id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a closure for a food processor. More specifically, the present invention relates to a closure for a food processing container.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Food processors are devices that process food and beverages by heating, cutting, grating, slicing, dicing, mixing, blending, stirring, kneading, cooling, grinding, mincing, crushing, steaming, boiling, infusing, smoking and otherwise physically or chemically converting food from one form into another.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, food processors include a container in which the food is processed with a removably-attachable cover having an aperture formed therein (e.g., a feed-tube) through which food may be inserted into the container for processing. This aperture is typically closed by a closure, either in the form of an externally-fitting cap or an internally-fitting cylinder.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention aims to at least partially ameliorate problems in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the present invention, there is provided a closure for a food processor, wherein the closure comprises a food processing tool. The food processing tool can increase the utility of the closure and the food processor. When, for instance, the cover is attached to the food processor the processing tools typically contained therein (heating/cooling elements, rotary and/or linear cutting tools etc.) are not easily accessible by the user for carrying out small tasks, for example the processing of a single vegetable or fruit. The present invention can therefore provide the user with a separate tool for carrying out such tasks. This is more convenient to the user and requires less space be taken up within their food preparation environment (e.g., kitchen) by tools. Preferably, the food processor is suitable for use in (at least) a first food processing operation and the food processing tool is suitable in a second food processing operation; more preferably the first food processing operation and the second food processing operation are different operations. The food processing tool is preferably a handheld tool. A closure preferably connotes a member for closing a container of a food processor, more preferably a member for closing an opening in a lid of container of a food processor, such as a pusher for a feed tube.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The closure is preferably configured to push food material through a feed tube of the food processor. To this end, the closure may be configured such that the first end of the closure and at least a portion of the closure's food processing tool may be inserted into the feed tube of the food processor. Preferably, the food processing tool is not a pusher&#x2014;that is, the closure acts as a pusher whereas the food processing tool is suitable for a different food processing operation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The closure may be configured such that in use it reduces movement of the food within the feed tube. For example, a first end of the closure may be configured to grip food. To this end, the first end of the closure may be non-planar, preferably comprising at least one protrusion which will push at least on to (and preferably into) the food as it is being pushed through the feed tube, thereby assisting in pushing food material through the feed tube. The first end preferably comprises a plurality of protrusions, which are preferably sharp.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The closure may be shaped to interact with at least one complimentary feature of the feed tube and or food processor&#x2014;for example, the first end of the closure may be shaped to fit between complimentary features of the feed tube, such as blades within the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The food processing tool is preferably configured to process food. Processing food preferably comprises converting food from one form into another. The conversion of food from one form into another may be a physical or chemical conversion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The closure is preferably configured to process food itself using the food processing tool.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, the closure is preferably configured to process food using the food processing tool without a further feature of the food processor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The food processing tool is optionally configured to process food itself. In other words, the food processing tool is optionally configured to process food without a further feature of the closure or food processor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The closure is preferably configured to cooperate with at least one further feature of the food processor to process food in cooperation with the at least one further feature, for example by pushing food material through the feed tube of the food processor into engagement with a further feature of the food processor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The food processing tool is preferably configured to process food in a different way to the way in which the closure is configured to process food in cooperation with the food processor. The food processing tool is preferably configured to provide a first food processing function. The closure is preferably further configured to cooperate with at least one further feature of the food processor to provide at least a second food processing function.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The food processing tool preferably comprises at least one of a potato-peeler, a knife, a slicer, a julienne-cutter, a green been slicer, a carrot-end cutter, a potato-eye remover, a green leaf remover, a bottle-opener, scissors, a cork-screw, pliers, a toothed blade/saw, a pizza-slicer, a file, a spiraliser, a garlic press, nut-crackers, a screw-driver, and a coring-tool.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The closure is preferably configured such that the user can grip the closure to use the food processing tool to process food.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The closure preferably comprises a substantially elliptical cylindrical surface, and the closure's food processing tool is located at or near a line collinear with an element of the surface that passes through the elliptical plane curve at one end of its major axis, or at least located nearer to a line collinear with an element of the surface that passes through the plane curve at one end of the major axis of the ellipse than a line collinear with an element of the surface that passes through the plane curve at one end of the minor axis of the ellipse.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The closure preferably comprises a first end and a second end and a longitudinal axis therebetween.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The food processing tool is preferably located on the side of the closure. The side of the closure preferably extends between the first and second ends of the closure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By providing a food processing tool located on the side of the closure the food processing tool can increase the utility of the closure and the food processing tool. It can achieve this without changing the way in which the closure cooperates with at least one further feature of the food processor to process food in cooperation with the at least one further feature</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first end of the closure is preferably configured to be inserted into and pass through at least a portion of the feed tube. The first end of the closure is preferably configured to push food material through a feed tube of the food processor. The first end of the closure is preferably the portion of the closure configured to be inserted into and pass through at least a portion of the feed tube before any other portion of the closure. The first end of the closure is preferably a closed end configured to be inserted into the feed tube of the food processor to push food material through the feed tube. The closure is preferably elongate with the first and second ends of the closure being those portions of the closure at the first and second longitudinal ends of the closure. The first end of the closure is preferably configured to pass through at least a portion of the feed tube along a given direction, wherein the given direction is parallel to an axis extending between the first and second ends of the closure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The closure preferably comprises a first end and a second end, and the food processing tool is located between the first end of the closure and the second end of the closure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By providing a food processing tool located between the first end of the closure and the second end of the closure the food processing tool can increase the utility of the closure and the food processing tool. It can achieve this without changing the way in which the closure cooperates with at least one further feature of the food processor to process food in cooperation with the at least one further feature.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The closure's food processing tool may be located away from the first end of the closure. By providing a food processing tool away from the first end of the closure the food processing tool can increase the utility of the closure and the food processing tool. It can achieve this without changing the way in which the closure cooperates with at least one further feature of the food processor to process food in cooperation with the at least one further feature.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The closure's food processing tool may be located away from the second end of the closure. By providing a food processing tool away from the first end of the closure the food processing tool can increase the utility of the closure and the food processing tool. It can achieve this without changing the way in which a user handles the closure when inserting the closure into the feed tube of the food processor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The food processing tool preferably comprises at least one sharp formation. The at least one sharp formation preferably comprises at least one sharp edge. The at least one sharp edge is preferably a blade. The sharp formation may be suitable for milling, grinding, grating, shredding or otherwise cutting food.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, an exemplary food processing tool may comprise at least one blade. The edge of each blade may extend between the first and second ends of the closure. For example, the edge of each blade may extend in the same plane as (e.g., parallel to) an axis that passes through the centres of the first and second ends of the closure. Preferably, the closure is configured to pass through at least a portion of the feed tube in a given direction and the blade extends in the same plane as (e.g., parallel to) the given direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The food processing tool is preferably releasably coupled to the remainder of the closure. A releasably coupled food processing tool may, for example, be operable to process food without the remainder of the closure. This can provide for different types of food processing tools to be attached to the remainder of the closure, thereby further increasing the utility of the closure. For example, a releasably coupled food processing tool may comprise a handle and a food processing element. Further, this can aid in cleaning of the closure and the food processing tool. Alternatively, the food processing tool may be fixed to or integral with the closure. In which case, the closure's food processing tool is not releasable from the remainder of the closure during normal use. For example, a portion of the closure such as a side extending between the first and second ends of the closure may comprise grating, cutting, or slicing edges formed therein. A fixed coupling can increase the potential utility of the closure and the food processor without substantially increasing the cost or reducing the durability of the closure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The food processing tool is preferably coupled to the remainder of the closure but moveable relative to the closure. The food processing tool is preferably rotatably coupled to the remainder of the closure. Alternatively, the food processing tool may be fixed in position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the closure's food processing tool is coupled to the remainder of the closure but moveable relative to the closure, the closure's food processing tool may move from a first position relative to the remainder of the closure to at least one further position relative to the remainder of the closure. To this end, the food processing tool may be coupled to the remainder of the closure by a moveable coupling, such as an axle. When a closure's food processing tool is in the first position, the first end of the closure and at least a portion (and preferably the whole) of the closure's food processing tool may be inserted into the feed tube of the food processor to push food material through the feed tube of the food processor. Preferably, when the closure's food processing tool is in any of the at least one further positions relative to the remainder of the closure, the first end of the closure and at least a portion (and preferably the whole) of the closure's food processing tool can be inserted into the feed tube of the food processor to push food material through the feed tube of the food processor. In this way, a food processing tool can be positioned in a number of positions when in use, which can increase the utility of the tool, but in each of those positions the tool will not obstruct the insertion of the closure into the feed tube of the food processor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The food processing tool is preferably releasably held in a position (e.g., the first position) such that the position of the food processing tool relative to the remainder of the closure will not change due to the force of gravity when the orientation of the closure is changed. The closure may comprise a frictional element for that purpose.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The closure may comprise a position selector configured to allow a user to move the tool to a desired position relative to the remainder of the closure and hold the tool at that position. The position selector preferably retains the food processing tool in at least one position relative to the remainder of the closure. For example, a closure may comprise a rotatable food processing tool and an orientation selector configured to allow a user to rotate the food processing tool to a desired orientation relative to the remainder of the closure and hold the tool at that orientation. If the position selector only allows a user to change the orientation of the food processing tool, the position selector may be referred to as an orientation selector. The position selector (orientation selector) may comprise a ratchet mechanism, a releasable block, or a frictional element requiring a predetermined force to overcome, the predetermined force preferably being in excess of that applied by gravity to the tool.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The food processing tool is preferably releasably coupled to the remainder of the closure but moveable relative to the closure. Alternatively, the food processing tool may not be releasably coupled to the remainder of the closure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The closure preferably comprises a plurality of food processing tools. The plurality of food processing tools is preferably coupled to the remainder of the closure at different positions&#x2014;for example, on different sides of the closure, or at different points along its longitudinal axis. Each food processing tool is preferably configured to process food differently, which can further increase the utility of the closure and the food processor.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The closure preferably further comprises a coupling device, wherein the coupling device couples at least two food processing tools to the remainder of the closure. The coupling device is preferably releasably coupled to the remainder of the closure. Alternatively, the coupling device may be fixed to or integral with the remainder of the closure. The coupling device is preferably coupled to the remainder of the closure but moveable relative to the remainder of the closure&#x2014;for example, rotatably coupled to the remainder of the closure. For example, the tool may comprise a carriage, the carriage comprising two or more food processing tools mounted thereon, preferably bladed tools, wherein the carriage is preferably a rotatable carriage. Alternatively, the coupling device may be fixed in position. The closure preferably further comprises a position selector configured to allow a user to move the coupling device to a desired position relative to the remainder of the closure and retain the coupling device at that position. The coupling device is preferably releasably held in a position such that the position of the food processing tool relative to the remainder of the closure will not change due to the force of gravity when the orientation of the closure is changed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The food processing tools are preferably selectable. The food processing tools are preferably selectable by movement of a coupling device by which the food processing tools are coupled to the remainder of the closure. Alternatively, the food processing tools are selectable by virtue of the tools being coupled to the remainder of the closure at different positions.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The closure preferably comprises a protective element, to reduce the risk of an injury being caused by the food processing tool. For example, the closure may comprise a protective screen partially surrounding the food processing tool.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The closure is preferably configured to selectively cover the food processing tool. The closure preferably comprises a cover for selectively covering the food processing tool. To this end, the closure may comprise a moveable shutter moveable to surround at least a portion of the tool. For example, when the closure comprises a protective screen partially surrounding the tool, the closure may further comprise a movable shutter configured to be moveable to surround a part of the tool not surrounded by the screen.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The closure preferably further comprises a container for collecting food processed using the closure's food processing tool, such as grated, sliced, or peeled food. By providing a container, the utility of the closure and the food processor can be further increased. The closure's container may collect the food as it is processed. For example, the closure may comprise a surface comprising a food processing tool. The surface may extend between the first and second ends of the closure. The closure's food processing tool may be fixed relative to or moveably coupled to the surface. When food is processed by the food processing tool, it is released from the food processing tool on one side of the surface. That side of the surface may be at least partially enclosed, thereby providing a container that collects food as it is processed by the food processing tool. The closure's container has an opening from which the food collected in the closure's container may be removed. The opening in the closure's container may be covered by an openable cover, such as an openable lid or base. In embodiments where the opening in the closure's container is covered by an openable cover, the container may substantially contain the collected food until the openable cover is opened.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The closure is preferably configured to prevent food being processed by the food processor from coming into contact with the closure's food processing tool when the closure is inserted into the feed tube of the food processor. For example, the closure may be configured to close the feed tube of the food processor in such a way as to prevent food material being processed entering the space within the feed tube in which the closure's food processing tool is located. In this regard, the food processing tool preferably does not extend beyond outer edges of the closure and/or preferably does not extend into a container of the food processor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The closure is preferably configured to prevent one of the feed tube of the food processor and the food processing tool from damaging the other of the feed tube of the food processor and the food processing tool.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The closure is preferably configured to pass through at least a portion of the feed tube in a given direction, and the closure is preferably further configured such that any line parallel to the given direction passing through a point on a boundary of a cross section of the closure defined by the food processing tool also passes through or within a boundary of a cross section of the closure defined by a portion of the closure other than the food processing tool. The portion of the closure other than the food processing tool is preferably a flange. By way of explanation, any cross section of a closure would comprise a boundary. The boundary is the intersection of the cross section's cutting plane with the outer surface of the closure. For example, a cross section of a right circular cylindrical closure may comprise a substantially elliptical region with a flat end if the cross section's cutting plane intersects both the side and end of the cylinder. The elliptical portion of the boundary of the cross section would be defined by the sides of the cylinder and the flat portion of the boundary of the cross section would be defined by the end of the cylinder. In other words, the closure preferably further configured such that each line that is parallel to the given direction and intersects the food processing tool also intersects the closure at another point. The other points are preferably closer to the first (insertion) end of the closure than the food processing tool, preferably at a flange closer to the first end of the closure than the food processing tool. In a preferred embodiment, each line that is parallel to the given direction and intersects the food processing tool also intersects the closure at a point closer to the first end of the closure than the food processing tool and a point closer to the second end of the closure than the food processing tool, preferably at flanges.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The food processing tool is preferably within the footprint of the remainder of the closure. In other words, in an orthographic projection of the closure with projection rays parallel to the given direction, the footprint of the food processing tool is within the footprint of the remainder of the closure. Optionally, such that in use the tool is spaced away from the side of the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The feed-tube and the closure preferably comprise one or more guiding elements, preferably rails and/or ribs, configured to be received in one or more corresponding slots in the other of the feed-tube and the closure for guiding the closure along the fee-tube. The first end of the closure may be chamfered or otherwise shaped to guide the closure into the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The feed tube or closure is optionally configured to substantially prevent the closure from rotating relative to the feed tube as the closure pushes food material through the feed tube and into the container. For example, at least a portion of the feed tube and closure may be non-circular (e.g., elliptical or square) so as to prevent rotation of the closure relative to the feed tube when the closure is within the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The feed tube or closure is optionally configured to substantially prevent the closure from tilting relative to the feed tube as the closure pushes food material through the feed tube. For example, the closure may be shaped to interact with a complimentary feature of the feed tube so as to prevent the closure from tilting relative to the feed tube when the closure is within the feed tube. For example, one of the closure and the feed tube may comprise at least a first protrusion extending along at least a portion of its length and the other of the closure and the feed tube may comprise at least a first recess extending along at least a portion of its length. The protrusion and recess are sized so as to substantially prevent the closure from tilting relative to the feed tube as the closure pushes food material through the feed tube and into the container. The protrusion may be a rib or rail and the corresponding recess may be groove.

The container may comprise a cover that is at least partially releasable from the remainder of the container.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The food processor further comprises a feed tube through which food may be inserted into the container for processing by the food processing tool. The feed tube may comprise an open cylindrical tube&#x2014;for example, an open elliptical cylinder. In embodiments where the container comprises a cover, the feed tube may be connected to or form part of the cover. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a cover comprising a cover portion <b>705</b> and a feed tube <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The food processor further comprises a closure such as any of the closures described herein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In use, the closure is configured to push food material in the feed tube of the food processor through the feed tube and into the container for processing by the food processing tool. For example, the closure may comprise a first end and a second end and a longitudinal axis therebetween. The first end of the closure may be configured to be inserted into and pass through at least a portion of the feed tube. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, closure <b>700</b> comprises a first end <b>708</b> and a second end <b>709</b>. Closure <b>700</b> is configured to pass through at least a portion of the feed tube <b>706</b> in direction <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The closure may be configured to close the feed tube of the food processor. The point at which the feed tube is closed by the closure may change dependent on the position of the closure within the feed tube. By closing the feed tube at a point along the feed tube, the closure prevents food that is being pushed into or processed by the food processor from returning up the feed tube past that point. For example, the closure may comprise a portion at or near its first end dimensioned to prevent food that is being pushed into or processed by the food processor from passing that portion of the closure within the feed tube. For example, the closure may comprise a projection or a flange at or near a first end of the closure. The closure may be dimensioned to substantially fill the feed-tube. The closure <b>700</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises a flange <b>702</b> at the first end of the closure which fits within and closes feed tube <b>706</b>, thereby preventing food that is being pushed into or processed by the food processor from passing that portion of the closure within the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The closure or the feed tube may be configured to prevent the feed tube from being damaged by the food processing tool (or the food processing tool being damaged by the feed tube). For example, the closure may be configured to limit the distance that the closure may pass through the feed tube of the food processor. To this end, the closure may comprise a stopping element configured to prevent the closure being inserted entirely through the feed tube. For example, the closure may comprise a projection or a flange which prevents the closure being inserted entirely through the feed tube. That projection or flange may be located at or near a second end of the closure. The closure <b>700</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises a flange <b>704</b> which prevents the closure <b>700</b> from being inserted entirely through the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> show a closure <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment of the invention. The closure <b>100</b> is dimensioned to fit within and close (with flanges <b>102</b>) the feed-tube of a food processor. The closure <b>100</b> preferably has a body which can be gripped in a user's hand. The bottom flange <b>102</b> can be used to push food material through the feed tube of a food processor.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to increase the utility of the closure <b>100</b> and the food processor to which it is connected, the closure comprises a food processing tool. For example, closure <b>100</b> has a food processing tool <b>101</b> provided on it. The closure's <b>100</b> food processing tool <b>101</b> is located away from and between the first end of the closure <b>100</b> and the second of the closure.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The closure's food processing tool <b>101</b> can be fixed in position such that, in particular, the position of the food processing tool relative to the remainder of the closure is fixed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Alternatively, the food processing tool may be moveably coupled to the remainder of the closure &#x2014; for example, by a moveable coupling. The food processing tool is more preferably rotatably mounted to allow it to be rotated to a desired orientation&#x2014;for example, the food processing tool may be attached to a body of the closure by a rotatable coupling, such as an axle, so as to be rotatable relative to the body. The rotatable coupling, such as an axle, may be unlubricated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the rotation of the tool <b>101</b> is preferably such that it cannot be rotated outside the flanges <b>102</b> (i.e., it cannot extend beyond their horizontal cross-section as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), to prevent the tool <b>101</b> obstructing the insertion of the closure <b>100</b> into the feed-tube of a food processor. The lower flange <b>102</b> serves to prevent food material being processed entering the space above the flange <b>102</b> and e.g., becoming caught on the tool <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">An exemplary food processing tool <b>101</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This food processing tool <b>101</b> has two food processing blades <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>mounted in a frame <b>101</b><i>e </i>having a central aperture <b>101</b><i>f. </i>As the sharp, cutting edges of the blades <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>face inwardly towards the central aperture <b>101</b><i>f, </i>and as the aperture <b>101</b><i>f </i>is preferably dimensioned such that a user's hand or fingers cannot fit within it, the user cannot easily come into contact with the blades <b>101</b><i>a </i>and thus the tool <b>101</b> is rendered safe. The central aperture <b>101</b><i>f </i>is, however, wide enough that fruits and vegetables can be pressed against it and have their surfaces bulge through it to carry out e.g., skinning or peeling.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The tool <b>101</b> is preferably mounted to the closure <b>100</b> so as to be rotatable about its central axis via axles <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>101</b><i>d. </i>Preferably the axles <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>101</b><i>d </i>include a frictional element such that the user must apply a predetermined amount of force to actually rotate the tool <b>101</b>, the predetermined amount of force being such that the tool will not change orientation when the closure <b>100</b> is tilted or tipped to a different orientation. An example of such a frictional element is a rubber or plastic ring in frictional contact with both the frame <b>101</b><i>e </i>and the closure <b>100</b>. Alternatively a releasable blocking element or ratchet may be provided to selectively hold the tool <b>101</b> at a desired orientation relative to the closure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Whilst two blades <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b </i>are shown, three or more blades may be provided in the tool (e.g., two additional blades may extend along the centre of the aperture <b>101</b><i>f </i>with edges facing the blades <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The axles <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>101</b><i>d </i>may be fixed to the closure <b>100</b>, or may be removably attachable to it using screw/thread or snap-fittings to allow different tools to be attached to the closure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The tool <b>101</b> is preferably aligned along the major axis of the closure <b>100</b>, such that the user can grip the body of the closure <b>100</b> with their hand to use the tool <b>101</b> to process food. Closure <b>100</b> comprises a substantially elliptical cylindrical surface, and the closure's <b>100</b> food processing tool is located at or near a line collinear with an element of the surface that passes through the elliptical plane curve at one end of its major axis.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A second embodiment of a closure <b>200</b>, similar to the closure <b>100</b> except for the following details, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The closure <b>200</b> is dimensioned to fit within and substantially fill the feed-tube of a food processor, it may have vertically-aligned grooves formed along it which receive a corresponding rail/rib extending from the inner surface of the feed-tube to guide the closure <b>200</b> along the feed-tube. As with the closure <b>100</b>, it has a tool <b>201</b> mounted rotatably to it, with the rotation of the tool <b>201</b> being such that it cannot be rotated to block the passage of the closure down the feed-tube. The closure <b>200</b> has a flange <b>202</b> formed at its upper end to prevent the closure <b>200</b> falling into the food processing container with which the closure <b>200</b> is used. The closure <b>200</b> additionally has a smaller aperture <b>205</b> formed extending through it, which is in turn closed by a secondary closure <b>203</b> having an upper flange <b>204</b> which prevents the secondary closure <b>203</b> falling down the smaller aperture <b>205</b> after it is inserted into it.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The purpose of the smaller aperture <b>205</b> is to allow smaller pieces of food (e.g., spring onions) to be held oriented vertically for processing within the food processing appliance with which the closure <b>200</b> is used. Maintaining a vertical orientation of the food is important during certain food processing techniques, such as, for example, cutting using a rotary blade.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">An exemplary food processor <b>300</b> featuring a closure <b>301</b> according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In this arrangement <b>300</b> the closure <b>301</b> (which is similar to the closures <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>) is located within the feed tube <b>304</b> of a cover <b>302</b> (preferably, when inserted into the feed-tube <b>304</b> the tool of the closure <b>301</b> is covered by the feed-tube for added safety). The cover <b>302</b> is removably-attachable to a food processing container <b>305</b>, and serves to substantially co-operatively enclose the volume within the container <b>305</b>. The container <b>305</b> is in turn mounted on, and preferably removably-attached to, the food processor base <b>303</b>. The base <b>303</b> can include an electric motor for providing mechanical power to food processing tools within the container <b>305</b>, heating/cooling elements for heating/cooling the container <b>305</b>, and electrical power connectors for providing electrical power to food processing tools within the food processing container <b>305</b> (e.g., heating elements). A user interface is provided on the base <b>303</b> for controlling the appliance and providing feedback to the user.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A coupling device coupling a plurality of food processing tools <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b </i>to a closure, which can be used in place of any of the tools described above, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>. Rather than consisting of a single food processing tool, two or more food processing tools <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b </i>are mounted (preferably rotatably) to a carriage comprising disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f </i>which are rotatable about axles <b>401</b><i>c </i>and <b>401</b><i>d. </i>In this way, the user may rotate the carriage so as to bring a specific food processing tool forward and to recess the other device close to the body of the closure <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>301</b>. In this way, if the user wishes to use the bean-peeler <b>401</b><i>a </i>(a food processing tool having multiple blades with their cutting-edges oriented horizontally towards the viewer as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a bean may then be inserted between the blades and peeled between them) they can rotate the disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f </i>to bring the bean-peeler <b>401</b><i>a </i>forward and recess the potato-peeler <b>401</b><i>b </i>close to the closure with which the tool <b>401</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The food processing tools <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b </i>may be partially surrounded by a screen <b>402</b> fixed to the closure so that the tools are only accessible about part of the periphery of the disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f. </i>This would help prevent accidental contact between the user and the devices mounted to the carriage which they have not selected to use, but would still allow the desired food processing tool to be accessed at that part of the periphery of the disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f </i>not surrounded by the screen <b>402</b>. As an additional modification to this screen <b>402</b>, it may further include a sliding or hinged element that can be closed to completely surround the periphery of the disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f </i>and the devices attached thereto.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As with the axles <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>101</b><i>d, </i>the axles <b>401</b><i>c </i>and <b>401</b><i>d </i>are preferably releasably-attachable to the closure and have a frictional element or releasable block/ratchet that allows the disks <b>401</b><i>e </i>and <b>401</b><i>f </i>to be rotated to a desired orientation and held there.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a closure <b>500</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. The closure <b>500</b> has a statically-fixed fixture <b>501</b> with two food processing tools&#x2014;a bean-slicer <b>502</b> and a guillotine blade <b>503</b>. The guillotine blade may be static or moveable within its aperture to cut food located in it. The closure <b>500</b> thus achieves a static multi-tool device.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another example of a closure comprising a plurality of food processing tools is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The closure <b>600</b> comprises a surface <b>603</b> (in this case cylindrical) extending between first and second ends. The ends comprise flanges <b>600</b>. The surface comprises at least one food processing tool. In this case, a first portion of the surface <b>603</b> comprises a first food processing tool <b>601</b><i>a </i>and a second portion of the surface comprises a second food processing tool <b>601</b><i>b. </i>In this case, the first food processing tool <b>601</b><i>a </i>comprises a plurality of grating slots and the second food processing tool <b>601</b><i>b </i>comprises a slicing slot.

The closure <b>700</b> has a flange <b>702</b> at the first end of the closure. Flange <b>702</b> is located closer to the first end of the closure than the food processing tool <b>701</b> and so serves to prevent food material being processed by the food processor entering the space above the flange <b>702</b> and e.g., becoming caught on the tool <b>701</b> as the closure is used to push food through the feed tube.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The closures <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>301</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b> described above are preferably made of food-safe and dish-washer-machine-washable (i.e., will not degrade/deteriorate under the temperatures and conditions typical within a household dish-washer) materials.
