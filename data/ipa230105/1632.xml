As one of the methods for producing a three-dimensional shaped object, known is a method to selectively irradiate a liquid resin composition containing a photosensitive resin with ultraviolet light to cure the resin composition into a desired shape (for example, Patent Literature (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;PTL&#x201d; 1). In the method described in PTL 1, a resin composition containing a photosensitive resin is irradiated with ultraviolet light in a pattern to form a cured product, namely a finely divided three-dimensional shaped object in the thickness direction. Then, a layer composed of the liquid resin composition is further <sup>-</sup>finned on the cured. product, and is irradiated with ultraviolet light in a pattern. The formation of the layer composed of the liquid resin composition and the irradiation with the ultraviolet light (curing of the resin composition) are repeated to produce a three-dimensional shaped object having a desired shape.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H8-174680</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods such as the method described in PTL 1 typically use, as a resin composition, a composition containing a photocurable compound, a photopolymerization initiator, and the like. However, a three-dimensional shaped object obtained from such a resin composition is more likely to be colored due to the influence of the photopolymerization initiator. Further, a resin composition containing a photopolymerization initiator is more likely to thicken due to the reaction of the polymerization initiator during storage, which leads to difficulty of handling the composition.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is conceivable to use an electron beam for irradiation in place of ultraviolet light. Irradiating with an electron beam has an advantage such that a photopolymerization initiator causing coloring is not necessary. However, it is difficult to adjust the degree of curing of a three-dimensional shaped object when an electron beam is used. For example, when a resin composition is sufficiently cured, the adhesiveness with the next layer to be formed becomes low, and peeling is more likely to occur between the layers. On the other hand, when the resin composition is not sufficiently cured, the strength of the entire three-dimensional shaped object model tends to decrease. There is thus a disadvantage on using electron beam irradiation such that the production of a three-dimensional shaped object having sufficient strength is difficult.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above disadvantage. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object, which is capable of producing a three-dimensional shaped object having high strength, by using electron beam irradiation, and a three-dimensional modeling apparatus to be used for this method.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object as follows.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">[1] A method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object, which includes thin layer forming of applying in a pattern a composition for three-dimensional modeling containing a radical polymerizable compound to form a thin layer; and electron beam radiating of irradiating the thin :layer with an electron beam to form a shaped object layer with the radical polymerizable compound being cured therein, wherein the thin layer forming and the electron beam radiating are repeated a plurality of times to stack a plurality of the shaped object layers on top of one another to produce a three-dimensional shaped object, and wherein the electron beam radiating is performed in an atmosphere having an oxygen concentration of 50 ppm or more and less than 5,000 ppm.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">[2] The method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object according to [1], wherein the composition for three-dimensional modeling is applied by a discharge method in the thin layer funning.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">[3] The method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object according to [1], Wherein the composition for three-dimensional modeling contains a filler.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a three-dimensional modeling apparatus as follows.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[4] A three-dimensional modeling apparatus, comprising: a shaping stage; an application area including an application part for applying a three-dimensional modeling composition on or above the shaping stage; and an electron beam irradiation area including an electron beam irradiation part for irradiating, with an electron beam, the three-dimensional modeling composition applied in the application area, wherein the three-dimensional modeling apparatus is provided with an oxygen concentration adjustment part for adjusting an oxygen concentration in the electron beam irradiation area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">[5] The three-dimensional modeling apparatus according to [4], further comprising: a transport mechanism capable of transporting the shaping stage, wherein the shaping stage is moved between the application area and the electron beam irradiation area.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object of the present invention can produce a three-dimensional shaped object having high strength by using electron beam irradiation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate a process for explaining a method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object according, to an embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schema is view for explaining a three-dimensional modeling apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">1. Method for Producing Three-dimensional Shaped Object</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object of the present invention includes a thin layer forming step of applying a composition for three-dimensional modeling (herein also referred to as &#x201c;three-dimensional modeling composition&#x201d;) containing a radical polymerizable compound to form a thin layer; and an electron beam radiating step of irradiating the thin layer with an electron beam to form a shaped object layer, in which the radical polymerizable compound is cured. The method produces a three-dimensional shaped object by alternately repeating the thin layer forming step and the electron beam radiating step a plurality of times to stack the shaped object layers on top of one another.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, a three-dimensional modeling composition has typically been irradiated with ultraviolet light to cure. However, it is necessary to add a photopolymerization initiator to a three-dimensional modeling composition to cure the three-dimensional modeling composition with ultraviolet light. The addition of the photopolymerization initiator results in disadvantages such as coloring of the obtained three-dimensional shaped object, and lowering of the storage stability of the three-dimensional modeling composition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The use of an electron beam for irradiation in place of ultraviolet light results in another disadvantage such that a three-dimensional shaped object having high strength cannot be obtained. During electron beam irradiation, the curability of a three-dimensional modeling composition mainly depends on the acceleration voltage of an electron beam and the irradiation amount of the electron beam (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;electron beam irradiation amount&#x201d;). The acceleration voltage correlates with the reachability of the electron beam in the depth direction, and the electron beam irradiation amount correlates with the degree of curing.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When shaped object layers are stack on top of one another to obtain a three-dimensional shaped object as in the present invention, an increased acceleration voltage of the electron beam and an increased electron beam irradiation amount greatly improve the curability of the shaped object layers. However, in this case, there are few bonding points left on the surface of the previously formed shaped object layer for bonding with the shaped object layer to be formed later. The adhesive strength between the layers becomes very low, and thus peeling is more likely to occur between these layers.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">On the other hand, when the acceleration voltage of the electron beam is reduced and the electron beam. irradiation amount is also reduced, the three-dimensional modeling composition is not sufficiently cured, thereby lowering the strength of the three-dimensional shaped object. Alternatively, when the acceleration voltage of the electron beam is reduced and the electron beam irradiation amount is increased, only the surface side of a shaped object layer is cured, and the curability of the inside and the bottom of the layer is lowered. The strength of the three-dimensional shaped object is also lowered in this case. Further, when the acceleration voltage of the electron beam is increased and the electron beam irradiation amount is reduced, the curability of the entire shaped object layer is also uniformly lowered, thereby also lowering the strength of the three-dimensional shaped object. That is, in three-dimensional shaping methods using electron beam irradiation, no matter how the acceleration voltage of the electron beam and the electron beam irradiation amount are adjusted, sufficient strength cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Typical electron beam irradiation is performed under the condition with substantially no oxygen. This is because the presence of oxygen causes oxygen inhibition to cause poor curing. In the present invention, on the other hand, electron beam irradiation for curing a thin layer (three-dimensional modeling composition) is performed in an atmosphere having an oxygen concentration of 50 ppm or more and less than 5,000 ppm to intentionally cause curing inhibition on the surface of the thin layer of the three-dimensional modeling composition. That is, even when the acceleration voltage of the electron beam is relatively increased and the electron beam irradiation amount is also relatively increased, many reaction points remain on the surface of the previously formed shaped object layer for reacting with the shaped object layer to be formed later. Then, when the shaped object layer formed later is cured, the surface of the previously formed shaped object layer can be simultaneously cured by relatively increasing the acceleration voltage of the electron beam and also relatively increasing the electron beam irradiation amount Such a configuration is less likely to generate regions having low curability over the entire three-dimensional shaped object, thereby obtaining the three-dimensional shaped object having high strength.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, each step in the method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object of the present invention will be described in detail. in addition to the thin layer forming step and the electron beam radiating step, the method for producing a three-dimensional shaped object of the present invention may include, for example, a step of forming a support material for supporting a part of the shaped object layer in accordance with the shape of the three-dimensional shaped object to be produced.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">1-1. Thin Layer Forming Step</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The thin layer forming step is a step of applying a three-dimensional modeling composition containing a radical polymerizable compound to form a thin layer. The three-dimensional modeling composition is applied on a shaping stage of a three-dimensional modeling apparatus, on a shaped object layer formed in advance (layer forted by the previously performed thin layer forming step and electron beam radiating step), and/or on an optionally formed support material. The thin layer has a pattern obtained by finely dividing a desired three-dimensional shaped object in its thickness direction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method for applying a three-dimensional modeling composition may be any method that can apply the three-dimensional modeling composition in a desired pattern. Examples of the applying method include an inkjet method, a discharge method that applies the composition with a dispenser or a jet dispenser, a screen printing method, a stencil printing method, and an intaglio printing method. In particular, the discharge method is preferable from the viewpoint that the thin layers can be formed in various patterns. The discharge method herein refers to a method in which a three-dimensional modeling composition is discharged from a nozzle or the like and landed at a desired position.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The thickness of the thin layer formed in the thin layer forming step is preferably 0.01 to 2 non, more preferably 0.05 to 0.5 mm, and even more preferably 0.08 to 0.15 mm. When the thickness of the thin layer is 2 mm or less, the electron beam can sufficiently reach the bottom of the thin layer to sufficiently cure the thin layer in the electron beam radiating step described below. When the thickness of the thin layer is 0.01 mm or more, it is possible to efficiently form a three-dimensional shaped object. When a desired thickness cannot be obtained by one application, the application of the three-dimensional modeling composition may be repeated until the desired thickness is obtained.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The three-dimensional modeling composition applied in this step contains at least a radical polymerizable compound, and may further contain, for example, a filler, an inert resin, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, a flame retardant, and/or a colorant, as needed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The radical polymerizable compound has a radically polymerizable group that is polymerized by irradiation with an electron beam. The three-dimensional modeling composition may contain only one type of radical polymerizable compound or may contain two or more types of radical polymerizable compounds. Examples of the radical polymerizable compounds include compounds each haying one or more of an ethylene group, a propenyl group, a butenyl group, a vinylphenyl group, an allyl ether group, a vinyl ether group, a maleyl group, a maleimide group, a (meth) acrylamide group, an acetylvinyl group, a vinylamide group, and a (meth) acryloyl group in the molecule.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular, the radical polymerizable compound is preferably an unsaturated carboxylate compound having one or more unsaturated carboxylate structures in the molecule, or an below described unsaturated carboxylic acid amide compound having one or more unsaturated carboxylic acid anode structures in the molecule.
