id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to oligonucleotides and uses thereof, particularly uses relating to the treatment of hepatitis B infection.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is a significant cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Current HBV therapies, such as nucleoside analogs require lifelong therapy to reduce plasma viremia, and they are generally ineffective in the long term. Functional cure of chronic HBV has traditionally been a best treatment outcome. RNA interference (RNAi) technology offers the potential for pharmacologically intervention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The outer envelope proteins are collectively known as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HBsAg consists of three related polypeptides called S, M, and L encoded by overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The smallest envelope protein is S with 226 amino acids, called the S-ORF. M and L are produced from upstream translation initiation sites and add 55 and 108 amino acids, respectively, to S. HBV S, M, and L glycoproteins are found in the viral envelope of intact, infectious HBV virions, named Dane particles, and all three are produced and secreted in a vast excess that forms non-infectious subviral spherical and filamentous particles (both referred to as decoy particles) found in the blood of chronic HBV patients. The abundance of HBsAg on the surface of decoy particles is believed to inhibit humoral immunity and spontaneous clearance in patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure relate to improved oligonucleotide-based compositions and related methods for treating HBV infection in a subject. In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to the development of potent oligonucleotides that produce durable knockdown of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) expression. The oligonucleotide induce RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated recognition and destruction of mRNA which encodes all forms of HBsAg in hepatocytes. This includes protein translated from viral RNAs transcribed from both cccDNA and HBV DNA which has been integrated into the host genome. Oligonucleotides are provided herein designed to target an expansive set of HBsAg transcripts encoded by HBV genomes across all known genotypes. In some embodiments, it has been found that oligonucleotides disclosed herein that target HBsAg transcripts in hepatocytes can produce a stable reduction in HBsAg expression with high specificity that persists for an extended period of time (e.g., greater than 7 weeks to several months) following administration to a subject (See, e.g., Examples 1 and 3). In some embodiments, it has been discovered that targeting of HBsAg expression using oligonucleotides disclosed herein results in reduction of pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) and other viral life cycle intermediates. It has also been found that certain RNAi oligonucleotides disclosed herein can knockdown HBsAg mRNA transcripts that originate from either cccDNA or integrated virus. In further aspects, it has been discovered that targeting of HBsAg expression using oligonucleotides disclosed herein reduces expression of all HBV proteins (with the exception of HBx), namely HBcAg, HBeAg, and HBV Polymerase, resulting in cytosolic retention of HBV core protein. Furthermore, in some embodiments, clearance of circulating HBsAg resulting from the mRNA knockdown using methods provided herein is clinically advantageous because it enables breaking of HBV immune tolerance caused by high levels of circulating HBsAg in CHB patients. Reactivation of immune system activity against HBV infection is believed to be a cornerstone of achieving functional cure, defined as permanent seroclearance of HBsAg.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previous work has indicated that the use of a combination of RNAi agents targeting multiple different HBV genes (namely, S, C, P, and X genes), or in some cases targeting X gene transcripts alone, achieves effective inhibition of HBV replication and gene expression. However, results provided herein demonstrate that the use of RNAi oligonucleotides targeting HBsAg transcripts alone also achieves effective inhibition of HBV replication and gene expression, which provides a new therapeutic approach to treating HBV infections. In addition to the direct effect of silencing viral RNAs, HSB(s)-219 precursors prevent nuclear localization of HBV Core Antigen (HBcAg). Importantly, targeting of HBV-X or both genes simultaneously does not prevent HBcAg nuclear localization. Preclinical data strongly suggest that the inhibition of nuclear core localization caused by S-targeting RNAi therapy results in significantly improved duration of HBsAg suppression. Notably, lack of nuclear localization of HBcAg in patients has been shown to correlate to favorable responses to antiviral therapy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some aspects of the present disclosure provide oligonucleotides for reducing expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) mRNA, the oligonucleotide comprising an antisense strand of 19 to 30 nucleotides in length, wherein the antisense strand comprises a region of complementarity to a sequence of HBsAg mRNA as set forth in ACAANAAUCCUCACAAUA (SEQ ID NO: 1).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide further comprises a sense strand of 19 to 50 nucleotides in length, wherein the sense strand forms a duplex region with the antisense strand.

HBV virus particles (virions) comprise an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein. The nucleocapsid generally encloses viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity similar to retroviruses. The HBV outer envelope contains embedded proteins which are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells. HBV, which attacks the liver, has been classified according to at least ten genotypes (A-J) based on sequence. In general, there are four genes encoded by the genome, which genes are referred to as C, P, S, and X. The core protein is encoded by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P. Gene S encodes surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame &#x201c;start&#x201d; (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large, middle, and small (pre-S1+pre-S2+S, pre-S2+S, or S) are produced. These may have a ratio of 1:1:4 (Heermann et al, 1984).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0066">Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) proteins can be organized into several categories and functions. Polymerases function as a reverse transcriptase (RT) to make viral DNA from pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), and also as a DNA-dependent polymerase to make covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) from viral DNA. They are covalently attached to the 5&#x2032; end of the minus strand. Core proteins make the viral capsid and the secreted E antigen. Surface antigens are the hepatocyte internalization ligands, and also the primary component of aviral spherical and filamentous particles. Aviral particles are produced &#x3e;1000-fold over Dane particles (infectious virions) and may act as immune decoys.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0067">Hepatitis B virus surface antigen: As used herein, the term &#x201c;hepatitis B virus surface antigen&#x201d; or &#x201c;HBsAg&#x201d; refers to an S-domain protein encoded by gene S (e.g., ORF S) of an HBV genome. Hepatitis B virus particles carry viral nucleic acid in core particles enveloped by three proteins encoded by gene S, which are the large surface, middle surface, and major surface proteins. Among these proteins, the major surface protein is generally about 226 amino acids and contains just the S-domain.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0068">Infection: As used herein, the term &#x201c;infection&#x201d; reefs to the pathogenic invasion and/or expansion of microorganisms, such as viruses, in a subject. An infection may be lysogenic, e.g., in which viral DNA lies dormant within a cell. Alternatively, an infection may be lytic, e.g., in which viruses actively proliferates and causing destruction of infected cells. An infection may or may not cause clinically apparent symptoms. An infection may remain localized, or it may spread, e.g., through a subjects blood or lymphatic system. An individual having, for example, an HBV infection, can be identified by detecting one or more of viral load, surface antigen (HBsAg), e-antigen (HBeAg), and various other assays for detecting HBV infection known in the art. Assays for detection of HBV infection can involve testing serum or blood samples for the presence of HBsAg and/or HBeAg, and optionally further screening for the presence of one or more viral antibodies (e.g., IgM and/or IgG) to compensate for any periods in which an HBV antigen may be at an undetectable level.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0069">Liver inflammation: As used herein, the term &#x201c;liver inflammation&#x201d; or &#x201c;hepatitis&#x201d; refers to a physical condition in which the liver becomes swollen, dysfunctional, and/or painful, especially as a result of injury or infection, as may be caused by exposure to a hepatotoxic agent. Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, appetite reduction, and weight loss.

For example, in some embodiments, a targeting ligand may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide for purposes of targeting the oligonucleotide to a specific tissue or cell of interest. In some embodiments, a targeting ligand selectively binds to a cell surface receptor. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a targeting ligand when conjugated to an oligonucleotide facilitates delivery of the oligonucleotide into a particular cell through selective binding to a receptor expressed on the surface of the cell and endosomal internalization by the cell of the complex comprising the oligonucleotide, targeting ligand and receptor. In some embodiments, a targeting ligand is conjugated to an oligonucleotide via a linker that is cleaved following or during cellular internalization such that the oligonucleotide is released from the targeting ligand in the cell.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0086">Tetraloop: As used herein, the term &#x201c;tetraloop&#x201d; refers to a loop that increases stability of an adjacent duplex formed by hybridization of flanking sequences of nucleotides. The increase in stability is detectable as an increase in melting temperature (Tm) of an adjacent stem duplex that is higher than the T<sub>m</sub>, of the adjacent stem duplex expected, on average, from a set of loops of comparable length consisting of randomly selected sequences of nucleotides. For example, a tetraloop can confer a melting temperature of at least 50&#xb0; C., at least 55&#xb0; C., at least 56&#xb0; C., at least 58&#xb0; C., at least 60&#xb0; C., at least 65&#xb0; C. or at least 75&#xb0; C. in 10 mM NaHPO4 to a hairpin comprising a duplex of at least 2 base pairs in length. In some embodiments, a tetraloop may stabilize a base pair in an adjacent stem duplex by stacking interactions. In addition, interactions among the nucleotides in a tetraloop include but are not limited to non-Watson-Crick base-pairing, stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, and contact interactions (Cheong et al., Nature 1990 Aug. 16; 346(6285):680-2; Heus and Pardi, Science 1991 Jul. 12; 253(5016):191-4). In some embodiments, a tetraloop comprises 4 to 5 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, a tetraloop comprises or consists of three, four, five, or six nucleotides, which may or may not be modified (e.g., which may or may not be conjugated to a targeting moiety). In one embodiment, a tetraloop consists of four nucleotides. Any nucleotide may be used in the tetraloop and standard IUPAC-IUB symbols for such nucleotides may be used as described in Cornish-Bowden (1985) Nucl. Acids Res. 13: 3021-3030. For example, the letter &#x201c;N&#x201d; may be used to mean that any base may be in that position, the letter &#x201c;R&#x201d; may be used to show that A (adenine) or G (guanine) may be in that position, and &#x201c;B&#x201d; may be used to show that C (cytosine), G (guanine), or T (thymine) may be in that position. Examples of tetraloops include the UNCG family of tetraloops (e.g., UUCG), the GNRA family of tetraloops (e.g., GAAA), and the CUUG tetraloop (Woese et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1990 November; 87(21):8467-71; Antao et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1991 Nov. 11; 19(21):5901-5). Examples of DNA tetraloops include the d(GNNA) family of tetraloops (e.g., d(GTTA)), the d(GNRA) family of tetraloops, the d(GNAB) family of tetraloops, the d(CNNG) family of tetraloops, and the d(TNCG) family of tetraloops (e.g., d(TTCG)).

In some embodiments, treatment involves reducing the frequency or severity of at least one sign, symptom or contributing factor of a condition (e.g., HBV infection or related condition) experienced by a subject. During an HBV infection, a subject may exhibit symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a treatment provided herein may result in a reduction in the frequency or severity of one or more of such symptoms. However, HBV infection can develop into one or more liver conditions, such as cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, liver inflammation or liver cancer. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a treatment provided herein may result in a reduction in the frequency or severity of, or prevent or attenuate, one or more of such conditions.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">II.

However, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides provided herein are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). An antisense oligonucleotide is a single-stranded oligonucleotide that has a nucleobase sequence which, when written in the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; direction, comprises the reverse complement of a targeted segment of a particular nucleic acid and is suitably modified (e.g., as a gapmer) so as to induce RNaseH mediated cleavage of its target RNA in cells or (e.g., as a mixmer) so as to inhibit translation of the target mRNA in cells.

In some embodiments, modified nucleobases (also referred to herein as base analogs) are linked at the 1&#x2032; position of a nucleotide sugar moiety. In certain embodiments, a modified nucleobase is a nitrogenous base. In certain embodiments, a modified nucleobase does not contain a nitrogen atom. See e.g., U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20080274462. In some embodiments, a modified nucleotide comprises a universal base.

Reversible Modifications</p><p id="p-0156" num="0143">While certain modifications to protect an oligonucleotide from the in vivo environment before reaching target cells can be made, they can reduce the potency or activity of the oligonucleotide once it reaches the cytosol of the target cell. Reversible modifications can be made such that the molecule retains desirable properties outside of the cell, which are then removed upon entering the cytosolic environment of the cell. Reversible modification can be removed, for example, by the action of an intracellular enzyme or by the chemical conditions inside of a cell (e.g., through reduction by intracellular glutathione).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0144">In some embodiments, a reversibly modified nucleotide comprises a glutathione-sensitive moiety. Typically, nucleic acid molecules have been chemically modified with cyclic disulfide moieties to mask the negative charge created by the internucleotide diphosphate linkages and improve cellular uptake and nuclease resistance. See U.S. Published Application No. 2011/0294869 originally assigned to Traversa Therapeutics, Inc. (&#x201c;Traversa&#x201d;), PCT Publication No. WO 2015/188197 to Solstice Biologics, Ltd. (&#x201c;Solstice&#x201d;), Meade et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>2014,32:1256-1263 (&#x201c;Meade&#x201d;), PCT Publication No. WO 2014/088920 to Merck Sharp &#x26; Dohme Corp, each of which are incorporated by reference for their disclosures of such modifications. This reversible modification of the internucleotide diphosphate linkages is designed to be cleaved intracellularly by the reducing environment of the cytosol (e.g. glutathione). Earlier examples include neutralizing phosphotriester modifications that were reported to be cleavable inside cells (Dellinger et al. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2003,125:940-950).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0145">In some embodiments, such a reversible modification allows protection during in vivo administration (e.g., transit through the blood and/or lysosomal/endosomal compartments of a cell) where the oligonucleotide will be exposed to nucleases and other harsh environmental conditions (e.g., pH). When released into the cytosol of a cell where the levels of glutathione are higher compared to extracellular space, the modification is reversed and the result is a cleaved oligonucleotide. Using reversible, glutathione sensitive moieties, it is possible to introduce sterically larger chemical groups into the oligonucleotide of interest as compared to the options available using irreversible chemical modifications. This is because these larger chemical groups will be removed in the cytosol and, therefore, should not interfere with the biological activity of the oligonucleotides inside the cytosol of a cell. As a result, these larger chemical groups can be engineered to confer various advantages to the nucleotide or oligonucleotide, such as nuclease resistance, lipophilicity, charge, thermal stability, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity. In some embodiments, the structure of the glutathione-sensitive moiety can be engineered to modify the kinetics of its release.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0146">In some embodiments, a glutathione-sensitive moiety is attached to the sugar of the nucleotide. In some embodiments, a glutathione-sensitive moiety is attached to the 2&#x2032;-carbon of the sugar of a modified nucleotide. In some embodiments, the glutathione-sensitive moiety is located at the 5&#x2032;-carbon of a sugar, particularly when the modified nucleotide is the 5&#x2032;-terminal nucleotide of the oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the glutathione-sensitive moiety is located at the 3&#x2032;-carbon of a sugar, particularly when the modified nucleotide is the 3&#x2032;-terminal nucleotide of the oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the glutathione-sensitive moiety comprises a sulfonyl group. See, e.g., U.S. Prov. Appl.

Targeting Ligands</p><p id="p-0161" num="0147">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to target the oligonucleotides of the disclosure to one or more cells or one or more organs. Such a strategy may help to avoid undesirable effects in other organs, or may avoid undue loss of the oligonucleotide to cells, tissue or organs that would not benefit for the oligonucleotide. Accordingly, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides disclosed herein may be modified to facilitate targeting of a particular tissue, cell or organ, e.g., to facilitate delivery of the oligonucleotide to the liver. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides disclosed herein may be modified to facilitate delivery of the oligonucleotide to the hepatocytes of the liver. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide comprises a nucleotide that is conjugated to one or more targeting ligands.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0148">A targeting ligand may comprise a carbohydrate, amino sugar, cholesterol, peptide, polypeptide, protein or part of a protein (e.g., an antibody or antibody fragment) or lipid. In some embodiments, a targeting ligand is an aptamer. For example, a targeting ligand may be an RGD peptide that is used to target tumor vasculature or glioma cells, CREKA peptide to target tumor vasculature or stoma, transferrin, lactoferrin, or an aptamer to target transferrin receptors expressed on CNS vasculature, or an anti-EGFR antibody to target EGFR on glioma cells. In certain embodiments, the targeting ligand is one or more GalNAc moieties.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0149">In some embodiments, 1 or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) nucleotides of an oligonucleotide are each conjugated to a separate targeting ligand. In some embodiments, 2 to 4 nucleotides of an oligonucleotide are each conjugated to a separate targeting ligand. In some embodiments, targeting ligands are conjugated to 2 to 4 nucleotides at either ends of the sense or antisense strand (e.g., ligands are conjugated to a 2 to 4 nucleotide overhang or extension on the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the sense or antisense strand) such that the targeting ligands resemble bristles of a toothbrush and the oligonucleotide resembles a toothbrush. For example, an oligonucleotide may comprise a stem-loop at either the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the sense strand and 1, 2, 3 or 4 nucleotides of the loop of the stem may be individually conjugated to a targeting ligand.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0150">In some embodiments, it is desirable to target an oligonucleotide that reduces the expression of HBV antigen to the hepatocytes of the liver of a subject. Any suitable hepatocyte targeting moiety may be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0151">GalNAc is a high affinity ligand for asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is primarily expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatocyte cells and has a major role in binding, internalization, and subsequent clearance of circulating glycoproteins that contain terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues (asialoglycoproteins).

In some embodiments, targeting ligands are conjugated to 2 to 4 nucleotides at either ends of the sense or antisense strand (e.g., ligands are conjugated to a 2 to 4 nucleotide overhang or extension on the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the sense or antisense strand) such that the GalNAc moieties resemble bristles of a toothbrush and the oligonucleotide resembles a toothbrush. For example, an oligonucleotide may comprise a stem-loop at either the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the sense strand and 1, 2, 3 or 4 nucleotides of the loop of the stem may be individually conjugated to a GalNAc moiety.

For example, oligonucleotides can be delivered to a subject or a cellular environment using a formulation that minimizes degradation, facilitates delivery and/or uptake, or provides another beneficial property to the oligonucleotides in the formulation. In some embodiments, provided herein are compositions comprising oligonucleotides (e.g., single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotides) to reduce the expression of HBV antigen (e.g., HBsAg). Such compositions can be suitably formulated such that when administered to a subject, either into the immediate environment of a target cell or systemically, a sufficient portion of the oligonucleotides enter the cell to reduce HBV antigen expression. Any of a variety of suitable oligonucleotide formulations can be used to deliver oligonucleotides for the reduction of HBV antigen as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide is formulated in buffer solutions such as phosphate-buffered saline solutions, liposomes, micellar structures, and capsids.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0160">Formulations of oligonucleotides with cationic lipids can be used to facilitate transfection of the oligonucleotides into cells. For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin, cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules (e.g., polylysine) can be used.

Methods provided herein are useful in any appropriate cell type. In some embodiments, a cell is any cell that expresses HBV antigen (e.g., hepatocytes, macrophages, monocyte-derived cells, prostate cancer cells, cells of the brain, endocrine tissue, bone marrow, lymph nodes, lung, gall bladder, liver, duodenum, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, bladder, adipose and soft tissue and skin). In some embodiments, the cell is a primary cell that has been obtained from a subject and that may have undergone a limited number of a passages, such that the cell substantially maintains its natural phenotypic properties. In some embodiments, a cell to which the oligonucleotide is delivered is ex vivo or in vitro (i.e., can be delivered to a cell in culture or to an organism in which the cell resides). In specific embodiments, methods are provided for delivering to a cell an effective amount any one of the oligonucleotides disclosed herein for purposes of reducing expression of HBsAg solely in hepatocytes.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0169">In some embodiments, oligonucleotides disclosed herein can be introduced using appropriate nucleic acid delivery methods including injection of a solution containing the oligonucleotides, bombardment by particles covered by the oligonucleotides, exposing the cell or organism to a solution containing the oligonucleotides, or electroporation of cell membranes in the presence of the oligonucleotides. Other appropriate methods for delivering oligonucleotides to cells may be used, such as lipid-mediated carrier transport, chemical-mediated transport, and cationic liposome transfection such as calcium phosphate, and others.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0170">The consequences of inhibition can be confirmed by an appropriate assay to evaluate one or more properties of a cell or subject, or by biochemical techniques that evaluate molecules indicative of HBV antigen expression (e.g., RNA, protein). In some embodiments, the extent to which an oligonucleotide provided herein reduces levels of expression of HBV antigen is evaluated by comparing expression levels (e.g., mRNA or protein levels) of HBV antigen to an appropriate control (e.g., a level of HBV antigen expression in a cell or population of cells to which an oligonucleotide has not been delivered or to which a negative control has been delivered). In some embodiments, an appropriate control level of HBV antigen expression may be a predetermined level or value, such that a control level need not be measured every time. The predetermined level or value can take a variety of forms. In some embodiments, a predetermined level or value can be single cut-off value, such as a median or mean.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0171">In some embodiments, administration of an oligonucleotide as described herein results in a reduction in the level of HBV antigen (e.g., HBsAg) expression in a cell. In some embodiments, the reduction in levels of HBV antigen expression may be a reduction to 1% or lower, 5% or lower, 10% or lower, 15% or lower, 20% or lower, 25% or lower, 30% or lower, 35% or lower, 40% or lower, 45% or lower, 50% or lower, 55% or lower, 60% or lower, 70% or lower, 80% or lower, or 90% or lower compared with an appropriate control level of HBV antigen. The appropriate control level may be a level of HBV antigen expression in a cell or population of cells that has not been contacted with an oligonucleotide as described herein. In some embodiments, the effect of delivery of an oligonucleotide to a cell according to a method disclosed herein is assessed after a finite period of time.

Development of Potent Oligonucleotide Inhibitors of HBsAg Expression</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0181">HBV surface antigen was identified as a target for RNAi-based therapy to treat HBV infection. As depicted in the HBV genome organization shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, HBsAg is encoded by three RNA molecules transcribed from a single ORF. Oligonucleotides were designed for purposes of silencing one or more RNA transcripts that contribute to HBsAg assembly (example RNAi target site indicated by &#x201c;X&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). An HBsAg-targeting oligonucleotide, HBV-254, was designed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. HBV-254 was selected and designed based on an ability to directly target mRNA transcripts for four HBV RNA species. The HBV-254 duplex oligonucleotide used in the experiments included a sense strand of a sequence as set forth in (shown 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;): GUGGUGGACUUCUCUCAAUAGCAGCCGAAAGGCUGC (SEQ ID NO: 21); and an antisense strand of a sequence as set forth in (shown 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;): UAUUGAGAGAAGUCCACCACGG (SEQ ID NO: 22).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0182">A single dose evaluation of oligonucleotide HBV-254 in HDI-mice was conducted, demonstrating the ability to subcutaneously target HBsAg viral transcript (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As shown, HBV-254 systematically reduced HBsAg levels in mice with increasing dosage. Preclinical potency was further evaluated in mice following a QW&#xd7;3 dosing regimen in which HBV-254 was subcutaneously administered at 3 mg/kg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The administration points are indicated by arrows in the figure. HBsAg levels were monitored in both oligonucleotide treated and untreated control mice for a period spanning 147 days. Diminished HBsAg levels persisted in treated mice throughout the entirety of the study, with expression levels (relative to control) appearing to settle at a reduced baseline at approximately two months following the first administration.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0183">Additional potent HBsAg-targeting oligonucleotides were identified by in vitro screening using a psiCHECK reporter assay with oligonucleotides in unmodified tetraloop form. The results from three different plates are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Each oligonucleotide, including HBV-254, was evaluated at three concentrations (1, 10, and 100 pM) in HeLa cells using the fluorescence-based reporter assay. The results reported for each plate are further shown in comparison with positive control (8, 40, and 200 pM), negative control (1 nM), and mock transfection. Oligonucleotides shown highlighted with boxes were scaled up for in vivo testing, in which HBV-219 and HBV-258 were found to be the most potent oligonucleotides among HBV-254 and those identified from the screening. HBV-219 exhibited a multi-log improvement in potency over HBV-254 and was selected for additional evaluation.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2.

This technology is based on grafting human hepatocytes into severely immunocompromised mice, then using a genetic mechanism to poison the host murine hepatocytes (Tateno et al., 2015). This process results in mice containing livers derived from &#x3e;70% human tissue, which, unlike wild type mice, can be infected with HBV (Li et al., 2014). The PXB-HBV model serves several purposes in the context of HBV(s)-219 pharmacology: (1) to confirm that the oligonucleotide can engage the human RNAi machinery (RISC) in vivo, (2) to confirm that the GalNAc-targeting ligand configuration can internalize into hepatocytes via human ASGR in vivo, and (3) to confirm efficacy in a true model of HBV infection (as opposed to an engineered model of HBV expression). Despite the limitation that the grafted human hepatocytes result in an irregular chimeric liver physiology (Tateno et al., 2015), significant antiviral efficacy can be observed in this model.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0199">Approximately 8 weeks after the initial infection of the mice with HBV Genotype C, plasma are collected for each mouse to serve as a baseline HBsAg measurement. Then, cohorts of 9 mice each (n=3 for PK, n=6 for PD) received 3 weekly SC injections of 0 (PBS) or 3 mg/kg HBV(s)-219P1. The first day of dosing is considered Day 0. Non-terminal blood collections were performed weekly to determine the serum HBsAg and circulating HBV DNA levels in each mouse (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D</figref>). Mice were euthanized for terminal tissue endpoints on Day 28. Day 28 liver samples were analyzed for intrahepatic HBV DNA and cccDNA levels. Significant antiviral activity was observed in all endpoints that were analyzed for mice treated with HBV(s)-219P1, including &#x3e;80% reduction of HBsAg, as well as significant decreases in circulating HBV DNA, intrahepatic HBV DNA, and cccDNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D</figref>).

While this results in controlled viremia while on such treatment, lifelong treatment is required and a functional cure is rarely achieved. The RNAi oligonucletoides targeting the S antigen impact both the viral polymerase and HBsAg protein.
