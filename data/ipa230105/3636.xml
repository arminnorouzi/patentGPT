More specifically, the present invention relates to semiconductor metrology techniques for measurement of device critical dimensions by optical means.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor manufacturing is continuously evolving towards smaller device dimensions in an effort to improve performance, power efficiency and cost. Maintaining this trend requires ever tighter and more efficient process control&#x2014;and thus also metrology&#x2014;both in terms of critical dimensions and material properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this context, optical metrology methods are distinguished for their non-destructive, non-contact mechanism combined with high throughput and small measurement spot. Specifically, optical spectroscopic methods such as Spectral Reflectometry (SR) and Spectral Ellipsometry (SE) are commonly used for dimensional metrology (OCD) and process control. By inspecting light reflected from a sample, information about the optical properties and thickness of thin films can be deduced, as well as dimensional parameters of complex patterned structures. However, these methods often have very low sensitivity to intrinsic material properties such as electrical (e.g. carrier lifetime, mobility) and mechanical (e.g. strain/stress) parameters. Other methods for measuring such properties often suffer from various shortcomings&#x2014;such as being destructive, requiring contact with the sample, having very long measurement time or excessively large measurement spot.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, it is an aim of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for measuring the light-induced change in optical properties of a sample. A system and a method that overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of systems and methods available nowadays.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modulation Spectroscopy (MS) refers to a family of techniques where the sample is perturbed in some way from its nominal state, and the change in spectrum (rather than the spectrum itself) as a response to that perturbation is measured. Examples of this are Thermo Reflectance, where the difference in reflectivity due to temperature change is measured, Electro/Magneto Reflectance where an electrostatic/magnetostatic, respectively, field is applied or Photo Reflectance, where an optical field is used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the spectral reflectivity of a material is closely related to electronic properties such as band structure, density of states, free carries etc., modulation spectroscopy (MS) is uniquely sensitive to these properties more than any other optical spectroscopy method. This can be of high value when electrical testing of semiconductor devices needs to be done at the early stages of their fabrication process, where conventional E-testing is impossible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is of an apparatus and method for broadband Photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy, i.e., for measuring the light-induced change in optical properties of a sample. The PR apparatus, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, uses two-beams: a first probe beam used for measuring the spectral reflectivity of a sample, and a second pump beam used for modulating the reflectivity. The PR measured value is &#x394;R/R, where R(&#x3c9;)+&#x394;R(&#x3c9;) and R(&#x3c9;) are the spectral reflectivity with and without the pump beam, respectively.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In most circumstances the magnitude of &#x394;R/R is very small, on the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>-10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>. Measuring this small change in reflectivity requires signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of &#x2dc;10<sup>6 </sup>which is challenging due to the noise and spurious signal sources present in standard spectroscopic systems.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The eventual performance and advantage of the PR apparatus and method of the present invention is described below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, the main noise factors in PR measurements are as follows:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">Shot noise: The shot noise in the detection of N photons (or photoelectrons) is &#x221a;{square root over (N)}. In PR, the signal of interest &#x394;R is the result of subtracting two much stronger signals R and R+&#x394;R. The noise in each of these signals is uncorrelated, and so not subtracted. So, if N photoelectrons are detected at reflectance R, the SNR becomes</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>S</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>N</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>R</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>&#x2248;</mo>  <mrow>   <msqrt>    <mfrac>     <mi>N</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </mfrac>   </msqrt>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x394;</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>R</mi>     </mrow>     <mi>R</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>.</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">&#x2003;For example, to detect a PR signal</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>&#x394;</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>R</mi>   </mrow>   <mi>R</mi>  </mfrac>  <mo>&#x2248;</mo>  <mrow>   <mn>1</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msup>    <mn>0</mn>    <mrow>     <mo>-</mo>     <mn>5</mn>    </mrow>   </msup>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths><ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">&#x2003;with SNR=10, a total of 2&#xb7;10<sup>12 </sup>photoelectrons need to be collected (per pixel), which amount to a few &#x3bc;J for visible light.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0012">&#x201c;1/f&#x201d; noise coming from the source, detector and electronics. This type of noise is difficult to overcome since, as its name suggests, it scales inversely with the frequency or linearly with acquisition time&#x2014;meaning that increasing measurement time does not help to average it out (or in other words, it contains long-term correlations).</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0013">The common mitigation to this, called Lock-in Detection (LID), is to modulate the pump beam at a sufficiently high frequency (typically &#x2dc;hundreds Hz) and pass the probe detector signal through a lock-in amplifier (LIA) locked to the pump modulation frequency&#x2014;thus isolating the frequencies close to the modulation frequency and rejecting the rest.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0014">This works very well, but the complex electronics make it practical only for a single channel measurement system. Acquiring a full spectrum in this way requires measuring each spectral component of the probe beam sequentially&#x2014;usually by means of a scanning monochromator.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0015">Such a procedure drastically increases the measurement time compared with the multichannel approach used in standard spectroscopic methods, e.g. by dispersing the collected probe beam onto a CCD or other multichannel sensor and measuring all wavelengths in parallel.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0016">Quantization and Read-out noise are uncorrelated noise sources incurred per acquisition of the CCD. If the modulation frequency is increased to better deal with 1/f noise, the number of read-outs is proportionally increased, ultimately making these noises dominate over the shot noise.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">As explained, to overcome 1/f noise, PR measurements require the use of a modulated pump with lock-in detection. Pump modulation can be achieved in one of several ways: placing a modulation device (such as a mechanical chopper wheel, electro-optic or acousto-optic modulator) in the pump laser beam path, or directly modulating the pump laser power.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">If the probe is monochromatic (laser PR), this is relatively straightforward to do with available fast detectors and LIA electronics. However, photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy is a different matter&#x2014;here the probe source is broadband, and the reflected light needs to be sampled at many different wavelengths to build up a PR spectrum. Broadly speaking there are two approaches to doing this:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0019">Using traditional Lock-In Detection (LID) as described above, the reflected probe beam must be passed through a monochromator and each wavelength measured sequentially. This means repeating the same measurement hundreds of times, making the throughput very low and ill-suited to industrial applications</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0020">Using a spectrometer which disperses the probe beam onto a multi-channel detector (e.g. CCD) and reads all wavelengths simultaneously, as is commonly done in SE and SR. However, for photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy the small signal still requires some form of LID to overcome noise, and this is not easily done on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The way it can be done is by using high-end CCDs and electronics which can read spectra at high frame rates (synchronized to the pump modulation) and low noise. The data is then processed on a computer to mathematically achieve the same effect as a LIA, essentially imposing a narrow bandpass filter around the pump modulation frequency in order to cancel noise at all other frequencies. If the frames are fully aligned to the pump cycles, this essentially amounts to accumulating all the &#x201c;pump-off&#x201d; frames and subtracting the result from the accumulated &#x201c;pump-on&#x201d; frames to get the PR signal &#x3b4;R(&#x3bb;). However, the problem with this approach is that it requires sophisticated and expensive sensors and electronics, most likely custom made. Thus, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an improved apparatus and a method for measuring the light-induced change in optical properties of a sample. More specifically, an apparatus and method which overcome the above-described limitations of apparatuses and methods available nowadays.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">Thus, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a photoreflectance (PR) spectroscopy apparatus for accumulating separately a &#x201c;pump on&#x201d; light beam and a &#x201c;pump off&#x201d; light beam reflecting off a sample.
