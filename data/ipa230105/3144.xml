The FVVS can control the number of working media entering an air cylinder by means of early intake valve closing (EIVC), thereby omitting a throttle valve. Such a throttle-valve-free gasoline engine will greatly reduce the pumping loss and reduce the fuel consumption under low and medium loads by <b>10</b>-<b>15</b>%. The FVVS is matched with a supercharged intercooler, which can solve the problems of deflagration and high heat load after an engine is supercharged. Low-temperature combustion is achieved while a mean effective pressure is greatly increased. The heat efficiency of the engine is improved, and emission of harmful gas is reduced. Therefore, an FVVS technology has become one of the important development directions of a new internal combustion engine technology.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present, a more advanced FVVS is a MultiAir (also referred to as UniAir) system jointly developed by Schaeffler and Fiat. The system adopts a camshaft-driven electro-hydraulic valve system, and the movement of a valve is jointly controlled by a camshaft and an electromagnetic valve. The working principle of the system is as follows: a hydraulic piston is driven by a cam; the hydraulic piston is connected to a driving piston through a sliding sleeve cavity; and the sliding sleeve cavity is controlled by a switching electromagnetic valve. When the electromagnetic valve is fully closed, the hydraulic piston pushes the driving piston through a liquid pressure, and transmits a hydraulic pressure generated by rotation of the cam to a valve; and at this time, an intake valve is completely controlled by the cam and is opened. When the electromagnetic valve is fully opened, the hydraulic pressure cannot transmit a driving force, and the hydraulic piston cannot push the driving piston; and the intake valve is no longer controlled by the cam and falls back or is closed. By means of controlling the opening and closing moment of the electromagnetic valve, various valve motion laws can be realized, and functions of the FVVS can be realized. However, the electromagnetic valve of the FVVS is complicated in structure and expensive, which limits the popularization and application of this technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to replace the expensive high-speed electromagnetic valve, Chinese invention patent CN109339896A discloses a fully variable electro-hydraulic valve device with a buffering function, comprising: a camshaft, a valve assembly, a spiral shaft, a sliding sleeve, a piston and a position restoring spring. The spiral shaft and the piston are connected with the sliding sleeve in a sliding sealing manner; the piston abuts against the valve assembly; in the sliding sleeve, a sealed sliding sleeve cavity is formed in a space between the spiral shaft and the piston; the reset spring is clamped between the spiral shaft and the piston; the spiral shaft is controlled by a cam surface of the camshaft in the axial direction; the circumferential wall of the spiral shaft that is connected with the sliding sleeve in a sliding sealing manner is a spiral circumferential wall; the end of the spiral shaft is provided with a control gear meshed with a rack; the rack is driven by a linear actuator controlled by an electric control unit of the engine; the sliding sleeve is provided with an oil inlet hole and a limiting oil hole; the oil inlet hole is close to the spiral shaft; the limiting oil hole is close to the piston; the oil inlet hole and the limiting oil hole communicate with a low-pressure oil circuit of the engine; and a one-way valve is arranged on a connecting pipeline between the limiting oil hole and the low-pressure oil circuit of the engine.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this invention, the spiral shaft and the camshaft are jointly used to control the movement of the valve; the opening and closing moment of the oil inlet hole is changed by rotating the spiral shaft, so that the functions of the FVVS can be realized, and this invention has high response speed and is convenient to control; and this invention replaces the expensive high-speed electromagnetic valve and is suitable for being used in a multi-cylinder engine.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the application of the device, it is found that the mechanism has the problem of too fast seating speed in the process of electro-hydraulically controlling the valve to be seated, which causes impact damage to the valve and a sealing surface of a valve seat, and affects the service life. Moreover, in the shutdown process of the engine, hydraulic oil in the sliding sleeve cavity will leak slowly. When the engine is started, the phenomenon of &#x201c;no oil&#x201d; may appear in the sliding sleeve cavity, which will cause failure of the system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For the shortcomings in the prior art, the present invention provides a fully variable electro-hydraulic valve system having a buffering function, so as to reduce the seating speed of a valve, relieve the impact damage caused to a valve and a sealing surface of a valve seat, and prolong the service life.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the above technical problems, the present invention adopts the following technical solution:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A fully variable electro-hydraulic valve system having a buffering function comprises a camshaft, a valve assembly, a sliding sleeve, a spiral shaft, a piston and a position restoring spring;

During the return stroke, hydraulic oil enters the sliding sleeve cavity from the oil inlet hole to enable the spiral shaft to be quickly reset together with the position restoring spring. The linear actuator controlled by the electric control unit of the engine drives the spiral shaft to rotate, so that the fully variable valve system has high response speed, is convenient to control, replaces an expensive high-speed electromagnetic valve, and is suitable for being used in a multi-cylinder engine.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">2) When the valve is going to be seated, the piston firstly collides with the buffering ring; due to the effect of the throttling device, engine oil within the buffering cavity has a damping effect on the movement of the buffering ring to enable the buffering ring to move slowly, such that the valve is slowly seated, thus reducing the impact damage caused to the valve and a sealing surface of a valve seat, thereby effectively prolonging the service life of the valve system. When the valve moves down again, the buffering ring moves downward under the action of the pressure of the engine oil. Since the buffering distance is extremely short, before the valve is seated again, there is enough time for the buffering ring to move to the position of the baffle plate. The valve buffering effect can be adjusted by adjusting the throttling effect and the buffering distance of the throttling device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">3) After the engine is shut down, and an electric control unit (ECU) is powered off, the rack moves to the extreme position limited by the limiting device under the action of the return spring; at this time, the piston abutting plane abuts against the spiral shaft abutting plane, and the engine oil does not work; the cam and the valve are in a rigid connection state; a valve lift of the valve assembly is completely controlled by the camshaft, so that the influence caused by loss of the engine oil on the normal work of the system is avoided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional view of an embodiment of a fully variable electro-hydraulic valve system having a buffering function of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view of a partial structure of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> cut along a plane formed by the center of a limiting oil hole and the center of a sliding sleeve when a valve is fully closed;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a three-dimensional structure of a spiral shaft in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a three-dimensional structure of a piston in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a three-dimensional structure during abutment of abutting planes of the spiral shaft and the piston in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a gear-rack mechanism for driving the spiral shaft in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a crank angle/valve lift curve chart of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><b>101</b>: camshaft;

After the spiral shaft abutting plane <b>102</b>B is separated from the piston abutting plane <b>105</b>B, since the spiral shaft <b>102</b> is provided with the spiral surface <b>102</b>E, the relative position where the spiral shaft <b>102</b> blocks the limiting oil hole <b>118</b> can be changed by rotating the spiral shaft <b>102</b>, so as to control the stroke of the piston <b>105</b>, thereby controlling a lift of the valve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a relationship between a valve lift and a crank angle (which is equivalent to a camshaft angle). The outermost curve represents a valve opening curve under the condition that the spiral shaft is only controlled by the cam surface when the spiral shaft abutting plane <b>102</b>B abuts against the piston abutting plane <b>105</b>B. At this time, the valve lift is the maximum.

In the circumferential direction, the distance from the limiting oil hole <b>118</b> to the piston abutting plane edge point P shall also be as short as possible, so that after the spiral shaft abutting plane <b>102</b>B is separated from the piston abutting plane <b>105</b>B, the spiral shaft <b>102</b> can play a role in blocking the limiting oil hole <b>118</b> along with own axial movement by being rotated by an angle that is as small as possible.
