A field-effect transistor (FET) is a semiconductor device that includes three terminals: a gate, a source, and a drain. A FET uses an electric field applied by the gate to control the electrical conductivity of a channel through which charge carriers (e.g., electrons or holes) flow from the source to the drain. In instances where the charge carriers are electrons, the FET is referred to as an n-channel device, and in instances where the charge carriers are holes, the FET is referred to as a p-channel device. Standard dopant used for Si, Ge, and SiGe includes boron (B) for p-type (acceptor) dopant and phosphorous (P) or arsenic (As) for n-type (donor) dopant. In addition, metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs) include a gate dielectric between the gate and the channel. MOSFETs may also be known as metal-insulator-semiconductor FETs (MISFETSs) or insulated-gate FETs (IGFETs). Complementary MOS (CMOS) structures use a combination of p-channel MOSFET (PMOS) and n-channel MOSFET (NMOS) to implement logic gates and other digital circuits.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A FinFET is a MOSFET transistor built around a thin strip of semiconductor material (generally referred to as a fin). The conductive channel of the FinFET device resides on the outer portions of the fin adjacent to the gate dielectric. Specifically, current runs along/within both sidewalls of the fin (sides perpendicular to the substrate surface) as well as along the top of the fin (side parallel to the substrate surface). Because the conductive channel of such configurations includes three different planer regions of the fin (e.g., top and two sides), such a FinFET design is sometimes referred to as a tri-gate transistor. Other types of FinFET configurations are also available, such as so-called double-gate FinFETs, in which the conductive channel principally resides only along the two sidewalls of the fin (and not along the top of the fin).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-section of an example stack of layers that may be used to form a ferroelectric-based transistor including a ferroelectric layer in the gate stack, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cross-section of an example ferroelectric-based transistor including a ferroelectric layer in the gate stack, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, the ferroelectric layer includes a suitable ferroelectric oxide. The ferroelectric layer can be voltage activated to switch between two ferroelectric states. Employing such a ferroelectric layer provides a reduction in leakage current in an off-state and provides an increase in charge in an on-state. In some embodiments, the interfacial oxide layer is between the ferroelectric layer and the gate electrode. In other embodiments, the ferroelectric layer is between the interfacial oxide layer and the gate electrode. In any such cases, the ferroelectric gate stack provides improved performance in the form of reduced off-state leakage and increased on-state charge, as will be appreciated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">General Overview</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As previously explained, the channel is a conductive region that connects the source and drain in a FET device, when proper biasing is applied. One factor in the design of semiconductor transistor devices is the mobility of the carrier flowing within the channel. Improved carrier mobility (e.g., how fast the carrier moves through the channel) translates to improved semiconductor performance. However, existing solutions commonly use silicon as the channel material, and carrier mobility provided by silicon channels is finite. For example, typical silicon carrier mobilities are about 200 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. To this end, group III-V semiconductor materials can be used as replacement channel materials in semiconductor transistor devices for certain applications. Group III-V semiconductor materials typically provide high carrier mobilities. For example, as compared to silicon or other group IV semiconductor materials, some group III-V semiconductor materials, such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), indium phosphide (InP), and indium arsenide (InAs), have carrier mobilities as high as 30,000 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. The high carrier mobilities allow group III-V semiconductor material transistor devices to operate much faster than group IV semiconductor material transistor devices at high currents (e.g., when the device is biased to an on-state to allow current flow). Despite the higher carrier mobilities and the potential for faster operating speeds, there are some non-trivial issues associated with group III-V semiconductor material transistor devices. One such issue is leakage current as a result of the small band gaps typically associated with group III-V semiconductor materials. Leakage current, sometimes referred to as band-to-band tunneling (BTBT), can be quite high in small band gap semiconductor material transistor devices. BTBT is the effect when charge carriers flow (or &#x201c;tunnel&#x201d;) from a channel region to a drain region (or vice versa) of a semiconductor device when the device is biased to an off-state so as to prevent current flow. For example, when a low voltage is applied to a semiconductor gate and a high voltage is applied to a corresponding drain region, a high gradient field is generated between the gate and the drain region. This field can cause charge carriers to tunnel from the valence band of the channel region to the conduction band of the drain region. This BTBT leads to a phenomenon referred to as gate induced drain leakage (GIDL), which is an off-state leakage current. Note that the GIDL can be quite high in small band gap semiconductor material transistor devices. Further note that the GIDL is exponential as a function of the high voltage applied to the drain region. That is, a percentage increase, for example, 20%, 30%, etc., in the high voltage applied to the drain region can result in an exponential increase, for example, 10&#xd7;, 100&#xd7;, or even larger, in the GIDL, as compared to a corresponding percentage increase. An undesirable consequence of GIDL is the reduction in gate control, making small band gap semiconductor material transistor devices harder to bias to an off-state (e.g., little or no current flow through the device).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">High-k dielectric materials have been proposed for use as an insulator in the gate stack to increase carrier mobility. Use of a high-k gate dielectric allows more carriers to be pulled into the channel in the on-state. Unfortunately, the physical thickness of the high-k gate dielectric needs to be increased to address the off-state leakage current and to avoid reliability concerns. However, increasing the thickness of the high-k dielectric will limit the ability to pull charges into the channel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, techniques are disclosed herein for integrating a ferroelectric oxide in a gate stack for logic transistor devices and other integrated circuit transistors. Ferroelectric oxides can be characterized as having a built-in-field or polarizable layer that can be reversed by the application of an external electrical field (e.g., voltage activation). For instance, in an off-state (e.g., when the gate voltage is 0 V), the dipoles in the field do not line up and the ferroelectric oxide becomes electrically very thick in that majority of the field drops across the ferroelectric gate oxide and very little of the field drops across the channel. In such a state, the ferroelectric oxide in the gate stack functions as a relatively thick gate oxide in that the field from the gate to the drain is very low. Conversely, in an on-state (e.g., when the gate voltage is 0.65 V or higher), the dipoles in the field line up and the ferroelectric oxide becomes electrically very thin in that majority of the field drops across the channel and very little of the field drops across ferroelectric oxide. In such a state, the ferroelectric oxide in the gate stack functions as a relatively thin gate oxide having a very high effective dielectric constant in that the field from the gate to the drain is very high (e.g., increased charge in the on-state). Thus, for the same physical thickness, the ferroelectric properties allow the ferroelectric oxide layer to electrically function as both a thick oxide in the off-state, and a thin oxide in the on-state. Accordingly, in an off-state, the low field allows the ferroelectric gate oxide to reduce the off-state leakage current commonly associated with small band gap semiconductor material systems. In addition, in an on-state, the increased field across the channel results in an increase in electrical current and a relatively fast turn on. Numerous variations and configurations will be apparent in light of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Use of the techniques and structures provided herein may be detectable using tools such as: electron microscopy including scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and reflection electron microscopy (REM); composition mapping; x-ray crystallography or diffraction (XRD); secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS); time-of-flight SIMS (ToF-SIMS); atom probe imaging or tomography; local electrode atom probe (LEAP) techniques; 3D tomography; or high resolution physical or chemical analysis, to name a few suitable example analytical tools. In particular, in some embodiments, such tools may indicate an integrated circuit or transistor device having a gate stack structure configured as described herein. For example, in some embodiments, such structures may include a ferroelectric layer between a gate dielectric and a metal gate. In other embodiments, such structures may include the gate dielectric between the ferroelectric layer and the metal gate. Further, such a ferroelectric layer may be identified by first identifying a structure including the layer using cross-sectional analysis (e.g., using SEM, TEM, or STEM through a transistor), for example, and then performing analysis for composition of material on the structural layers (e.g., using composition mapping) to identify that the ferroelectric layer exhibits ferroelectric properties and/or includes ferroelectric material, such as one or more of the ferroelectric materials described herein. In some embodiments, the techniques described herein may be detected based on the benefits derived from their use, which include improved on-state charge and/or reduction in off-state leakage as a result of the lower field.

Specifically, in the example stack of layers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is formed above interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b> (as compared to the stack of layers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is formed below interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>). That is, ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is between interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b> and gate electrode <b>150</b>. In such embodiments where ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is formed above interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>, a preclean may be performed to remove any naturally forming oxide on base layer <b>120</b> prior to depositing interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b> on base layer <b>120</b>, for instance. Ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> can then be formed on interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>, and gate electrode <b>150</b> can be formed on ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a cross-section of an example ferroelectric-based transistor structure including a ferroelectric layer in the gate stack, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. Note that the cross-section is taken along the orthogonal-to-gate direction. The previous relevant discussion with respect to the features of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> that are similar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is equally applicable here, such as the previous relevant discussion with respect to base layer <b>120</b>, S/D regions <b>160</b>, S/D contacts <b>170</b>, spacers <b>180</b>, and so forth. Note that the relative changes in the example structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (compared to the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) primarily relate to the gate stack layer (ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>, interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>, and gate electrode <b>150</b>), as will be understood based on this disclosure. Thus, the gate stack layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is indicated with a respective A, B, or C as shown, such as ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>A, interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>A, and gate electrode <b>150</b>A. Numerous gate stack configurations will be apparent in light of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, both a ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>A and an interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>A are formed on the bottom and sidewalls of the gate trench region (e.g., the region between spacers <b>180</b>), and the material of the two layers <b>130</b>A and <b>140</b>A remains on the sidewalls of that region. In such an example structure, ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>A and interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>A may have been blanket deposited (e.g., via conformal deposition process) after S/D regions <b>160</b> and spacers <b>180</b> were formed. As a result, in this example embodiment, ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>A and interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>A are between a gate electrode <b>150</b>A and each of spacers <b>180</b>, such that gate electrode <b>150</b>A is no longer directly adjacent to (or in physical contact with) spacers <b>180</b>. However, in this example embodiment, spacers <b>180</b> are still adjacent to both sides of gate electrode <b>150</b>A, except there is now an intervening bilayer (e.g., ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>A and interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>A), as shown. For embodiments used in logic applications, such as logic transistor application, the gate stack may be the same distance (e.g., equidistant) from both of the S/D regions (e.g., as is the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>); however, the present disclosure is not intended to be so limited. In some embodiments, the gate stack may be separated from each of the S/D regions by at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 50 nm, or some other suitable minimum distance, depending on the end use or target application.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate expanded views of the A-A dashed square portion indicated in the example structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, the A-A dashed square portion includes the gate stack layers of ferroelectric layer <b>130</b>, interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>, and gate electrode <b>150</b>. Note that the description refers to the three layers generally as <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b> for ease of description, but it will be appreciated that A-A dashed square portion applies equally to layers <b>130</b>A, <b>140</b>A, and <b>150</b>A, respectively, as can be understood based on this disclosure. Also note that the A-A dashed square portion description also applies to a gate state composed of layers <b>140</b>, <b>130</b>, and <b>150</b>, as well as <b>140</b>A, <b>130</b>A, and <b>150</b>A, in such specified ordering (e.g., layering). Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> corresponds to the ferroelectric-based transistor gate stack layers in the transistor on-state, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> corresponds to the ferroelectric-based transistor gate stack layers in the transistor off-state. As can be understood based on this disclosure, when the transistor is in an on-state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is in a first ferroelectric state (indicated with the arrows pointing downward toward channel region <b>125</b>), thereby effecting more carriers to be pulled across interfacial layer <b>140</b> and ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> into channel region <b>125</b>, which produces increased charge. This in turn provides increased control over the channel. Further, when the transistor is in an off-state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> is in a second ferroelectric state (indicated with the arrows pointing upward toward interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>), thereby effecting less field from the gate to the drain (e.g., less field across ferroelectric layer <b>130</b> and interfacial oxide layer <b>140</b>). The lower field results in a reduction in off-state leakage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the techniques and structures described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b></figref> primarily related to a ferroelectric-based transistor having a planar configuration, the techniques can be applied to form transistors of varying configurations. For example, in some embodiments, the techniques may be used to form transistors having non-planar configurations, such as a dual-gate configuration, a tri-gate configuration, or a gate-all-around (GAA) configuration (e.g., including one or more nanowires or nanoribbons). Further, the techniques can be applied to benefit various different transistor types, such as metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), tunnel FETs (TFETs), high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), to name a few examples. Further still, the techniques can be applied regardless of the transistor doping schemes used. For example, in the case of a MOSFET configuration, the channel region may be doped in a type opposite from the adjacent S/D regions, such as an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS) configuration that includes n-type doped S/D material and p-type doped channel material, or a p-channel MOSFET (PMOS) configuration that includes p-type doped S/D material and n-type doped channel material. In the case of a TFET configuration, the S/D regions may be oppositely typed doped (where one is n-type doped and the other is p-type doped) and the channel material may be minimally doped or undoped/intrinsic. Further note that the techniques can be used to benefit one or both of the n-channel and p-channel transistors included in a complementary device, such as one or both of the NMOS and PMOS transistors included in a complementary MOS (CMOS) device, for example. Accordingly, the techniques described herein are not intended to be limited to any particular transistor configuration, unless otherwise stated.
