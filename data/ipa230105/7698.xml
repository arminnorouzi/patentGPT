function(s) or algorithm(s) may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of software and hardware. Disclosed functions may correspond to modules that may be software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. The software implementation may comprise computer-executable instructions stored on a computer-readable medium such as memory or other types of storage devices. For example, one or more microprocessors or general-purpose computers with communication processing capability may be programmed with corresponding executable instructions and carry out the disclosed network function(s) or algorithm(s). The microprocessors or general-purpose computers may be formed of Applications Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASIC), programmable logic arrays, and/or using one or more Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). Although some of the example implementations disclosed are oriented to software installed and executing on computer hardware, alternative example implementations implemented as firmware or as hardware or combination of hardware and software are well within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The computer-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, Random Access Memory (RAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), flash memory, Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM), magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, or any other equivalent medium capable of storing computer-readable instructions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">A radio communication network architecture (e.g., a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) system, or an LTE-Advanced Pro system) may typically include at least one Base Station (BS), at least one UE, and one or more optional network elements that provide connection towards a network. The UE may communicate with the network (e.g., a Core Network (CN), an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network, an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), a Next-Generation Core (NGC), or an Internet), through a Radio Access Network (RAN) established by the BS.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In the present disclosure, a UE may include, but is not limited to, a mobile station, a mobile terminal or device, a user communication radio terminal. For example, a UE may be a portable radio equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, a mobile phone, a tablet, a wearable device, a sensor, or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with wireless communication capability. The UE may be configured to receive and transmit signals over an air interface to one or more cells in a RAN.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">A BS may include, but is not limited to, a Node B (NB) as in the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), an evolved Node B (eNB) as in the LTE-A, a Radio Network Controller (RNC) as in the UNITS, a Base Station Controller (BSC) as in the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)/GSM Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) Radio Access Network (GERAN), a next-generation eNB (ng-eNB) as in an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) BS in connection with the 5GC, a next-generation Node B (gNB) as in the 5G Access Network (5G-AN), and any other apparatus capable of controlling radio communication and managing radio resources within a cell. The BS may connect to serve the one or more UEs through a radio interface to the network.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">A BS may be configured to provide communication services according to at least one of the following Radio Access Technologies (RATs): Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), GSM (often referred to as 2G), GERAN, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), UNITS (often referred to as 3G) based on basic Wideband-Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), LTE, LTE-A, enhanced L (eLTE), NR (often referred to as 5G), and LTE-A Pro. However, the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited to the protocols mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The BS may be operable to provide radio coverage to a specific geographical area using a plurality of cells included in the RAN. The BS may support the operations of the cells. Each cell may be operable to provide services to at least one UE within its radio coverage. More specifically, each cell (often referred to as a serving cell) may provide services to serve one or more UEs within its radio coverage (e.g., each cell schedules the Downlink (DL) and optionally Uplink (UL) resources to at least one UE within its radio coverage for DL and optionally UL packet transmissions). The BS may communicate with one or more UEs in the radio communication system through the plurality of cells. A cell may allocate Sidelink (SL) resources for supporting Proximity Service (ProSe), LTE SL services, and LTE/NR Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services. Each cell may have overlapped coverage areas with other cells. In Multi-RAT Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) cases, the primary cell of an MCG or a SCG may be referred to as a Special Cell (SpCell). A PCell may refer to the SpCell of an MCG. A Primary SCG Cell (PSCell) may refer to the SpCell of an SCG. MCG may refer to a group of serving cells associated with the Master Node (MN), including the SpCell and optionally one or more SCells. An SCG may refer to a group of serving cells associated with the Secondary Node (SN), including the SpCell and optionally one or more SCells.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">As discussed above, the frame structure for NR is to support flexible configurations for accommodating various next-generation (e.g., 5G) communication requirements, such as eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC, while fulfilling high reliability, high data rate, and low latency requirements. The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, as agreed in the 3GPP, may serve as a baseline for an NR waveform. The scalable OFDM numerology, such as the adaptive sub-carrier spacing, the channel bandwidth, and the cyclic prefix (CP), may also be used. Additionally, two coding schemes are considered for NR: (1) low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and (2) polar code. The coding scheme adaption may be configured based on the channel conditions and/or the service applications.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Moreover, it is also considered that in a transmission time interval of a single NR frame, at least DL transmission data, a guard period, and UL transmission data should be included, where the respective portions of the DL transmission data, the guard period, the UL transmission data should also be configurable, for example, based on the network dynamics of NR.

A UE may simultaneously receive or transmit on one or multiple CCs depending on its capabilities. CA is supported for both contiguous and non-contiguous CCs. When CA is deployed frame timing and SFN are aligned across cells that can be aggregated. The maximum number of configured CCs for a UE is 16 for DL and 16 for UL. When CA is configured, the UE only has one RRC connection with the network. At RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the NAS mobility information, and at RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the security input. This cell is referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell). Depending on UE capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) can be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. The configured set of serving cells for a UE therefore always consists of one PCell and one or more SCells.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">In various implementations of the present disclosure, a HARQ is a functionality that ensures delivery between peer entities at Layer 1 (i.e., Physical Layer). A single HARQ process supports one Transport Block (TB) when the physical layer is not configured for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, and when the physical layer is configured for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, a single HARQ process supports one or multiple TBs.

A timer is running once it is started, until it is stopped or until it expires; otherwise it is not running. A timer can be started if it is not running or restarted if it is running. A timer is always started or restarted from its initial value, where the initial value can be (but is not limited to) configured by the base station via downlink RRC signaling.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In various implementations of the present disclosure, a subset of the total cell bandwidth of a cell is referred to as a BWP and BA is achieved by configuring the UE with BWP(s) and telling the UE which of the configured BWPs is currently the active one. To enable BA on the PCell, the base station configures the UE with UL and DL BWP(s). To enable BA on SCells in case of CA, the base station configures the UE with DL BWP(s) at least (i.e. there may be none in the UL). For the PCell, the initial BWP is the BWP used for initial access. For the SCell(s), the initial BWP is the BWP configured for the UE to first operate at SCell activation. UE may be configured with a first active uplink BWP by a firstActiveUplinkBWP IE. If the first active uplink BWP is configured for an SpCell, the firstActiveUplinkBWP IE field contains the ID of the UL BWP to be activated upon performing the RRC (re-)configuration. If the field is absent, the RRC (re-)configuration does not impose a BWP switch. If the first active uplink BWP is configured for an SCell, the firstActiveUplinkBWP IE field contains the ID of the uplink bandwidth part to be used upon MAC-activation of an SCell.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In various implementations of the present disclosure, for DL transmission, the base station can dynamically allocate resources to UEs via the C-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI/CS-RNTI on PDCCH(s).

Afterward, a base station (e.g., a gNB) may reply a random access response to UE A and another random access response to UE B via a single MSGB transmission. That is, the base station may multiplex a subPDU carrying RAR of UE A and a subPDU carrying RAR of UE B into a single MAC PDU. The MAC PDU is transmitted via a TB scheduled by a DL assignment (e.g., DCI) identified by the MSGB-RNTI (e.g., the DCI with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits scrambled by MSGB-RNTI).

The MSGB is indicated by a DL assignment received on a PDCCH for either an MSGB-RNTI or a C-RNTI. The MSGB reception may be handled by (but is not limited to) a specific/dedicated DL HARQ process which means that the HARQ process for the MSGB is not dynamically indicated by the base station via a DCI on a PDCCH. The specific DL HARQ process may be, but is not limited to, a DL HARQ process 0.

That is, the MAC entity instructs the PHY layer to perform the HARQ-ACK feedback based on whether the data in the received TB was successfully decoded or not.

The DCI may also indicate the DL data corresponding to a HARQ feedback (e.g., HARQ-ACK) related instruction. That is, the DCI indicates time and frequency locations of the PDSCH and indicates the timing at which the UE should perform the corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0155">Two parameters K0 and K1 were introduced in NR Release 15 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for PDSCH scheduling and the corresponding HARQ-ACK feedback.

The K1 is defined as a slot offset between the slot containing the PDSCH and the slot the UE needs to perform the HARQ-ACK feedback.

The time interval of the first piece of information may be, but is not limited to, a value with the unit of symbol, sub-slot, slot, or sub-frame. For example, the first piece of information indicates a slot offset between a first slot of MSGB reception and a second slot of the HARQ-ACK feedback. Also, the time interval of the second piece of information may be, but is not limited to, a value with the unit of symbol, sub-slot, slot, or sub-frame. In an example, the second piece of information indicates an uplink resource for the HARQ-ACK feedback transmission within the second slot. The second piece of information indicates an uplink resource among multiple UL radio resources located within the second slot. In one example, the multiple UL radio resources located within the second slot are preconfigured by RRC configuration. In one example, the UL radio resource is represented in a value with the unit of symbol.

For example, the specific IE may be, but is not limited to, ServingCellConfigCommonSIB, UplinkConfigCommonSIB, BWP-UplinkCommon and/or pusch-ConfigCommon. For example, the PUCCH resource indicator indicates an uplink resource for the HARQ-ACK feedback transmission within the second slot. The PUCCH resource indicator indicates an uplink resource among multiple UL radio resources located within the second slot.
