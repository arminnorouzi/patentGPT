Application No. 63/216,833, filed Jun. 30, 2021, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/284,320, filed Nov. 30, 2021, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional capacitive touchscreen technologies, such as those used in smartphones and tablet devices, require significant visual engagement by a vehicle driver, which is a distraction for the driver and compromises safety. Conventional mechanical switches and knobs are less distracting because they can be safely used without requiring the driver to remove his eyes from the road, but they tend to have limited flexibility, with each switch controlling a single function or feature.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, switches, such as the ones disclosed and described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,707,034, issued Jul. 7, 2020, which is attached hereto as Appendix A and is fully incorporated by reference, have been developed. These switches provide sufficient feedback to the driver upon receiving driver input to avoid distracting the driver and provide the ability to control multiple functions and/or vehicle systems with a minimal footprint. Typically, this feedback is in the form of tactile and/or audible haptic feedback. Haptic feedback is used in various electronic devices, mostly commonly in toys, cell phones, and the like, and in touch switches, as described herein. There are a few types, but most commonly haptic exciters, which provide the haptic feedback and are motor driven or voice coil driven. Motor driven types commonly drive an unbalanced rotating medium, and the lack of balance causes a vibration perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Voice coil types provide a back and forth motion like a speaker. These are commonly available and are usually designed into products mechanically mounted to a surface of a product that will transfer the vibration or audio appropriately. An example of a typical conventional voice-coil haptic exciter is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a typical conventional voice-coil haptic exciter comprises a voice coil, a magnet, a suspension for the magnet, electrical connections for the voice coil, and a mounting surface. In a typical implementation, other than the electrical connections, the voice-coil haptic exciter is separate from the components that comprise the electronic device using the haptic exciter and are only mounted to a surface of the electronic device (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, where the entire assembled conventional voice-coil haptic exciter is mounted on the underside of a touch plate of a switch). The typical design uses a soft plastic housing that serves as a bobbin for the coil, but also provides flexible plastic arms to suspend the magnet in the magnetic field created by the coil. As the coil is energized with an alternating current, the magnet moves up and down. That motion is coupled via the arms to the housing. The housing is typically attached to a surface of the electronic device to transfer the vibration ultimately to the user. The coil is generally connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) of the electronic device either by electrical wires or a connector.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, cost savings can be realized as well as reduced space usage if characteristics of the mechanical design of the electronic device are used to achieve some of the elements of the voice-coil haptic exciter. Therefore, systems and methods are desired that overcome challenges in the conventional art, some of which are described herein. For example, a switch assembly with a voice-coil haptic exciter that uses characteristics of the mechanical design of the switch assembly as elements of the voice-coil haptic exciter is desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed and described herein are systems and methods of using characteristics of the mechanical design of the electronic device to achieve some of the elements of the voice-coil haptic exciter. For example, an existing PCB and touch plate of a touch switch with haptic feedback can be used as a suspension for the coil and the magnet. The mounting surface, the magnet itself, may be coupled directly to the touch plate, which is where the vibration is desired. The coil may be soldered directly to the PCB as a surface mounted component, which eliminates a connector or manual wiring/soldering operations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One implementation of the present disclosure is a switch assembly that provides haptic feedback that includes a printed circuit board (PCB), the PCB having a first planar surface that faces in a first direction and a second planar surface that faces in a second direction, the second direction being opposite from the first direction, a touch plate, the touch plate having a first surface that faces in the first direction and a second surface that faces in the second direction, where the first surface of the touch plate is proximate the second planar surface of the PCB, and a haptic exciter. The haptic exciter includes a conductive coil of wire having a hollow inner core and a magnet that is at least partially disposed within the hollow inner core of the coil of wire such that the magnet alternatively moves in the first and second directions as an alternating current passes through the conductive coil of wire. In some implementations, the conductive coil of wire is mechanically affixed to the PCB. In some implementations, the magnet is directly or indirectly disposed adjacent the first surface of the touch plate</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional advantages will be set forth in part in the description which follows or may be learned by practice.

The assembly <b>200</b> includes a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>202</b>. The PCB <b>202</b> has a first planar surface <b>204</b> that faces in a first direction and a second planar surface <b>206</b> that faces in a second direction, the second direction being opposite from the first direction. The assembly further includes a touch plate <b>208</b>. The touch plate <b>208</b> has a first surface <b>210</b> that faces in the first direction and a second surface <b>212</b> that faces in the second direction. The first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> is proximate the second planar surface <b>206</b> of the PCB <b>202</b>. The assembly <b>200</b> further includes an integrated haptic exciter <b>214</b>. The haptic exciter <b>214</b> comprises a conductive coil of wire <b>216</b> (e.g., copper magnet wire, and the like) and a magnet <b>218</b>. The coil of wire <b>216</b> has a hollow inner core, and at least a portion of the magnet <b>218</b> is disposed within the hollow inner core of the coil of wire <b>216</b> such that the magnet <b>218</b> alternatively moves in the first and second directions as an alternating current passes through the conductive coil of wire <b>216</b> creating a magnetic field. Rather than being a total separate device, the haptic exciter <b>214</b> is integrated into the switch assembly <b>200</b> as the conductive coil of wire <b>216</b> is mechanically affixed to the PCB <b>202</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the magnet <b>218</b> is directly or indirectly disposed adjacent the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b>. For example, the magnet <b>218</b> may be in contact with the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> and, in some instances, the magnet <b>218</b> may be affixed to the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b>. For example, the magnet <b>218</b> may be affixed to the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> using one or more of glue, adhesives, fasteners, compression fit, welding, molding, and the like. The movement of the magnet <b>218</b> causes a palpable vibration and/or sound in the touch plate <b>208</b>. In effect, the touch plate <b>208</b> becomes the voice cone of the haptic exciter <b>214</b>. As such, at least a portion of the touch plate <b>208</b> may be comprised of flexible material. For example, the outer edge of the touch plate <b>208</b> may be comprised of flexible material such that the central portion of the touch plate <b>208</b> is &#x201c;suspended&#x201d; by the flexible material.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Generally, the conductive coil of wire <b>216</b> is in electrical communication with a circuit on the PCB <b>202</b>; however, it is also contemplated that the conductive coil of wire <b>216</b> may be in electrical communication with circuits that are not included on the PCB <b>202</b> while the coil <b>216</b> is still physically mounted to the PCB <b>202</b>. For example, the haptic exciter <b>214</b> may include a flexible cable connector (not shown) that has a first end that is coupled to the haptic exciter <b>214</b> and a second end that is coupled to the PCB <b>202</b>. The flexible cable connector minimizes or eliminates transmission of the vibration from haptic exciter <b>214</b> to the PCB <b>202</b> while allowing the haptic exciter <b>214</b> to be electrically coupled to the PCB <b>202</b>. In one non-limiting example, the flexible cable connector may be a zero insertion force (ZIF)-type connector. In other implementations, the haptic exciter <b>214</b> is coupled to the PCB <b>202</b> with wires that are coupled to each via soldering or other suitable coupling mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an implementation where the magnet <b>218</b> is in indirect contact with the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b>. For example, the magnet <b>218</b> may be in indirect contact with the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> through a spacer <b>220</b>. As such, the spacer <b>220</b> may be in contact with the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> and/or may be affixed to the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b>. For example, the spacer <b>220</b> may be affixed to the first surface <b>210</b> of the touch plate <b>208</b> using one or more of glue, adhesives, fasteners, compression fit, welding, molding, and the like.
