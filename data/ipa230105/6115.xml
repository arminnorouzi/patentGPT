For example, the first connection line CNL1 may be disposed to bypass one end (or first end) of the sub-scan line SS1, and the second connection line CNL2 may be disposed to bypass the other end (or second end) of the sub-scan line SS1. Therefore, in case that the first and second connection lines CNL1 and CNL2 are disposed to bypass the sub-scan line SS1 to not overlap it, it is possible to reduce the parasitic capacitance between the first and second connection lines CNL1 and CNL2 and the sub-scan line SS1, so that excellent image quality may be provided as described above.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">The third pixel circuit SPXC3 may be electrically connected to the third light emitting part EMU3.
