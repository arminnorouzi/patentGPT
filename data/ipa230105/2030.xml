The fixed wing has a leading edge extending along a spanwise direction of the fixed wing and an upper surface forming a suction side of the fixed wing. The high-lift device is movable between a retracted position and a deployed position and attached to the leading edge of the fixed wing via a first support and a second support. The first support is spaced apart from the second support in the spanwise direction. In the retracted position a trailing edge of the high-lift device is in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing. The hold-down arrangement is arranged between the first support and the second support and comprises a first hold-down element attached to the high-lift device and a second hold-down element attached to the fixed wing. The hold-down arrangement is configured such that the first hold-down element only contacts the second hold-down element when the high-lift device is in the retracted position. In the retracted position of the high-lift device the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the fixed wing deforms or bends in the spanwise direction. The invention is further directed to a hold-down arrangement and an aircraft comprising a wing.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">High-lift devices such as slats are commonly mounted to a leading edge of a fixed wing of an aircraft using a first support and a second support. For example, slats are mounted using a master slat track and a slave slat track. Both slat tracks are driven, however only the master slat track fixes the position of the in a spanwise direction of the wing whereas the slave slat track does not fix the slat position in the spanwise direction but allows a spanwise displacement of the slat relative to the slave slat track. For aerodynamic reasons the slat is mounted to the fixed wing such that in the retracted position an upper surface of the slat extends flush with an upper surface of the fixed wing which forms the suction side of the wing. The slat is, in particular, arranged such that there is no gap between the upper surface of the fixed wing and the trailing edge of the slat, i.e., the trailing edge is in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing, and the shape of the slat in the spanwise direction of the wing generally follows the shape of the fixed wing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the slat is mounted to the fixed wing in two points only which are spaced from one another in the spanwise direction of the wing, bending or deformation of the fixed wing along the spanwise direction is not or only partly transmitted to the slat. This may result in the trailing edge of the slat not being in continuous or extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing or even completely detaching from the upper surface. Also, the shape of the slat in the spanwise direction of the wing does not conform to the shape of the fixed wing anymore.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to ensure that the trailing edge of the high-lift device remains in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing when the high-lift device is in the retracted position, a hold-down arrangement is provided between the first support and the second support which prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface and forces the slat to deform with the fixed wing. To this end the hold-down arrangement comprises a first hold-down element attached to the high-lift device and a second hold-down element attached to the fixed wing. The hold-down elements are only in contact with each other when the slat is in the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a wing tip of the fixed wing bends upwards during flight, for example, due to the lift generated by the fixed wing, the second hold-down element pushes downwards against the first hold-down element due to the deformation of the fixed wing and forces the high-lift device to deform with the fixed wing. Thus, in essence a third contact point between the high-lift device and the fixed wing is created in addition to the first and second support which in the retracted position ensures that the high-lift device is forced to deform with the fixed wing so that the upper surface of the high-lift device remains flush with the upper surface of the fixed wing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The transfer of the spanwise deformation from the fixed wing to the high-lift device by means of the hold-down arrangement requires a high-lift device that is able to withstand the same deformation as the fixed wing and withstand the additional loads generated by the hold-down arrangement. Thus, a high-lift device being forced to deform with the fixed wing and, thereby, provide the necessary aerodynamic performance has to be able to be more robust and in consequence heavier than a high-lift device that does not follow the spanwise deformation of the fixed wing. Also, the fixed wing has to be more robust as it has to bear the additional loads that are required for deforming the high-lift device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved wing, an improved hold-down arrangement and an improved aircraft.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The problem underlying the present invention is solved by a wing according to claim <b>1</b>, a hold-down arrangement according to claim <b>11</b> and an aircraft according to claim <b>12</b>. Preferred embodiments of the wing according to the present invention are the subject matter of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect the problem underlying the present invention is solved by a wing for an aircraft comprising a fixed wing, a high lift device and a hold-down arrangement. The fixed wing has a leading edge extending along a spanwise direction of the fixed wing and an upper surface forming a suction side of the fixed wing. The high-lift device is movable between a retracted position and a deployed position and attached to the leading edge of the fixed wing via a first support and a second support. The first support is spaced apart from the second support in the spanwise direction. In the retracted position a trailing edge of the high-lift device is in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing. The hold-down arrangement is arranged between the first support and the second support and comprises a first hold-down element attached to the high-lift device and a second hold-down element attached to the fixed wing. The hold-down arrangement is configured such that the first hold-down element is in contact with the second hold-down element when the high-lift device is in the retracted position but is not in contact with the second hold-down in element when the high-lift device is in the deployed position. In the retracted position of the high-lift device the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the fixed wing deforms in the spanwise direction. One of the first hold-down element and the second hold-down element is a load-limited hold-down element which has at least a first stable state and a second state. The load-limited hold-down element is configured such that the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the first stable state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, that the hold-down arrangement does not prevent the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the second state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, and that the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the first stable state to the second state when loads transmitted through the load-limited hold-down element for preventing the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing exceed an operational threshold.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other words, the present wing for an aircraft is, for example, a main wing with a fixed wing and a high-lift device in form of a slat. The fixed wing has a leading edge which extends along but not necessarily parallel to the spanwise direction of the fixed wing. An upper surface of the fixed wing forms a suction side of the fixed wing and may also be referred to as a suction surface of the fixed wing. The fixed wing extends in the spanwise direction between an inward or inboard end which may, for example, be adapted to be attached to a fuselage of an aircraft, and a wing tip which forms the outer or outboard end of the fixed wing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the aircraft is in flight, the lift created by the fixed wing deforms the wing. In particular, the wing is curved upwards such that the wing tip moves upwards relative to the inward end of the fixed wing. The amount by which the fixed wing bends or deforms depends on various factors among which are speed of the aircraft and weather conditions. For example, the deformation of the fixed wing increases considerably when an aircraft accelerated from take-off speed to cruise speed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The high-lift device attached to the wing is mounted to the wing using only two supports, a first support and a second support. The supports which may, for example, be slat tracks are used to move the high-lift device between a retracted and one or more deployed positions. When the high-lift device is in the retracted position, its trailing edge shall for aerodynamic reasons be in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing such that an upper surface of the high-lift device extends flush with the upper surface of the fixed wing, i.e., such that no gap exists between the upper surface of the fixed wing and the trailing edge of the high-lift device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As previously discussed, due to the changing curvature of the fixed wing during flight and the fact that the high-lift device is only mounted in two points to the fixed wing, the slat does not deform with the fixed wing in the spanwise direction. Hence, a hold-down arrangement comprising a first and a second hold down element is used to provide a third contact point between the high-lift device and the fixed wing when the high-lift device has been retracted, i.e., is in the retracted position. The first hold-down element is attached or mounted to the high-lift device and the second hold-down element is mounted to the fixed wing such that the first hold-down element and the second hold-down element only come into contact or engage when the high-lift device is in the retracted position. By means of the hold-down arrangement it is ensured that a relative downward deformation of the fixed wing in the spanwise direction between the first and the second support of the high-lift device corresponding to an upward movement of the wing tip of the fixed wing relative to the fixed wing's inward end is transferred to the high-lift device such that the high-lift device follows the curvature or deformation of the fixed wing. As a result, the trailing edge of the high-lift device constantly maintains extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, according to the present invention one of the first and the second hold-down elements is a load-limited hold-down element that has a first stable state and a second state. The second state may also be stable but could also be a metastable state. As will be set out in the following paragraphs in more detail the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the first stable state to the second state under sufficiently high loads.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The load-limited hold-down element is initially in the first state which is a stable state. While the load-limited hold-down element is the first stable state, the hold-down arrangement is configured to prevent the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing while the high-lift device is in the retracted position. To this end, a load path is formed by the hold-down arrangement between the fixed wing and the high-lift device that transfers any relative downward deformation of the fixed wing in the spanwise direction between the first support and the second support to the high-lift device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, when the load or force transmitted through the load-limited hold-down element exceeds an operational threshold, the load-limited hold-down element transitions or deforms from the first stable state to the second state. The deformation of the load-limited hold-down element is reversible. When the load-limited hold-down element transitions to the second state its dimensions change such that the hold-down arrangement can no longer prevent the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing. Due to the deformation of the load-limited hold-down element, the load path between the fixed wing and the high-lift device is interrupted and deformations of the fixed wing along the spanwise direction are not further transmitted to the high lift device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The operational threshold may, for example, be chosen such that the load-limited hold-down element does not transition from the first stable state to the second state when the spanwise deformation of the fixed wing is within limits that are experienced during regular flights but changes its shape when deformations occur that are only experienced in extreme corners of the flight envelope in which the high-lift device has to bear very high loads due to the forced deformation and the increased drag due to the trailing edge of the high-lift device detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing is tolerable. In any case the operational threshold is chosen such that the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the first stable state to the second state well-before the spanwise deformation of the fixed wing reaches operational limits.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thereby, the loads transmitted through the hold-down arrangement are advantageously limited to loads occurring during regular flight conditions for which it is essential to keep the trailing edge of the high-lift device in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing to improve the aerodynamic performance of the fixed wing. However, during rare and extreme flight situations in which the curvature of the fixed wing along the spanwise direction exceeds commonly occurring curvatures, the load-limited hold-down element transitions to the second state due to the forces acting thereon. In such a rare case aerodynamic performance of the wing are of less concern and it is instead preferred to reduce the loads acting on the high-lift device or, in other words, to limit the force deformation of the high-lift device. As the maximum deformation of the high-lift device is reduced as compared to a rigid or non-deforming hold-down element, the high-lift device may be constructed less robust. This may, in particular, advantageously allow reducing the weight of the high-lift device. Further, since the load on the fixed wing is also reduced as it does not have to bear the additional load that is required to deform the high-lift device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The operational threshold may, for example, be chosen such that the load-limited hold-down element transitions form the first stable state to the second state when a load factor exceeds a value of 2.0, preferably of 1.75 and most preferably of 1.3, where the load factor is defined as the ratio of lift of an aircraft to its weight.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment the second hold-down element is the load-limited hold-down element. In other words, it is preferred that the load-limited hold-down element is the hold-down element mounted to the fixed wing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment the load-limited hold-down element is a disk spring. Disk springs may also be referred to as cup springs, plate springs or Belleville spring washers. A disk spring may have the shape of a truncated cone. It is relatively rigid up to the operational threshold above which it suddenly deforms and transitions into the second state.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Using a disk spring as load-limited hold-down element has the advantage that the disk spring is a simple element from a constructional perspective, it is easy to install and very tolerant against loads acting sideways.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, the load-limited hold-down element may be a buckling element formed by two contact plates and a one or more of strip-shaped or plate-shaped connecting elements extending in parallel to one another between the contact plates. In the first stable state the plurality of connecting elements are configured to hold the contact plates spaced apart from one another at a first distance. The connecting elements are configured to buckle when loads transmitted through the load-limited hold-down element for preventing the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing exceed the operational threshold such that the buckling element transitions to the second state in which the contact plates are held spaced apart from one another by the connecting elements at a second distance, wherein the second distance is smaller than the first distance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the connecting elements are configured such that buckling of the connecting elements is an elastic deformation. This allows the buckling element to return to its original first stable state after it transitioned to the second state. Thus, the load-limited hold-down element would be reusable even after an initial deformation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a preferred embodiment the load-limited hold-down element is configured such that the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the second state to the first stable state when a load acting on the load-limited hold down element exceeds a reset threshold, wherein the reset threshold is lower than the operational threshold. In other words, less force is required to trigger the load-limited hold-down element to transition back from the second state to the first state.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment the hold-down arrangement comprises a biasing means for biasing the load-limited hold-down element towards the first stable position. A biasing load generated by the biasing means preferably exceeds the reset threshold. The biasing means is preferably formed as a spring. Providing a biasing means enables the load-limited hold-down element to automatically transition back from the second state to the first stable state after an initial transition has taken place. To this end, the biasing means is preferably dimensioned such that the force acting on the load-limited hold-down element exceeds the reset threshold so that the hold-down arrangement may be immediately functional again once the high loads that trigger the initial deformation are no longer acting on the hold-down arrangement. Thus, the hold-down arrangement advantageously prevents high-loads on the high-lift device due to excessive forced deformation of the fixed wing and at the same time ensures improved aerodynamic performance once deformation of the fixed wing is within the limits tolerable by the high-lift device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is further preferred if the second state is a metastable state. In a metastable state only little force is limited to trigger a transition of the load-limited hold-down element out of the second state and back to the first stable state.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment the high-lift device is a slat, wherein the first support is preferably a master slat track and the second support is preferably a slave slat track.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a second aspect the problem underlying the present invention is solved by a hold-down arrangement for a wing of an aircraft. The wing comprises a fixed wing and a high-lift device, wherein the wing has a leading edge extending along a spanwise direction of the fixed wing and an upper surface forming a suction side of the fixed wing and wherein the high-lift device is movable between a retracted position and a deployed position and attached to the leading edge of the fixed wing via a first support and a second support, wherein the first support is spaced apart from the second support in the spanwise direction and wherein in the retracted position a trailing edge of the high-lift device is in extended contact with the upper surface of the fixed wing. The hold-down arrangement comprises a first hold-down element attachable to the high-lift device of the wing and a second hold-down element attachable to the fixed wing of the wing such that the first hold-down element is in contact with the second hold-down element when the high-lift device is in the retracted position but is not in contact when the high-lift device is in the deployed position, that the hold-down arrangement is arranged between the first support and the second support of the wing and that in the retracted position of the high-lift device the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the fixed wing is deformed in the spanwise direction. One of the first hold-down element and the second hold-down element is a load-limited hold-down element which has at least a first stable state and a second state. The load-limited hold-down element is configured such that the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the first stable state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, that the hold-down arrangement does not prevent the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the second state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, and that the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the first stable state to the second state when loads transmitted through the load-limited hold-down element for preventing the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing exceed an operational threshold.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The hold-down arrangement may be configured in the same way as the hold-down arrangement which has been described as part of the preferred embodiments of a wing for an aircraft. For the sake of brevity, details of these embodiments are not repeated here but reference is made to the preceding description. The advantages of the hold-down arrangement correspond to the advantages of the respective embodiments of a wing for an aircraft.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a preferred exemplary aspect the problem underlying the present invention is solved by using a hold-down arrangement in a wing of an aircraft.

One of the first hold-down element and the second hold-down element is a load-limited hold-down element which has at least a first stable state and a second state. The load-limited hold-down element is configured such that the hold-down arrangement prevents the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the first stable state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, that the hold-down arrangement does not prevent the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing when the load-limited hold-down element is in the second state and the high-lift device is in the retracted position, and that the load-limited hold-down element transitions from the first stable state to the second state when loads transmitted through the load-limited hold-down element for preventing the trailing edge of the high-lift device from detaching from the upper surface of the fixed wing exceed an operational threshold.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The hold-down arrangement used in the wing may in particular correspond to the different embodiments of hold-down arrangements previously described.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Finally, in a further aspect an aircraft comprising a fuselage and a wing as in the previously described embodiments solves the problem underlying the present invention.

The high-lift devices <b>15</b> are mounted to the fixed wing <b>7</b> such that their respective trailing edges <b>22</b> (only visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) are in extended contact with the upper surface <b>19</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b>. Since <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show the wing <b>5</b> from below, the trailing edges <b>22</b> of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> are not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. However, for the sake of completeness it is noted that a trailing edge <b>22</b> of a high-lift device <b>15</b> in extended contact with the upper surface <b>19</b> of a fixed wing <b>7</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b></figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> is mounted to the leading edge <b>17</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> via a first support <b>23</b> and a second support <b>25</b>. The supports <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> are spaced apart from one another in the spanwise direction <b>9</b> of the wing <b>5</b> and enable the movement of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> between the deployed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and the retracted position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. One of the first and second supports <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, for example, the respective first supports <b>23</b> may be driven via a drive unit (not shown) for moving the high-lift devices or slats <b>15</b>. The second supports <b>25</b> may be not driven such that they only follow the motion induced by the first support <b>23</b>. In such an embodiment where the high-lift devices <b>15</b> are slats <b>16</b>, the first supports <b>23</b> may also be referred to as master slat tracks <b>23</b> and the second supports <b>25</b> may also be referred to as slave slat tracks <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As previously discussed, the lift and drag on the fixed wing <b>7</b> as well as other motions of the aircraft <b>1</b> deform the fixed wing <b>7</b> along the spanwise direction <b>9</b> of the wing <b>5</b>. As each high-lift device <b>15</b> is only attached via two supports <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> to the fixed wing <b>7</b>, the deformation of the fixed wing <b>7</b> along the spanwise direction is not transmitted to the high-lift device. In particular, any upwards bending of the wing tip <b>13</b> caused by the increasing lift of the wing <b>5</b> with increasing velocity of the aircraft <b>1</b> would cause the fixed wing <b>7</b> to move downwards relative to the trailing edge <b>22</b> of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> in the region between the first and second supports <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>. This may cause the respective trailing edges <b>22</b> of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> to detach from the upper surface <b>19</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> so that the upper surfaces <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> and the high-lift devices <b>15</b> are no longer flush and the aerodynamic performance of the wing <b>5</b> are affected negatively. In particular, the drag may be increased.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Hence, for each of the high-lift devices <b>15</b> a hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> is provided which comprises a first hold-down element <b>29</b> attached to the respective high-lift device <b>15</b> and a second hold-down element <b>31</b> attached to the fixed wing <b>7</b>. Only the hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> of the high-lift device <b>15</b> in the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> is shown. The hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> is arranged between first and second supports <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> of the respective high-lift device <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, when the high-lift devices <b>15</b> are in their respective deployed position, the first hold-down element <b>29</b> attached to the high-lift device <b>15</b> is not in contact with the second hold-down element <b>31</b> attached to the fixed wing <b>7</b>. However, when the high-lift device <b>15</b> is in the retracted position, the first hold-down element <b>29</b> comes into contact with the second hold-down element <b>31</b>. In other words, the first hold-down element <b>29</b> is only in contact with the second hold-down element <b>31</b> when the high-lift device <b>15</b> to which the first hold-down element <b>29</b> is mounted is in its retracted position. It should be pointed out that for technical reason a first contact will need to be established before the high-lift device <b>15</b> has reached its final retracted position. However, the contact is essentially limited to the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once the first and second hold-down elements <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> have come into contact or have been brought into engagement with one another, the second hold-down element <b>31</b> holds the first hold-down element <b>29</b> down and thus transmits any relative downward deformation of the fixed wing <b>7</b> to the high-lift device <b>15</b>. Thereby, the high-lift device <b>15</b> is forced to deform with the fixed wing <b>7</b> and the trailing edge <b>22</b> is prevented from detaching from the upper surface <b>20</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to limit the forced spanwise deformation of the high-lift devices <b>15</b>, the second hold-down element <b>31</b> is formed as a load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> which transitions from a first stable state to a second state when the forces or loads transmitted through the hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> from the fixed wing <b>7</b> to the high-lift device <b>15</b> exceed an operational threshold. The operational threshold is chosen such that the load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> remains in the first stable state and the hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> prevents the trailing edge <b>22</b> of the high-lift device <b>15</b> from detaching from the upper surface <b>19</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> during regular flight conditions and common flight maneuvers. When the loads exceed the operational threshold, i.e., reach the structural or operational limits of the slats <b>16</b>, for example, when the aircraft <b>1</b> operates in corners of the flight envelope, i.e., during extreme flight conditions, the load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> transitions from the first stable state to the second state which may, for example, be metastable.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> has transitioned to the second state, the hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> does no longer force the high-lift device <b>15</b> to deform with the fixed wing <b>7</b> and thereby prevents the trailing edge <b>22</b> of the high-lift device <b>15</b> from detaching from the upper surface <b>19</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> when the latter deforms in the spanwise direction <b>9</b>. Hence, both the high-lift device <b>15</b> and the fixed wing have to bear less load and may, therefore, be designed less robust which may provide a production cost and/or weight benefit.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a more detailed exemplary embodiment of a wing <b>5</b> comprising an exemplary embodiment of a hold-down arrangement <b>27</b>. The wing <b>5</b> may, for example, be the wing <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> or <b>3</b></figref>. Only a partial section through the wing <b>5</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which may, for example, be taken along the dashed line <b>33</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. With regard to features of the wing <b>5</b> not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The wing <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also comprises a fixed wing <b>7</b> to which a high-lift device <b>15</b> in form of a slat <b>16</b> is mounted using two supports (not shown). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the slat <b>16</b> is shown in the retracted position in which its trailing edge <b>22</b> is in extended contact with the upper surface <b>19</b> of the fixed wing <b>7</b> such that the upper surfaces <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> of the high-lift device <b>15</b> and the fixed wing <b>7</b> form a continuous surface.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The wing <b>5</b> comprises a hold-down arrangement <b>27</b> with a first and a second hold down element <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>. The first hold-down element <b>29</b> is an adjustable contact pad <b>34</b> which is mounted to a hold-down rib <b>35</b> of the slat <b>15</b>. The contact pad <b>34</b> is adjustable in that its height relative to the hold-down rib <b>35</b> can be adjusted to adapt the position of the slat <b>15</b> in its retracted position. The first hold-down element <b>29</b> is in contact with a second hold-down element <b>31</b> that is also part of the hold-down arrangement <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second hold-down element <b>31</b> is a load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> that is mounted to the fixed wing via a rib <b>37</b>. The load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> is formed as a disk spring <b>38</b>. It has a first stable state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> with continuous lines and a second metastable state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> with dashed lines. The load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> transitions from the first stable state to the second state and changes its shape when a load acting through the load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> onto the first hold-down element <b>29</b> exceeds an operational threshold.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A disk spring <b>38</b> is used as load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as the disk spring <b>38</b> is very rigid until the operational threshold is reached when it suddenly deforms into the second state. Due to the sudden deformation, the load transfer from the fixed wing <b>7</b> to the high-lift device <b>15</b> is immediately interrupted. This advantageously stops any further deformation of the high-lift device <b>15</b> and prevents high loads due to excessive deformation along the spanwise direction <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further comprises a biasing means <b>39</b> in form of a spring <b>39</b> which biases the load-limited hold-down element <b>32</b> towards the first stable position. In detail, the biasing means <b>39</b> exerts a biasing force onto the disk spring <b>38</b> when the disk spring <b>38</b> has deformed into the second state. The biasing force exerted by the biasing means <b>39</b> urges the disk spring <b>38</b> back to the first stable state. As it exceeds a reset threshold that is lower than the operational threshold, the disk spring <b>38</b> will automatically return to the first stable state.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>show another exemplary embodiment of a wing <b>5</b> comprising an exemplary embodiment of a hold-down arrangement <b>27</b>.
