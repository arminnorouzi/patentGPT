The mover includes at least one stationary contact and at least one movable contact that abuts onto or separates from the at least one stationary contact. The plunger moves the mover, and the insulator electrically insulates the mover and the plunger from each other. That is, the insulator prevents a current from flowing toward the plunger.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An increase in the current flowing through the mover in such an electromagnetic relay device may result in the mover being likely to become higher in temperature due to Joule heat based on the current. A high-temperature mover may cause the insulator abutting onto the high-temperature mover to become higher in temperature. This may cause deformation of the insulator. A deformation of the insulator may cause a detrimental effect on operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the circumstances set forth above, one aspect of the present disclosure seeks to provide electromagnetic relay devices, each of which is capable of preventing a detrimental effect due to a high-temperature mover on operations of the corresponding one of the electromagnetic relay devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first exemplary measure of the present disclosure is an electromagnetic relay device. The electromagnetic relay device includes a mover including a movable contact movable to abut onto and separate from a stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a plunger configured to cause the mover to reciprocate to accordingly cause the movable contact to abut onto or separate from the stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a solenoid unit configured to cause the plunger to reciprocate, and an insulator having a heat-resistant temperature and arranged between the mover and the plunger.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The electromagnetic relay device additionally includes a heat-resistant member having a heat-resistant temperature and interposed between the insulator and the mover. The plunger enables indirect abutment onto the mover through the insulator and the heat-resistant member. The heat-resistant temperature of the heat-resistant member is set to be higher than the heat-resistant temperature of the insulator.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second exemplary measure of the present disclosure is an electromagnetic relay device. The electromagnetic relay device includes a mover including a movable contact movable to abut onto and separate from a stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a plunger configured to cause the mover to reciprocate to accordingly cause the movable contact to abut onto or separate from the stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a solenoid unit configured to cause the plunger to reciprocate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electromagnetic relay device includes a heat-resistant insulator interposed between the plunger and the mover. The plunger enables indirect abutment onto the mover through the heat-resistant insulator. The heat-resistant insulator is made of at least one of glass and ceramic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The heat-resistant member of the electromagnetic relay device according to the first exemplary measure is interposed between the insulator and the mover. This suppresses an increase in the temperature of the insulator even if the temperature of the mover becomes high due to an increase in a current flowing in the electromagnetic relay device. This therefore prevents a detrimental effect due to the high-temperature mover on operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The heat-resistant insulator of the electromagnetic relay device <b>1</b> according to the second exemplary measure is interposed between the plunger and the mover to electrically insulate therebetween. This results in the heat-resistant insulator, which has heat resistance property, being unlikely to deform even if the temperature of the mover becomes high due to an increase in a current flowing in the electromagnetic relay device. This therefore prevents a detrimental effect due to the high-temperature mover on operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, each of the first and second exemplary measures offers the corresponding electromagnetic relay device, which is capable of preventing a detrimental effect due to a high-temperature mover on operations of the corresponding electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Note that each parenthesized reference character assigned to a corresponding element in claims described later represents a relationship between the corresponding element and a corresponding specific measure described in embodiments described later, and therefore the parenthesized reference characters used in the claims should not be interpreted implying limitation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other aspects of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description of an embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay device according to the first embodiment with a heat-resistant member abutting onto a mover;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic relay device according to the first embodiment with the heat-resistant member separated from the mover;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay device according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay device according to the third embodiment with the heat-resistant member separated from the mover;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic relay device according to the third embodiment with the heat-resistant member abutting onto the mover;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay device according to the fourth embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay device according to the fifth embodiment with a large-diameter portion abutting onto a heat-resistant insulator; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an axial cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic relay device according to the fifth embodiment with the large-diameter portion separating from the heat-resistant insulator.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The following describes an electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the electromagnetic relay device <b>1</b> includes a mover <b>5</b>, a plunger <b>2</b>, a solenoid unit <b>4</b> for causing the plunger <b>2</b> to reciprocate, and first and second stationary contacts <b>61</b>.

The magnetic flux generates magnetic attractive force between the movable core <b>43</b> and the stationary core <b>42</b>.

This causes the electromagnetic relay device <b>1</b> to be switched on.

The switched-on state of the electromagnetic relay device <b>1</b> maintains the abutment end surface <b>322</b> of the heat-resistant member <b>32</b> in a separate state from the rearward major surface of the mover <b>5</b>, resulting in a clearance G between the rearward major surface of the plate-like member of the mover <b>5</b> and the abutment end surface <b>322</b> of the heat-resistant member <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, de-energization of the magnetizing coil <b>41</b>, which is in an energized state, causes the magnetic attractive force between the stationary core <b>42</b> and the movable core <b>43</b> to disappear. Because the biasing force of the return spring <b>13</b> is set to be larger than the biasing force of the pressure spring <b>14</b> according to the first embodiment, the return spring <b>13</b> causes the movable core <b>43</b> to move in the forward direction due to no magnetic attractive force between the movable core <b>43</b> and the stationary core <b>42</b>.
