Along with the increase of interest in health, exercise has been attracting more attention as a means to maintain health.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, electronic devices have been developed in various manners to measure and use bio-signals, and provide various services for managing a user's health or checking a health state by measuring the bio-signals. With the development of technology, the types of sensors mounted on electronic devices to measure bio-signals are diversifying, and various functions use the bio-signals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device for measuring oxygen saturation in a user's blood by sensing the user's bio-signals. Oxygen saturation may be an index that indicates the oxygen-binding ability of hemoglobin included in the red blood cells of blood. Expressed as a percentage, an oxygen saturation is the ratio of the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin. The oxygen saturation value may be used for diagnosing health conditions such as respiratory and blood circulation. In daily life, the normal range of oxygen saturation may be about 90% to 100%. When an oxygen saturation is below about 90%, it may be considered lower than the normal range. Since the oxygen saturation may vary according to a user's various situations and environments (e.g., the user's condition), it may be difficult to diagnose the user's health condition using only the normal range of oxygen saturation in daily life. When various measurement periods and reference oxygen saturation ranges are set based on the user's various situations and environments, oxygen saturation suitable for the user's various situations and environments as well as the user's daily life may be used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide method for a measurement period and a reference range of oxygen saturation are identified based on a user context including bio-information, environmental information, and medical information about a user, and an oxygen saturation is measured based on the identified measurement period and reference range of oxygen saturation, so that oxygen saturation may be used in various conditions of the user as well as in the daily life of the user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide an apparatus for upon occurrence of a specified event (hospital entry (or visit) or a user input), an oxygen saturation-related disease history may be identified based on medical information about a user, a measurement period and a reference range of oxygen saturation may be identified based on the disease history of the user, and an oxygen saturation may be measured and notified based on the identified measurement period and reference range of oxygen saturation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide an apparatus for upon occurrence of a specified event (hospital entry (or visit) or a user input), the result of an oxygen saturation-related medical treatment may be identified based on medical information about a user, a measurement period and a reference range of oxygen saturation may be identified based on the medical treatment result of the user, and an oxygen saturation may be monitored based on the identified measurement period and reference range of oxygen saturation and provided based on the result of the monitoring.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.

For example, because a respiratory patient may have oxygen saturation much lower than that of a healthy person in an exercise state, the processor <b>320</b> may change the oxygen saturation measurement period to a shorter measurement period in the exercise state than in the daily life state, and the reference oxygen saturation range to a lower reference range in the exercise state than in the daily life state, for the respiratory patient, and perform intensive monitoring. In addition, in the state where a measured altitude value is higher than a specified altitude value (the high altitude state), oxygen saturation may significantly affect the respiration of the respiratory patient. Accordingly, the processor <b>320</b> may change the oxygen saturation measurement period to a shorter measurement period in the high altitude state than in a low altitude state (a state where a measured altitude value is not higher than the specified altitude value), and the reference oxygen saturation range to a lower reference range in the high altitude state than in the daily life state, and may perform intensive monitoring.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Further, the respiratory patient may also have oxygen saturation much lower than that of the healthy person in the sleep state.

In addition, a sharp decrease in oxygen saturation during sleep may be a situation that requires a treatment for a respiratory disease. When the oxygen saturation is less than or equal to specified oxygen saturation during sleep, the processor <b>320</b> according to an embodiment may transmit oxygen saturation information (or a request for a treatment) to an external server (e.g., a hospital) and output guidance information recommending a hospital visit through the display <b>360</b> or the speaker visually or audibly.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">In operation <b>640</b>, the processor <b>320</b> according to an embodiment may provide a notification or a feedback according to the oxygen saturation measurement result based on the identified (or selected, determined, or changed) oxygen saturation measurement period and reference range.
