No. 16/026,410, filed Jul. 3, 2018, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/528,652, filed Jul. 5, 2017, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments relate generally to medical examinations and biopsies of the body and more particularly to devices, systems and methods for lung and other biopsies including visual or photographical inspection.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. There were 180,000 Medicare/Medicaid admissions for bronchial or lung cancer in 2010. In 2013, Centers for Medicare &#x26; Medicaid Services paid for 46,000 bronchoscopic lung biopsy procedures. Of these procedures, 3,400 procedures were performed using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), and 15,300 procedures were performed using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">ENB can be used to track tools within the body using radio waves. Antennas are placed on the patient's body, which receive a signal emitted from the tools inserted into the body. The position of the tool is superimposed onto a CT image of the patient to provide feedback to the physician on the location of the tool. There are at least two ENB systems currently on the market. One such system, the SuperDimension system, is cost-prohibitive for many clinics, at several hundred thousand dollars per unit. A competitor to SuperDimension is the Veran Medical EndoBronchial guidance system, which gained FDA clearance in 2009. The SuperDimension system has a steerable guide catheter with position sensor that is smaller than a bronchoscope. Once the guide catheter is placed, a tool can be deployed through the guide catheter. The Veran Medical system adds some additional features, and supplies a suite of tools that all include the position sensing element at the tip of the tool. They enable the switching from an endobronchial approach to a transcutaneous approach in a single setup. The Veran Medical system likewise can also be cost-prohibited to many clinics or hospitals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If a transbronchial approach cannot be used to obtain a biopsy, a transthoracic needle can be used to acquire a sample. In 2013, 40,000 transthoracic needle biopsies were paid for by Centers for Medicare &#x26; Medicaid Services. The risk of pnuemothorax for transthoracic needle biopsies is between 9 and 54%, however.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EBUS avoids the necessity for use of a transthoracic needle in some instances, where the object to be biopsied is located on a main bronchial tube having a relatively large diameter. EBUS involves using an ultrasonic sensor on a bronchoscope to determine when the bronchoscope is passing by an object having different density or acoustical properties from the rest of the lung. For example, a tumor or nodule can be detected by the difference in acoustical response. The bronchoscope can also include a biopsy needle, such that the detected tumor, nodule, or other object can be biopsied.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">EBUS can be implemented on bronchoscopes that are used to biopsy tumors that are in the larger bronchial tubes of the lung. A typical bronchoscope, having a 5.3 mm standard diameter, cannot reach the periphery of the lung, where the bronchial tubes are less than 5.3 mm wide. If the object is adjacent to a large bronchial tube, the EBUS can be routed to it. The edges of the tumor can be seen in the EBUS image generated from ultrasound data.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing ENB systems are expensive, and often cost-prohibitive for smaller hospitals or clinics where they would not be used routinely. Furthermore, use of transthoracic needles can result in severe complications such as a collapsed lung. EBUS, while less expensive than ENB, is only suitable when the object to be biopsied is located on a main bronchial path having a large diameter that affords access to the bronchoscope, and much of the lung may be inaccessible to EBUS systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Devices, systems and methods for locating and biopsying an object in a pulmonary system are disclosed. In embodiments, such a system does not require simultaneous electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) guidance or transthoracic puncture, and is capable of reaching objects adjacent to pulmonary passages that are smaller than those reachable by a standard bronchoscope. Systems discussed herein include a tool that is small enough to be deployed by a bronchoscope tool port, and include a camera, light-emitting diode (LED), and ultrasonic sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a system includes a housing, a camera, a light source, and an ultrasonic system, The housing extends from a proximal end to a distal end. The camera is arranged within the housing at the distal end to obtain optical data relating to the position of the system. The light source is arranged within the housing opposite the camera from the distal end. The light source is then configured to produce illumination passing between the housing and the camera at the distal end. The ultrasonic system is arranged within the housing opposite the light source from the distal end, and is configured to detect acoustical properties in a region opposite the housing from the ultrasonic system. A biopsy needle tube arranged opposite the ultrasonic system from the distal end defines an aperture in the housing, such that a biopsy needle deployed from the biopsy needle tube through the aperture is positioned at the region. The biopsy needle can be bendable, such that the biopsy needle deployed from the biopsy needle tube through the aperture is able to take a biopsy adjacent to a transducer of the ultrasonic system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above summary is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the subject matter hereof.

Within this system are arranged, in order from the distal end of the system in one embodiment: a camera; an LED; and an ultrasonic sensor. In other embodiments the ultrasonic sensor may be positioned adjacent to, or may be interchangeable with, the camera and LED. The system can also include a biopsy needle port that facilitates deployment of a needle adjacent to the ultrasonic sensor. Such components can be used to optically guide the system to an object in a pulmonary system to acquire a biopsy sample, even if that object is not located in a large, primary pulmonary passageway that is reachable by the relatively larger bronchoscope.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are perspective views of a lung biopsy system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. System <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b>, a camera <b>104</b>, a light-emitting diode (LED) <b>106</b>, an ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>, a first biopsy needle tube <b>110</b>A having a first biopsy needle aperture <b>111</b>A, and a second biopsy needle tube <b>110</b>B having a second biopsy needle aperture <b>111</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> additionally depicts a first biopsy needle <b>112</b>A and a second biopsy needle <b>112</b>B.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">System <b>100</b> is sized for deployment via a bronchoscope to a remote location of a pulmonary system. Bronchoscopes are standardized devices with a diameter of 5.3 mm. Within each bronchoscope are several standard ports, including a tool port having a diameter of about 2 mm. A bronchoscope can be used to enter a pulmonary system but often cannot be extended all the way to an object that a physician wishes to biopsy because the pulmonary passageways are not wide enough for the bronchoscope to pass through. Rather than access the object using a transthoracic needle, system <b>100</b> can be deployed from the tool port and, due to its smaller diameter, routed more easily to objects that are positioned along pulmonary passageways having a smaller diameter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">System <b>100</b> has a proximal end P, which can be manipulated by the physician at the bronchoscope or outside of the patient. System <b>100</b> also has a distal end D, which can be driven through pulmonary passageways.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Housing <b>102</b> is an outer wall of system <b>100</b>, housing the other components of system <b>100</b>. Housing <b>102</b> can be made from a flexible material such as a polymer, in embodiments. In some embodiments, it may be desirable for housing <b>102</b> to be at least partially made of a transparent or translucent material, such that light can pass through housing <b>102</b>. Housing <b>102</b> extends from a proximal end (at or near the bronchoscope; not shown) to a distal end D (at or near camera <b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Camera <b>104</b> is arranged at or near the distal end D of housing <b>102</b>. Camera <b>104</b> can be used to provide an indication of the position of system <b>100</b> in a pulmonary system. Camera <b>104</b> can send back signals to the physician that show what is in front of system <b>100</b>, either wirelessly or through a wired connection (not shown) extending from the proximal end to the distal end D of system <b>100</b>. Camera <b>104</b> can provide feedback on the actual position of system <b>100</b> in the pulmonary passage. This solves a problem of conventional systems, in that navigational feedback from EBUS or ENB systems can be incorrect and make advancement difficult.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Camera <b>104</b> can be, for example, a 1 mm&#xd7;1 mm square camera. In other embodiments, the size and shape of camera <b>104</b> can vary. For example, in alternative embodiments camera <b>104</b> could have a round profile from distal end D, Camera <b>104</b> is small enough, however, that when positioned in housing <b>102</b> having a circular outer diameter, at least some portion of the distal end D of housing <b>102</b> is not overlapped by camera <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">LED <b>106</b> is positioned closer to the proximate end than camera <b>104</b> of system <b>100</b>. LED <b>106</b> can have a larger cross-sectional area than camera <b>104</b> when viewed from the distal end D. In this way, light from LED <b>106</b> passes around camera <b>104</b> and out the distal end D of system <b>100</b>, lighting the pulmonary passageways so that camera <b>104</b> can be used to provide information about the position of system <b>100</b>. The light from LED <b>106</b> can pass through the distal end D of system <b>100</b> due to the fact that the material making up housing <b>102</b> is transparent or translucent, in embodiments. In alternative embodiments, LED <b>106</b> need not have a larger cross-sectional area than camera <b>104</b>. For example, in some embodiments outer housing <b>102</b> can be made of a transparent or translucent matter, as described above. In those embodiments, light can be routed, either through reflections or refractions, around camera <b>104</b>. Light can therefore be directed to the distal end D of system <b>100</b>. In alternative embodiments, LED <b>106</b> could be replaced by some other source of illumination. In embodiments, the illumination provided by LED <b>106</b> or another light source could be at an angle and wavelength that promotes total internal reflection within the material that makes up outer housing <b>102</b> or another transmissive material arranged between camera <b>104</b> and outer housing <b>102</b>. In embodiments, LED <b>106</b> or another source of illumination is tuned to the wavelengths or color spectra corresponding to those that are easily detected by camera <b>104</b>. Additionally or alternatively, LED <b>106</b> or another source of illumination can be tuned to a wavelength that is primarily reflected from pulmonary passages rather than absorbed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, outer housing <b>102</b> can be a molded or extruded polymer that encapsulates both camera <b>104</b> and LED <b>106</b>, and outer housing <b>102</b> can act as a carrier for the light produced by LED <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, alternative systems for delivering light to the distal end D of system <b>100</b> could be used. For example, fiber optics or other light guides could be used to route light from LED <b>106</b> to the distal end D of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b> is arranged along system <b>100</b> coaxially with camera <b>104</b> and LED <b>106</b>. This coaxial arrangement allows outer housing <b>102</b> to be substantially narrower than if the same components were arranged in another fashion. Ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b> can emit and/or detect ultrasonic signal passing through adjacent objects, such as the pulmonary passageway. Tumors, nodules, or other objects that a physician may wish to biopsy often have different acoustical properties in the ultrasonic frequencies than the rest of a pulmonary passageway. Using the signal detected by ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>, a physician can determine that ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b> is adjacent to the object of interest for biopsy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">First biopsy needle tube <b>110</b>A and second biopsy needle tube <b>110</b>B extend within the region bounded by outer housing <b>102</b>, from the proximal end of system <b>100</b> to first and second apertures <b>111</b>A and <b>111</b>B that are arranged almost as far in the distal direction as ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, first and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B can be deployed such that a biopsy sample is acquired from a region adjacent to ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">First and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B can be bendable and can comprise a flexible material such as a polymer, in embodiments. In some embodiments, it may be desirable for first and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B to comprise polyether ether ketone (PEEK) such that the material is high strength, biocompatible, and able to hold a sharpened edge. In other embodiments, it may be desirable for first and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B to comprise a steel cutting tip and a polymer shaft. In still other embodiments, first and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B can comprise Nitinol such that the needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B are able to sustain greater bend angles without kinking when compared to, e.g., steel needles because of the relative yield strengths of these materials. In further embodiments, first and second biopsy needles <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B can comprise combinations of these materials and/or other materials that provide desired properties and behaviors.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is an end view of system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, from the distal end D. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, camera <b>104</b> covers some but not all of the distal end D. The rest of the distal end D, circumscribed by outer housing <b>102</b> and not covered by the face of camera <b>104</b>, is a light transmission region <b>114</b>. It is through this region <b>114</b> that light from LED <b>106</b> can pass, to illuminate the area in front of camera <b>104</b>. In embodiments, optical light guides (not shown) can be used to guide the light around the periphery of camera <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The components described so far can be used to position system <b>100</b> adjacent to an object in a narrow passage of a pulmonary system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> depicts a method for using system <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, a bronchoscope is inserted into a pulmonary system (<b>150</b>). The bronchoscope includes a tool port, and the system <b>100</b> can be deployed therefrom (<b>152</b>). System <b>100</b> can be deployed when, for example, the bronchoscope is too large to access a region where an object is located in a pulmonary system. In an alternative, system <b>100</b> can be deployed independently, without a bronchoscope. In such an embodiment, the process begins with deployment (<b>152</b>) rather than bronchoscope insertion (<b>150</b>). Once deployed, system <b>100</b> can be routed to that object by an operator, using optical guidance (<b>154</b>) provided by the system <b>100</b> and its associated camera <b>104</b>. While system <b>100</b> is driven, using optical guidance from camera <b>104</b>, ultrasonic sensing (<b>156</b>) is employed via ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>. Once ultrasonic sensing <b>156</b> shows that the object is adjacent to ultrasonic sensor <b>108</b>, system <b>100</b> can be used to biopsy the object (<b>158</b>). System <b>100</b> can then be retracted into the bronchoscope and the bronchoscope can be removed from the pulmonary system.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> depict an alternative embodiment, in which only a single biopsy needle is present.

For example, rather than being used in a pulmonary system, a similar device could be sized to fit through other passages such as vasculature. In those embodiments, the relative size of the outer housing could be different in order to accommodate the expected size of the passages through which that system will pass, and the port, device, or catheter from which the system will be deployed. Likewise, the size and materials making up the camera, and the intensity or wavelength of the light source, can be varied to match the application.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Various embodiments of systems, devices, and methods have been described herein.
