In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, many kinds of materials are repeatedly formed in a film shape on a silicon wafer to form a layered structure. In order to form this layered structure, a technique to planarize the surface of the wafer is essential. As such means for planarizing the surface of a wafer, polishing apparatuses that perform chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) (also referred to as chemical mechanical polishing apparatuses) are widely used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus includes a polishing table with a polishing pad attached thereto, a top ring (polishing head) for holding a wafer, and a slurry ejection nozzle for feeding a polishing liquid (slurry) onto the polishing pad. While the polishing liquid is fed onto the polishing pad from the slurry ejection nozzle, the top ring presses the wafer against the polishing pad, and the top ring and the polishing table are moved relative to each other, thereby polishing the wafer to planarize the surface of the wafer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After the wafer is polished, particles such as polishing debris and abrasive grains contained in the polishing liquid remain on the polishing pad. Thus, after the wafer is polished, an atomizer having at least one jet nozzle that jets liquid or a gas-liquid fluid mixture toward the polishing pad sprays a mist-like cleaning fluid (liquid or a liquid-gas mixture) onto the polishing pad to remove foreign substances on the polishing pad.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In conventional apparatuses, in moving a slurry ejection nozzle provided on the distal end part of a swing arm between a slurry dropping position and a retracted position, the slurry ejection nozzle interferes with an atomizer positioned above a polishing pad, which limits the operation range of the swing arm and the height of the slurry ejection nozzle. Thus, it is difficult to drop slurry required to polish a wafer onto an optimum position at an optimum timing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2018-6549 discloses a technique that includes a swing arm configured to be rotatable around a horizontal axis extending in the horizontal direction and rotates the swing arm around the horizontal axis in moving a slurry ejection nozzle between a slurry dropping position and a retracted position to retract the slurry ejection nozzle above an atomizer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The polishing apparatus requires, on and above the polishing pad, a space for installing a device other than the slurry ejection nozzle and the atomizer, such as a dresser for dressing the polishing pad or a temperature control slider for controlling the surface temperature of the polishing pad. However, in conventional apparatuses, a large space is required for the swing arm swinging above the polishing pad and for installing a device such as a dresser or a temperature control slider on and above the polishing pad, and it is difficult to leave a space for the atomizer to swing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, as described above, in conventional apparatuses, the slurry ejection nozzle provided on the distal end part of the swing arm interferes with the atomizer positioned above the polishing pad, which limits the operation range of the swing arm. Thus, it is difficult to drop slurry required to polish a wafer onto an optimum position at an optimum timing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in conventional apparatuses, jetted water (water droplets) unpredictably dripping after the polishing pad is cleaned by the atomizer positioned above the polishing pad may dilute the slurry fed onto the polishing pad during polishing and thus change the amount of polishing per unit slurry, which may increase the consumption of expensive slurry.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is desirable to provide a liquid feeder and a polishing apparatus that can leave a space for installing a device other than a first nozzle and a second nozzle on and above a polishing table and retract at least one of the first nozzle and the second nozzle from the polishing table at any timing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A liquid feeder according to an aspect of the present technique includes:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a first arm having a first nozzle configured to eject a first fluid onto a polishing table;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a second arm having a second nozzle configured to eject a second fluid onto the polishing table;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a first rotation shaft supporting a proximal end part of the first arm;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a second rotation shaft supporting a proximal end part of the second arm;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a first rotation driver configured to rotate the first rotation shaft around an axis thereof to turn the first arm from a fluid feed position inside the polishing table to a retracted position outside the polishing table;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a second rotation driver configured to rotate the second rotation shaft around an axis thereof to turn the second arm from a fluid feed position inside the polishing table to a retracted position outside the polishing table;

and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">a controller configured to control an operation of the first rotation driver and an operation of the second rotation driver, in which</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">the first rotation shaft and the second rotation shaft are disposed coaxially with each other, and</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">the controller is capable of controlling the operation of the first rotation driver and the operation of the second rotation driver independently of each other.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to such an aspect, since the first rotation shaft and the second rotation shaft are disposed coaxially with each other, the first arm and the second arm are turned around the same axis. This can minimize a space occupied by the first arm and the second arm turning above the polishing table, thereby leaving a space for installing a device other than the first nozzle and the second nozzle on and above the polishing table. Also, since the operation of the first rotation driver and the operation of the second rotation driver can be controlled independently of each other, at least one of the first nozzle and the second nozzle can be retracted from the polishing table at any timing by individually driving the first arm and the second arm. For example, in a case where the first nozzle is a slurry ejection nozzle, and the second nozzle is an atomizer, the atomizer is retracted in advance out of the polishing table in ejecting slurry from the slurry ejection nozzle while swinging the swing arm. This prevents the operation range of the swing arm from being limited by interference with the atomizer to enable the slurry to be dropped onto the entire surface of the pad and also prevents the slurry fed onto the polishing pad from being diluted with jetted water (water droplets) unpredictably dripping from the atomizer. Thus, the polishing performance is improved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A liquid feeder according to a second aspect of the embodiment is the liquid feeder according to the first aspect, in which</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">the first arm and the second arm are disposed at different height positions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to such an aspect, the first arm and the second arm can be turned so as to cross each other.
