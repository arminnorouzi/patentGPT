In a typical cavity filter, the resonators act as the inner conductor and the housing acts as the outer conductor. Each resonator may include a stalk and a resonator head. The base of the stalk may be galvanically connected to the housing and the distal end of the stalk may be spaced apart from the housing. Inductive coupling between adjacent resonators can be achieved by a gap between a housing cavity's partition walls. Similarly, capacitive coupling may occur between the spaced-apart distal ends of adjacent stalks. Resonator heads may be mounted at or near the distal ends of the stalks to increase the capacitive coupling. The amount of capacitive coupling between resonators can be adjusted (e.g., increased) by the positioning, size, and form of the resonator heads, which may also be referred to herein as &#x201c;resonator hats.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It may be desirable to provide inexpensive resonator heads. Though planar (i.e., flat) metal resonator heads may be less expensive than dish-shaped resonator heads, coupling between resonator heads may be inconsistent if the resonator heads are at different heights or are bent (and thus not quite planar). According to embodiments of the present inventive concepts, however, a PCB may facilitate the use of resonator heads that are inexpensive, flat, precisely (e.g., consistently) positioned, and relatively easy to assemble.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, according to embodiments of the present inventive concepts, multiple resonator heads that provide coupling (e.g., capacitive coupling) between resonators can be formed on a single PCB that is then mounted on multiple resonator stalks. In other embodiments, a transmission line and/or inductive couplings may be formed on a single PCB, and this PCB may be mounted on multiple resonator stalks. Moreover, stripline-based filter structures, such as a low-pass filter, can also be implemented on the same single-piece PCB that has multiple resonator heads. Other elements that can be included on the PCB are connector pins, connectors, and RF couplers. Because filter elements, such as resonator heads, may be implemented with a single-piece PCB, variation during manufacturing can be reduced and assembly tolerances can be highly-controlled.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Implementing filter elements on a PCB may also reduce the need for filter tuning. Tuning adjustments to a PCB-based filter can be performed by conventional techniques, such as by bringing a metallic material closer to an open end of a coupling element (e.g., a resonator head). Moreover, the present inventive concepts may facilitate other filter tuning techniques, such as tuning by removing metal from a PCB using a laser.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Example embodiments of the present inventive concepts will be described in greater detail with reference to the attached figures.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a top perspective view of the inside of an RF filter device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present inventive concepts. The filter <b>100</b> is a device that includes resonators R in respective cavities C inside a housing <b>110</b>. Each resonator R includes a resonator stalk <b>101</b> and a metal resonator head <b>102</b> that is on the stalk <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, the resonator heads <b>102</b> may be respective flat (rather than dish-shaped) resonator heads.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An interior wall <b>120</b> may extend inside the housing <b>110</b> between two filters comprising resonators R. For example, the two filters may have separate transmission paths, respectively, to two ports of the filter <b>100</b>. The ports may be coupled to respective antenna ports, such as ports of a base station antenna (e.g., a 64T64R antenna or other massive multiple-input, multiple-output (&#x201c;MIMO&#x201d;) antenna). In some embodiments, the two filters that are divided by the interior wall <b>120</b> may be identical mirrored bandpass filters. The housing <b>110</b> may also include cavity walls CW that are between the interior wall <b>120</b> and an outer wall of the housing <b>110</b>. The cavities C may be defined by combinations of cavity walls CW, the interior wall <b>120</b>, and/or outer walls. A lid (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) may cover the cavities C.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Adjacent, spaced-apart resonators R may be electromagnetically (e.g., capacitively and/or inductively) coupled to each other. Moreover, a metal component <b>103</b> that is adjacent and spaced apart from a resonator R may couple the resonator R to a port of the filter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion of the filter <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).

Each resonator head <b>102</b> includes a loop portion <b>102</b>-L that extends around an upper portion <b>101</b>-U of a resonator stalk <b>101</b>.

For example, the loop portion <b>102</b>-L may be soldered to the upper portion <b>101</b>-U. In some embodiments, resonator heads <b>102</b> may be formed by soldering loop portions <b>102</b>-L of a flat metal sheet to respective stalks <b>101</b> and then cutting away some of the interconnecting metal between the stalks <b>101</b> to provide pairs of spaced-apart arm portions <b>102</b>-A.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The upper portion <b>101</b>-U of a stalk <b>101</b> may be the (i) top half, (ii) top third, or (iii) top quarter of the stalk <b>101</b>. Accordingly, a resonator head <b>102</b> that is on the stalk <b>101</b> is closer to the top end of the stalk <b>101</b> than to the bottom end of the stalk <b>101</b>. Moreover, the stalk <b>101</b> may also be referred to as a &#x201c;resonator pedestal.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E</figref> are top views illustrating a method of forming metal resonator heads <b>102</b> of the filter <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, multiple resonator heads <b>102</b> may be formed from the same sheet of metal. Accordingly, interconnecting metal, such as metal bridges <b>105</b>, may connect adjacent resonator heads <b>102</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, the metal bridges <b>105</b> may be removed (e.g., by cutting) to separate the resonator heads <b>102</b> from each other. In some embodiments, the metal bridges <b>105</b> may be removed after loop portions <b>102</b>-L of the resonators <b>102</b> are soldered to respective resonator stalks <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> also shows that an outer diameter D of a loop portion <b>102</b>-L may be narrower than a length L of an arm portion <b>102</b>-A that protrudes from the loop portion <b>102</b>-L.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a top view of the inside of an RF filter device <b>200</b> according to further embodiments of the present inventive concepts. As with the filter <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), the filter <b>200</b> has resonators R that are inside a housing <b>210</b>. For example, the filter <b>200</b> may include two filters, and resonators R<b>1</b> of the first filter may be separated from resonators R<b>2</b> of the second filter by an interior wall <b>220</b> that is inside the housing <b>210</b>. The resonators R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> may provide respective paths (e.g., transmission paths) between two pairs of ports of the filter <b>200</b>. Some of the ports may be coupled to respective antenna ports, such as ports of a base station antenna. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the first and second filters each include eleven resonators R. In some embodiments, however, more (e.g., twelve or more) or fewer (e.g., ten, nine, eight, or fewer) resonators R may be included. Moreover, for simplicity of illustration, only two resonators R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> are labeled for the first filter, and only two resonators R<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> are labeled for the second filter.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Unlike the filter <b>100</b>, multiple metal resonator heads <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the resonators R of the filter <b>200</b> may be on a single PCB. For example, resonators R<b>1</b> of the first filter and resonators R<b>2</b> of the second filter may have first and second pluralities of resonator heads <b>202</b> on respective PCBs <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>. Accordingly, each PCB <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> may have multiple resonator heads <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the PCBs <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> may comprise high-frequency laminates, such as RO3003&#x2122; laminates by Rogers Corporation. Moreover, in some embodiments, the PCB <b>231</b> and/or the PCB <b>232</b> may include additional electrical components. As an example, the PCBs <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> may include low-pass filters <b>241</b> and <b>242</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The PCBs <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> facilitate easier assembly of the filter <b>200</b> relative to assembly of the filter <b>100</b>. For example, because the filter <b>200</b> has PCB-based resonator heads <b>202</b> instead of non-PCB resonator heads <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), metal does not need to be cut to form the resonator heads <b>202</b>. By contrast, cutting away interconnecting metal to form the resonator heads <b>102</b> may move and/or bend the resonator heads <b>102</b>. As a result, tolerances for the PCB-based filter <b>200</b> may be improved relative to the filter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The filters <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may each have an operational frequency range (e.g., a pass band) of 3480 megahertz (&#x201c;MHz&#x201d;) to 3800 MHz or a portion thereof. Over the operational frequency range, the maximum insertion loss of the filter <b>200</b> may be 1.8 decibels (&#x201c;dB&#x201d;), the insertion loss variation may be under 1 dB, and the maximum group delay distortion may be 65 nanoseconds (&#x201c;ns&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the housing <b>210</b> may be a metal housing. For example, a single machined or die-cast piece may, in some embodiments, comprise exterior walls, a bottom surface, cavity walls CW (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), the interior wall <b>220</b>, and/or resonator stalks <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing <b>210</b>. As an example, the stalks <b>201</b> and the housing <b>210</b> may be different portions of a single metal piece (e.g., the stalks <b>201</b> may be die-cast with the housing <b>210</b>) or the stalks <b>201</b> may be connected to the housing <b>210</b> by screws or soldering. Likewise, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a single machined or die-cast piece may, in some embodiments, comprise exterior walls, a bottom surface, cavity walls CW, an interior wall <b>120</b>, and/or resonator stalks <b>101</b> of a housing <b>110</b>.

The PCB <b>231</b> may have openings <b>260</b> between respective pairs of resonators R. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pair&#x201d; may refer to two resonators R (or components thereof) that have an opening <b>260</b> therebetween and do not have a third resonator R therebetween. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an opening <b>260</b> that is between (a) an arm portion <b>202</b>-A of a metal resonator head <b>202</b> of a first resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and (b) an arm portion <b>202</b>-A of a metal resonator head <b>202</b> of a second resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the opening <b>260</b> may include a middle/end portion <b>260</b>-E that is between respective ends of the pair of arm portions <b>202</b>-A, as well as one or more side portions <b>260</b>-S that extend along sides of the pair of arm portions <b>202</b>-A. As an example, the opening <b>260</b> may be an H-shaped or U-shaped hole in the PCB <b>231</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each resonator head <b>202</b> may have at least one arm portion <b>202</b>-A. As an example, the resonator heads <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> each have two arm portions <b>202</b>-A. Other resonator heads <b>202</b> may likewise have two arm portions <b>202</b>-A or may have one arm portion <b>202</b>-A or three arm portions <b>202</b>-A.

Moreover, the loop portion <b>202</b>-L and the arm portion(s) <b>202</b>-A extending therefrom may be different portions of a single metal piece.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A plurality of loop portions <b>202</b>-L are on, and electrically connected to (e.g., via solder), respective resonator stalks <b>201</b>.

The loop portion <b>202</b>-L does not, however, need to completely surround the stalk <b>201</b>. In some embodiments, the loop portion <b>202</b>-L may extend partially around the circumference of an upper portion <b>201</b>-U of the stalk <b>201</b>. For example, the loop portion <b>202</b>-L may extend about <b>180</b> degrees (or fewer) around the circumference of the upper portion <b>201</b>-U. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;loop,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to a partial loop or a complete (e.g., 360-degree) loop.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The PCB <b>231</b> may, in some embodiments, have curved openings <b>270</b> that extend adjacent respective loop portions <b>202</b>-L.

Positioning the openings <b>260</b> and <b>270</b> (which replace PCB dielectric material) near the resonator heads <b>202</b> can improve Q performance of the filter <b>200</b> relative to a filter having a PCB that lacks the openings <b>260</b> and <b>270</b>.

Though cavity walls CW of the cavity C are typically metal, they are depicted transparently in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> for ease of illustrating a resonator stalk <b>201</b> and a PCB <b>231</b> inside the cavity C.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the PCB <b>231</b> may have an upper surface <b>231</b>U and an opposite lower surface <b>231</b>L and may be on an upper portion <b>201</b>-U of the stalk <b>201</b>.

Moreover, the filters <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may be time division duplex (&#x201c;TDD&#x201d;) filters, which may be less susceptible to passive intermodulation (&#x201c;PIM&#x201d;) distortion than frequency division duplex (&#x201c;FDD&#x201d;) filters.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a top view of the inside of an RF filter device <b>400</b> according to further embodiments of the present inventive concepts. As with the filter <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and the filter <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the filter <b>400</b> has resonators R that are inside a housing <b>410</b>. For example, the filter <b>400</b> may include two filters, and resonators R<b>1</b> of the first filter may be separated from resonators R<b>2</b> of the second filter by an interior wall <b>420</b> that is inside the housing <b>410</b>. The resonators R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> may provide respective paths (e.g., transmission paths) between two pairs of ports of the filter <b>400</b>. Some of the ports may be coupled to respective antenna ports, such as ports of a base station antenna. For simplicity of illustration, only three resonators R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, and R<b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are labeled for the first filter, and only three resonators R<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, and R<b>2</b>-<b>3</b> are labeled for the second filter.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion of the filter <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, (a) an arm portion <b>402</b>-A of a metal resonator head <b>402</b> of a first resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and (b) an arm portion <b>402</b>-A of a metal resonator head <b>402</b> of a second resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> may each extend into (e.g., through) an opening OCW in a cavity wall CW that is between respective resonator stalks <b>401</b> of the resonators R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the pair of arm portions <b>402</b>-A may be electromagnetically coupled to each other. For example, the pair of arm portions <b>402</b>-A may be horizontally offset (i.e., adjacent and horizontally spaced apart) from each other in the opening OCW such that a side surface of one of the arm portions <b>402</b>-A is electromagnetically coupled to a nearest side surface of the other arm portion <b>402</b>-A. Moreover, the opening OCW may also be referred to as a &#x201c;window&#x201d; or &#x201c;cutout&#x201d; in the cavity wall CW, which may be a metal wall.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The arm portions <b>402</b>-A extend horizontally outward from respective loop portions <b>402</b>-L of the resonator heads <b>402</b>, and the loop portions <b>402</b>-L are on respective resonator stalks <b>401</b>. For example, the arm portion <b>402</b>-A of the resonator head <b>402</b> of the first resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> may extend outward from the loop portion <b>402</b>-L of that resonator head <b>402</b> toward the loop portion <b>402</b>-L of the resonator head <b>402</b> of the second resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>. Similarly, the arm portion <b>402</b>-A of the resonator head <b>402</b> of the second resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> may extend outward from the loop portion <b>402</b>-L of that resonator head <b>402</b> toward the loop portion <b>402</b>-L of the resonator head <b>402</b> of the first resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b>. Like the non-PCB resonator heads <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), the resonator heads <b>402</b> may be non-PCB resonator heads.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Unlike how the non-PCB resonator heads <b>102</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, however, some of the resonator heads <b>402</b> may have only a single arm portion <b>402</b>-A rather than multiple arm portions. As an example, the first resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and the second resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> may each have only a single arm portion <b>402</b>-A extending outward from a respective loop portion <b>402</b>-L. Moreover, others of the resonator heads <b>402</b>, such as the resonator head <b>402</b> of the third resonator R<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, may have a loop portion <b>402</b>-L that is free of any arm portion <b>402</b>-A extending outward therefrom.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further unlike how the non-PCB resonator heads <b>102</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the resonator heads <b>402</b> may be bowl/dish-shaped rather than flat. Accordingly, each resonator head <b>402</b> may slope downward from the top of its loop portion <b>402</b>-L toward a respective resonator stalk <b>401</b>. In some embodiments, the top of the loop portion <b>402</b>-L may be at a higher vertical level than the top of the resonator stalk <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Resonators R<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, and R<b>2</b>-<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) may include similar components/structures to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> for the resonators R<b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, and R<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, respectively. For example, the resonators R<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> may each have a single arm portion that extends horizontally outward from a respective loop portion, whereas the resonator R<b>2</b>-<b>3</b> may have a loop portion that is free of any arm portion extending outward therefrom. Moreover, a pair of the arm portions may be electromagnetically coupled to each other, and resonator heads of the resonators R<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, and R<b>2</b>-<b>3</b> may be bowl/dish-shaped.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An RF filter device <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) according to embodiments of the present inventive concepts may provide a number of advantages. These advantages include easier assembly and improved tolerances due to having multiple metal resonator heads <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) on a single PCB <b>231</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). By contrast, tolerances may be worse with resonator heads <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) that are formed by metal punching, which may involve cutting interconnecting metal pieces with significant force. The PCB <b>231</b> can also host other elements, including stripline-based filter structures, such as a low-pass filter <b>241</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, the filter <b>200</b> may comprise two linear arrays of resonators R on respective PCBs <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, the present inventive concepts can provide an RF filter device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) having metal resonator heads <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) with arm portions <b>102</b>-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) that extend toward each other to strengthen coupling between pairs of resonator heads <b>102</b> relative to disc-shaped (e.g., dish-shaped) resonator heads that are farther apart from each other. Though the resonator heads <b>102</b> are not on a PCB, the PCB-based resonator heads <b>202</b> of the filter <b>200</b> may similarly have arm portions <b>202</b>-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) that can strengthen coupling between pairs of resonator heads <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, each resonator head <b>102</b> may have a loop portion <b>102</b>-L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) from which multiple arm portions <b>102</b>-A laterally extend.
