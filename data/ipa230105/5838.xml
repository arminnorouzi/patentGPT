It should be understood, however, that these descriptions are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Further, in the following description, descriptions of well-known structures and techniques are omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring concepts of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various structural schematic diagrams according to the embodiments of the present disclosure are shown in the accompanying drawings. The drawings are not to scale, some details have been exaggerated for clarity, and some details may be omitted. Shapes of various regions and layers shown in the drawings, as well as their relative sizes and positional relationships are only exemplary, and may vary in practice due to preparing tolerances or technical limitations, and regions/layers having different shapes, sizes and relative positions may be additionally designed by those skilled in the art as desired.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the context of the present disclosure, when a layer/element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer/element, it may be directly on the another layer/element or there may be intervening layers/elements. In addition, if a layer/element is &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer/element in one orientation, the layer/element may be &#x201c;below&#x201d; the another layer/element when the orientation is reversed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of preparing a metallic stack. In the conventional technique, an interlayer dielectric layer is formed first, then trenches or holes are formed in the interlayer dielectric layer, and the trenches or holes are filled with a conductive material to form interconnection wires or vias. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, a metal pattern is first formed on an underlying layer, for example, on a substrate on which some devices have been formed or a lower layer in the metallic stack, then gaps of the metal pattern is filled with a dielectric material to form the interlayer dielectric layer. The metal pattern may be formed by photolithography. In this way, a line width and a spacing of interconnection wires as well as a critical dimension (CD) and a spacing of vias may be determined by the line width or CD and spacing of lithography, thereby reducing the line width or CD and spacing, and thus increasing the integration density. In addition, difficulties of metal filling in the conventional technique are avoided. Also, since a filling process is not used, metal materials such as ruthenium (Ru), molybdenum (Mo), rhodium (Rh), platinum (Pt), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), or chromium (Cr), may be used, so that the use of diffusion barriers may be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, in the conventional technique, the trenches or holes formed by etching have a shape tapered from top to bottom, and thus the interconnection wires or the conductive vias formed therein have a corresponding shape. In contrast, according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the interconnection wires or the conductive vias may be directly obtained by photolithography, and thus may have a shape tapered from bottom to top.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, a pair of interconnection wire layers and via layers adjacent to each other may be formed together. For example, a metal layer may be formed on the underlying layer, and a thickness of the metal layer may correspond to a sum of thicknesses of both the interconnection wire layer and the via layer. The metal layer may be formed over the entire area where the metallic stack needs to be formed, for example, over substantially the entire surface of the underlying layer. The metal layer may be patterned, for example, by photolithography, into an interconnection pattern, which may correspond to or be the layout of interconnection wires in the interconnection wire layer. A thickness of a first part of the interconnection pattern may be thinned (and possibly cut at certain areas) to form interconnection wires. A second part (which may not be substantially thinned in thickness) of the interconnection pattern other than the first part may form conductive vias in the via layer. Thus, the interconnection wires and the conductive vias on the interconnection wires may be integrated with each other and self-aligned with each other.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The metallic stack may include a plurality of such interconnection wires and via layers, at least some or all of the interconnection wires and via layers may be prepared in this way.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the interconnection pattern may include a series of metal wires. These metal wires may have the same pattern as the layout of the interconnection wires in the interconnection wire layer. That is, the metal layer may be patterned according to the layout of the interconnection wires. Alternatively, the interconnection pattern may have a pattern in which the metal wires extend according to the layout of the interconnection wires, but the metal wires corresponding to separate interconnection wires opposite to each other may extend continuously. In this case, forming metal wires extending in the same direction is advantageous for patterning. This layout, in conjunction with metal wires in another interconnection wire layer extending in another direction that intersects (e.g., orthogonal to) this direction, enables various interconnect wirings. For example, in the metallic stack, an interconnection wire layer with interconnection wires extending in a first direction and an interconnection wire layer with interconnection wires extending in a second direction orthogonal to the first direction may alternate in the vertical direction. After the first part of the interconnection pattern is thinned, the metal wires may be cut at predetermined areas according to the layout of the interconnection wires, so as to realize the separation between different interconnection wires.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the above preparing process, after the metal wires are formed and the first part of the metal wires is thinned, gaps are formed between the metal wires due to the thinning, and a dielectric material may be filled into the gaps to form an interlayer dielectric layer. As the gaps between the metal wires are small, hollows or voids may be formed in the filled dielectric material. Such hollows or voids may be helpful to reducing capacitance. Positions of the hollows or voids may be adjusted by a deposition-etch-deposition method, as described below. In addition, the filled dielectric materials may be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above-described method, a metallic stack according to the embodiments of the present disclosure may be obtained, wherein at least a part of the interconnection wires in at least one interconnection wire layer and the conductive vias thereon are integral with each other. In a conventional dual damascene process, the interconnection wires and the conductive vias below the interconnection wires may be formed together, and thus they may be integrated with each other.

In the following description, the desired etch selectivity may or may not be indicated. It should be understood to those skilled in the art that when it is mentioned below that a certain material layer is etched, if it is not mentioned that other layers are also etched or the drawings do not show that other layers are also etched, then such etching may be selective, and the material layer may have etch selectivity relative to other layers exposed to the same etch recipe.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> schematically illustrate some stages in a flow of preparing a metallic stack according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate <b>1001</b> is provided.
