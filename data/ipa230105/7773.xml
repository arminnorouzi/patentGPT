The array substrate <b>101</b> or the opposing substrate <b>103</b> may further include a common electrode (not shown) forming an electric field with the pixel electrodes PE. The display panel <b>110</b> has a first length in the first direction D<b>1</b> greater than a second length in the second direction D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the display panel <b>110</b> may include an organic electroluminescent display panel, which includes a plurality of organic electroluminescent structures that emit light. For example, each of the organic electroluminescent structures may include a first electrode, a second electrode facing the first electrode, and an organic electroluminescent element interposed between the first electrode and the second electrode.

The printed circuit boards <b>230</b> may be arranged adjacent to the display panel <b>110</b>. For example, the printed circuit boards <b>230</b> may be arranged to face a side or edge of the display panel <b>110</b> that extends in the first direction Dl.

Thus, any duplicative explanation may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The flexible circuit film <b>360</b> may include a flexible part <b>310</b> and a guide film <b>320</b>. The flexible part <b>310</b> may include a first flexible film, a second flexible film and a plurality of wirings. The first flexible film and the second flexible film may each include an insulating material having flexibility. The first flexible film and the second flexible film may have, for example, a U-shape to cover the wirings. The flexible circuit film <b>360</b> having a U-shape has a base portion <b>371</b> and two branch portions <b>372</b> and <b>373</b>. In addition, flexible circuit film <b>360</b> has an inner edge <b>377</b> having inner corners <b>378</b> and <b>379</b>. The wirings of the flexible part <b>310</b> are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> for ease of explanation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The wirings may be arranged between the first flexible film and the second flexible film, may include a conductive material such as copper, silver, or the like, and may have flexibility to be capable of bending with the flexible films.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The wirings may extend and bend to have a U-shape that includes a base and branches extending perpendicularly from opposite ends of the base. For example, one of the branches of the wirings extend in a second direction D<b>2</b> corresponding to first branch <b>372</b> to connect to the base at a first bend <b>381</b>, and then the base extends in a first direction D<b>1</b> perpendicular to the second direction D<b>2</b> to the second branch at a second bend <b>382</b>, and then the second branch extends in a direction opposite to the second direction D<b>2</b> from the second bend to correspond to the second branch <b>373</b>. The wirings may be arranged to be spaced apart from each other by a distance between the first flexible film and the second flexible film.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The wirings may include a power supply line <b>351</b>, a ground line, and image signal supplying lines <b>353</b> or the like. A width of the power supply <b>351</b> may be greater than a width of each of the image signal supplying lines <b>353</b>. Also, a width of the ground line may be greater than a width of each of the image signal supplying lines <b>353</b>. The power supply line <b>351</b> may be used to apply a gamma power, and a width of the power supply line <b>351</b> supplying a gamma power may be about 200 &#x3bc;m to about 250 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the second embodiment, the power supply line <b>351</b> and the ground line may be arranged adjacent to an outer edge or an inner edge of the flexible part <b>310</b> having a U-shape. For example, the power supply line <b>351</b> may be arranged adjacent to the inner edge <b>377</b> of the flexible part <b>310</b> having the U-shape. Because the power supply line <b>351</b> having a relatively greater width is arranged adjacent to the inner edge <b>377</b> of the flexible part <b>310</b> having the U-shape where the inner edge is otherwise relatively easily damaged, electrical characteristics of the wirings may be maintained, even if an external impact is applied to the flexible part <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The guide film <b>320</b> may be arranged on the first flexible film. For example, the guide film <b>320</b> may be arranged on a rear surface of the first flexible film. The guide film <b>320</b> may include a more rigid material than that of the flexible films.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The guide film <b>320</b> may be arranged at an edge of the first flexible film. For example, the guide film <b>320</b> may overlap with ends of the wirings corresponding to terminal ends of the branches. The guide film <b>320</b> may include tear-preventing portions <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b </i>that may overlap with portions of the inner edge <b>377</b> of the U-shape of the flexible part. The tear-preventing portions <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b </i>may extend from the inner edge <b>377</b> of the U-shape in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the second direction D<b>2</b> or opposing directions thereof. For example, the tear-preventing portions <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b </i>may overlap with the bends of the shortest one of the wirings. Furthermore, the tear-preventing portion <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b </i>may further overlap with the bends of the longest one of the wirings. The guide film <b>320</b> may further include a handling portion <b>325</b><i>a </i>and <b>325</b><i>b </i>that overlaps the bend portions of the wirings <b>381</b> and <b>382</b> at the outer edge <b>387</b> of the U-shape. Specifically, the tear-preventing portions <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b </i>and the handling portions <b>325</b><i>a </i>and <b>325</b><i>b </i>of the guide film <b>320</b> may be integrally formed with each other and may overlap with bent portions <b>381</b> and <b>382</b> of all the wirings.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the above, because the guide film <b>320</b> of the flexible circuit film includes the tear-preventing portion <b>321</b><i>a </i>and <b>321</b><i>b, </i>the flexible part <b>310</b> of the flexible circuit film may be prevented from being physically damaged. For example, when the flexible circuit film is coupled to a printed circuit board, the bent portions <b>381</b> and <b>382</b> of the inner edges <b>377</b> of the flexible part may be prevented from being torn by an operator. Furthermore, when the flexible circuit film is coupled to the printed circuit board, the bent portions <b>381</b> and <b>382</b> of the outer edges <b>387</b> of the flexible part may be prevented from being torn by an operator.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The second flexible film may cover the wirings arranged on the first flexible film. The second flexible film may include terminal grooves exposing opposing ends of the wirings. Terminal portions TMa and TMb of the wirings, which are exposed through the terminal grooves CN, may contact and electrically connect to a connecting portion of the printed circuit board. The second flexible film may further include a protective portion <b>314</b> that protects ends of the terminal portions TMa and TMb of the wirings and may extend in an arranging direction of the wirings.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the above, ends of the wirings are partially covered by the protective portion <b>314</b>. Thus, even if an external impact is applied to the flexible circuit film, the ends of the wirings may be prevented from being separated from the first flexible film.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating a display apparatus according to a second exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a display apparatus according to the second exemplary embodiment is substantially same as the display apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> except for including just one host line <b>210</b> connected to the chain of printed circuit boards <b>230</b>.

For example, the first printed circuit board <b>230</b><i>a </i>is arranged adjacent to the second printed circuit board <b>230</b><i>b </i>in an opposing direction to the first direction D<b>1</b>, and receives electrical signals from the host line <b>210</b> via the second printed circuit board <b>230</b><i>b </i>and the flexible circuit film <b>300</b>. The printed circuit boards adjacent to each other may receive or provide electrical signals via the flexible circuit film <b>300</b>.
