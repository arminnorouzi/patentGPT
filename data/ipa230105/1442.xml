It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;engaged to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly engaged to&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.).

These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer and/or section from another region, layer and/or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;inner,&#x201d; &#x201c;outer,&#x201d; &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the example term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the words &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; are used in this specification in connection with a numerical value, it is intended that the associated numerical value include a tolerance of &#xb1;10% around the stated numerical value, unless otherwise explicitly defined.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the context of the present application, it is to be noted that the term &#x201c;viscous medium&#x201d; should be understood as highly viscous medium with a viscosity (e.g., dynamic viscosity) typically about or above 1 Pa s (e.g., solder paste, solder flux, adhesive, conductive adhesive, or any other kind of medium of fluid used for fastening components on a substrate, conductive ink, resistive paste, or the like, all typically with a viscosity about or above 1 Pa s). The terms &#x201c;jetted droplet,&#x201d; &#x201c;droplet,&#x201d; or &#x201c;shot&#x201d; should be understood as the volume of the viscous medium that is forced through the jetting nozzle and moving towards the substrate in response to an impact of the impacting device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the context of the present application, it is noted that the term &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; should be interpreted as a non-contact deposition process that utilizes a fluid jet to form and shoot droplets of a viscous medium from a jetting nozzle onto a substrate, as compared to a contact dispensing process, such as &#x201c;fluid wetting&#x201d;. In contrast to a dispenser and dispensing process where a needle in combination with, for contact dispensing, the gravitation force and adhesion force with respect to the surface is used to dispense viscous medium on a surface, an ejector or jetting head assembly for jetting or shooting viscous medium should be interpreted as an apparatus including an impacting device, such as an impacting device including, for example, a piezoelectric actuator and a plunger, for rapidly building up pressure in a jetting chamber by the rapid movement (e.g., rapid controlled mechanical movement) of an impacting device (e.g., the rapid movement of a plunger) over a period of time that is more than about 1 microseconds, but less than about 50 microseconds, thereby providing a deformation of the fluid in the chamber that forces droplets of viscous medium through a jetting nozzle. In one implementation, an ejection control unit applies a drive voltage intermittently to a piezoelectric actuator, thereby causing an intermittent extension thereof, and a reciprocating movement of a plunger with respect to the assembly housing of the ejector or jetting head assembly head.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">&#x201c;Jetting&#x201d; of viscous medium should be interpreted as a process for ejecting or shooting droplets of viscous medium where the jetting of droplets of the viscous medium onto a surface is performed while the at least one jetting nozzle is in motion without stopping at each location on the workpiece where viscous medium is to be deposited. Jetting of viscous medium should be interpreted as a process for ejecting or shooting droplets of viscous medium where the ejection of a droplet through a nozzle is controlled by an impacting device building up a rapid pressure impulse in a jetting chamber over a time period that typically is more than about 1 microseconds and less than about 50 microseconds. For the movement of the impacting device to be rapid enough to build up a pressure impulse in the jetting chamber to force individual droplets or shots of the relatively highly viscous fluids (with a viscosity of about or above 1 Pa s) out of the chamber through the jetting nozzle, the break-off is induced by the impulse of the shot itself and not by gravity or the movement of a needle in an opposite direction. A volume of each individual droplet to be jetted onto the workpiece may be between about 100 pL and about 30 nL. A dot diameter for each individual droplet may be between about 0.1 mm and about 1.0 mm. The speed of the jetting, i.e. the speed of each individual droplet, may be between about 5 m/s and about 50 m/s. The speed of the jetting mechanism, e.g. the impacting mechanism for impacting the jetting nozzle, may be as high as between about 5 m/s and about 50 m/s but is typically smaller than the speed of the jetting, e.g. between about 1 m/s and about 30 m/s, and depends on the transfer of momentum through the nozzle.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The terms &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; and &#x201c;jetting head assembly&#x201d; in this disclosure and the claims, refer to the break-off of a fluid filament induced by the motion of the fluid element in contrast to a slower natural break-off akin to dripping where the a break-off of a fluid filament is driven for example by gravity or capillary forces.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to distinguish &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; of droplets of a viscous medium using a &#x201c;jetting head assembly&#x201d; such as an ejector-based non-contact jetting technology from the slower natural dripping break-off driven by gravity or capillary forces, we introduce below non-dimensional numbers that describe a threshold for the dripping-jetting transition for filament break-off for different cases and fluids that are driven by different physical mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For elastic fluids, the terms &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; and &#x201c;jetting head assembly&#x201d; refer to the definition of jetting droplets by reference to the Weissenberg number, Wi=&#x3bb;U<sub>jet</sub>/R, where &#x3bb; is the dominant relaxation time of the fluid, U<sub>jet </sub>is the speed of the fluid and R is the radius of the jet, can be used and the threshold for dripping-jetting is approximately 20&#x3c;Wi<sub>th</sub>&#x3c;40.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For fluids where break-off is controlled by viscous thinning, the terms &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; and &#x201c;jetting head assembly&#x201d; refer to the definition of jetting droplets by reference to the Capillary number, described by Ca=&#x3b7;<sub>0</sub>U<sub>jet</sub>/&#x3b3;, where &#x3b7;<sub>0 </sub>is the yield viscosity and &#x3b3; is the surface tension, can be used to introduce a threshold for dripping-jetting of Ca<sub>th</sub>&#x2248;10.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For fluids where break-off is dominated by inertial dynamics, the terms &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; and &#x201c;jetting head assembly&#x201d; refer to the definition of jetting droplets by reference to the Weber number, expressed as &#x3c1;U<sup>2</sup>jetR/&#x3b3;, where &#x3c1; is the fluid density, can be used to introduce a jetting-dripping threshold of We<sub>th</sub>&#x2248;1.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The ability to eject a more precise and/or accurate volume of viscous medium from a given distance at a specific position on a workpiece while in motion are hallmarks of viscous jetting. These characteristics allow the application of relatively highly viscous fluids (e.g., above 1 Pa s) while compensating for a considerable height variation on the workpiece (h=about 0.4 to about 4 mm). The volumes are relatively large compared to ink jet technology (between about 100 pL and about 30 nL) as are the viscosities (viscosities of about or above 1 Pa s).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At least some example implementations of the technology disclosed provide increased speed of application due to the jetting &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d; principle of ejector-based jetting technology applying viscous medium without stopping for each location on the workpiece where viscous medium is to be deposited. Hence, the ability of ejector-based jetting technology of jetting droplets of the viscous medium onto a first (horizontal) surface is performed while the at least one jetting nozzle is in motion without stopping at each location provides an advantage in terms of time savings over capillary needle dispensing technology.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Typically, an ejector is software controlled. The software needs instructions for how to apply the viscous medium to a specific substrate or according to a given (or alternatively, desired or predetermined) jetting schedule or jetting process. These instructions are called a &#x201c;jetting program&#x201d;. Thus, the jetting program supports the process of jetting droplets of viscous medium onto the substrate, which process also may be referred to as &#x201c;jetting operation&#x201d;. The jetting program may be generated by a pre-processing step performed off-line, prior to the jetting operation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As discussed herein, &#x201c;viscous medium&#x201d; may be solder paste, flux, adhesive, conductive adhesive, or any other kind (&#x201c;type&#x201d;) of medium used for fastening components on a substrate, conductive ink, resistive paste, or the like. However, example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein should not be limited to only these examples.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; may be a &#x201c;workpiece.&#x201d; A workpiece may be any carrier, including any carrier of electronic components. A workpiece may include, but is not limited to, a piece of glass, a piece of silicon, a piece of one or more organic material-based substrates, a printed circuit board, a piece of plastic paper, any combination thereof, or any other type of carrier material. A workpiece may be a board (e.g., a printed circuit board (PCB) and/or a flexible PCB), a substrate for ball grid arrays (BGA), chip scale packages (CSP), quad flat packages (QFP), wafers, flip-chips, or the like.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is also to be noted that the term &#x201c;jetting&#x201d; should be interpreted as a non-contact dispensing process that utilizes a fluid jet to form and shoot one or more droplets of a viscous medium from a jet nozzle onto a substrate, as compared to a contact dispensing process, such as &#x201c;fluid wetting.&#x201d; It is also to be noted that the term &#x201c;jetting,&#x201d; and any &#x201c;jetting operation&#x201d; as described herein, may include the incremental jetting of one or more droplets to incrementally form one or more deposits on a substrate. But it will also be understood that the term &#x201c;jetting,&#x201d; and any &#x201c;jetting operation&#x201d; as described herein, is not limited to the incremental jetting of one or more droplets to incrementally form one or more deposits on a substrate. For example, the term &#x201c;jetting,&#x201d; and any &#x201c;jetting operation&#x201d; as described herein, may encompass a &#x201c;screen printing&#x201d; operation, as the term is well-known, for example where a viscous medium is transferred to a substrate so that multiple deposits are formed on a substrate simultaneously or substantially simultaneously (e.g., simultaneously within manufacturing tolerances and/or material tolerances).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The term &#x201c;deposit&#x201d; may refer to a connected amount of viscous medium applied at a position on a workpiece as a result of one or more jetted droplets.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For some example embodiments, the solder paste may include between about 40% and about 60% by volume of solder balls and the rest of the volume may be solder flux.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some example embodiments, the volume percent of solder balls of average size may be in the range of between about 5% and about 40% of the entire volume of solid phase material within the solder paste. In some example embodiments, the average diameter of the first fraction of solder balls may be within the range of between about 2 and about 5 microns, while the average diameter of a second fraction of solder balls may be between about 10 and about 30 microns.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;deposit size&#x201d; refers to the area on the workpiece, such as a substrate, that a deposit will cover. An increase in the droplet volume generally results in an increase in the deposit height as well as the deposit size.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some example embodiments, a jetting device may include a jetting chamber communicating with a supply of viscous medium, and a nozzle (&#x201c;jetting nozzle&#x201d;) communicating with the jetting chamber. The jetting chamber may be at least partially defined by one or more inner surfaces of a housing of the jetting device and one or more surfaces of the jetting nozzle. One or more surfaces of the impacting device, including an impact end surface, may be understood to at least partially define the jetting chamber. Prior to the jetting of a droplet, the jetting chamber may be supplied with viscous medium from the supply of viscous medium. Then, the volume of the jetting chamber may be rapidly reduced (e.g., based on movement of the impacting device through a portion of the housing), causing a well-defined volume and/or mass (&#x201c;amount&#x201d;) of viscous medium to be forced with high velocity out of the orifice or exit hole (&#x201c;outlet orifice&#x201d;) of the jetting nozzle and onto a substrate, thus forming a deposit or dot of viscous medium on the substrate. The jetted amount (e.g., the amount of viscous medium that is forced through the outlet orifice and thus out of the jetting device) is hereinafter referred to as a droplet or a jet.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some example embodiments, the jetting device includes a supply conduit actuator that is configured to move, independently of the impacting device, through at least a portion of the supply conduit, so as to adjust a cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit. The hydrodynamic resistance of at least the portion of the supply conduit, and in some example embodiments the jetting device in general, is adjusted based on the adjustment of the cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit. For example, the hydrodynamic resistance, of at least the portion of the supply conduit through which the supply conduit actuator moves, to flow of viscous medium therethrough, may be controlled and/or increased prior to, during, and subsequently to a portion of a jetting operation wherein the impacting device causes one or more droplets to be jetted from the jetting chamber via the jetting nozzle. As described herein a hydrodynamic resistance of at least a portion of the supply conduit through which the supply conduit actuator moves may be understood to include a hydrodynamic resistance of some or all of the entire supply conduit to viscous flow threrethrough, a hydrodynamic resistance of some or all of the jetting device to viscous flow to or from the jetting chamber and/or jetting nozzle via the supply conduit, a general hydrodynamic resistance of some or all of the jetting device, any combination thereof, or the like. As referred to herein, a viscous medium flow, through at least the portion of the supply conduit through which the supply conduit actuator may move, may include a &#x201c;forward&#x201d; flow of viscous medium into the jetting chamber via the supply conduit and/or a &#x201c;backflow&#x201d; of viscous medium from the jetting chamber and/or the jetting nozzle via the supply conduit (i.e., a flow from the jetting chamber via the supply conduit thereby being a flow that does not pass from the jetting chamber to the jetting nozzle), referred to herein as &#x201c;backflow&#x201d; of viscous medium from the jetting chamber.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some example embodiments, the supply conduit actuator may be controlled to increase the cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit between separate jetting operations, to enable viscous medium flow to the jetting chamber via the supply conduit with a lower hydrodynamic resistance of the supply conduit, to replace (&#x201c;replenish&#x201d;), in the jetting chamber, the volume of viscous medium that is jetted as the one or more droplets during each jetting operation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be understood that the supply conduit actuator may &#x201c;move&#x201d; through a portion of the supply conduit by at least partially &#x201c;extending&#x201d; through at least some of the portion of the supply conduit to thus adjust a cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit. It will be understood that moving through the portion of the supply conduit may include moving through a limited section of the portion of the supply conduit, such that the cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit is changed between two separate values but is not completely closed (e.g., reduced to zero value, or null size, such that the cross-sectional flow area is completely occluded).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As a result of independently controlling the hydrodynamic resistance of at least the portion of the supply conduit through which the supply conduit actuator may move, via controlling the cross-sectional flow area of the portion of the supply conduit via movement of the supply conduit actuator, and separately causing droplets to be jetted via independent control of the impacting device, backflow of viscous medium from the jetting chamber via the supply conduit during the jetting operation may be reduced or minimized, and the properties of droplets jetted during the jetting operation may be more precisely controlled and may be more uniform (&#x201c;consistent&#x201d;) from droplet to droplet, so that the droplets have properties that are more consistent and are more accurate with regard one or more target values of the properties. As a result, the reliability and performance of the jetting device may be improved, and thus the reliability and performance of workpieces formed based on the jetting device jetting the one or more droplets on a substrate may be improved.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some example embodiments, the control of the hydrodynamic resistance via operation (also referred to herein as control and/or adjusting) of the supply conduit actuator may be further based upon sensor data generated by one or more sensor devices monitoring the one or more jetted droplets and/or one or more deposits formed on a substrate as a result of one or more jetted droplets reaching the substrate, so that the hydrodynamic resistance may be adjusted, in a single operation or iteratively after successive jetting operations, to adjust the properties of the jetted droplets to approach or reach one or more target properties based on adjusting the range of movement of the supply conduit actuator during a jetting operation and thus adjusting the restriction of the cross-sectional flow area of at least the portion of the supply conduit through which the supply conduit actuator moves.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a jetting device <b>1</b> according to some example embodiments of the technology disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The jetting device <b>1</b> may be configured to dispense (&#x201c;jet&#x201d;) one or more droplets of a viscous medium onto a substrate (e.g., board <b>2</b>, which may be a &#x201c;workpiece&#x201d;) to generate (&#x201c;establish,&#x201d; &#x201c;form,&#x201d; &#x201c;provide,&#x201d; etc.) a board <b>2</b> having one or more deposits therein.
