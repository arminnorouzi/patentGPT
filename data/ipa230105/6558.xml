In one example, the input voltage may be in the range of 3V to 5.5V and Viso may be 3.3V or 5V. To regulate Viso, the power converter includes a regulation loop which includes a data channel in which data is communicated from the output of the converter through the galvanic isolation barrier to the input side of the converter to be used to control the operating point of the converter. The data channel also is isolated. In some conventional power converters, the regulation loop includes an isolated data channel that is separate from the isolated power channel (i.e., two separate isolation barriers). In the described examples, power and data are isolated through a single isolation barrier.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with the described embodiments, a transformer is used as the isolation barrier. The transformer is shared by both the power channel and the data channel. The data channel includes a detuning circuit on the secondary side of the converter and a receiver circuit on the primary side of the converter. The detuning circuit modulates a resonance on the secondary side of the transformer by, for example, connecting and disconnecting circuit components. In one example (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the components being connected and disconnected from the secondary side are capacitors, but the components can be other than capacitors such as resistors, inductors, or diodes. In one embodiment, the receiver circuit includes an integrator to decode whether a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is transmitted across the data channel. The detuning circuit causes the slew rate on a switch node within the primary side of the converter to be different when a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is transmitted across the data channel than when a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is transmitted. The integrator produces an output signal that is a function of the slew rate on the switch node. The integrator's output signal indicates whether a 0 or a 1 is being transmitted across the data channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an isolated power converter <b>100</b> in accordance with an example embodiment. The isolated power converter <b>100</b> has a primary side <b>105</b> and a secondary side <b>107</b>. The isolated power converter <b>100</b> includes a transformer <b>120</b> that is operable as an isolation transformer to galvanically isolate the primary side <b>105</b> from the secondary side <b>107</b>. The dashed line <b>101</b> delineates the primary side <b>105</b> from the secondary side <b>107</b>. No electrical connection is present between the primary and secondary sides. The terms &#x201c;primary&#x201d; and &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; refer to the primary and secondary inductors of the transformer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The primary side <b>105</b> includes a voltage input <b>111</b> and a data output <b>151</b>. The input voltage provided to the voltage input <b>111</b> is Vin, and the data output signal on the data output <b>151</b> is Data_Out. The secondary side <b>107</b> includes a voltage output <b>131</b> and a data input <b>141</b>. The isolated output voltage from the voltage output <b>131</b> is Viso, and the data input signal provided to the data input <b>141</b> is Data_In. The primary side <b>105</b> includes a primary-side power stage <b>110</b> and a receiver circuit <b>150</b>. The secondary side <b>107</b> includes a secondary-side power stage <b>130</b>, a detuning circuit <b>140</b>, a feedback (F/B) circuit <b>133</b>, and a multiplexer <b>135</b>. The primary side <b>105</b> has a ground Vssp. The secondary side <b>107</b> has a ground Vsss. The grounds Vssp and Vsss are isolated from each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The transformer <b>120</b> has a primary winding <b>121</b> and a secondary winding <b>122</b>. The primary-side power stage <b>110</b> receives Vin and the output of the primary-side power stage is coupled to the primary winding <b>121</b> of the transformer <b>120</b>. The secondary-side power stage <b>130</b> is coupled to the secondary winding <b>122</b> of the transformer <b>120</b> and generates the isolated output voltage Viso. A voltage Vin provided to the primary-side power stage <b>110</b> results in an isolated output voltage Viso being generated by the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b>. The voltages Vin and Viso do not share the same ground and are galvanically isolated from each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (described below) provides example implementations of the primary-side power stage <b>110</b> and the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Feedback circuit <b>133</b> receives Viso and generates a control (C) bit. In one example, Viso is compared to a reference voltage to generate the control bit (C equal to 0 means that Viso is smaller than the reference voltage, and C equal to 1 means that Viso is greater than the reference voltage). The control bits are communicated through the transformer <b>120</b> to control the operation of the power converter to maintain Viso at a regulated voltage level. Data_In is a serial bit stream that represents data that may be unrelated to the control bits. The data bits (D) of Data_In are provided to an input of a multiplexer <b>135</b> along with the control bits (C). Logic (not shown) generates a selection signal to control the input selection of the multiplexer <b>135</b>. The C and D bits are time-division multiplexed together by multiplexer <b>135</b> and the resulting interleaved C/D bit stream (DATA1) is provided to the detuning circuit <b>140</b>. The time division multiplexed C/D bit stream DATA1 is transferred through the transformer <b>120</b> to the primary side of the transformer. In another embodiment, DATA1 is one of the C bits or the D bits and is not a multiplexed series of C and D bits.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The detuning circuit <b>140</b> changes an electrical characteristic of the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b> depending on the voltage level of DATA1, and thus depending on the voltage level of Data_In. The change in the electrical characteristic of the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b> causes a change in an electrical characteristic in the primary-side power stage <b>110</b>. The receiver circuit <b>150</b> detects the change in the electrical characteristic in the primary-side power stage <b>110</b> to recover the data being transmitted across the transformer <b>120</b>. In one embodiment (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the detuning circuit <b>140</b> changes the resonant frequency of the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b>. The change in the resonant frequency of the secondary-side power stage <b>130</b> causes a change in a voltage slew rate within the primary-side power stage <b>110</b>. The receiver circuit <b>150</b> includes an integrator which integrates the voltage within the primary-side power stage to thereby generate an integration signal. The change in the voltage's slew rate results in a different magnitude of the integration signal. The integration signal represents the data (DATA1) being transmitted across the transformer <b>120</b>. Data_Out includes DATA1 which can be demultiplexed to recover the C bits separate from the D bits. The C bits are used to control the primary-side power stage (e.g., to turn it on if C equals 0 and to turn it off if C equals 1). The D bits are provided to and consumed by logic (not shown).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic circuit depicting one embodiment for the implementation of the block diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this example, the primary-side power stage <b>110</b> includes transistors M<b>2</b>-M<b>4</b>, gate drivers <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, and oscillator <b>210</b>. Transistors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> are N-type metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (NMOS transistors). Transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> are P-type metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (PMOS transistors). Transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> are cross-coupled with the gate of each transistor coupled to the drain of the other transistor. The sources of transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> are coupled together and to Vin. The drains of transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>2</b> are coupled together, and the drains of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>3</b> are coupled together. The connection between the drains of transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>2</b> is a switch node (also referred to as a &#x201c;switch terminal&#x201d;) labeled VP<b>1</b>. The connection between the drains of transistors M<b>5</b> and M<b>3</b> is a switch node labeled VP<b>2</b>. The sources of transistors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> are coupled together and to ground VSSP.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Transistor M<b>4</b> is driven by the voltage of switch node VP<b>2</b>, and transistor M<b>5</b> is driven by the voltage of switch node VP<b>1</b>. Transistors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> are actively driven by oscillator <b>210</b>. Oscillator <b>210</b> generates oscillation signals G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>. Oscillation signal G<b>1</b> is coupled to the gate of transistor M<b>2</b> via gate driver <b>212</b>. Oscillation signal G<b>2</b> is coupled to the gate of transistor M<b>3</b> via gate driver <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows example waveforms for oscillation signals G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>. When oscillation signal G<b>1</b> is high (and, accordingly, transistor M<b>2</b> is on), oscillation signal G<b>2</b> is low (and, accordingly, transistor M<b>3</b> is off). Similarly, when oscillation signal G<b>2</b> is high (and transistor M<b>3</b> is on), oscillation signal G<b>1</b> is low (and transistor M<b>2</b> is off). The oscillator <b>210</b> implements a &#x201c;dead time&#x201d; (DT) after turning off one transistor and before turning on the other transistor to ensure that both transistors are not on at the same time. The frequency of the oscillation signals G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> produced by the oscillator <b>210</b> may be in the range of 1 MHz to 500 MHz. In another embodiment, rather than transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> being cross-coupled to each other, transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> can be actively driven by oscillator <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The voltage on the switch nodes VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b> toggles between Vin (e.g., 3.3V, 5V, etc.) and Vssp. When oscillation signal G<b>2</b> is high and G<b>1</b> is low, transistor M<b>3</b> is on and transistor M<b>2</b> is off. With transistor M<b>3</b> being on, switch node VP<b>2</b> is pulled down to Vssp. Switch node VP<b>2</b> being ground (Vssp) also causes PMOS transistor M<b>4</b> to be turned on thereby pulling switch node VP<b>1</b> up to Vin.

With transistor M<b>2</b> being on, switch node VP<b>1</b> is pulled down to Vssp. Switch node VP<b>1</b> being low also causes PMOS transistor M<b>5</b> to be turned on thereby pulling switch node VP<b>2</b> up to Vin.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The instantaneous voltage on each switch node VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b> is a square wave having the same frequency as the oscillation signals G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> from the oscillator <b>210</b>. The average voltage on each switch node is DUTY*Vin, where &#x201c;DUTY&#x201d; is the duty cycle of transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b>. That is, during each period of G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b>, transistors M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> are on for a fraction (the duty cycle) of the period. For example, if M<b>4</b> has a duty cycle of 0.75 (75%), then the average voltage on switch node VP<b>1</b> is 0.75*Vin. In one example, the average voltage on switch node VP<b>2</b> is equal to the average voltage on switch node VP<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Primary winding <b>121</b> of transformer <b>120</b> has terminals <b>121</b><i>a </i>and <b>121</b><i>b</i>.

The signal on connection point <b>153</b> is a signal labeled INTEG.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The voltage on switch node VP<b>1</b> is the gate voltage of transistor M<b>1</b>. The magnitude of the drain current through transistor M<b>1</b> is controlled by the gate-to-source voltage (Vgs) of transistor M<b>1</b>. While the voltage on the switch node VP<b>1</b> is high enough to keep transistor M<b>1</b> on, current flows through transistor M<b>1</b> to the capacitor C<b>1</b>. As the capacitor C<b>1</b> charges, the voltage across C<b>1</b> (the INTEG signal) increases. Upon a transition of the voltage on the switch node VP<b>1</b> from a higher level to a lower level (and at a slew rate that is influenced by the detuning circuit <b>140</b>), the voltage on the gate of transistor M<b>1</b> decreases. Despite a falling gate voltage, the voltage across capacitor C<b>1</b> continues to increase as drain current through transistor M<b>1</b> continues to flow (albeit a diminishing drain current due to a decreasing Vgs of transistor M<b>1</b>). Upon the Vgs of transistor M<b>1</b> falling below its threshold voltage (Vt), the drain current through transistor to capacitor C<b>1</b> ceases. Thus, the voltage magnitude of INTEG when transistor M<b>1</b> turns off is a function of, among other factors, the slew rate of the voltage on switch node VP<b>1</b>.

The switch node voltage VP<b>1</b> is shown transitioning from a logic high to a logic low at falling edge <b>405</b> and then back to the logic high level. The rate at which the switch node voltage decreases during falling edge <b>405</b> is affected by the detuning circuit <b>140</b>. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a falling edge <b>405</b> for VP<b>1</b> that corresponds to a data bit equal to a &#x201c;V&#x201d; which caused the switches SW<b>1</b> and SW<b>2</b> to be open (off). With switches SW<b>1</b> and SW<b>2</b> open, the circuit path is open between the terminals <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the secondary winding <b>122</b> of the transformer <b>120</b> and Vsss. As a result of electrically disconnecting the capacitors C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> from the secondary winding <b>122</b>, the resonant frequency of the secondary winding is altered which results in a smaller slew rate of the falling edge of the switch node VP<b>1</b> (as well as switch node VP<b>2</b>) during the falling and rising edges of the switch node voltage. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the difference in voltage of VP<b>1</b> (dy) during the falling edge <b>405</b> is 2.409V during a time period (dx) of 2.047 ns, which corresponds to an average slope of 1.177 GV/s.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, waveform <b>402</b> is the sample-and-hold output SH<b>0</b>, which is a previously sampled and held INTEG signal for a previously known 0-bit.

Reference numeral <b>412</b> identifies the point at which the VP<b>1</b> voltage has dropped low enough that transistor M<b>1</b> is turned off. Once transistor M<b>1</b> turns off, drain current through transistor M<b>1</b> to capacitor C<b>1</b> ceases and the remaining voltage on C<b>1</b> represents an integration of the VP<b>1</b> voltage between time points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b>&#x2014;that is, from the time that the integrator is enabled to the time that transistor M<b>1</b> turns off. The magnitude of INTEG is therefore a function of the area <b>425</b> under the waveform <b>401</b>. The area <b>425</b> is a function of the slew rate of the falling edge <b>405</b> of the VP<b>1</b> voltage.

Waveform <b>503</b> is the SHn output of the sample-and-hold <b>220</b>, and waveform <b>504</b> is the signal INTEG. The falling edge <b>505</b> of the VP<b>1</b> waveform <b>501</b> begins at point <b>510</b>. At point <b>512</b>, the VP<b>1</b> voltage is low enough so as to turn off transistor M<b>1</b>. The slope of the falling edge <b>505</b> is characterized in this example by a difference in voltage of VP<b>1</b> (<i>dy</i>) during the falling edge of 2.416V during a time period (dx) of 1.483 ns, which corresponds to an average slope of 1.628 GV/s. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the average slope during the falling edge of the VP<b>1</b> switch node voltage is 1.177 GV/s for a data bit equal to a &#x201c;0,&#x201d; while the average slope during the falling edge of the switch node voltage is 1.628 GV/s for a data bit equal to a &#x201c;0&#x201d; Accordingly, the average slope is larger for data bit equal to 1 than for a data bit equal to 0. Because the slope is higher for a 1-data bit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) than for a 0-data bit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the area <b>525</b> under the curve of the VP<b>1</b> switch node waveform <b>501</b> during falling edge <b>505</b> for a 1-data bit is smaller than the corresponding area <b>425</b> for a 0-data bit. The integrator <b>152</b> within the receiver circuit <b>150</b> thus the capacitor C<b>1</b> receives charge current from transistor M<b>1</b> for a smaller period of time (e.g., 1.483 ns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> compared to 2.047 ns in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) thereby resulting in a smaller magnitude of INTEG once INTEG settles following point <b>512</b> when transistor M<b>1</b> shuts off. Upon transistor M<b>1</b> turning off, the magnitude of INTEG settles at 650 mV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> but at only 535 mV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As such, in this example the voltage on SHn is 650 mV for a 0-data bit, and is 535 mV for a 1-data bit. For a 1-data bit, the comparator <b>222</b> outputs a logic high for Data_Out because the magnitude of SH<b>0</b> (for a previously known 0-data bit) is larger than the magnitude of SHn for a 1-data bit.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Because the comparator <b>222</b> compares the sample and held magnitude of INTEG for each data bit being transmitted to a sampled and held magnitude of INTEG for a known bit (e.g., a 0-data bit), the receiver circuit <b>150</b> is generally immune to variations across temperature, process, or voltage.

In this example, the power converter <b>700</b> provides an operating voltage for a gate driver <b>751</b> of a high side (HS) transistor. The HS transistor is coupled to a low side (LS) transistor at a switch node (SW). the HS and LS transistors may be controlled to produce a signal on the switch node to drive a load (e.g., a motor). Gate driver <b>751</b> receives an input signal (from logic, not shown) and drives the gate of the HS transistor. Similarly, gate driver <b>752</b> receives an input signal (from logic, not shown) and drives the gate of the LS transistor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The power terminals to the gate driver <b>751</b> are connected to Viso and Vsss as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. The ground terminal (Vsss) of the gate drier <b>751</b> is also connected to the switch node SW between the HS and LS transistors. The drain of the HS transistor is copied to a voltage node V_hi. In one example, V_hi is larger than Viso. For example, Viso may be 3.3V or 5V and V_hi may be 1000V. The source of the LS transistor is connected to a ground <b>759</b>, which may be different than ground Vssp. The HS and LS transistors are switched on and off, but both transistors are not turned on simultaneously. When the LS transistor is on, Vsss is pulled to ground <b>759</b> through the LS transistor. When the HS transistor is on, Vsss is pulled up to V_hi through the HS transistor. Thus, the voltage on the isolated ground Vsss of the power converter <b>700</b> may have a substantial voltage swing due to the operation of the load (e.g., the HS and LS transistors in this example) and the supply voltage provided to the load.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a graph of the voltage difference between the secondary side ground Vsss and the primary side ground Vssp (Vsss-Vssp). When the LS transistor is turned off and the HS transistor on, the voltage on the switch node SW increases rapidly from ground <b>759</b> to V_hi. Because Vsss is the same potential as the switch node SW, Vsss also increases from the potential of ground <b>759</b> to V_hi, and thus the Vsss-Vssp increases as depicted by rising edge <b>780</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. The magnitude of the increase in Vsss-Vssp occurs over a short period of time&#x2014;the period of time the transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> take to change their power state (from off to on, and vice versa). The substantial and rapid change in the potential difference between Vsss and Vssp causes a common mode transient current <b>760</b> to flow from the ground node Vsss and through the secondary winding of the transformer <b>730</b>. The transient current then induces a corresponding common mode transient current <b>761</b> in the primary winding of the transformer <b>730</b>, which then flows through the primary side ground node Vssp. A common mode transient current also flows in the opposite direction from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> when the LS transistor is turned which rapidly pulls the switch node voltage down to ground <b>759</b> resulting a rapid and large decrease in Vsss-Vssp (falling edge <b>781</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>).

Transient <b>812</b> has a larger slope of 100V/ns, and transient <b>813</b> has an even larger slope of 200V/ns. Different slopes may result from the different values of switch node parasitic capacitance, which varies with the rating and technology of HS and LS transistors. Other reasons for different slopes include different system-level disturbances. The decreasing slopes for the falling edge of Vsss-Vssp have similar absolute value slopes as for the rising edge of Vsss-Vssp (e.g., &#x2212;50V/ns for transient <b>831</b>, &#x2212;100V/bs for transient <b>832</b>, and &#x2212;200V/ns for transient <b>833</b>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The CMT currents injected in the switch nodes VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>0</b> change the instantaneous values of the node currents from the value established by the transformer current.

In this example, oscillator <b>925</b> also generates the control signals to operate switches SW<b>91</b>, SW<b>93</b>, and SW<b>95</b> to cause sample-and-hold elements <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, and <b>913</b> to sequentially sample and then hold the magnitude of the INTEG signal on their respective capacitors C<b>91</b>, C<b>93</b>, and C<b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Switches SW<b>96</b>-SW<b>98</b> are controlled by a single control signal, AVERAGE. Accordingly, all three switches SW<b>96</b>-SW<b>98</b> are all on (open) or all off (closed). The AVERAGE signal is generated by a digital circuit (not shown) clocked on the same time-base of the switching signals (e.g., G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>), which generates sequentially the sampling signals and the AVERAGE signal. While the signal INTEG signal is being sampled sequentially by each of the three sample-and-hold elements, the AVERAGE signal causes the switches SW<b>96</b>-SW<b>98</b> to be off. After the sample-and-hold elements <b>911</b>-<b>913</b> have sampled the INTEG signal on their respective capacitors, the AVERAGE signal causes the switches SW<b>96</b>-SW<b>98</b> to be closed to thereby cause at least some of the charge from the capacitors C<b>91</b>, C<b>93</b>, and C<b>95</b> to be transferred to capacitor C<b>99</b>. The averaging takes place as follows. The previous residual charge stored in capacitor C<b>99</b> (from a previous averaging event) is &#x201c;QRES&#x201d; which is equal to C<b>99</b>*V(AVG_OUT) (&#x201c;C<b>99</b>&#x201d; is the capacitance of capacitor C<b>99</b> and &#x201c;V(AVG_OUT)&#x201d; is the voltage of AVG_OUT). The charge Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, and Q<b>3</b> stored on the sampling capacitors C<b>91</b>, C<b>93</b>, and C<b>95</b>, respectively, can be expressed as Q<b>1</b>=C<b>91</b> *V(SH<b>1</b>), Q<b>2</b>=C<b>93</b>*V(SH<b>2</b>), Q<b>3</b>=C<b>95</b>*V(SH<b>3</b>). As the switches SW<b>96</b>, SW<b>97</b>, and SW<b>98</b> are closed, the total charge QTOT is equal to (QRES+Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>+Q<b>3</b>). Assuming that the capacitances of C<b>91</b>, C<b>93</b> and C<b>95</b> are approximately equal to each other (a value of &#x201c;CS&#x201d;) and that the capacitance of C<b>99</b> is substantially smaller, QTOT will be approximately equal to (Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>+Q<b>3</b>) and after the averaging event V(AVG_OUT) will equal QTOT/CTOT (where &#x201c;CTOT&#x201d; is C<b>91</b>+C<b>93</b>+C<b>95</b>, which is equal to 3*CS). Accordingly, V(AVG_OUT) will be equal to (V(SH<b>1</b>)+V(SH<b>2</b>)+V(SH<b>3</b>))/3. The voltage (AVG_OUT) on capacitor C<b>99</b> is the SHn output that is provided to the comparator <b>220</b>, as explained above.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is the switching waveforms for the switch node VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b> voltages and illustrates that M instances of a data bit (D) are transmitted followed by a N instances of a control bit (C). In one example, the resonance on the secondary winding of the transformer is maintained in accordance with the data (or control) bit to span M switching cycles. In another example, the resonance is maintained for a number of switching cycles equal to M plus Y, where Y is a number of switching cycles preceding the data (or control) bit to allow for the operating state of the converter to settle. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, M is 6, but M can be other than 6 in other implementations. In some embodiments, the value of N may be equal to M. In other embodiments, M and N are not equal to each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> A, a data bit D is transmitted during 6 consecutive switching cycles (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). N consecutive instances of a control bit are then transmitted following the end of switching cycle 6. The control bits control the operation of the power converter. For example, and as explained above, the control bits form a part of a control loop to regulate the magnitude of Viso. In one embodiment, the data bits are unrelated to the control of the power converter itself. A device (e.g., a sensor) coupled to the secondary side <b>107</b> of the converter provides a serial bit stream Data_In to be transmitted through the isolation barrier provided by the transformer <b>120</b> to a device (e.g., a processor) coupled to the primary side <b>105</b> of the converter.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrates the use of two integrators <b>1010</b> and <b>1015</b>. Integrator <b>1010</b> is coupled to and integrates the falling edges of switch node VP<b>1</b>, and integrator <b>1015</b> is coupled to and integrates the falling edges of switch node VP<b>2</b>. Because the switching waveforms of VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b> are alternating (VP<b>1</b> has a falling edge when VP<b>2</b> has a rising edge, and VP<b>2</b> has a falling edge when VP<b>1</b> has a rising edge), an integration can be performed with each falling edge of both VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b>. In one example, the M instances of a data bit D are recovered from the VP<b>1</b> and VP<b>2</b> switch nodes. Integrator <b>1010</b> integrates the voltage on switch node VP<b>1</b> during switching cycles 1, 3, and 5.

The primary can determine when a control bit or a data is being sent based on the number of switching cycles which have passed. There might be up to x switching periods of error which can be mitigated by adding x switching periods of tolerance to the data/control framing. This can be accounted for at design time based on how repeatable it is to have the secondary side recognize the first edge created by the primary on the transformer.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In previously described embodiments, SH<b>0</b> is the sampled and held INTEG signal when a bit being transmitted through the converter is known to be a 0.
