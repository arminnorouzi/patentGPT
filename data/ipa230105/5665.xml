No. 9,384,895. The film capacitor was determined to have the following attributes:</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">Film: a densified ePTFE film having a nominal 4 &#x3bc;m thickness.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">Nominal un-encapsulated capacitor dimensions: 27 mm width, 34 mm diameter, 30 mm height</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">Capacitance: The capacitor was wound to obtain a nominal 20 &#x3bc;F value.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">Pre-encapsulation preparation procedure: The following pre-encapsulation preparation procedure was performed: Two metal terminals were attached to each end of the capacitor at the end-spray. The capacitor was subjected to a &#x201c;grind and sand&#x201d; treatment (e.g., using a dremel tool, sandpaper, or other friction-based treatment), to remove weld spatter from upper and lower terminations and to remove any lips, overhangs or sharp edges in the end-spray/termination weld area. The connection interfaces of the terminations were masked. Each termination/end spray area was sand-blasted as needed to remove sharp edges.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">End-spray coating: A solution of 40% by weight PVDF copolymer (Arkema Kynar Flex&#xae; 3030-10) was dissolved in NMP (N-methyl-pyrrolidone). 40 grams of the PVDF copolymer was poured into a flask along with 60 grams of the NMP. Using a stir plate and bar, the flask was covered and mixed at room temperature until all PVDF copolymer was dissolved in solution (the dissolution took less than 24 hours). A nominal 0.1 mm thickness of the coating of the copolymer solution was applied. The coating of the copolymer solution covered the end-spray on each end of the capacitor and around the edges of the terminations, such that the end spray and the termination/end spray weld spot were coated. The coating was cured for minimum of 72 hours at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">Injection molding: The capacitor was overmolded using molding technology where the bare capacitor was mounted concentrically with a cylindrical molding cavity at the terminal points with a nominal 1 mm clearance around the rest of the capacitor. The electrical connection ends of the terminals were prevented from being covered by polymer during molding. Mold vents and flow ports were prepared such that air was purged from the cavity during molding and any pressure from the polymer flow was distributed uniformly around a circumference of the capacitor. With the capacitor installed in the mold cavity a mold was preheated until the mold reached a uniform nominal temperature of 150&#xb0; C. An injection molding machine was used such that the polymer (Arkema Kynar Flex&#xae; 3030-10) flowed from its injection nozzle/port at a nominal temperature of 200&#xb0; C. The injection molding machine was purged as needed to clear any air. With the mold at 150&#xb0; C., polymer was injected into the mold's injection port at a rate of 1.5 to 3 cc/second until the polymer completely filled the cavity. The mold temperature was maintained at 150&#xb0; C. for a minimum of 10 minutes then allowed to cool to room temperature. The molded capacitor was removed from the mold and residual polymer was trimmed as needed so the encapsulated shape matched the cylindrical shape of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">The following measurements were made.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Temperature cycling testing for encapsulation integrity: Encapsulated devices were evaluated for temperature cycling per JEDEC Standard JESD22-A104C for single chamber temperature cycling using test condition H, soak mode 4 and a cycle rate &#x3e;0.1 cycles/hour for a total of 1000 cycles. Under visual inspection without magnification, there were no visible cracks in the coating/packaging.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Humidity exposure testing for encapsulation integrity: The capacitor terminals were protected from moisture exposure. The device comprising the capacitor was exposed per MIL-STD-202G Method 103 Test Condition C. Immediately after exposure, the device's insulation resistance (&#x201c;IR&#x201d;) was measured per IEC Standard 60384-1 Section 4.5 Test A. Per this measurement, the device maintained an insulation resistance greater than 20 Giga &#x3a9;&#xb7;F.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">Dielectric Withstand Voltage: A dielectric withstand voltage test was conducted per MIL-STD-202, Method 301 with settings of: 500 V DC for terminal-to-terminal test 1500 V AC at 60 Hz for terminal-to-case test. There was no visible or detectable evidence of damage, momentary or intermittent arcing, or other indication of electrical breakdown.
