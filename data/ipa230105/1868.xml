Given the increasing prevalence of autonomous driving and the integration of enhanced safety and entertainment technologies, it is not uncommon for standard vehicles now to possess in excess of 150 electronic control units (ECUs). This has meant power supply circuits within the EEA have become increasingly important in modern vehicles, and the increase in autonomous driving technologies has accelerated this further.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this respect, a loss of power and resulting deactivation of certain functions within the EEA would be unacceptable. For example, a loss of power to critical steering or braking modules due to a fault in the EEA could be catastrophic and lead to accidents, particularly if the vehicle is operating in an autonomous drive mode. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate various safety devices into the EEA to mitigate the risk of loss of power to such critical modules.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As part of the above, it may sometimes also be necessary to disconnect the power supply to certain non-critical modules due to electrical failures in the power distribution, such as a short circuit. This is sometimes required to preserve the power supply or avoid interference to critical modules, as well as to prevent further damage to the EEA which could be quite severe, such as a thermal overload of cables leading to an electrical fire.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are however shortcomings with existing architectures. In particular, conventional architectures require a balance to be struck between handling the above electrical malfunctions to secure the overall safety of the EEA, whilst maintaining the continued operation of certain critical functions under such failure situations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further consideration is the weight of the wiring harness itself. With conventional architectures, greater safety functionality typically requires more independent connections to the vehicle's power distribution unit or fuse box. This results in increased wiring, which not only increases wiring harness costs, but also reduces the vehicle's fuel efficiency due to the weight.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved vehicle power supply circuit for addressing the above shortcomings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, there is provided a vehicle power supply circuit including: a power source input for receiving an input current having an input voltage; and a first branch and a second branch, each branch being connected to the power source input and including: a converter for converting the input current to an output current, and a first distribution unit connected to the respective converter for receiving the output current and including a plurality of first outputs for supplying power to a plurality of loads.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this way, a power distribution assembly may be provided in which different loads may be powered by separate branches of the power distribution architecture. Each branch may thereby provide a suitable power supply output current. For instance, the output may be a current at an operating voltage different from the input voltage. Accordingly, with separate power supplies, such as DC/DC converters, servicing independent branches, if there is a fault in one branch, this will not affect the loads supplied by the other branch. This thereby allows for redundancy to be built into the EE architecture. For instance, power to a non-critical module on one branch may be disconnected without compromising the power supply to a critical module on another branch. Furthermore, the provision of more than one power distribution unit or fuse box provides for reduced wiring requirements because these distribution locations may be located closer to their respective nodes. As such, a scalable zonal EE architecture may be provided, for example, which can distribute power from a high voltage power source, such as an electric vehicle's battery, through a plurality of branches, with each branch providing the operating voltage independently.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In embodiments the first and second branches have corresponding converters and corresponding first distribution units. In this way, a mirrored arrangement may be provided, thereby allowing the two branches to service corresponding loads. For example, the second branch may provide power to corresponding modules to those provided by the first branch, with functionality distributed or mirrored across those modules.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In embodiments at least one of the loads supplied by the first distribution unit of the first branch is a primary module, and at least one of the loads supplied by the first distribution unit of the second branch is a back-up module to the primary module. In this way, a critical module, such as the steering module, may be provided as a primary module, and a back-up to that module, such as another steering module, may be provided as a redundancy. Accordingly, in the event of a power supply disruption on the first branch which compromises the function of the primary module, the back-up module may be activated to maintain operation of, for instance, steering functions. This thereby ensures a vehicle's critical safety functions may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In embodiments, the vehicle power supply circuit further includes the primary module and the back-up module, wherein the primary module is connected to the first branch and the back-up module is connected to the second branch. In this way, the modules may form part of the power distribution circuit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In embodiments, at least one of the plurality of loads is connected to the first distribution units of both the first and second branches for being supplied power thereby. In this way, certain loads, such as safety critical modules, may receive power from either branch, thereby providing redundancy for maintaining operation of those modules.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In embodiments, the vehicle power supply circuit further includes a back-up energy store connected to at least one of the first distribution units for supplying power to its respective plurality of first outputs in the absence of the output current from the respective converter. In this way, an energy store, such as a battery or supercapacitor, may be used to provide a back-up if there is an issue with the normal branch supply.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In embodiments, at least one of the first outputs of the first distribution units includes a circuit protection device for disconnecting a respective load from the output. In this way, a fuse or e-fuse for example may be used to selectively disconnect a load if a short circuit occurs. In embodiments, the circuit protection device is an electronic fuse. As such e-fuses provide a faster and more precise response than a melting fuse, this may thereby allow for reduced wiring thicknesses to be used, leading to additional cost and weight savings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the first and second branches includes a switch for selectively disconnecting the respective first distribution units from the respective converter. In this way, a branch may be selectively connected or disconnected to allow loads or modules connected to that branch to be activated or deactivated as required.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In embodiments, the vehicle power supply circuit further includes a second distribution unit connected to one of the first outputs of the first branch and including a plurality of second outputs for supplying power to a plurality of second loads. In this way, a zonal architecture may be provided, allowing the second distribution units to be located in a region of the vehicle closer to its associated loads. This in turn allows shorter wiring to be used, thereby saving both weight and cost could be achieved and the complexity of the wiring harness could be reduced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments, the second distribution unit is further connected to one of the first outputs of the second branch, and wherein the plurality of second outputs includes at least one dual power second output, wherein the dual power second output is connected to the first outputs of both the first and second branches for receiving power for supplying its respective second load. In this way, certain second loads, such as safety critical loads, may be protected by a dual power supply. As such, operation can be maintained even if there is a fault on one of the power supply branches.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In embodiments, the plurality of second outputs further include at least one single power second output, wherein the single power second output is connected to the first output of one of the first and second branches for receiving power for supplying their respective second loads. In this way, different loads may be supported by different single power supply branches.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments, at least one of the second outputs of the second distribution units includes a circuit protection device for disconnecting a respective load from the output. In this way, a fuse or e-fuse for example may be used to selectively disconnect a load if a short circuit occurs. In embodiments, the circuit protection device is an electronic fuse.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In embodiments, the vehicle power supply circuit further includes a plurality of second distribution units, wherein the plurality of second distribution units are for location at different zones of the vehicle. In this way, not only may less wiring be used, but the provision of a plurality of second distribution units allows functions to be split across multiple distribution units powered by independent power supply branches. This may thereby allow functionality to substantially maintained in the event of a single power supply fault.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In embodiments, at least one of the second outputs of the second distribution units in different zones are for supplying power to corresponding second loads associated with the respective vehicle zone. In this way, common vehicle functions in different regions may be powered independently. For example, if a lighting unit on one side of the vehicle is deactivated due to a fault, operation of the corresponding lighting unit on the other side of the vehicle may be maintained if this is supplied thorough a different second power distribution unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other embodiments, further branches may be provided. In this way, additional power supply branches may be provided depending on the architecture requirements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a second aspect, there is provided a vehicle power supply circuit including: a power source input for receiving an input current having an input voltage; and a first branch and a second branch, each branch being connected to the power source input and including a converter for converting the input current to an output current; and a distribution unit connected to the converters of the first and second branches for receiving their output currents and including a plurality of outputs for supplying power to a plurality of loads, wherein the outputs include at least one dual power output, and wherein the dual power output is connected to both the first and second branches for receiving power for supplying their respective loads.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this way, a power distribution assembly may be provided in which two separate power supply branches are provided for feeding a common distribution unit. Accordingly, certain second loads, such as safety critical loads, may be protected by a dual power supply, each of which may provide a suitable power supply output current. For instance, the output may be a current at an operating voltage different from the input voltage. As such, operation can be maintained even if there is a fault on one of the power supply branches.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Illustrative embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a vehicle power distribution circuit according to a first illustrative embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a vehicle power distribution circuit according to second embodiment, overlaid a vehicle floorplan; and</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show further schematic illustrations of vehicle power distribution circuits according to further illustrative embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure relates to a vehicle power supply circuit and power distribution architecture.

The second diode <b>14</b><i>b </i>prevents current from being drawn from the first branch <b>1</b><i>a </i>through to the second subset of secondary outputs <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the first and second subsets <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are conductively isolated from one another. The third subset of secondary outputs <b>17</b> are connected to the power rail <b>15</b> between the first and second diodes <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>. As such, these secondary outputs <b>17</b> are able to draw current from both the first and second branches <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In use, the illustrative arrangement provides a scalable power supply for a zonal vehicle architecture. Firstly, high power loads <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>may be supplied by the primary outputs <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>of different branches. As the operating voltage in each branch is supplied by an independent converter <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, this thereby allows for improved safety and isolation between the modules. For example, if one of the loads <b>10</b><i>a </i>is a steering module, which is safety critical to the operation of the vehicle, a corresponding back-up safety module <b>10</b><i>b </i>may be provided on the other branch. As such, the second branch <b>1</b><i>b </i>may effectively mirror the first branch <b>1</b><i>a </i>and provide back-up protection in the event that the power supply through the first branch <b>1</b><i>a </i>is compromised. Consequently, no single fault can result in the disruption of a safety critical load.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Secondly, the distribution boxes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>allow further secondary loads to be supplied. Importantly, the distribution boxes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>may be located in different zones of the vehicle for providing a localised power supply hub for loads in these regions. For instance, distribution boxes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>may be provided in the four corners of the vehicle for supplying lights, comfort, and control functions in those regions. In addition, a fifth distribution box <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>may be provided, for instance, in the vehicle's doors or tailgate for powering lights and actuators. This allows for strategic placement of power distribution hubs to reduce the total wiring requirement.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thirdly, the provision of both single and dual powered secondary outputs at the distribution boxes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c</i>, as well as the provision of multiple distribution boxes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>allows functions to be maintained by different branches <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the power supply circuit <b>100</b>. Accordingly, loads supplied by one of the first or second subsets <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>of secondary outputs <b>17</b> are isolated from disturbances that may occur on the other branch <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Moreover, a load connected to one of the third subset of secondary outputs <b>17</b> is afforded a dual power supply, thereby providing redundancy in the supplied power for maintaining operation even if one of the branches fails.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further illustrative embodiments will now be described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>7</b></figref>. In these example, various configurations of vehicle power distribution circuits are shown with different numbers of zones and power distribution units for accommodating various sizes and complexities of EE architectures.

In this case, two power supplies <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>are used to support loads <b>10</b> through first distribution units <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, as well as through three downstream secondary distribution units <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c</i>. As shown in context of the vehicle floorplan, the arrangement provides for optimised positioning of units, better power distribution, and shorter cabling to supported components. As such, a low cost, customizable, and scalable power distribution solution may be provided.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a vehicle power distribution circuit for a two zone EE architecture, with loads <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>being sub-zone controllers for two door modules. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a vehicle power distribution circuit for a three zone EE architecture. In this arrangement, the sub-zone controllers <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>are supplied from the secondary distribution units <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, with the tailgate module having a dual power supply through the respective secondary distribution unit <b>13</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a similar power distribution circuit to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, except that a further back-up battery supply <b>11</b><i>b </i>is provided, and further sub-zone controllers <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>in the form of left and right rear door modules are fed from the secondary distribution units <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show two variants of power distribution circuits for four zone EE architectures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the load <b>10</b><i>e </i>receives a dual power supply, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the tailgate module <b>10</b><i>f </i>is supplied through a dual-power supply from secondary distribution units <b>13</b><i>c</i>, <b>13</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, embodiments of the invention may provide power distribution circuits in different scaled arrangements for various zonal EE architecture configurations. As such, vehicles with different equipment levels may be accommodated. Furthermore, arrangements can also be scaled for supporting special requirements based on Functional Safety (FuSa) or autonomous driving concepts. Moreover, embodiments may be applied to different powertrain systems, such as full electric, hybrid, and combustion engine vehicles.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be understood that the embodiment illustrated above show an application only for the purposes of illustration. In practice, embodiments may be applied to many different configurations, the detailed embodiments being straightforward for those skilled in the art to implement.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, embodiments may incorporate smart prefuse boxes, conventional melting fuse boxes, or hybrid circuit protection systems which comprise both convention and smart fuses.
