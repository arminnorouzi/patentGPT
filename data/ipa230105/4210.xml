Operational chips used in mining machines generally adopt a series connection structure for signals and a series connection structure for power supply, so that control information enters the chips from a bottom chip (which is the operational chip closest to the ground GND in the series connection structure for power supply), and is delivered layer by layer through various operational chips to a top chip (which is the operational chip closest to the power input terminal Vcc). The power supply for the operational chips uses a conventional power supply mode of power supply for computer hosts, and uses a voltage of about 12V (some use a voltage of about 15V-18V).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the structure of a conventional operational circuit. In terms of communication signals, various operational chips <b>11</b> in calculation board <b>1</b> are connected in series, and an operational chip <b>11</b> at an end of the series-connected operational chips <b>11</b> is communicatively connected to control chip <b>21</b> in control board <b>2</b>. In terms of power supply, various operational chips <b>11</b> in the calculation board <b>1</b> are connected in a manner which include both series connections and parallel connections to form a multilayer series circuit for power supply of the operational chips. For example, various operational chips <b>11</b> may be grouped into several groups; in each group of operational chips <b>11</b>, various operational chips <b>11</b> are connected in series between the power input terminal Vcc and the ground GND through respective power ports, that is, in each pair of adjacent operational chips <b>11</b>, the negative terminal GND_OUT of a preceding operational chip <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the power supply terminal Vcc_IN of a following operational chip <b>11</b>; the power supply terminal Vcc_IN of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc is electrically connected to the power input terminal Vcc, and the negative terminal GND_OUT of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the ground GND is directly connected to the ground GND; various groups of the operational chips <b>11</b> are connected in parallel between the power input terminal Vcc and the ground GND. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the pair of series-connected adjacent operational chips <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc on the left, the negative terminal GND_OUT<b>11</b> of a preceding operational chip <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>12</b> of a following operational chip <b>11</b>, the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>11</b> of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc is electrically connected to the power input terminal Vcc; in the pair of series-connected adjacent operational chips <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc on the right, the negative terminal GND_OUT<b>21</b> of a preceding operational chip <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>22</b> of a following operational chip <b>11</b>, the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>21</b> of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc is electrically connected to the power input terminal Vcc; in the pair of series-connected adjacent operational chips <b>11</b> closest to the ground GND on the left, the negative terminal GND_OUT<b>1</b><i>n</i>&#x2212;1 of a preceding operational chip <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>1</b><i>n </i>of a following operational chip <b>11</b>, the negative terminal GND_OUT<b>1</b>n of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the ground GND is connected to the ground GND; in the pair of series-connected adjacent operational chips <b>11</b> closest to the ground GND on the right, the negative terminal GND_OUT<b>2</b><i>n</i>&#x2212;1 of a preceding operational chip <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the power supply terminal Vcc_IN<b>2</b><i>n </i>of a following operational chip <b>11</b>, and a negative terminal GND_OUT<b>2</b><i>n </i>of the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the ground GND is connected to the ground GND.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With such a circuit structure, the output current of the power supply keeps increasing with the continuous increase of the power of each single mining machine while the output voltage of 12V remains unchanged. As a result, the heat loss of the operational chips keeps increasing, the direct current loss of the calculation board where the operational chips are installed also increases significantly, and the efficiency of the power supply cannot be further increased.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For such conventional circuit structure, there are multiple layers of operational chips <b>11</b> connected in series between the power input terminal Vcc and the ground GND. With the present manufacturing technology, a power supply of 12V can support about <b>40</b> layers of series-connected operational chips. When a high-voltage power supply is used instead, the high-voltage power supply may support more layers of series-connected operational chips. For example, a power supply of 48V can support about <b>160</b> layers of series-connected operational chips <b>11</b>. In that case, each calculation board <b>1</b> may include as many as four to five hundred operational chips <b>11</b>. After power-on, voltage balance between operational chips <b>11</b> is hard to achieve, and operational chips <b>11</b> in various layers may have different voltage values, which may cause the operational chips <b>11</b> at some layers have too low voltages to start-up normally. Further, for the conventional circuit structure, a high-voltage power supply requires more layers of operational chips <b>11</b> to be connected in series, and the excessive number of operational chips <b>11</b> may further cause communication signals to pass through more operational chips <b>11</b> layer by layer before reaching the top chip (which is the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc), which increases signal delay and makes it difficult to achieve signal synchronization. Meanwhile, the signal quality may also worsen, resulting in a greatly-increased probability of communication error of the chip at an end of a communication link (which is the operational chip <b>11</b> closest to the power input terminal Vcc), which thereby reduces the stability of the virtual currency mining machine system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above, the present application provides a virtual currency data processing device and an operational circuit of the virtual currency data processing device, so as to increase the power supply efficiency when the power supply voltage is increased and to improve system stability of the virtual currency data processing device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The technical scheme of the present application is as follows.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An operational circuit of a virtual currency data processing device includes:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">at least two operational chip groups, configured to operate within respective operating voltage threshold ranges of the operational chip groups to receive a communication signal which includes an issued task, perform calculations according to the issued task, and transmit a communication signal which includes a calculation result;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a control module configured to operate within an operating voltage threshold range of the control module to transmit the communication signal which includes the issued task and receive the communication signal which includes the calculation result; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">at least two signal forwarding and electrical isolation modules, each of the signal forwarding and electrical isolation modules is communicatively connected to a respective operational chip group and the control module, and is configured to forward communication signals between the control module and the operational chip group, and to isolate an operating voltage threshold of the operational chip groups from an operating voltage threshold of the control module to make the operational chip groups and the control module capable of identifying communication signals sent by each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A virtual currency data processing device includes the above operational circuit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Compared with conventional techniques, the multilayer series circuit for power supply of a conventional operational chip is replaced with a series circuit for power supply of operational chip groups which is composed of multiple series-connected operational chip groups in the power supply path according to the operational circuit of the virtual currency data processing device of various embodiments of the present application. The circuit of the power supply path of the operational chips in each operational chip group adopts the same circuit structure as the multilayer series circuit for power supply of a conventional operational chip, except that the number of operational chips in each operational chip group is far smaller than the number of operational chips in the multilayer series circuit for power supply of a conventional operational chip. Meanwhile, a signal forwarding and electrical isolation module is communicatively connected between the control module and each operational chip group, and as a result, instead of all of operational chips in all of operational chip groups perform the same calculation task collectively, each operational chip group receives and executes a respective calculation task as an independent processing unit and returns calculation results when a high-voltage DC power supply is applied to the series circuit for power supply of the operational chip group, which can greatly improve power efficiency and reduce current heating loss. Meanwhile, in various embodiments of the present application, communication connections are established between the control module and each operational chip group which serves as an independent unit, and the number of operational chips in each operational chip group is much smaller than the total number of operational chips, thus the problem of delay among various operational chips in the operational chip groups can be solved, signal synchronization in the operational chip groups can be ensured, which can improve the signal quality in the operational chip groups, greatly reduce the probability of communication error of the operational chip groups, and improve stability. Meanwhile, in various embodiments of the present application, electrical isolation and data communication between the control module and each operational chip group can be realized by using the signal forwarding and electrical isolation module, thereby the operational chip group and the main control board can identify signals of each other even when the operational chip group and the main control board have different operating voltage thresholds.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an operational circuit of a conventional virtual currency mining machine;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an operational circuit of a virtual currency data processing device according to an embodiment of the present application;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an operational circuit of a virtual currency data processing device according to embodiment one of the present application;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an operational circuit of a virtual currency data processing device according to embodiment two of the present application; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an operational circuit of the virtual currency data processing device according to embodiment three of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the drawings, names of components represented by various reference numerals are as follows:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0021"><b>1</b>. calculation board;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0022"><b>11</b>. operational chip</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0023"><b>2</b>. control board</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0024"><b>21</b>. control chip</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0025"><b>31</b>. operational chip group</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0026"><b>311</b>. operational chip subgroup</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0027"><b>32</b>. control module</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0028"><b>33</b>. signal forwarding and electrical isolation module</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0029"><b>4</b>. sub-control board</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0030"><b>5</b>. main control board</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0031"><b>6</b>. signal-electrical level conversion module</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0032">In order to make the purpose, technical solutions and advantages of the present application clearer, the present application will be further described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings and embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0033">The virtual currency data processing device in various embodiments of the present application may refer to, but not limited to, a virtual currency mining machine.

The circuit of the power supply path of the operational chips in each operational chip group adopts the same circuit structure as the multilayer series circuit for power supply of a conventional operational chip, except that the number of operational chips in each operational chip group is far smaller than the number of operational chips in the multilayer series circuit for power supply of a conventional operational chip. Meanwhile, a signal forwarding and electrical isolation module is communicatively connected between the control module and each operational chip group, and as a result, instead of all of operational chips in all of operational chip groups perform the same calculation task collectively, each operational chip group receives and executes a respective calculation task as an independent processing unit and returns calculation results when a high-voltage DC power supply is applied to the series circuit for power supply of the operational chip group, which can greatly improve power efficiency and reduce current heating loss. Meanwhile, in various embodiments of the present application, communication connections are established between the control module and each operational chip group which serves as an independent unit, and the number of operational chips in each operational chip group is much smaller than the total number of operational chips, thus the problem of delay among various operational chips in the operational chip groups can be solved, signal synchronization in the operational chip groups can be ensured, which can improve the signal quality in the operational chip groups, greatly reduce the probability of communication error of the operational chip groups, and improve stability. Meanwhile, in various embodiments of the present application, electrical isolation and data communication between the control module and each operational chip group can be realized by using the signal forwarding and electrical isolation module, thereby the operational chip group and the main control board can identify signals of each other even when the operational chip group and the main control board have different operating voltage thresholds.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0065">The foregoing descriptions are merely some of preferred embodiments of the present application and are not intended for limiting the present application.
