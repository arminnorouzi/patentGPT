An intersection between these digital platforms, and many conventional content provisioning systems, is often characterized by inefficient and computationally expensive manual intervention and implementation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one example, an apparatus includes a communications unit, a storage unit storing instructions, and at least one processor coupled to the communications unit and the storage unit. The at least processor may be configured to execute the instructions to receive a first signal via the communications unit. The received signal may include information generated by an application program executed by a communications device, and based on the generated information, the at least one processor may be further configured to obtain an identifier of a third party associated with the executed application program. The at least one processor may be further configured to identify and obtain first elements of digital content that include a representation of the identifier, generate a second element of digital content that incorporates a subset of the first elements of digital content, and transmit a second signal via the communications unit to the communications device.

The application program may be executed by a communications device, and based on the generated information, the computer-implemented method may obtain an identifier of a third party associated with the executed application program. The method also includes identifying and obtaining, by the at least one processor, first elements of digital content that include a representation of the identifier, generating, by the at least one processor, a second element of digital content that incorporates a subset of the first elements of digital content, and transmitting, by the at least one processor, a second signal that includes the second element of digital content to the communications device. The second signal may be transmitted through a programmatic interface associated with the executed application program, and the communications device may be configured by the executed application program to display the second element of digital content on an interface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in some examples, a tangible, non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, perform a method that includes receiving a first signal including information generated by an application program.

In this application, the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x201c;including,&#x201d; as well as other forms such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;included,&#x201d; is not limiting. In addition, terms such as &#x201c;element&#x201d; or &#x201c;component&#x201d; encompass both elements and components comprising one unit, and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit, unless specifically stated otherwise. Additionally, the section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only, and are not to be construed as limiting the described subject matter.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This specification describes exemplary computer-implemented systems, devices, and processes that, among other things, automatically and dynamically generate and provision digital content to network-connected devices operating within a computing environment. By way of example, as described herein, a computing system operating within the computing environment (e.g., a &#x201c;content provisioning system&#x201d;) may receive a first signal that includes information generated by an application program executed at a network-connected device (e.g., a &#x201c;client device&#x201d;) operating within the computing environment). The information may include a unique identifier of executed application program, and in some instances, may also include a current geographic location of the client device (e.g., as determined by an embedded positioning unit), a unique identifier of a user that operates the client device (e.g., an authentication credential associated with the application program or assigned by the content provisioning system) or a unique identifier of the client device (e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) address or a media access control (MAC) address).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the receipt of the first signal and the information included therein, may cause the content provisioning system to perform any of the exemplary processes described herein, either alone or in conjunction with other network-connected computing system operating within environment <b>100</b>, that dynamically and selectively combine elements of digital content associated with the executed application program, and that automatically provision the combined elements of digital content to the client device in real-time and without intervention from a corresponding user. For example, and based on the generated information, the content provisioning system may identify and load, from a locally or remotely accessible storage unit, an identifier of a third-party approved to distribute content to the executed application program (e.g., an &#x201c;approved&#x201d; third party). The third-party identifier may, in some instances, be identified based on the unique identifier of the executed application program, either alone or in conjunction with location data specifying a current or prior geographic location of the client device (e.g., as incorporated within the generated information), preference data specifying one or more content-delivery preferences of a user that operates the client device, or targeting data established by the third party.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The content provisioning system may perform further operations to identify and obtain elements of digital content (e.g., &#x201c;first&#x201d; elements of digital content) that include or reference the third-party identifier. In some examples, the content provisioning system may obtain the first elements of digital content that one or more network-connected computing systems that aggregate and maintain digital content generated by users of one or more digital platforms (e.g., a &#x201c;content aggregation&#x201d; system). For instance, the content aggregation system may subscribe to, and receive data streams generated by, one or more social media or microblogging platforms, and additionally or alternatively, may be configured to execute one or more application programs that scrape published digital content from corresponding web pages (e.g., via a corresponding programmatic interface, such as an application programming interface (API)).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, in some instances, the content provisioning system may generate a second element of digital content that includes a selectively combined subset of the first elements of digital content, e.g., which include or reference the third-party identifier. As described herein, the content provisioning system may select the subset of the first elements of digital content for inclusion within the second element of digital content, and/or may combine the selected subset of the first digital content elements to form the second digital content element, based on an application of one or more adaptive or dynamic combination schemes, algorithms, or processes to information, such as metadata, that characterizes the each of the first digital content elements.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By way of example, the one or more applied adaptive or dynamic combination schemes may, when applied to the information characterizing the first digital content elements, establish an ordering or a position of the each of the subset of the first digital content elements within the newly generated second digital content element, and additionally or alternatively, a visual format of the each of the subset of the first digital content elements within the newly generated second digital content element. Examples of the adaptive or dynamic combination schemes may include, but are not limited to, a weighted combination scheme (e.g., those based on an impact or sentiment analysis), a hierarchical combination scheme, or a combination scheme based on one or more machine learning algorithms, clustering algorithms, or collaborative filtering algorithms.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The content provisioning system may generate a second signal that includes the newly generated second element of digital content, and perform operations that transmit the generated second signal across the communications network to the client device, e.g., through a corresponding programmatic interface established or maintained by the executed application program. The client device may, for example, be configured to preset the second element of digital content, which includes the dynamically and adaptively combined subset of the first elements of digital content, within a portion of an interface, such as a graphical user interface generated by the executed application program.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples, and as described herein, the approved third party may correspond to a merchant, and the third-party identifier may correspond to any merchant- or product-specific identifier that facilitates the identification of the first elements of digital content, e.g., by the content aggregation system. Examples of the merchant- or product-specific identifiers include, among other things, merchant- or product-specific hashtags (e.g., that characterize content within one or more social media or microblogging platforms, such as Facebook&#x2122;, Instagram&#x2122;, or Twitter&#x2122;), merchant names or merchant acronyms, locational identifiers, merchant nicknames, or other information capable of uniquely identifying digital content associated with the merchant or products offered for sale by that merchant.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, the first elements of digital content may be generated by users that operate network-connected devices within the computing environment and interact with the one or more digital platforms described herein (e.g., &#x201c;user-generated&#x201d; digital content within accessible web pages, user- or location-based social media platforms, microblogging platforms, etc.). The user-generated digital content may include digital images, digital video, digital audio, and/or combinations thereof, and examples of the user-generated digital may include, but are not limited to, images of the merchant or of one of more products or services offered for sale by the merchant, user-generated reviews or commentary on the merchant, or user-generated reviews or commentary on the one or more products or services.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the second element of digital content, which includes a selectively combined subset of the user-generated content, may correspond to a dynamically generated advertisement for the merchant or for the one or more products or services, which the content provisioning system can automatically provision to the client device based on the information included within the received first signal, e.g., the current geographic location of the client device. Additionally, and as described herein, the second element of digital content may also include additional content of relevance to the merchant or to the one or more products or services, such as digital advertisements or promotions that offer a predetermined percentage or monetary discount of purchases initiated at the merchant or involving the one or more products or services.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Certain of the exemplary, computer-implemented processes described herein dynamically select elements of digital content referencing an identifier of a third-party based on location, preference, or target data, adaptively combine the selected digital content elements into a single, aggregated digital content element, and automatically provision the aggregated digital content element to a client device without intervention.

For example, and in response to a detected occurrence of a triggering event, content provisioning system <b>130</b> may request and receive the data identifying the approved third parties or merchants from one or more additional network-connected computing systems, such as third-party targeting system <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described herein, examples of the triggering event include, among other things, a receipt of data from client device <b>102</b> (e.g., as generated by the executed application program without intervention from user <b>101</b>) that identifies the executed application program or user <b>101</b>, that identifies a current geographic location of client device <b>102</b>, and/or that specifies one or more elements of profile data characterizing user <b>101</b>. Further, the approved third parties may include one or more approved merchants, and the data identifying the approved merchants may, for example, include one or more unique identifiers of the approved merchants, or one or more unique identifiers of products or services offered for sale by the approved merchants. Examples of these merchant- or product-specific identifier may include, but are not limited to, merchant- or product-specific hashtags that characterize content within one or more social media or microblogging platforms, merchant names, nicknames, or acronyms, or product names, nicknames, or acronyms.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In further examples, the first digital content elements may include, among other things, one or more elements of digital content generated by a user of a digital platform, such as a user- or a location-based social media platform or a digital platform maintained by a content provider that publishes digital content. Examples of the user-generated digital content may include, but is not limited to, digital images or videos of the merchants of a products offered for sale by the merchants, digital content that includes user-generated reviews of the merchants or the offered products, or digital content that specifies user-generated comments on the merchants or the offered products, and as described herein, content provisioning system <b>130</b> may obtain one or more of the user-generated content elements from one or more network-connected computing systems, such as content aggregation system <b>170</b>, based on portions of the merchant- or product-specific identifiers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Content provisioning system <b>130</b> may perform additional operations that generate an aggregated element of digital content (e.g., a &#x201c;second&#x201d; digital content element) based on a dynamically selected and ordered combination of a subset of the first digital content elements. For example, and as described herein, content provisioning system <b>130</b> may generate the second digital content element based an application of one or more dynamic or adaptive combination schemes to information, e.g., metadata, that identifies and characterizes each of the first digital content elements, and examples of the combination schemes include, but are not limited to, classification-based combination schemes, hierarchical combination schemes, or combination schemes based on content-specific weight factors, combination schemes based on machine learning algorithms, clustering algorithms, or collaborative filtering algorithms, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In further examples, content provisioning system <b>130</b> may automatically transmit or &#x201c;provision&#x201d; the second digital content element to client device <b>102</b> without direct intervention from either client device <b>102</b> or a user that operates client device <b>102</b>, such as user <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As described herein, client device <b>102</b> may perform operations that present the second digital content element, which represents the dynamically selected combination of the first digital content elements, to user <b>101</b> on a corresponding interface generated by an executed application program, such as a mobile application associated with content provisioning system <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">a.
