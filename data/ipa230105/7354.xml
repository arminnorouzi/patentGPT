On the audio playback interface, the user can click the &#x201c;recommended songs&#x201d; button in the figure to pop up the window illustrated on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which contains other songs with high similarity to the currently playing song.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other embodiment, &#x201c;recommended songs&#x201d; may also be replaced with &#x201c;similar songs&#x201d; or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At block S<b>102</b>, the method may include in response to receiving an instruction of playing the recommended audio, saving the playback information of a target audio currently played on an audio playback interface, and playing the recommended audio.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one embodiment, the currently playing songs in the playlist is illustrated as the target audio.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the user chooses to play the acquired recommended audio, the currently playing target audio may be paused, and the terminal acquires and saves the playback information of the target audio, and plays the recommended audio. The playback information includes but is not limited to the target audio name, the target audio list, the target audio playback progress, and the audio contents in the target audio list.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At block S<b>103</b>, the method may include in response to receiving an instruction of ceasing to play the recommended audio, and playing the target audio on the audio playback interface according to the playback information.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The playback cease instruction may be generated when the user manually ceases the recommended audio in the process of playing the recommended audio, or it may be automatically generated when the recommended audio play is finished. After receiving the recommended audio playback cease instruction, the terminal continues to play the target audio on the audio playback interface according to the saved playback information. Continuing play is the restoration and recovery of the play state of the target audio. For example, when the recommended audio is played, the target audio has been played to 02:35, and after the recommended audio play is ceased, the terminal controls the player to restore the playback progress of the target audio to 02:35, and continue to play the remaining audio after 02:35.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the audio playback method provided in at least one embodiment of the disclosure, the terminal receives the recommended audio acquisition instruction input for the audio playback interface, acquires the recommended audio, and then saves the playback information of the target audio currently played on the audio playback interface and plays the recommended audio after receiving the playback instruction for the recommended audio input. When receiving playback cease instruction for the recommended audio input, the target audio is played on the audio playback interface according to the playback information. In at least one embodiment of the disclosure, when the recommended audio or other audio outside the playlist is played, the playback information of the originally playing target audio is saved, and when the recommended audio or other audio is played, the terminal may restore or recover the play state of the target audio of the playlist according to the saved playback information, which can effectively avoid the audio play experience interruption caused by the insertion of recommended audio/other audio.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> for a schematic flowchart of an audio playback method provided in implementations of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method of one embodiment of the disclosure may include the following blocks:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block S<b>201</b>, the method may include in response to an instruction of scrolling to the audio playback interface, and displaying an audio recommendation interface, wherein the audio recommendation interface includes at least one recommended audio; receiving the recommended audio selected on the audio recommendation interface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Taking music as an example, in a feasible implementation method, a certain song in the album list is clicked to play, the audio playback interface displays the music, and the user swipes to the left or right gesture to enter the audio recommendation interface, and the audio recommendation interface includes some detailed information of the singer of the music being played and a plurality of recommended songs which are similar to the music. The user selects one of the recommended songs listed in the audio recommendation interface for playing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the scroll instruction may also be a voice scroll instruction or a button-type scroll instruction or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block S<b>202</b>, the method may include in response to receiving a playback instruction input for the recommended audio, ceasing the playback of the target audio currently played on the audio playback interface, and saving the playback information of the target audio.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the terminal receives the playback instruction input by the user for the selected recommended song, the terminal controls the currently playing target audio (target song) to pause playing, and saves the current play state of the target audio. The saved information includes the name of the song, the position of the song in the playlist and the tracks contained in the playlist or the like. The recommended song may be an adapted version of the target song, a cover version, and other songs with high melody similarity or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block S<b>203</b>, the method may include displaying temporary playback interface on the audio recommendation interface, and playing the recommended audio on the temporary playback interface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the playback information of the target audio is successfully saved, a temporary playback interface is displayed on the audio playback interface, which is configured to display the recommended audio (recommended song) to be played. The temporary player interface corresponds to a player, which is a temporary player.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In at least one embodiment, two independent players are configured to respectively play the audios in the user's frequently used list and other audios outside the list. In particular, in other embodiment, the temporary player may also be configured to play non-recommended audio outside the frequently used list. For example, the primary player (that is, the player corresponding to the audio playback interface) is playing a song in the list. When the user browses the ranking list on the software or web-page and wants to listen to a song in the ranking list, the user clicks the play button, and the temporary player can play the audition song, and the song in the list will be paused. The primary player will continue to play the songs in the list after the audition song is finished or is ceased midway.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block S<b>204</b>, the method may include in response to receiving close instruction input for the temporary playback interface, and closing the temporary playback interface; playing the target audio on the audio playback interface according to the playback information.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the temporary playback interface is closed, the corresponding temporary player is also closed. After receiving the recommended audio play cease instruction, the terminal continues to play the target audio in the audio playback interface according to the saved playback information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Compared with the play function of the player corresponding to the audio playback interface, the functions of the temporary player are more streamlined. For example, the player corresponding to the audio playback interface includes sound quality, sound effect selection, comment sharing, double speed play, and song cycle mode or the like, while the temporary player only includes the functions of collecting/adding and cutting songs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for a schematic flowchart of the playing process of a recommended music provided in implementations of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The interface illustrated in a in the figure is the audio playback interface, and the music in the frequently used playlist is playing. The user may scroll to the music recommendation interface by making the gesture of sliding to the left in the interface (the interface illustrated in b in the figure), which displays the detailed information of the music being played and some recommended songs similar to the music. In the recommended list formed by these recommended songs, the user can select the recommended music from the recommended music. The user selects a recommended song to listen to according to his preference and clicks the play button. Based on the received recommended song playback instruction, the terminal controls the song played on the audio playback interface to pause playback, and saves the playback information (such as the playback progress) of the song. And then, the terminal controls to pop up a temporary playback interface to play the recommended music to be played (interface c in the figure).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the process of playing recommended songs, if the user does not want to continue listening, he can click the cease button on the temporary playback interface to end the playing of the recommended songs, and return to the music recommendation interface again (the interface illustrated in b in the figure). At this time, the terminal may control the player corresponding to the audio playback interface to continue playing the music previously played in the frequently used list according to the saved playback information.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In particular, when multiple recommended songs define a list and the user does not close the temporary playback interface during the playing of recommended songs, the temporary player may play the recommended songs one by one in the recommended songs list until the user manually ceases the temporary playback interface.
