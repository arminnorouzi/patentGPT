Further, when the vehicle <b>3</b> approaches the power supply area, the ECU <b>7</b> of the vehicle <b>3</b> uses the communication device <b>38</b> to transmit a power supply request signal for requesting power supply to the vehicle <b>3</b> from the power supply apparatus <b>2</b>. When receiving the power supply request signal from the vehicle <b>3</b>, the controller <b>6</b> of the power supply apparatus <b>2</b> causes the power transmission apparatus <b>4</b> to generate an alternating current magnetic field for power transmission. That is, when receiving the power supply request signal from the vehicle <b>3</b>, the controller <b>6</b> starts non-contact power supply to the vehicle <b>3</b> from the power supply apparatus <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, the driver of the vehicle <b>3</b> is liable to change lanes from the lane of the power supply area to an adjacent lane if not aware of the presence of the power supply area etc. If changing lanes at the power supply area, the vehicle <b>3</b> will deviate in position away from the power transmission coil <b>44</b> in the vehicle width direction and the power supply efficiency will drop. Further, the opportunity to supply power to the vehicle <b>3</b> will be lost if changing lanes in a manner that avoids passing through the power supply area. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the amount of power supplied to the vehicle <b>3</b> kept from falling by prohibiting lane changes that would cause a drop in the amount of power supplied to the vehicle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of the processor <b>73</b> of the ECU <b>7</b> in the first embodiment.

In particular, in the present embodiment, the lane change prohibiting part <b>74</b> prohibits lane changing by manual driving of the driver of the vehicle <b>3</b> in the predetermined range. Note that in the present embodiment, lane changing by the vehicle <b>3</b> is prohibited taking only the running position of the vehicle <b>3</b> into consideration. That is, lane changing by the vehicle <b>3</b> is prohibited regardless of the traffic in a lane adjacent to the lane of the power supply area. Accordingly, lane changing by the vehicle <b>3</b> is prohibited even if there are no other vehicles in a lane adjacent to the lane of the power supply area.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The predetermined range where lane changing is prohibited includes, for example, the range from the start point of the power supply area to the end point of the power supply area. This makes it possible to keep the vehicle <b>3</b> from deviating in position away from the power transmission coil <b>44</b> due to lane changing in the power supply area and in turn keep the amount of power supplied to the vehicle <b>3</b> from dropping.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, when the vehicle <b>3</b> is located in the area before the power supply area, it is more difficult for the driver of the vehicle <b>3</b> to recognize the presence of the power supply area. For this reason, the predetermined range where lane changing is prohibited may include the range before the power supply area in the direction of advance of the vehicle <b>3</b>. This makes it possible to keep lane changing that would avoid passage through the power supply area from happening and in turn keep the amount of power supplied to the vehicle <b>3</b> from dropping. For example, the predetermined range is set to the range from the start point of the power supply area to the end point of the power supply area, the range from a predetermined position before the power supply area to the start point or the end point of the power supply area, etc.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Below, referring to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the flow of the above-mentioned control will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart showing a control routine carried out in the vehicle <b>3</b> in the first embodiment.
