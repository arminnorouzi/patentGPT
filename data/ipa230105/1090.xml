The disclosure particularly relates to injection devices, such as a handheld injectors configured to expel a single or multiple doses of a fixed or variable size. In a further aspect the disclosure relates to injection devices configured to prepare a liquid medicament prior to conduct an injection procedure. Preparation of the medicament may include mixing of a powdered or lyophilized medicament with a diluent or solvent.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drug delivery devices for setting and dispensing a single or multiple doses of a liquid medicament are well-known in the art. Generally, such devices have substantially a similar purpose as that of an ordinary syringe.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Drug delivery devices, such as pen-type injectors have to meet a number of user-specific requirements. For instance, a patien with a chronic disease, such as diabetes, may be physically infirm and may also have impaired vision. Suitable drug delivery devices especially intended for home use therefore need to be robust in construction and should be easy to use. Furthermore, manipulation and general handling of the device and its components should be intelligible and easily understandable. Such injection devices should provide settings for subsequent dispensing of a dose of a medicament of variable size. Moreover, a dose setting, as well as a dose dispensing procedure, should be easy to operate and intuitive to use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, a drug delivery device comprises a housing or a particular cartridge holder, adapted to receive a cartridge at least partially filled with the medicament to be dispensed. The device further comprises a drive mechanism, usually having a displaceable piston rod to operably engage with a bung or piston of the cartridge. By means of the drive mechanism and its piston rod, the bung or piston of the cartridge is displaceable in a distal or dispensing direction and may therefore expel a predefined amount of the medicament via a piercing assembly, e.g., in the form of an injection needle, which is to be releasably coupled with a distal end section of the housing of the drug delivery device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The medicament to be dispensed by the drug delivery device may be provided and contained in a multi-dose cartridge. Such a cartridge typically comprises a vitreous barrel sealed in distal direction by means of a pierceable seal and being further sealed in proximal direction by the bung. With a reusable drug delivery device, an empty cartridge is replaceable by a new one. In contrast to that, a disposable drug delivery devices may be entirely discarded when the medicament in the cartridge has been dispensed or used-up.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With some drug delivery devices, such as pen-type injection devices, a user has to set a dose of equal or variable size by rotating a dose dial in a clockwise or dose-incrementing direction relative to a body or housing of the injection device. For injecting and expelling a dose of a liquid medicament, the user has to depress a trigger or dose button in a distal direction and hence towards the body or housing of the injection device. Typically, the user uses their thumb for exerting a distally directed pressure onto the dose button, which may be located at a proximal end of the dose dial and the dose dial sleeve, while holding the housing of the injection device with the remaining fingers of the same hand.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With injection devices, such as handheld injectors provided with a prefilled multi-chamber or dual chamber medicament container, such as a dual-chamber cartridge, the medicament contained inside the cartridge may be prepared before an injection takes place. With a dual-chamber cartridge or dual-chamber syringe, for example, it may be necessary to conduct a priming step or a priming procedure, e.g., to mix the medicament with one of a solvent and a diluent in order to prepare the liquid medicament that is intended to be expelled and injected into biological tissue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With other examples, a priming step may be necessary in order to assure that a plunger or piston rod is in abutment with a piston of the medicament container or cartridge. With some devices, it may be further necessary to conduct a so-called priming shot or air shot in order to expel eventual remaining air from the cavity of the medicament container.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With manually operable injection devices, it may be quite cumbersome and sometimes rather sophisticated for the end user to conduct such a priming step or priming procedure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore desirable to provide an improved injection device for expelling of a dose of a medicament, wherein the injection device provides a rather user-friendly, efficient and failure safe approach to conduct a priming step or priming procedure. When the injection device is equipped with a dual-chamber cartridge that requires mixing or preparation of the liquid medicament the improved injection device should provide a rather easy, intuitive and failure safe approach to correctly conduct such a priming step or priming procedure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect there is provided an injection device for expelling of a dose of a medicament. The injection device comprises an elongated housing. The elongated housing comprises a distal end and a proximal end. The proximal end is located opposite to the distal end. The elongated housing, typically extending in a longitudinal direction with a long axis, comprises a body and a protective cap. Typically, the protective cap is detachably connected to the body. The injection device further comprises a medicament container. The medicament container comprises a barrel having a first cavity. The first cavity is sealed in proximal direction or towards the proximal direction by a first stopper. The first stopper is slidably arranged inside the barrel. Typically, the medicament container is located inside the housing. The medicament container is typically located inside the body of the housing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The protective cap is configured to abut on a distally facing abutment portion of the barrel. The body of the housing is configured to abut on a proximally facing abutment portion of the first stopper. The first stopper is movable in distal direction relative to the barrel from an initial position into a priming position. In other words, during a priming step or priming procedure the stopper is subject to a distally directed movement relative to the barrel from the initial or proximal position into the priming or distal position. The movement of the first stopper is induced or caused by the protective cap moving along the proximal direction relative to the body from a preset position into an activation position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The protective cap, either typically located at the distal end of the housing and/or forming the distal end of the housing and the body, or typically located at the proximal end of the housing or forming the proximal end of the housing, may be moved closer together when moving from the preset position into the activation position. Hence, upon or during movement of the protective cap from the preset position towards and into the activation position, the total elongation of the elongated housing may be reduced. Since the protective cap is configured to abut on the distally facing abutment portion of the barrel the protective cap is operable to apply a proximally directed pressure onto the barrel. Likewise, the body is configured to abut on a proximally facing abutment portion of the first stopper. Hence, the body is operable to apply a distally directed pressure onto the first stopper.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an initial configuration the protective cap may be in direct or indirect abutment with the distally facing abutment portion of the barrel. Likewise, the body may be direct or indirect abutment with a proximally facing abutment portion of the first stopper. Now and as the protective cap is moved relative to the body in proximal direction from the preset position into and/or towards the activation position the protective cap applies a proximally directed pressure onto the barrel while the body applies a distally directed pressure onto the stopper. As a consequence and when the respective forces are above a break loose force of the first stopper relative to the barrel the stopper becomes subject to a distally directed movement relative to the barrel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the protective cap is in the preset position relative to the body it does not necessarily be in direct or indirect engagement with the barrel. In the preset position also the body does not necessarily have to be in direct or indirect abutment with the first stopper. It is sufficient, when a longitudinal abutment between the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the barrel is established during the movement of the body from the preset position into or towards the activation position. The same is valid for a direct or indirect abutment of the body with the first stopper.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the preset position there may remain a functional gap between the body and the first stopper which is closed as the protective cap is moved relative to the body from the preset position towards the activation position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present context an indirect abutment of the protective cap and the barrel means, that there may be provided one or several mechanical components between the protective cap and the barrel, wherein such components are configured to transfer a longitudinal force effect from the protective cap towards the barrel. The same applies for the indirect abutment between the first stopper and the body. Also here, there may be provided one or several mechanical components arranged between the body and the first stopper, which components are operable to transfer a mechanical pressure, force or thrust from the body towards and onto the first stopper.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In effect and by moving the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position relative to the body a priming procedure may be conducted by the end user rather easily and intuitively. During and due to the relative movement of the protective cap and the body the first stopper moves a well-defined distance relative to the barrel of the medicament container.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The priming distance, i.e., the distance the first stopper has to be moved from the initial position to reach the priming position directly correlates with the distance between the preset position and the activation position of protective cap and body. Typically, the priming distance is less than or equal to the activation distance, i.e., the distance the protective cap moves relative to the body from the preset position to the activation position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With some examples, the activation position may be visually and/or haptically indicated on the outside of the injection device. Reaching of the activation position is therefore immediately apparent to the user from outside the housing of the injection device. In this way, an increased degree of patient safety and intuitive use of the injection device may be provided and supported.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The patient or end user receives a well-defined and intuitive feedback that the activation position of the protective cap, which is correlated with the priming position of the first piston has been reached and that priming has been conducted, or that a mixing of two components of a dual-chamber cartridge or syringe may be conducted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further example the injection device comprises an activation lock detachably or movably arranged on the elongated housing. The activation lock is operable to block or to prevent a movement of the protective cap from the preset position towards the activation position. The activation lock serves to prevent inadvertent activation or inadvertent priming of the injection device. A user of the injection device may first remove, detach or move the activation lock into a release configuration so as to enable a movement of the protective cap from the preset position towards or into the activation position.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With some examples the activation lock is movable relative to at least one of the protective cap and the elongated housing. The activation lock may be movably connected to at least one of the elongated housing and the protective cap. With some examples the activation lock is movable relative to both, the activation lock and the elongated housing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With some examples the activation lock is pivotally or slidably supported on at least one of the protective cap and the elongated housing. It may be pivotable from a blocking position into a release position or release configuration. Here, a pivot axis may extend parallel to the elongation of the housing and/or along a central axis of the barrel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When and as long as the activation lock is in the blocking position it effectively blocks and/or prevents a movement of the protective cap from the preset position towards the activation position, hence a movement of the protective cap in proximal direction and/or relative to the elongated housing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With some examples the activation lock may be movably or detachably supported on one of a proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and a distally facing abutment portion of the elongated housing, typically of a body of the elongated housing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another example the activation lock is frangibly connected to at least one of the body and the protective cap. A frangible activation lock may be provided as a tamper evident component, which is detachably and non-re-attachably connected to at least one of the body and the protective cap.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The frangible and non-re-attachable connection of the activation lock to at least one of the body and the protective cap may be beneficial in that a manipulated injection device with the frangible activation lock disconnected or detached may not be re-attached to the body or to the protective cap. In this way a detached or at least partially detached or removed activation lock is a direct indicator to the user, that the injection device has been manipulated. In this case, the injection device should not be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to another example the activation lock is connected to at least one of the body and the protective cap by at least one of a perforated structure and a structurally weakened connector. The perforated structure and/or the structurally weakened connector comprises a predetermined breaking structure. In this way, the activation lock may be detached from the housing or it may be at least moved relative to the housing, e.g., by disrupting or by destroying the predetermined breaking structure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With some examples the activation lock is integrally formed with at least one of the body and the protective cap. The protective cap and/or the body may comprise an injection molded plastic component.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With some examples the activation lock is provided with a detachment flap forming a gripping structure for the user in order to grip the activation lock and to disrupt or to disconnect the activation lock from the housing. With other examples, the flap may be used to move the activation lock into a release configuration, in which the protective cap is movable from the preset position into the activation position.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another example the activation lock comprises a ring. The ring encloses an outside surface of the housing. Hence, the ring may clasp around the housing. It may clasp at least one of the protective cap and the body. The ring may be located in an interface section of protective cap and body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With some examples and when the activation lock is connected to both, the body and the protective cap and is further frangibly connected to at least one of the body and the protective cap may be secured or attached to the body by way of the activation lock. Destroying or disrupting the activation lock may then not only give way to move the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position but may also enable detachment of the protective cap from the body.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to another example the activation lock comprises a distally facing abutment portion. The distally facing abutment portion is configured or operable to abut with a proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap. When the distally facing abutment portion of the activation lock abuts with the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap the activation lock is effective to prevent or to block a proximally directed movement of the protective cap relative to the body.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another example the activation lock comprises a proximally facing abutment portion. The proximally facing abutment portion is configured or operable to abut with a distally facing abutment portion of the body. In this way and when in a longitudinal abutment with the body the activation lock prevents and blocks a distally directed movement of the body relative to the protective cap.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">With such examples, wherein the activation lock is provided as a separate piece detachably arranged on the housing it comprises a distally facing abutment portion and a proximally facing abutment portion. Here, the activation lock may act as a spacer between the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body. As long as the protective cap is located between the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body a respective movement from the preset position into the activation position is effectively blocked.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the preset position the activation lock may be in abutment with at least one of the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body. However, it may be also arranged with a certain longitudinal gap to the abutment portions of the protective cap and the body, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With some examples the activation lock comprises numerous segments, e.g., numerous ring segments frangibly connected to each other, e.g., by way of a perforated structure or by a structurally weakened connector. Hence, in addition to or instead of detaching the activation lock from the housing the numerous segments of the activation lock, e.g., the ring segments, may be disconnected from each other, thereby destroying the integrity of the activation lock, e.g., thereby destroying the annular structure of the ring. Individual segments of the activation lock, e.g., individual ring segment thereof may remain connected to one of the protective cap and the body but may be moved, bended or pivoted in such a way, that they are outside a blocking engagement with one of the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to another example a proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap or the above-mentioned proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap is configured or operable to abut on a distally facing abutment portion of the body when the protective cap is in or reaches the activation position relative to the body. Also here, the distally facing abutment portion of the body may be the above-mentioned distally facing abutment portion of the body that is configured to abut with a proximally facing abutment portion of the activation lock.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other words the proximally and distally facing abutment portions of the protective cap and the body intended and configured to engage or to abut with the proximally and distally facing abutment portions of the activation lock may also directly abut, when the protective cap and the body reach the activation position.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this way the proximally and distally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the body provide a twofold function. With the activation lock arranged between the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body the respective abutment portions of the protective cap and the body serve to prevent a movement of the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position. With the activation lock removed or with the activation lock in a release configuration the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap engaging or in abutment with the distally facing abutment portion of the body serves to delimit the movement of the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hence, the mutual abutment of the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body defines the activation position. In this way, the activation distance the protective cap moves relative to the body as well as the priming distance the first stopper moves relative to the barrel may be delimited. Insofar, a movement of the first piston from the initial position towards and beyond the priming position may be effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to another example the protective cap and the body are telescopically displaceable in a longitudinal direction. The longitudinal direction typically extends along a long axis of the elongated housing. One of the protective cap and the body comprises a receptacle. The other one of the protective cap and the body comprises an insert portion. The receptacle is sized to receive the insert portion. On the other hand, the insert portion is sized to become inserted into the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By providing a telescopic interface of protective cap and body, the protective cap may slide in longitudinal direction relative to the body. Moreover, the mutual arrangement of receptacle and insert portion provides a sliding engagement in longitudinal direction. The sliding engagement may also comprise a rotational guiding. Hence, the protective cap and the body may be subject to a longitudinal sliding motion and/or to a helical sliding motion.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Typically, the insert portion may be reduced in diameter compared to the receptacle. An outside surface of the insert portion has an outside diameter that is less or equal than an inside diameter of the sidewall of the receptacle. The diameter reduced or stepped down insert portion may further provide a mount for the activation lock.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to a further example the activation lock is arranged on the insert portion. The activation lock, e.g., implemented as a ring may clasp around the insert portion. The activation lock may longitudinally abut with an end face of the sidewall of the receptacle. The activation lock may further longitudinal engage with a radially inwardly extending stop of the insert portion. The end face of the receptacle may provide one of the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body. The stepped down portion of the insert portion may provide the other one of the proximally facing abutment portion of the protective cap and the distally facing abutment portion of the body.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The activation lock may flush with an outside surface of a sidewall of the protective cap and/or of the body. When implemented as a ring the thickness of the ring may correspond to the radial step size of the insert. In this way, an outside surface of the ring may flush with the outside surface of that one of the body and the protective cap that is provided with the insert portion.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to another example the protective cap is detachably fixed to the body via a fastening mechanism. The fastening mechanism is transferable from a locked configuration into a release configuration. When in the locked configuration the protective cap is fastened and/or fixed to the body. When in the release configuration the protective cap may be detached from the body.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">With some examples the protective cap is detachably connected to the housing of the injection device, e.g., to the body and/or a sleeve surrounding or enclosing the medicament container. The fastening mechanism may provide a fastening feature on the protective cap correspondingly or complementary shaped counter fastening feature provided on the sleeve or body. With some examples, one of the fastening feature and the counter fastening feature comprises a radial protrusion and the other one of the fastening feature and the counter fastening feature comprises a radial recess or groove shaped and configured to engage with the protrusion.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fastening feature and the counter fastening feature may provide a snap fit connection between the protective cap and the body or sleeve. Generally, the protective cap may be detached and disconnected from the body by overriding the fastening mechanism.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The fastening mechanism is and/or remains in the locked configuration when the protective cap is in the preset position. The fastening mechanism is in or reaches the release configuration when the protective cap is in the activation position or when the protective cap approaches or reaches the activation position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">By way of the fastening mechanism, a detachment of the protective cap may require a movement of the protective cap from the preset position to the activation position. Only when the protective cap has reached the activation position it may be removed from the body. In this way a user of the injection device is obliged to move the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position before the protective cap may be detached from the injection device in order to expel a dose of the medicament.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to another example the fastening mechanism comprises a slot in one of a sidewall of the protective cap and the body. The fastening mechanism further comprises a pin protruding from the sidewall of the other one of the protective cap and the body. The pin is slidably displaceable along the slot. Typically, the pin is slidably engaged with the slot. The pin and the slot form a slotted link between the protective cap and the body. The fastening mechanism provides a forced guidance for the protective cap on the body.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to a further example the slot comprises a dead end portion forming a stop for the pin.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The slot further comprises an escape portion to enable removal of the pin from the slot. The dead end portion extends at a predefined direction relative to the escape portion. Typically, the dead end portion and the escape portion merge into each other at a predefined angle. At least one or both of the dead end portion and the escape portion may comprise a rather straight shape. With regards to the longitudinal axis of the elongated housing, at least what of the escape portion, the dead end portion or an intermediate portion comprises a bending or curved structure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The dead end portion comprises an end stop for the pin. The dead end stop of the dead end portion serves to delimit a movement of the pin beyond this dead end stop. When the slot is located in the body the dead end stop is located at a distal end of the dead end portion of the slot. When the slot is located or arranged in or on the protective cap the dead end stop is located or forms a proximal end of the dead end portion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The dead end stop is that longitudinal end of the dead end portion that faces away from the escape portion. Hence, an opposite end of the dead end portion merges into the escape portion, e.g., via the intermediate portion. The escape portion comprises a free end portion. The free end portion of the escape portion is located at an end of the escape portion being furthest away from the dead end portion. That end of the escape portion merging with the dead end portion is located opposite to the free end portion of the escape portion. Once the pin is guided through the escape portion it may leave the slot through the free end portion.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an initial configuration, hence when the protective cap is in the initial position the pin is typically located inside the dead end portion. It may be located near or even in abutment with the dead end stop. A movement of the protective cap in distal direction relative to the body is blocked by the pin engaging with the dead end stop.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">During movement of the protective cap from the preset position into the activation position the pin is moved along the dead end portion. When arriving in the activation position the pin is in the intermediate portion or in the merging section between the dead end portion and the escape portion. So when the protective cap is in the activation position the pin has left the dead end portion.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A movement of the protective cap in distal direction relative to the body from the activation position leads to a respective guiding of the pin along the escape portion. The pin is then allowed to leave the slot and the fixing or fastening provided by the fastening mechanism is released or abrogated. Consequently, the protective cap may be detached and removed from the body.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">With the above examples or with further examples the protective cap comprises a cup-shaped receptacle. The protective cap may comprise a tubular sleeve or tubular sheath sized and configured to receive or to accommodate a distal end of the injection device. With some examples, the protective cap comprises a closed distal end face. The protective cap comprises or forms a receptacle that is open in proximal direction so as to receive a distal end of the injection device or to receive a distal end of the housing of the injection device. Moreover, the proximal end, e.g., the proximal end of the sidewall of the protective cap may be provided with a fastening feature to engage with a correspondingly shaped counter fastening feature of the elongated housing or body of the injection device.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to another example the medicament container comprises a second stopper to separate a second cavity from the first cavity. With this example the medicament container may comprise a dual chamber cartridge or dual-chamber syringe. The first and second stoppers are both slidably arranged inside the barrel. Between the first and the second stopper there is provided the first cavity. Between the second stopper and a distal outlet of the medicament container there is provided the second cavity. Typically, a liquid substance, such as a solvent or diluent is located inside the first cavity. In the second cavity there is typically provided a lyophilized or powdered pharmaceutical substance. The barrel may further comprise a bypass, e.g., in form of a radially outwardly protruding portion. In the region of the bypass, the inner diameter of the barrel is increased compared to regions located longitudinally outside the bypass.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an initial configuration, the first stopper and the second stopper are located proximally of the bypass. During a priming procedure and by applying a distally directed pressure onto the first piston both pistons will be subject to a distally directed movement, e.g., until the second piston reaches the bypass. In this configuration the second piston is no longer able to seal the first cavity. Consequently, the liquid substance provided in the first cavity is allowed to enter the second cavity via the bypass.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The location of the bypass, the arrangement of the barrel inside the body as well as the priming distance and the activation distance are chosen in such a manner, that a majority or effectively the entirety of the liquid substance originally provided in the first cavity is transferred into the second cavity as the first stopper moves from the initial position into the priming position and/or as the protective cap moves from the preset position into the activation position.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Insofar and when the protective cap reaches the activation position the substance located inside the dual-chamber cartridge or dual-chamber syringe may be mixed, e.g., by shaking the injection device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to a further example at least one of a lyophilized medicament, a liquid medicament, a diluent end and a solvent is arranged inside the medicament container. In case that a powdery substance and a liquid substance are arranged inside the medicament container, the powdered substance, e.g., the lyophilized medicament is typically arranged in the second cavity whereas the liquid substance, e.g., the liquid medicament, the diluent and/or the solvent is arranged in the first cavity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The terms &#x201c;drug&#x201d; or &#x201c;medicament&#x201d; are used synonymously herein and describe a pharmaceutical formulation containing one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. An active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#x201c;API&#x201d;), in the broadest terms, is a chemical structure that has a biological effect on humans or animals. In pharmacology, a drug or medicament is used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being. A drug or medicament may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described below, a drug or medicament may include at least one API, or combinations thereof, in various types of formulations, for the treatment of one or more diseases. Examples of API may include small molecules having a molecular weight of 500 Da or less; polypeptides, peptides and proteins (e.g., hormones, growth factors, antibodies, antibody fragments, and enzymes); carbohydrates and polysaccharides; and nucleic acids, double or single stranded DNA (including naked and cDNA), RNA, antisense nucleic acids such as antisense DNA and RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), ribozymes, genes, and oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids may be incorporated into molecular delivery systems such as vectors, plasmids, or liposomes. Mixtures of one or more drugs are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The drug or medicament may be contained in a primary package or &#x201c;drug container&#x201d; adapted for use with a drug delivery device. The drug container may be, e.g., a cartridge, syringe, reservoir, or other solid or flexible vessel configured to provide a suitable chamber for storage (e.g., short- or long-term storage) of one or more drugs. For example, in some instances, the chamber may be designed to store a drug for at least one day (e.g., 1 to at least 30 days). In some instances, the chamber may be designed to store a drug for about 1 month to about 2 years. Storage may occur at room temperature (e.g., about 20&#xb0; C.), or refrigerated temperatures (e.g., from about &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. to about 4&#xb0; C.). In some instances, the drug container may be or may include a dual-chamber cartridge configured to store two or more components of the pharmaceutical formulation to-be-administered (e.g., an API and a diluent, or two different drugs) separately, one in each chamber. In such instances, the two chambers of the dual-chamber cartridge may be configured to allow mixing between the two or more components prior to and/or during dispensing into the human or animal body. For example, the two chambers may be configured such that they are in fluid communication with each other (e.g., by way of a conduit between the two chambers) and allow mixing of the two components when desired by a user prior to dispensing. Alternatively or in addition, the two chambers may be configured to allow mixing as the components are being dispensed into the human or animal body.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The drugs or medicaments contained in the drug delivery devices as described herein may be used for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of many different types of medical disorders.

An example of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a poly-sulphated low molecular weight heparin is enoxaparin sodium. An example of a hyaluronic acid derivative is Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc&#xae;), a sodium hyaluronate.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an immunoglobulin molecule or an antigen-binding portion thereof. Examples of antigen-binding portions of immunoglobulin molecules include F(ab) and F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, which retain the ability to bind antigen. The antibody can be polyclonal, monoclonal, recombinant, chimeric, de-immunized or humanized, fully human, non-human, (e.g., murine), or single chain antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody has effector function and can fix complement. In some embodiments, the antibody has reduced or no ability to bind an Fc receptor. For example, the antibody can be an isotype or subtype, an antibody fragment or mutant, which does not support binding to an Fc receptor, e.g., it has a mutagenized or deleted Fc receptor binding region. The term antibody also includes an antigen-binding molecule based on tetravalent bispecific tandem immunoglobulins (TBTI) and/or a dual variable region antibody-like binding protein having cross-over binding region orientation (CODV).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refer to a polypeptide derived from an antibody polypeptide molecule (e.g., an antibody heavy and/or light chain polypeptide) that does not comprise a full-length antibody polypeptide, but that still comprises at least a portion of a full-length antibody polypeptide that is capable of binding to an antigen.

Antibody fragments that are useful in the present disclosure include, for example, Fab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, scFv (single-chain Fv) fragments, linear antibodies, monospecific or multispecific antibody fragments such as bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific and multispecific antibodies (e.g., diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies), monovalent or multivalent antibody fragments such as bivalent, trivalent, tetravalent and multivalent antibodies, minibodies, chelating recombinant antibodies, tribodies or bibodies, intrabodies, nanobodies, small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIP), binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion proteins, camelized antibodies, and VHH containing antibodies. Additional examples of antigen-binding antibody fragments are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The terms &#x201c;Complementarity-determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refer to short polypeptide sequences within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides that are primarily responsible for mediating specific antigen recognition. The term &#x201c;framework region&#x201d; refers to amino acid sequences within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides that are not CDR sequences, and are primarily responsible for maintaining correct positioning of the CDR sequences to permit antigen binding. Although the framework regions themselves typically do not directly participate in antigen binding, as is known in the art, certain residues within the framework regions of certain antibodies can directly participate in antigen binding or can affect the ability of one or more amino acids in CDRs to interact with antigen. Examples of antibodies are anti PCSK-9 mAb (e.g., Alirocumab), anti IL-6 mAb (e.g., Sarilumab), and anti IL-4 mAb (e.g., Dupilumab).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of any API described herein are also contemplated for use in a drug or medicament in a drug delivery device.

idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of a handheld injection device <b>1</b> is schematically illustrated. The injection device <b>1</b> may be configured as an injection pen. It may be also configured as a so-called auto injector. The injection device <b>1</b> comprises an elongated housing <b>5</b>. The housing <b>5</b> may comprise a tubular shape. The housing <b>5</b> comprises a distal end <b>2</b> and an oppositely located proximal end <b>3</b>. With its distal end <b>2</b> the injection device is configured to expel or to inject a liquid medicament located inside a medicament container <b>79</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The medicament container <b>79</b> may be a component of a syringe <b>80</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the medicament container <b>79</b> comprises a barrel <b>82</b>. The barrel is of tubular shape. The barrel <b>82</b> comprises an outlet <b>88</b> at a distal end. The outlet <b>88</b> may be provided with a needle hub <b>92</b>. The needle hub <b>92</b> may be fixed to the outlet <b>88</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>. The needle hub <b>92</b> is typically provided with an injection needle <b>90</b>. The injection needle <b>90</b> may be covered by a needle shield <b>94</b>. The needle shield <b>94</b> may comprise or provide an inner needle cap.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The barrel <b>82</b> further comprises a radially narrowing shoulder portion <b>86</b> towards the distal end. At least one of the shoulder portion <b>86</b>, the outlet <b>88</b> and the needle hub <b>92</b> serves as or provides a distally facing abutment portion <b>87</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Inside the barrel <b>82</b> there are located a first stopper <b>10</b> and a second stopper <b>12</b>. The sidewall of the barrel <b>82</b> and the two stoppers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> delimit or confine a first cavity <b>83</b>. Inside the first cavity <b>83</b> there may be located a liquid substance, such as a solvent or diluent. There is provided a second cavity <b>84</b>. The second cavity <b>84</b> may be provided with a lyophilized medicament or with a powdered substance. The second cavity <b>84</b> is delimited in proximal direction by the second stopper <b>12</b>. It is delimited in distal direction by the outlet <b>88</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">As further indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the barrel <b>82</b> comprises a bypass <b>85</b>. In the region of the bypass <b>85</b> The inner diameter of the barrel <b>82</b> is increased compared to longitudinal sections of the barrel <b>82</b> located offset from the bypass <b>85</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The syringe <b>80</b> further comprises a piston rod <b>11</b> or plunger. The piston rod <b>11</b> is configured to abut in longitudinal direction with an abutment portion <b>17</b> located or formed by a proximal end face of the first stopper <b>10</b>. The barrel <b>82</b> is further connected to or mounted in a flange <b>81</b>. By way of the flange <b>81</b> the barrel <b>82</b> is arranged and/or fixed inside the housing <b>5</b> of the injection device <b>1</b>. As indicated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref> the housing <b>5</b> comprises a proximal housing component, denoted as body <b>20</b>. The housing <b>5</b> further comprises a distal housing component, denoted as protective cap <b>30</b>. The protective cap <b>30</b> is detachably connected to the body <b>20</b>. When assembled or attached to the body <b>20</b> the protective cap <b>30</b> covers the outlet end of the syringe <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In an initial and/or preset configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the distally facing abutment portion <b>87</b> of the barrel <b>82</b> is in direct or indirect longitudinal abutment with the protective cap <b>30</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the distal end <b>38</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b> comprises a closed end face <b>39</b> being in longitudinal or axial abutment with the needle shield <b>94</b>. The needle shield <b>94</b> is further in direct abutment with the outlet <b>88</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>. The end face <b>39</b> and hence the distal end <b>38</b> provide a proximally facing abutment <b>36</b> to engage with the distal end of the needle shield <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In a similar manner also the piston rod <b>11</b> is in direct abutment with a proximal end <b>25</b> of the body <b>20</b>. Here, the body <b>20</b>, which may be of tubular shape, comprises a closed end face <b>27</b> at a proximal end <b>25</b> in direct longitudinal abutment with a proximal end of the piston rod <b>11</b>. Hence, the proximal end <b>25</b> and hence the proximal end face <b>27</b> of the body <b>20</b> forms a distally facing abutment <b>26</b> for the piston rod <b>11</b>. The opposite distal end of the piston rod <b>11</b> is in abutment with the proximally facing abutment portion <b>17</b> of the first stopper <b>10</b>. In this way, the body <b>20</b> is in indirect longitudinal abutment with the proximally facing abutment portion <b>17</b> of the first stopper <b>10</b>. The protective cap <b>30</b> is in indirect longitudinal abutment with the distally facing abutment portion <b>87</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Instead of separate pieces that provide an effective abutment between the protective cap <b>30</b> and the barrel <b>82</b> or providing an abutment between the body <b>20</b> and the stopper <b>10</b> it is also conceivable, that the piston rod <b>11</b> is integrally formed with the body <b>20</b>. Likewise, also the needle shield <b>94</b> may be integrally formed with or rigidly connected to the protective cap <b>30</b>. Hence, the needle shield <b>94</b> may be alternatively provided by an inwardly extending protrusion of the distal end face <b>39</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Similarly, also the piston <b>11</b> may be integrally formed with the body <b>20</b>. It may be rigidly connected to the body <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">When in the initial configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> there is provided an activation lock <b>50</b> between a proximal end <b>35</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b> and a stepped portion <b>22</b> of the body <b>20</b>. As it becomes apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> the protective cap <b>30</b> comprises a receptacle <b>33</b> at the proximal end <b>35</b>. The receptacle <b>33</b> is open towards the proximal direction and is sized to receive an insert portion <b>23</b> of the body <b>20</b>. The insert portion <b>23</b> of the body <b>20</b> is a stepped down portion. Hence, the sidewall <b>21</b> of the body <b>20</b> proximally adjacent to the insert portion may comprise an outer diameter or outer structure that is somewhat equivalent or even identical to the outside diameter or structure of the sidewall <b>31</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b>. The stepped down portion <b>22</b> and hence the diameter-reduced insert portion <b>23</b> is sized to become slidably received inside the receptacle <b>33</b> as it is apparent from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">As long as the activation lock <b>50</b> is located in the interface of the telescopic engagement of the protective cap <b>30</b> and the body <b>20</b> the protective cap <b>30</b> is hindered to move in proximal direction relative to the body <b>20</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> the activation lock <b>50</b> is frangibly connected to at least one of the body <b>20</b> and the protective cap <b>30</b>. The activation lock <b>50</b> may comprise an annular structure and may fill or traverse a longitudinal gap between the proximal end <b>35</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b> and the stepped down portion <b>22</b> of the body <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the activation lock <b>50</b> comprises a distally facing abutment portion <b>51</b>, hence a distal end face to abut or to engage with a correspondingly shaped proximally facing abutment portion <b>34</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The proximally facing abutment portion <b>34</b> may be provided by an end face of the sidewall <b>31</b> of the receptacle <b>33</b>. In the opposite direction the activation lock <b>50</b> comprises a proximally facing abutment portion <b>52</b>. The abutment portion <b>52</b> may be provided by a distal end face of the receptacle <b>33</b> forming the activation lock <b>50</b>. The stepped down insert portion <b>23</b> is delimited in proximal direction by a distally facing abutment portion <b>24</b> of the body <b>20</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the proximally facing abutment portion <b>52</b> of the activation lock <b>50</b> is in abutment with the distally facing abutment portion <b>24</b> of the body <b>20</b>. In this way the activation lock fills or traverses the gap between the distally facing abutment portion <b>24</b> and the proximally facing abutment portion <b>34</b> of the body <b>20</b> and the protective cap <b>30</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> the activation lock <b>50</b> comprises a ring <b>53</b> with numerous individual segments <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, e.g., implemented as ring segment <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>. The segments <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> are mutually connected by a perforated structure <b>56</b>. In addition, at least one of the segments <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> is connected to at least one sidewall <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> of the body <b>20</b> or protective cap <b>30</b>, respectively. Hence, the activation lock <b>50</b> may be detachably and frangibly connected to the protective cap <b>30</b> by a perforated structure <b>58</b>. It may be further detachably or frangibly connected to the body <b>20</b> via the perforated structure <b>57</b>. The perforated structure(s) <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> may each comprises one or more separate connectors <b>59</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Optionally, the activation lock <b>50</b> may be provided with a gripping flap <b>72</b> that facilitates an easy gripping and handling of the activation lock by a user. By gripping of the e.g., radially outwardly protruding gripping flap a user may easily invoke and induce a disruption of at least one of the perforated structures <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> thus enabling to detach or to remove the activation lock <b>50</b> of the housing <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The distal end <b>28</b> of the body <b>20</b> is provided with an insert portion <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The resulting configuration after detachment and removal of the activation lock <b>50</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Starting from the initial or preset position a user may now move the protective cap <b>30</b> relative to the body <b>20</b> in proximal direction. Due to the longitudinal or axial abutment of the protective cap <b>30</b> with the distally facing abutment portion <b>87</b> of the barrel <b>82</b> and due to the abutment of the proximally facing abutment portion <b>17</b> of the first stopper <b>10</b> with the body <b>20</b> the first stopper <b>10</b> will be subject to a distally directed movement relative to the barrel <b>82</b> as the protective cap <b>30</b> and the body <b>20</b> approach the activation position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Since the first cavity <b>83</b> is filled with a substantially non-compressible medium a respective movement of the first stopper <b>10</b> relative to the barrel <b>82</b> equally transfers to a respective movement of the second stopper <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the second stopper <b>12</b> is moved into the region of the bypass <b>85</b>. Consequently, the liquid substance initially located inside the first cavity <b>83</b> is transferred into the second cavity <b>84</b> via the bypass. In this configuration the medicament located inside the medicament container <b>79</b> can be mixed and/or prepared for a subsequent injection procedure.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The proximally directed movement of the protective cap <b>30</b> relative to the body <b>20</b> is delimited by the proximally facing abutment portion <b>34</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b> getting in abutment with the corresponding shaped distally facing abutment portion <b>24</b> of the body <b>20</b>. In this way, the movement from the preset position into the activation position is stopped.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is illustrative of the configuration of the injection device <b>1</b> after the protective cap <b>30</b> has been removed. The device <b>1</b> then ready for dispensing of the liquid medicament located inside the second cavity <b>84</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is indicative of a final configuration of the injection device <b>1</b> after dispensing or expelling of the medicament from the second cavity <b>84</b>. During and/or for expelling of the medicament, the flange <b>81</b> and hence the barrel <b>82</b> is subject to a proximally directed movement relative to the body <b>20</b>. In other words, the body <b>20</b> and/or the piston rod <b>11</b> is subject to a distally directed movement relative to the barrel <b>82</b>, thereby moving both, the first and the second stoppers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> in distal direction. The liquid substance previously contained in the second cavity <b>84</b> is expelled via the injection needle <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> another example of an injection device <b>1</b> is shown. This injection device <b>1</b> is highly similar to the injection device as described and explained with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. There is only one difference, namely that the protective cap <b>30</b> comprises an abutment portion <b>32</b> protruding radially inwardly from the sidewall <b>31</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b>. The abutment portion <b>32</b> may comprise a radially inwardly extending flange configured to engage with the shoulder portion <b>86</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>. Here, the shoulder portion <b>86</b> effectively provides the distally facing abutment portion <b>87</b> of the barrel <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref> another example of an injection device <b>1</b> is illustrated. Again, this example is somewhat similar to the example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. But here, the body <b>20</b> further comprises a sleeve <b>60</b> displaceably, e.g., slidably arranged to the proximal portion of the body <b>20</b>. The sleeve <b>60</b> is a kind of a needle sheath a needle shield. When the protective cap <b>30</b> is removed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the sleeve <b>60</b> form a distal end of the body <b>20</b>. The distal end <b>68</b> of the sleeve <b>60</b> is located distally from the tip of the injection needle <b>90</b>. In this way, a stitch danger may be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">For conducting an injection, the distal end <b>68</b> of the sleeve <b>60</b> is pressed against the skin of the patient and the proximal portion of the body <b>20</b> is moved in distal direction relative to the sleeve <b>60</b> thus inducing a respective forward movement of the syringe <b>80</b> or barrel <b>82</b>. This is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. A rather detailed example of such an injection mechanism is further explained below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>26</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As becomes further apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> a proximal end <b>65</b> of the sleeve <b>60</b> comprises an abutment <b>64</b> configured to engage with the flange <b>81</b> or with the barrel <b>82</b> of the syringe <b>80</b>. In this way a distally directed movement of the barrel <b>82</b> and hence of the syringe <b>80</b> with the injection needle <b>90</b> mounted thereon in distal direction relative to the sleeve <b>60</b> can be delimited, namely when the abutment <b>64</b> at the proximal end <b>65</b> of the sleeve <b>60</b> abuts against a distally facing abutment portion of the flange <b>81</b>. Here, and in the course of expelling of the medicament the sleeve <b>60</b> provides an effective abutment for the flange <b>81</b> relative to the skin of the patient. A holding force for the flange relative to the distally moving piston rod <b>11</b> can be provided by the abutment of the sleeve <b>60</b> on the patient's skin. The sleeve <b>60</b> is a component of the body <b>20</b>. Insofar, the above-described abutment of the protective cap <b>30</b> may equally apply to the sleeve <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref> one example of a fastening mechanism <b>40</b> is illustrated. The fastening mechanism <b>40</b> is active between the protective cap <b>30</b> and the body <b>20</b>. The fastening mechanism <b>40</b> may be implemented as a slotted link. In the example as illustrated, the inside facing portion of the sidewall <b>31</b> of the protective cap <b>30</b> comprises a radially inwardly protruding pin <b>46</b> engaged with a slot <b>42</b> provided on an outside surface of the sidewall <b>21</b> of the body <b>20</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, the slot <b>42</b> is provided on an outside facing portion of a sidewall <b>61</b> of the sleeve <b>60</b>. The sleeve is hindered to separate distally from the proximal portion of the body <b>20</b>. From the configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> it may only move in proximal direction.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The slot <b>42</b> comprises a dead end portion <b>43</b>, an intermediate curved portion <b>45</b> and an escape portion <b>44</b>. The escape portion <b>44</b> is open towards the distal direction. It comprises a free end portion <b>49</b> and enables a removal of the pin <b>46</b> as it moves from the intermediate portion <b>45</b> through the escape portion <b>44</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The dead end portion <b>43</b> comprises a dead end stop <b>41</b> located in a longitudinal end of the slot <b>42</b> opposite to the free end portion <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the initial configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> the pin <b>46</b> is located in the dead end portion <b>43</b>. Upon and during movement of the protective cap <b>30</b> towards and into the activation position, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> the pin <b>46</b> is located in the intermediate portion <b>45</b>. The pin <b>46</b> may enter the escape portion <b>44</b> only via the intermediate portion <b>45</b>. Insofar, a detachment of the protective cap <b>30</b> from the body <b>20</b> is only possible by initially moving the protective cap <b>30</b> from the preset position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> into the activation position. Only from the activation position, in which e.g., the medicament is appropriately mixed inside the syringe <b>80</b> the protective cap <b>30</b> can be detached by transferring the pin <b>46</b> from the intermediate portion <b>45</b> into the escape portion <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> another example of a fastening mechanism <b>40</b> is illustrated. Also here, the fastening mechanism <b>40</b> comprises a dead end portion <b>43</b> with a dead end stop <b>41</b> and an escape portion <b>44</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the escape portion <b>44</b> extends in longitudinal direction. It runs substantially parallel to a longitudinal center axis of the housing <b>5</b>. The dead end portion <b>43</b> is somewhat slanted or angled. In this way, the dead end portion <b>43</b> and the escape portion <b>44</b> mutually emerging in the intermediate portion <b>45</b> form a kind of a bayonet coupling for the pin <b>46</b>. Hence, for the pin <b>46</b> sliding along the dead end portion <b>43</b>, the protective cap <b>30</b> is subject to a helical movement, i.e., a combined rotational and longitudinal displacement relative to the body <b>20</b>. Such a bayonet type coupling provided by the fastening mechanism <b>40</b> may be even beneficial to increase the longitudinal force exerted by the body <b>20</b> and the protective cap <b>30</b> to move the first stopper <b>10</b> and/or the second stopper <b>12</b> in distal direction relative to the barrel <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the sequence of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>17</b></figref> another example of a fastening mechanism <b>40</b> is described. Here, there are provided two separate slots <b>42</b>, <b>47</b>, each of which serving as a slotted link for a respective pin <b>48</b>, <b>46</b>. The slot <b>42</b> is somewhat equivalent to the slot <b>42</b> as illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. The further slot <b>47</b> is somewhat skewed or slanted relative to the elongation of the dead end portion <b>43</b> and the escape portion <b>44</b> of the other slot <b>42</b>. In this way and as the protective cap <b>30</b> is moved from the preset position as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> towards and into the activation position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> the slanted slot <b>47</b> induces an angular momentum or torque onto the protective cap <b>30</b> that leads to a respective tangential movement of the pin <b>46</b> through the intermediate portion <b>45</b> so as to ensure that the pin <b>46</b> is transferred from the dead end portion <b>43</b> into the escape portion <b>44</b> as the protective cap <b>30</b> reaches the activation position. The slanted slot may induce a flexible deformation of the protective cap as it moves towards the activation position. The tangential distance between the pins <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> make radially reduce during this movement. As soon as the activation position has been reached, the mechanical biasing or tensioning may relax, thereby transferring the pin <b>46</b> into the escape portion <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>26</b></figref> an injection mechanism and the assembly of a syringe <b>180</b> inside a body <b>120</b> of a further injection device <b>101</b> is illustrated.

Moreover, the syringe <b>180</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>26</b></figref> only comprises a single cavity <b>183</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The injection device <b>101</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>26</b></figref> comprises a cap <b>103</b> that may include a viewing window <b>104</b> (e.g., an opening or a substantially transparent piece of material).

The needle <b>190</b> is located within the sleeve <b>160</b> preventing a user from touching and seeing it. In this state the medicament delivery device <b>101</b> may be held at the body <b>102</b> and the sleeve <b>160</b> may be pushed against an injection site, e.g., a patient's skin. Consequently, the sleeve <b>160</b> moves in the proximal direction P relative to the body <b>102</b> against the force of the spring <b>130</b>, as the spring <b>130</b> is applying a biasing force on the spring seat <b>163</b> of the sleeve <b>160</b>. Due to the movement of the sleeve <b>160</b> in the proximal direction P, the spring <b>130</b> is compressed. The syringe <b>180</b> remains in position relative to the body <b>102</b> due to the syringe retarder <b>114</b>. As the syringe <b>180</b> and the needle <b>190</b> stay in position relative to the body <b>102</b> while the sleeve <b>160</b> moves in the proximal direction P, the needle <b>190</b> protrudes beyond a distal end of the sleeve <b>160</b> and is inserted into the injection site.

The needle <b>190</b> has reached its insertion depth. Any further movement of the sleeve <b>160</b> relative to the body <b>102</b> in the proximal direction P hence causes deformation of the syringe retarder <b>114</b>, and the container carrier <b>170</b> moves proximally out of the first position P<b>1</b> relative to the body <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref> are schematic longitudinal detail sections in different section planes of the medicament delivery device <b>101</b> with the syringe <b>180</b> having moved in the proximal direction P relative to the piston rod <b>110</b>. The increase in force required to deform the syringe retarder <b>114</b> may be a tactile feedback experienced by a user. As the piston rod <b>110</b> is coupled to the body <b>102</b>, movement of the syringe <b>180</b> in the proximal direction P causes the piston rod <b>110</b> to abut the stopper <b>10</b> and displace it within the syringe barrel <b>182</b> ejecting the drug from the cavity <b>183</b> through the needle <b>190</b> into the injection site. As the sleeve <b>160</b> keeps moving relative to the body <b>102</b> the spring <b>130</b> is further compressed thus increasing its force according to Hooke's law thus providing a tactile feedback to the user about the state of the injection. As the syringe <b>180</b> moves in the proximal direction P relative to the body <b>102</b> and the piston rod <b>110</b>, the flange <b>181</b> engages the proximal hook <b>152</b> within the carrier <b>170</b>. Hence, the carrier <b>170</b> is also moved in the proximal direction P relative to the piston rod <b>110</b> thereby causing the second legs <b>175</b> to move along the ratchet toothing <b>113</b>.

At this point the force opposing the movement of the body <b>102</b> in the distal direction D relative to the sleeve <b>160</b> considerably increases indicating to the user that the injection is finished. At this point the container carrier <b>170</b> has travelled to or beyond a second position P<b>2</b> such that the clamps <b>150</b> could deflect radially outwards.
