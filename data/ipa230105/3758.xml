The proof mass needs to be asymmetric with respect to this rotation axis so that it's center of mass does not lie on the axis. The proof mass may be suspended from fixed anchor points by suspenders which are sufficiently thin to undergo torsional twisting when the accelerometer experiences acceleration in the z-direction and the proof mass begins to turn out of the xy-plane.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates a MEMS accelerometer with two proof masses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.

The accelerometer comprises a mobile first proof mass and a mobile second proof mass formed in the device layer and suspended from one or more fixed parts of the accelerometer by a suspension structure. The first proof mass is adjacent to the second proof mass in the xy-plane. The suspension structure allows the first proof mass to undergo rotation out of the xy-plane about a first rotation axis, and the suspension structure allows the second proof mass to undergo rotation out of the xy-plane about a second rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first and the second rotation axes are parallel to each other and define an x-direction which is parallel to the first and the second rotation axes and a y-direction which is perpendicular to the x-direction. The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the first proof mass is greater than the y-coordinate of the first rotation axis, and the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the second proof mass is less than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis. The y-coordinate of the first rotation axis is greater than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis by a nonzero distance D.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The accelerometer comprises a first counter-electrode and a second counter-electrode which are adjacent to the first proof mass in the z-direction. The size and geometry of the first counter electrode together with the adjacent edges of the first proof mass define a first measurement region on the first proof mass on a first side of the first rotation axis. The size and geometry of the second counter electrode together with the adjacent edges of the first proof mass define a second measurement region on the first proof mass on a second side of the first rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The accelerometer also comprises a third counter-electrode and a fourth counter-electrode which are adjacent to the second proof mass in the z-direction. The size and geometry of the third counter electrode together with the adjacent edges of the second proof mass define a third measurement region on the second proof mass on a first side of the second rotation axis. The size and geometry of the fourth counter-electrode together with the adjacent edges of the second proof mass define a fourth measurement region on the second proof mass on a second side of the second rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The areas and shapes of the first, second, third and fourth measurement regions are all substantially equal in the xy-plane. The first measurement region and the second measurement region are substantially reflection-symmetric with respect to the first rotation axis. The third measurement region and the fourth measurement region are substantially reflection-symmetric with respect to the second rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The device layer may be a structural layer formed in a device wafer, or it may be a device layer deposited on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this disclosure the device plane is illustrated and referred to as the xy-plane. The device plane is determined by the device layer where proof masses and suspension structures are formed by etching. The vertical z-axis is perpendicular to the xy-plane. Motion where the center of gravity of a proof mass moves in a vertical direction may be referred to as out-of-plane motion, or motion out of the device plane. Motion where the center of gravity of a proof mass moves in the xy-plane may be referred to as in-plane motion, or motion in the device plane. The center of gravity of each proof mass may lie in the device plane when the proof mass is in its rest position. The micromechanical structures which form the mobile parts (such as proof masses and flexible suspenders) of the accelerometer can be prepared in the device layer by etching the layer. When the structures are completed, the fixed parts of the device layer typically form a supporting body which surrounds the mobile parts in the device plane. The device layer may be a silicon layer. The device layer may require structural support from a separate, much thicker support wafer or substrate during manufacturing and/or in the finished component. These thicker wafers may also be called handle wafers.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the first and second proof masses forms a seesaw, which may also be called a teeter-totter. Each seesaw responds to acceleration in the direction of the z-axis with out-of-plane rotation. If the seesaws are not coupled to each other, the response of each seesaw is independent of the response of the other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Anchor points are fixed structures which do not undergo any movement with respect to the fixed surroundings of the accelerometer when the device undergoes acceleration. The proof masses are suspended from these anchor points with suspension structures. These suspension structures include at least some flexible parts, such as torsionally flexible torsion elements. The suspension structures may also include substantially rigid extension parts which may be fixed at one end to an anchor point. These extensions are dimensioned so that they undergo far less elastic deformation than the flexible parts when the device is in operation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The parts of the suspension structure which flexibly allow out-of-plane motion are referred to as torsion elements in this disclosure. In this disclosure torsion elements are illustrated as bars which are narrow in the direction which is perpendicular to the corresponding rotation axis. Other torsionally flexible structures, like e.g. meander springs, could alternatively be used. In the figures of this disclosure each torsion element in a suspension structure lies on the corresponding rotation axis. However, a torsion element can alternatively comprise two or more torsionally flexible parts on different sides of the axis, and in that case none of these parts needs to lie exactly on the rotation axis. This option has not been illustrated, but it could be implemented for any torsion element.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The center of gravity of each proof mass lies off its rotation axis. The suspension arrangement can be configured to allow torsional twisting about the rotation axis. By dimensioning the suspension arrangement suitably, it allows the proof mass to rotate out of the device plane when a given minimum amount of z-axis acceleration is exceeded. The proof mass then undergoes a designed amount of out-of-plane rotation in response to z-axis acceleration of a certain magnitude. The torsional stiffness of the suspension arrangements can be selected so that suitable tilt angles are obtained in the range of z-axis acceleration values where the sensor is expected to operate. The tilt angle of a proof mass can be measured capacitively between the proof mass and an opposing fixed structure. The magnitude of the acceleration can be calculated from this measurement.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates an accelerometer. The illustrated x-axis here shows the positive x-direction, i.e. the direction in which the x-coordinate increases. A first proof mass <b>21</b> is suspended from first anchor points <b>281</b>. A second proof mass <b>22</b> is suspended from second anchor points <b>282</b>. Each proof mass could alternatively be suspended from just one anchor point.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>the y-axis illustrates the positive y-direction, i.e. the direction in which the y-coordinate increases. Due to the asymmetric shape of the first proof mass <b>21</b>, the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the first proof mass is greater than the y-coordinate of the first rotation axis <b>291</b>. Similarly, due to the asymmetric shape of the second proof mass the y-coordinate of the center of mass of the second proof mass <b>22</b> is less than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis <b>292</b>. The first and second proof masses will therefore rotate in opposite out-of-plane directions when the accelerometer undergoes acceleration in the z-direction which is perpendicular to the xy-plane.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates a cross-section of the accelerometer in the yz-plane along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>. Counter-electrodes <b>271</b> and <b>272</b> for the capacitive measurement are located on a surface <b>195</b> which is adjacent to the proof masses. This surface may for example the surface of a packaging wafer or substrate to which the fixed parts of the device are attached. The first and second measurement regions <b>211</b>-<b>212</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The measurement regions could be defined with a conductive electrode deposited on the first proof mass opposite to the counter-electrode. The area in the xy-plane where the electrode overlaps with the counter-electrode would then be the measurement region. But if the proof mass is sufficiently conductive, the mass itself can be used as the electrode in the capacitive measurement. In this case the electrically active measurement region on the proof mass is determined by the size and geometry of the corresponding counter-electrode and the edges of the proof mass which are adjacent to this counter-electrode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The counter-electrode may extend to an area of the xy-plane where the proof mass does not extend. Since the measurement region lies on the proof mass, the measurement region will obviously not extend beyond the proof mass in the xy-plane. So even if counter-electrode <b>271</b> would extend further to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the measurement region <b>211</b> would remain the same. If the proof mass <b>21</b> has a uniform thickness in the z-direction, the measurement region lies in the area of the xy-plane where the proof mass overlaps with the counter-electrode. This area is delimited by the edges of the counter-electrode if the counter-electrode does not extend beyond the proof mass (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>), but it will be limited by an edge of the proof mass if the counter-electrode extends beyond that edge.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The areas of the first and second measurement regions <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>in the xy-plane correspond to the areas of the underlying counter-electrodes <b>271</b> and <b>272</b>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>. The areas of the third and fourth measurement regions <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> in the xy-plane also correspond to the areas of two underlying counter-electrodes (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrates proof masses <b>21</b>-<b>22</b> in the xy-plane and underlying (or overlying) counter-electrodes <b>271</b>-<b>274</b> which extend beyond one edge of the corresponding proof mass. That edge of the proof mass then delimits and defines the corresponding measurement regions <b>211</b>-<b>212</b> and <b>221</b>-<b>222</b> in the proof masses <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, the measurement region does not necessarily always coincide with the area of the xy-plane where the proof mass overlaps with the counter-electrode. This is because the edge which delimits the measurement region does not necessarily have to be the outer edge of the proof mass. A proof mass may comprise trenches or other structures so that the vertical thickness of the proof mass varies with the x- and/or the y-coordinate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d </i></figref>illustrates an example where the proof mass <b>21</b> comprises a vertical step <b>216</b> and a vertically thin part <b>215</b>. The vertical step <b>216</b> forms an edge which delimits and defines the measurement region. Even though the counter-electrode <b>271</b> extends far to the left and the thin part <b>215</b> of the proof mass <b>21</b> also overlaps with that counter-electrode, the vertical gap between the counter-electrode <b>271</b> and the thin part <b>215</b> can deliberately be made so much greater than the corresponding gap on the other side of the step <b>216</b> that the measurement region <b>211</b> is in practice delimited by the step <b>216</b>.
