In particular, this disclosure relates to a method for the preparation of a working electrode, the method comprising laser irradiation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Monitoring certain body functions, more particularly monitoring one or more concentrations of certain analytes, plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of various diseases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Along with so-called point measurements in which a sample of a body fluid is specifically taken from a user and investigated for the analyte concentration, continuous measurements are increasingly becoming available. Hence, there is an increasing demand for accurate analyte sensors that enable reliable and cost-efficient analyte detection from a body fluid or other samples. An analyte sensor for determining the concentration of an analyte under in-vivo conditions is known from WO 2010/028708 A1. Another example of such sensor is disclosed in WO 2012/130841 A1. Moreover, WO 2007/147475 A1 discloses an amperometric sensor configured for implantation into a living body to measure the concentration of an analyte in a body fluid. An alternative sensor element is disclosed in WO 2014/001382 A1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the manufacturing of commercially available analyte sensors, a structuring step is required to form the layer of the sensing material on the substrate of the sensor such as continuous or long-term glucose monitoring sensors. Current ways of conducting this structuring step involve screen printing, dip-coating, and dispensing methods.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These methods are disadvantageous in that the sensing material cannot be applied sufficiently homogenously onto the sensor substrate such that inhomogeneities occur, in particular at the edges of the sensor substrate. These so called edge effects lead to varying sensor sensitivity across charges. In order to reduce sensor signal sensitivity variation across different charges detailed monitoring and fine adaptation of the manufacturing parameters is required. This can be time consuming and expensive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2006/018447 discloses a method for the preparation of electrode assemblies for use in an electrochemical sensor.

Further, the sensitivity can be selected and precisely adjusted during the manufacturing. Since detailed monitoring and fine adaptation of manufacturing parameters can be avoided, costs may be reduced and factory calibration of the sensor is possible.

The term specifically may refer, without limitation, to a layer of at least one material, which provides a selective barrier. Thus, the membrane layer generally may selectively allow for one or more molecules and/or compounds to pass, whereas other molecules and/or compounds are stopped by the membrane layer. Thus, as outlined above, the membrane layer is permeable for the at least one analyte to be detected. Thus, as an example, the membrane layer may be permeable for one or more of blood glucose, lactate, cholesterol or other types of analytes. The at least one membrane layer may hence function as a diffusion barrier that controls diffusion of the analyte from the exterior, e.g., the body fluid surrounding the analyte sensor, to the sensing material, i.e., the enzyme molecules in the sensing material.

More specifically, the biocompatibility layer covers the analyte sensor at least partly or completely. Even more specifically, the biocompatibility layer may be the outmost layer of the analyte sensor. Thus, even more specifically, at least a part of the biocompatibility layer contacts a body fluid of a subject.

Diffusion may occur during applying the membrane layer to the sensing material. The diffusion of the crosslinker into the sensing material may allow for at least partial cross linking of the sensing material independent of the presence of a crosslinker in the sensing material during step b) of applying the sensing material to the substrate. This may be advantageous as the presence of a crosslinker in the sensing material during applying of the sensing material to the sensor substrate in step b) is not required and can be avoided. Avoiding the presence of a crosslinker in the sensing material during applying the sensing material to the substrate may have the advantages as specified herein above, namely, e.g., constant viscosity properties of the sensing material during applying to the sensor substrate.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0085">In the method according to this disclosure, the diffusion step may further comprise a swelling of at least a part of the sensing material.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0086">The term &#x201c;swelling&#x201d; as used herein is a broad term and is to be given its ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art and is not to be limited to a special or customized meaning.
