Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a production method for purified <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract, and a purified <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Roots and stems of <i>Salacia </i>genus plants have been utilized as natural drugs in the traditional medicine Ayurveda of India and Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, it has been passed down that the root bark of <i>Salacia reticulata </i>is effective for the treatment of rheumatism, gonorrhea, and skin diseases, and that the above-described root bark is used for the treatment of early stage diabetes mellitus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, it has been reported that a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract has an effect of inhibiting a rise in the blood glucose level by a sugar absorption suppressing action based on &#x3b1;-glucosidase activity inhibition (for example, FOOD Style 21, Vol. 6, No. 5, pp. 72-78), and a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract includes polyphenols (and mangiferin, which is xanthene glycoside) (for example, YAKUGAKU ZASSHI, 121 (5), pp. 371-378). The described polyphenols are perceived as bitter taste, astringent taste, astringency, harsh taste, and odd taste, and they may give an unpleasant feeling to the consumers when ingested as food products.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">By the way, examples of the substance containing polyphenols, similarly to the <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract, include a tea extract. JP1997-220055A (JP-H9-220055A) discloses a production method for a tea beverage, characterized by bringing a tea extract liquid containing tannins and amino acids into contact with a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone resin to adsorb and remove the tannins in the tea extract liquid, thereby setting an amino acids/tannins ratio to 0.2 to 3.0. In addition, JP4336192B discloses a production method for catechins that have reduced fragrance and reduced bitter taste, which is characterized by passing an aqueous solution containing catechin extracted from tea leaves through a column packed with a synthetic adsorbent which is a copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene and treating it to collect a non-adsorbed part thereof.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Until now, there has been no report on a method of producing a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract suitable for the use application on oral ingestion, which does not require processing into a pharmaceutical preparation or a food product, by using a resin column for the intended purpose of reducing bitter taste and/or astringent taste. In a case of purifying a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract, attention should be paid to the recovery rate of the active ingredient salacinol of the <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract and the concentration thereof so that it is not decreased.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A decrease in the recovery rate of the active ingredient salacinol due to purification is not preferable from the viewpoint of the production cost. Since a decrease in the concentration of the active ingredient salacinol leads to a reduction in the activity of the <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract, the amount of one-time ingestion should be increased, and thus, there is a problem that the burden on the ingesting person may increase. Furthermore, in order to obtain an extract that can be directly ingested orally without being subjected to processing into a pharmaceutical preparation, a food product, or the like, it is important to produce an extract that has reduced bitter taste and/or reduced astringent taste and that can be easily ingested.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a purified <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract that has reduced bitter taste and/or reduced astringent taste, in which the content of salacinol contained in the extract is not reduced during purification and the concentration of salacinol contained in the extract is maintained, and a production method therefor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, the raw material for obtaining a purified <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract is not subjected to a purification treatment since the recovery rate is easily decreased. However, as a result of diligent studies to achieve the above object, the inventors of the present invention have found that the above problems can be solved by an extraction step of passing a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant-containing raw material extract consisting of at least one of a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant, a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant extract, or a <i>Salacia </i>genus plant ground product, through a column packed with a styrene-based synthetic resin.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, the following inventions are provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">&#x3c;1&#x3e;
