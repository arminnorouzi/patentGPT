Elevated temperatures, or hyperthermia, may be harmful to the brain under normal conditions, and even more importantly, during periods of physical stress, such as illness or surgery. Conversely, lower body temperatures, or mild hypothermia, may offer some degree of neuroprotection. Moderate to severe hypothermia tends to be more detrimental to the body, particularly the cardiovascular system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Targeted temperature management can be viewed in two different aspects. The first aspect of temperature management includes treating abnormal body temperatures, i.e., cooling the body under conditions of hyperthermia or warming the body under conditions of hypothermia. The second aspect of thermoregulation is an evolving treatment that employs techniques that physically control a patient's temperature to provide a physiological benefit, such as cooling a stroke patient to gain some degree of neuroprotection. By way of example, TTM systems may be utilized in early stroke therapy to reduce neurological damage incurred by stroke and head trauma patients. Additional applications include selective patient heating/cooling during surgical procedures such as cardiopulmonary bypass operations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">TTM systems circulate a fluid (e.g., water) through one or more thermal contact pads coupled with a patient to affect surface-to-surface thermal energy exchange with the patient. In general, TTM systems comprise a TTM fluid control module coupled with at least one thermal contact pad via a fluid delivery line. In some embodiments, tubing extends from a thermal contact pad to couple with the fluid delivery line. One such TTM system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,645,232, titled &#x201c;Patient Temperature Control System with Fluid Pressure Maintenance&#x201d; filed Oct. 11, 2001, and one such thermal contact pad and related system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,045 titled &#x201c;Cooling/heating Pad and System&#x201d; filed Jan. 4, 1999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. As noted in the '045 patent, the ability to establish and maintain thermally intimate pad-to-patient contact is of importance to fully realizing medical efficacies with TTM systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fluid delivery line generally includes at least two fluid conduits for transporting TTM fluid to and from the thermal contact pad. Fluid delivery lines may include connection systems for selectively connecting to and disconnecting from the thermal contact pad. Although TTM systems may include a functionality to purge a thermal contact pad prior to disconnecting the thermal contact pad from a fluid delivery line, an operator may fail to utilize such functionality and, even when utilized, such functionality may leave some TTM fluid in the thermal contact pad. As a result, upon disconnection, some TTM fluid may leak from the tubing extending from the thermal connection pad thereby causing health and safety risks. Disclosed herein are systems, devices, and methods for preventing leakage of TTM fluid upon disconnecting a thermal contact pad from a fluid delivery line.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly summarized, disclosed herein is a targeted temperature management (TTM) pad to receive and circulate TTM fluid to facilitate thermal energy transfer between the TTM fluid and a patient, the TTM pad including a pad portion configured for placement on the patient, a fluid delivery conduit extending away from the pad portion, the fluid delivery conduit including a delivery conduit connector at a proximal end thereof, a fluid return conduit extending away from the pad portion, the fluid return conduit including a return conduit connector at a proximal end thereof, and a connector coupled to a distal end of each of the fluid delivery conduit and the fluid return conduit, the connector including a flapper valve configured to alternate between open and closed positions based on whether the connector is coupled with a fluid delivery line (FDL) hub. The connector includes a connector housing having disposed therein proximal ends of the fluid delivery conduit and the fluid return conduit, a conduit partition separates the fluid delivery conduit and fluid return conduit and the flapper valve.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The flapper valve is configured in the closed position covering openings of each of the fluid delivery conduit and fluid return conduit when the connector is uncoupled from the FDL hub. The connector is configured to receive the FDL hub upon coupling (connecting) causing the flapper valve to deform into the open position, wherein coupling the connector and the FDL hub establishes fluid communication therebetween. The flapper valve is configured to deform around the conduit partition. In some embodiments, the conduit partition includes an aperture, and wherein the flapper valve is disposed in the aperture. In some such embodiments, wherein each of a proximal side and a distal side of the aperture includes tapering to facilitate deformation of the flapper valve upon coupling of the connector and the FDL hub.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the connector includes a top compression strip connected to a top latch and a bottom compression strip connected to a bottom latch, wherein each of the top latch and bottom latch extends proximally from the connector. The top and bottom compression strips are configured to cause movement of the top and bottom latches in opposing directions upon application of pressure to the top and bottom compressions strips. Upon coupling of the connector and the FDL hub, an opening of the fluid delivery conduit is configured to receive a distal conduit tip of the fluid delivery lumen and an opening of the fluid return conduit is configured to receive a distal conduit tip of the fluid return lumen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also discussed herein is a targeted temperature management (TTM) system, comprising a TTM module configured to provide a TTM fluid, a fluid delivery line (FDL) including a FDL hub, a fluid delivery lumen and a fluid return lumen, and a pad discussed above. Further, embodiments of a method of exchanging thermal energy with a patient are disclosed, where the method comprises providing a targeted temperature management (TTM) module configured to circulate TTM fluid through one or more pads, the TTM module including a fluid delivery line (FDL) for transporting TTM fluid to and from the one or more pads, the FDL including an FDL hub, a fluid delivery lumen and a fluid return lumen, providing a pad as discussed above, connecting the delivery conduit connector and the return conduit connector to the FDL hub to establish fluid communication of the fluid delivery conduit and the fluid return conduit with the FDL, applying the pad portion to the patient, and initiating circulation of the TTM fluid through the pad.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the concepts provided herein will become more apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the accompanying drawings and the following description, which describe particular embodiments of such concepts in greater detail.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A more particular description of the present disclosure will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof that are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The cross-sectional view of the FDL hub <b>600</b> illustrates that the FDL hub <b>600</b> includes a housing <b>603</b> houses the plurality of first fluid conduits <b>602</b>A-<b>602</b>C and the plurality of second fluid conduits <b>604</b>A-<b>604</b>C. The housing <b>603</b> includes two grooves <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> on opposing sides (e.g., on a top side and a bottom side). As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B-<b>7</b>C</figref>, the latches <b>504</b>, <b>508</b> are disposed within the grooves <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> when the pad connector <b>500</b> is connected to the FDL hub <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates that each conduit of both of the plurality of first fluid conduits <b>602</b>A-<b>602</b>C and the plurality of second fluid conduits <b>604</b>A-<b>604</b>C extend distally from the housing <b>603</b> (e.g., toward a TTM pad), where the distally-extending portion may be referred to as distal conduit tips (e.g., the distal conduit tips <b>605</b>A, <b>607</b>A). Further, the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates tubing <b>610</b> that extends proximally from the housing <b>603</b> (e.g., toward a TTM module such as the module <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), where the tubing <b>610</b> may be comprised of a delivery tubing <b>612</b> and a return tubing <b>614</b>. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of first fluid conduits <b>602</b>A-<b>602</b>C may receive TTM fluid from the deliver tubing <b>612</b> and each of the plurality of second fluid conduits <b>604</b>A-<b>604</b>C may return TTM fluid to the return tubing <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a view of a proximal portion of the pad connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> approaching the fluid delivery line hub of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates the pad connector <b>500</b> and the FDL hub <b>600</b> prior to connecting (or immediately following disconnecting) using a combination of the cross-sectional illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b>B</figref>. As is shown, the latches <b>504</b>, <b>508</b> align with the grooves <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> such that upon application of pressure to the compression strips <b>528</b>, <b>530</b> of the pad connector <b>508</b>, the latches <b>504</b>, <b>508</b> will move in opposing directions allowing the pad connector <b>500</b> to physically connect with the FDL hub <b>600</b>. As is understood, upon removal of the pressure from the compression strips <b>528</b>, <b>530</b>, the latches <b>504</b>, <b>508</b> will return to a default position, which is within the grooves <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> when the pad connector <b>500</b> is connected with the FDL hub <b>600</b>. Further, the conduit <b>602</b>A aligns with the conduit <b>510</b> and the conduit <b>604</b>A aligns with the conduit <b>512</b> thereby providing for fluid communication between the pad connector <b>500</b> and the FDL hub <b>600</b>. Notably, as the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows the pad connector <b>500</b> and the FDL hub <b>600</b> in a disconnected state, the flapper valve <b>514</b> is shown in a closed position, e.g., covering the openings of the conduits <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a view of the proximal portion of the pad connector and the fluid delivery line hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shown in a connected state, in accordance with some embodiments. As the pad connector <b>500</b> connects with the FDL hub <b>600</b>, the distal conduit tips <b>605</b>A, <b>607</b>A enter the conduits <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, respectively. Specifically, as the distal conduit tips <b>605</b>A, <b>607</b>A enter the conduits <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, the flapper valve <b>514</b> is deformed (e.g., bent to form a curved or &#x2018;V&#x2019; shape), which allows TTM fluid to flow between the conduits <b>602</b>A, <b>510</b> and the conduits <b>604</b>A, <b>512</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrates the connected state of the proximal portion of the pad connector and the fluid delivery line hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> having fluid flowing therethrough, in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, TTM fluid may flow from the conduit <b>602</b>A (from a TTM module) to the conduit <b>510</b> and from the conduit <b>512</b> to the conduit <b>604</b>A such that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrates fluid communication. As is understood, when the pad connector <b>500</b> is disconnected from the FDL hub <b>600</b> (upon application of pressure to the compression strips <b>528</b>, <b>530</b> and a pulling force to the pad connector <b>500</b> in the distal direction), the flapper valve <b>514</b> returns to its default (or non-deformed) shape thereby once again blocking the openings of the conduits <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can use the preceding description to utilize the invention to its fullest extent.
