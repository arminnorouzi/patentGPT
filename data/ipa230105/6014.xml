In order to increase the screen-to-body ratio, a technical solution of placing an optical sensor (e.g., a camera) on a side, facing away from a light exit surface, of a screen (i.e., a display panel) of a display device, is proposed in the related art. That is, the optical sensor is disposed below the display panel to form an under-screen optical sensor, so as to release a space occupied by the optical sensor in the display panel. In this design, external light needs to pass through the display panel to reach the under-screen optical sensor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">However, the display panel has a low light transmittance, so that the under-screen optical sensor receives insufficient light, which affects a function of the under-screen optical sensor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to solve this problem, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display device. The display device includes a display panel <b>10</b>. The display device may further include a middle frame <b>20</b> for supporting the display panel <b>10</b>, and a housing <b>30</b> for fixing and protecting the display panel <b>10</b> and the middle frame <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The display device may be applied to various scenes. For example, the display device may be a display, a television, a billboard, a digital photo frame, a laser printer with a display function, a telephone, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (FDA), a digital camera, a camcorder, a viewfinder, a navigator, a display device for a vehicle, a large-area wall display device, a home appliance, an information inquiry device (e.g., a business inquiry device of an e-government, a bank, a hospital or an electric power department), or a monitor.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the display panel may be an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel, a quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED) panel, a micro light-emitting diode (including a mini-LED or a micro-LED) panel. For clarity, a related description will be made in an example where the display panel is the OLED display panel.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the display panel <b>10</b> has a display region A and a bezel region B located on a periphery of the display region. The bezel region B is located on at least one side of the display region A. For example, the bezel region B may be arranged around the display region A.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, the display panel includes a plurality of pixel driving circuits and a plurality of light-emitting devices L. Each light-emitting device L is coupled to a pixel driving circuit to form a light-emitting sub-pixel, and the pixel driving circuit is configured to drive the light-emitting device L to emit light.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, a plurality of light-emitting sub-pixels include a first type of light-emitting sub-pixels, a second type of light-emitting sub-pixels and a third type of light-emitting sub-pixels. Light-emitting sub-pixels of the same type have the same light-emitting color, and light-emitting sub-pixels of different types have different light-emitting colors. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each light-emitting sub-pixel <b>101</b> may emit one of the three primary colors of light. Then, the first type of light-emitting sub-pixels may be red light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b>-R, the second type of light-emitting sub-pixels may be green light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b>-G, and the third type of light-emitting sub-pixels may be blue light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b>-B.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the light-emitting device L may be a light-emitting device including a light-emitting diode (LED), an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) or a quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED). Based on the foregoing embodiments, the display panel is the OLED display panel, and thus the light-emitting device L is an OLED device. A plurality of OLED devices may be disposed in the display panel <b>10</b>. Since the OLED device may realize self-luminescence, a backlight source is not required to be provided in the display device with the plurality of OLED devices.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the display panel <b>10</b> may include a substrate <b>110</b>, an anode <b>111</b>, a hole transport layer (HTL) <b>112</b>, a light-emitting layer (e.g., an organic light-emitting layer) <b>113</b>, an electron transport layer (ETL) <b>114</b>, a cathode <b>115</b> and an encapsulation layer <b>116</b> that are sequentially arranged. The anode <b>111</b>, the hole transport layer <b>112</b>, the light-emitting layer <b>113</b>, the electron transport layer <b>114</b> and the cathode <b>115</b> are sequentially stacked on the substrate <b>110</b> to form a light-emitting device.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The substrate is configured to carry film layers. The substrate may be a rigid substrate. The rigid substrate may be a glass substrate or a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) substrate. For another example, the substrate may be a flexible substrate. The flexible substrate may be a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, a polyethylene naphthalate two formic acid glycol ester (PEN) substrate or a polyimide (PI) substrate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A circuit layer may be formed on the substrate, and the circuit layer may include the plurality of pixel driving circuits. The substrate on which the circuit layer is formed may be referred to as a driving backplane. The plurality of light-emitting devices may be disposed on a side of the circuit layer away from the substrate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, the anode may be made of, for example, a transparent conductive material with a high work function. An electrode material of the anode may include indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium gallium oxide (IGO), gallium zinc oxide (GZO), zinc oxide (ZnO), indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum zinc oxide (AZO), and a carbon nanotube. The cathode may be made of, for example, a material with a high conductivity and a low work function. An electrode material of the cathode may include a magnesium aluminum (MgAl) alloy, a lithium aluminum (LiAl) alloy and other alloys, or magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), lithium (Li), silver (Ag) and other elemental metals.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, a material of the organic light-emitting layer may be selected according to different colors of light emitted from the organic light-emitting layer. For example, the material of the organic light-emitting layer includes a fluorescent light-emitting material or a phosphorescent light-emitting material. For another example, in at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, a doping system may be used in the organic light-emitting layer. That is, a dopant material is mixed into a host light-emitting material to obtain a usable light-emitting material. For example, the host light-emitting material may be a metal compound material, a derivative of anthracene, an aromatic diamine compound, a triphenylamine compound, an aromatic triamine compound, a biphenyldiamine derivative, or a triarylamine polymer. In a case where a type of the material of the organic light-emitting layer is different, a color of the light emitted from the organic light-emitting layer is different, so that a light-emitting color of a corresponding sub-pixel is different.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, light-emitting sub-pixels (e.g., three) with different light-emitting colors may constitute a pixel. The display panel may include a plurality of pixels located in the display region. For example, the plurality of pixels may be arranged in a plurality of rows and a plurality of columns. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the display panel, three adjacent light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b> with different light-emitting colors constitute a light-emitting pixel <b>160</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a red light-emitting sub-pixel <b>101</b>-R, a green light-emitting sub-pixel <b>101</b>-G and a blue light-emitting sub-pixel <b>101</b>-B that are adjacent may constitute a light-emitting pixel <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> again, when a voltage is applied to the anode <b>111</b> and the cathode <b>115</b>, electrons in the cathode <b>115</b> move to the light-emitting layer <b>113</b> through the electron transport layer <b>114</b> due to an action of the voltage, holes in the anode <b>111</b> move to the light-emitting layer <b>113</b> through the hole transport layer <b>112</b> due to the action of the voltage, and the electrons and the holes are combined in the light-emitting layer <b>113</b> to emit light, so as to realize the self-luminescence. In addition, by adjusting the voltage applied to the anode <b>111</b> and the cathode <b>115</b> of the OLED device at a different position in the display panel, a light-emitting intensity of the OLED device may be changed, thereby realizing display of a color image.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The encapsulation layer may be used for ensuring a good sealing property inside the OLED device to reduce contact of the OLED device with oxygen and water vapor in an external environment, so that a performance of the OLED device may be kept stable, and a service life of the OLED device may be prolonged.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the substrate and the encapsulation layer may be sealed by an encapsulation glue. For another example, the encapsulation layer may include an inorganic encapsulation layer, an organic encapsulation layer and an inorganic encapsulation layer that are sequentially stacked, which are manufactured on the substrate on which the pixel driving circuits and the light-emitting devices are formed by a film layer manufacturing process, so as to encapsulate the light-emitting devices. The film layer manufacturing process may include, for example, at least one of a vapor deposition process and a spin coating process.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the display region A has first region(s) A<b>1</b> and a second region A<b>2</b>. There may be one or more first regions A<b>1</b> in the display region A. For the convenience of description, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the display region A includes one first region A<b>1</b> as an example, which is collectively described here, and will not be repeated below.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, a region other than the first region A<b>1</b> in the display region A is the second region A<b>2</b>. That is, the second region A<b>2</b> is used only for distinction from the first region A<b>1</b>, and does not mean a specific region in the display region A. Moreover, the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are only for illustration, and actual sizes of the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b> are not limited.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the display panel includes light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b> located in the first region A<b>1</b> and light-emitting sub-pixels <b>101</b> located in the second region A<b>2</b>. That is, the display panel <b>10</b> includes pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> located in the first region A<b>1</b> and pixel driving circuits located in the second region. A density of the pixel driving circuits in the first region is less than a density of the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in the second region A<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As a specific implementation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> again, the display region A of the display panel <b>10</b> includes the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b>. In the second region A<b>2</b>, the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> are substantially uniformly distributed in row and column directions. That is, a distance d<b>1</b> between every two adjacent pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in each row (i.e., a distance between a certain point of a pixel driving circuit and a corresponding point of an adjacent pixel driving circuit, e.g., a distance between connection points of two adjacent pixel driving circuits for coupling respective light-emitting devices) is substantially equal, and a distance d<b>2</b> between every two adjacent pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in each column is substantially equal. According to the density of the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in the second region A<b>2</b>, the first region A<b>1</b> has, for example, 7 by 7 positions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> where the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> are able to be respectively placed. In the 7 by 7 positions, only some positions are each provided with the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b>, and other positions are not provided with the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b>, so that the density of the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in the first region A<b>1</b> is less than the density of the pixel driving circuits in the second region A<b>2</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there are 9 positions (each indicated by a block filled with oblique lines) where the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b> is not disposed. In the embodiments, such a position where the pixel driving circuit is not disposed may be referred to as a vacancy position.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Many metal wires exist in a pixel driving circuit, and these metal wires have a poor light transmittance, so that a light quantity of the external light transmitted to the under-screen optical sensor through the display panel is small, and the under-screen optical sensor receives insufficient light, which finally affects the function of the under-screen optical sensor. For example, some positions in the first region are not provided with the pixel driving circuit, and a position where the pixel driving circuit is not disposed has a higher light transmittance than a position where the pixel driving circuit is disposed, so that a light transmittance of the first region is improved, and a light transmittance of the display panel is improved. Thus, the first region A<b>1</b> may also be referred to as a transmittance increase region. Due to the transmittance increase region of the display panel <b>10</b>, an under-screen optical sensor is able to receive an increased light quantity, so that a function of the under-screen optical sensor is able to be ensured.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> located in the first region A<b>1</b> in the display panel <b>10</b> are distributed in rows and columns. The number of pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in each row is less than the number of columns of the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in the first region A<b>1</b>. That is, in the first region A<b>1</b>, there is at least one position in each row where the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b> is not disposed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It can be understood that the distribution of the pixel driving circuits in the rows and columns may be an array distribution, or may be other distribution structures, which is not limited.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> in the first region A<b>1</b> are not distributed in an array, but are only arranged in the row direction and the column direction. In at least one row, there is at least one position where the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b> is not disposed. In at least one column, there is at least one position where the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b> is not disposed.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A region in which the pixel driving circuit is not disposed has a higher light transmittance than a region in which the pixel driving circuit is disposed, and a region in which one or at least two adjacent positions in each row are not provided with the pixel driving circuit is referred to as a circuit vacancy region. That is, the circuit vacancy region includes one vacancy position or at least two continuous vacancy positions. Since at least one circuit vacancy region (e.g., a plurality of circuit vacancy regions) exists in each row, the circuit vacancy regions in the first region are distributed more uniformly in the column direction, so that the light transmission of the first region in the column direction is more uniform.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in the first region A<b>1</b>, each row of pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> includes a plurality of circuit groups <b>42</b>, each circuit group <b>42</b> includes m pixel driving circuits <b>300</b> that are continuously distributed, and n continuous positions between every two adjacent circuit groups <b>42</b> are not provided with the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b>. Here, m is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., m&#x2265;1), and n is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., n&#x2265;1). That is, each row includes a plurality of circuit vacancy regions <b>41</b>, and each circuit vacancy region <b>41</b> is a region in which n adjacent positions in a row are not provided with the pixel driving circuit <b>300</b>, and includes n adjacent vacancy positions.
