Examples of this are servers, network components and uninterruptible power supplies.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common for data centres to be equipped with appropriate IT equipment cabinets in which IT equipment or IT components are installed depending on the intended use. As IT equipment cabinets have a much longer lifespan than the IT equipment itself, it may be that the cabinets no longer have the necessary dimensions to accommodate new IT equipment. It may also be necessary, for example, to accommodate additional equipment in an IT equipment cabinet. An example of this is a larger and uninterruptible power supply or an additional network component.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Until this point, IT equipment cabinets often had to be replaced in this case, which is associated with increased costs and effort.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is therefore to address a possibility to increase the size of IT equipment cabinets.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the invention, this object is achieved by an extension kit for an IT equipment cabinet having the features of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferred embodiments of the invention are provided in the dependent claims, in the description, and in the figures and their explanations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The extension kit according to the invention for an IT equipment cabinet has two vertical profiles, two transverse profiles and four depth profiles. The two vertical profiles and the two transverse profiles form a rectangular frame, wherein two lower and two upper contact regions are formed in each case between one vertical profile and one transverse profile. These contact regions are located in the corners of each frame.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each of the depth profiles is fastened to one of the four contact regions with one of its two ends. Furthermore, two adapter profiles are provided, wherein one adapter profile is fastened parallel to each vertical profile on the other end of two depth profiles. The adapter profiles are used for fastening to an IT equipment cabinet and are designed accordingly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, it has been recognised that it is advantageous not to provide a new IT equipment cabinet, but to extend existing IT equipment cabinets. To achieve this, the underlying construction of an IT equipment cabinet is again incorporated so that the extension kit essentially has a cuboid outer structure. However, it is missing two transverse profiles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The necessary stability of the extension kit is achieved by connecting the adapter profiles to the IT equipment cabinet. In this respect, the two transverse profiles of the IT equipment cabinet facing the extension kit also form the necessary transverse profiles for the extension kit in order to ensure sufficient stability.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is advantageous if the cross-section of the vertical profiles and the cross-section of the transverse profiles are the same. In other words, the same profiles can be used with different lengths. This facilitates storage and also makes a flexible set-up possible.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The contact regions can be of any design. It is advantageous if an identical corner connector is provided in each. This corner connector is designed in such a way that it has one receptacle or connection region each for a vertical profile, for a transverse profile and for a depth profile. If the vertical and transverse profiles have the same basic profile, identical corner connectors can be used for all four contact regions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In principle, the vertical profiles, the transverse profiles and/or the depth profiles can be connected to the corner connectors or to each other by means of any fastening means. A detachable fastening is preferred, for example, in the form of a screw or a clamp connection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The adapter profile is preferably designed such that it corresponds to the vertical profiles of the IT equipment cabinet, i.e. makes fastening thereto possible. For example, the adapter profile can have, at least in its start and end region, an S-shaped, mirrored S-shaped, U-shaped or C-shaped cross-section. In these regions, it can be attached to the corresponding corner connectors of the IT equipment cabinet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The S-shaped or mirrored S-shaped cross-section of the adapter profile can have one inner leg, two outer legs and two connecting legs, for example. In this case, a first end of the first outer leg can be connected to a first end of the inner leg by means of the first connecting leg. A second end of the inner leg can be connected to a first end of the second outer leg by means of the second connecting leg.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The U-shaped or C-shaped cross-section of the adapter profile can have two outer legs and one connecting leg, for example. In this case, a first end of the first outer leg can be connected to a first end of the second outer leg by means of the connecting leg.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Fastening openings can be provided in the two outer legs. These are used, for example, to fasten the adapter profile to the IT equipment cabinet and to fasten the adapter profile to the depth profiles of the extension kit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is thus advantageous if the connecting legs are dimensioned such that they allow access to the fastening openings of the outer legs. Hereby, the dimensioning is such that it is possible to insert and tighten screws in order to attach the extension kit to the IT equipment cabinet by means of the adapter profile or to attach the adapter profiles to the depth profiles.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The flexibility of the extension kit is further increased if the adapter profile has fastening holes for fastening IT equipment at least between its start and end regions. In particular, these can have a spacing according to the HE standard. This makes it possible to also install IT equipment in the extension kit, which equipment can be fastened to the adapter profile on one side and to corresponding T-slots or fastening means on the vertical profiles on the other side.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention further relates to an IT equipment cabinet having four vertical cabinet profiles, four transverse cabinet profiles and four depth cabinet profiles. Together with eight preferably identical corner connectors, these form a cuboid frame structure of the IT equipment cabinet.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The IT cabinet according to the invention has a corresponding extension kit, as explained above, which is fastened to four corner connectors of a front or rear side of the IT equipment cabinet by means of the adapter profiles. In this way, it is possible to easily and efficiently increase the space provided by an IT equipment cabinet. In principle, the extension kit can also be attached to one of the sides.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the vertical profiles and the vertical cabinet profiles have a same cross-section. It is also possible that, additionally or alternatively, the transverse profiles and the transverse cabinet profiles have a same cross-section. Analogously, the depth profiles and the depth cabinet profiles can have a same cross-section. Furthermore, it is preferable if the corner connectors of the IT equipment cabinet and the extension kit are designed identically.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Such dimensioning and construction ensures that components developed for the IT equipment cabinet itself can also be integrated into the extension kit. For example, this applies to side panels, doors and shelves or the like that can be mounted in the interior.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following, the invention is described in more detail using a schematic exemplary embodiment with reference to the figures.
