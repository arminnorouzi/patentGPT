The present invention more specifically relates to metal-supported cells, in particular, metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell units of either the oxidizer type (MS-SOFC) or electrolyser type (MS-SOEC), and stacks thereof.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some fuel cell units can produce electricity by using an electrochemical conversion process that oxidises fuel to produce electricity. Some fuel cell units can also, or instead, operate as regenerative fuel cells (or reverse fuel cells) units, often known as solid oxide electrolyser fuel cell units, for example to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water, or carbon monoxide and oxygen from carbon dioxide. They may be tubular or planar in configuration. Planar fuel cell units may be arranged overlying one another in a stack arrangement, for example 100-200 fuel cell units in a stack, with the individual fuel cell units arranged electrically in series.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A solid oxide fuel cell that produces electricity is based upon a solid oxide electrolyte that conducts negative oxygen ions from a cathode to an anode located on opposite sides of the electrolyte. For this, a fuel, or reformed fuel, contacts the anode (fuel electrode) and an oxidant, such as air or an oxygen rich fluid, contacts the cathode (air electrode). Conventional ceramic-supported (e.g. anode-supported) SOFCs have low mechanical strength and are vulnerable to fracture. Hence, metal-supported SOFCs have recently been developed which have the active fuel cell component layer supported on a metal substrate. In these cells, the ceramic layers can be very thin since they only perform an electrochemical function: that is to say, the ceramic layers are not self-supporting but rather are thin coatings/films laid down on and supported by the metal substrate. Such metal supported SOFC stacks are more robust, lower cost, have better thermal properties than ceramic-supported SOFCs and can be manufactured using conventional metal welding techniques.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Applicant's earlier patent application WO2015/136295 discloses metal-supported SOFCs in which the electrochemically active layer (or active fuel cell component layer) comprises respective anode, electrolyte and cathode layers respectively deposited (e.g. as thin coatings/films) on and supported by a metal support plate <b>12</b> (e.g. foil) The metal support plate has a porous region surrounded by a non-porous region with the active layers being deposited upon the porous region so that gases may pass through the pores from one side of the metal support plate to the opposite side to access the active layers coated thereon. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fuel cell unit <b>9</b> comprises three plates or layers&#x2014;the metal support plate <b>12</b>, a separator plate <b>50</b> and a spacer plate <b>13</b> sandwiched between them. It also has fluid ports <b>20</b>, <b>88</b> (for oxidant or fuel) and the three plates are stacked upon one another and welded (fused together) through the spacer plate <b>13</b> to form a single metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell unit with a fluid volume in the middle defined by the large space <b>14</b> provided in the spacer plate <b>13</b>, The metal components of the fuel cell stack repeat layer are in electrical contact with one another, with electron flow between them being primarily via the fuse/weld path, thereby avoiding surface-to-surface contact resistance losses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As discussed in WO2015/136295, the porous region comprises small apertures (holes drilled through the metal foil substrate) (not shown) extending through the metal support plate <b>12</b>, in a location to overlie the anode (or cathode, depending on the polarity orientation of the electrochemically active layer), which is positioned under the metal support plate <b>12</b>. These are positioned in the large space or aperture <b>14</b> defined by the spacer plate <b>13</b> so as to allow the fluid volume to be in fluid communication with the electrochemically active layers on the underside of the support plate <b>12</b> through the small apertures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the separator plate <b>50</b>, up and down corrugations <b>60</b> are provided to extend up to the cathode (or anode, depending on the polarity orientation of the electrochemically active layers) of a subsequent fuel cell unit stacked onto this fuel cell unit, and down to the metal support plate <b>12</b> of its own fuel cell unit. This thus electrically connects between adjacent fuel cells units of a stack to put the electrochemically active layers of the stack (usually one on each fuel cell unit) in series with one another.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known to provide a single central port in circular fuel cell units (for example, WO 2005/064725 A1 and US 2011/123890 A1), wherein the electrochemically active layers may be in the form of annular segments around the central port (for example WO 2005/064725 A1) or in the form of an annulus around the central port. Such architectures are significantly different to rectangular cell units given their highly symmetrical nature</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US 2013/0177829 A1 and US 2012/0295182 A1 provide a central manifold in a separator of dual plate construction. The separator has a &#x201c;paddle&#x201d; or &#x201c;H&#x201d; shape. There are a pair of elongate channels within the separator, extending in opposite directions, to supply, at a distal end of the channel and separated from the central manifold, a respective pair of self-supporting electrolyte electrode assemblies.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2008/123968 A1 relates to a stack of cell units having a central port with self-supporting electrolyte electrode assemblies.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">JP 2013/187005 A relates to cell units having two self-supporting electrolyte electrode assemblies arranged on a separator, the separator having a central port for cooling air. The cell units may be formed into a stack and fastened using bolts which pass through central port.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC) may have the same structure as an SOFC but is essentially that SOFC operating in reverse, or in a regenerative mode, to achieve the electrolysis of water and/or carbon dioxide by using the solid oxide electrolyte to produce hydrogen gas and/or carbon monoxide and oxygen.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed at a stack of repeating solid oxide fuel cell units having a structure suitable for use as an SOEC or an SOFC. For convenience, SOEC or SOFC stack cell units will both hereinafter be referred to as &#x201c;cell units&#x201d; (i.e. meaning SOEC or SOFC stack cell units).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention seeks to improve the efficiency of the fuel cell unit while providing a cell unit that is cost-efficient&#x2014;reducing their cost of manufacture would be of significant benefit to reduce the entry cost of fuel cell energy production.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a stack of rectangular, planar electrochemical cell units, each cell unit comprising at least one first fluid mid-port that is disposed midway along its length within or between one or more active cell chemistry regions and is in fluid communication with a first fluid volume of the cell unit, wherein the first fluid mid-ports of the respective cell units align to form at least one first fluid mid-passageway extending in the stack direction; and, wherein the stack is configured such that, in each first fluid volume, first fluid flow paths extend across the one or more active cell chemistry regions between the at least one first fluid mid-port and each respective opposed cell end.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this way, the first fluid flow paths may extend in opposed (e.g. lengthwise) directions across the one or more active cell chemistry regions between the at least one first fluid mid-port and each respective opposed cell end. Such a flow path arrangement means that one or more active cell chemistry regions may be disposed between the mid-port and each opposed cell end. Active cell chemistry disposed to each side of the mid-port means that there is a lower pressure drop across the region and shorter distance for fluid to travel to service the active cell chemistry region(s) than if the flow path extended lengthwise from one cell end to the opposed cell end across the entire cell chemistry. Thus, differences in temperature and fuel delivery/consumption may be reduced across the chemistry.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The flow path is between the mid-port and the respective opposed ends, however, the fluid flow itself will fan out across the active cell chemistry regions between the mid-port and the opposed cell ends. Nonetheless, while the flow fans out there is a (main) component of the fluid flow path extending (e.g. lengthwise) between the mid-port and the respective cell ends.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The active cell chemistry regions may share the same mid-port and may be the same distance therefrom. This increases power density of each cell unit by effectively reducing the number of ports required per unit area of active cell chemistry. This can lead to a more thermally ideal cell unit having an increased proportion of the cell unit area covered by active cell chemistry, shorter fluid flow path length, and smaller number of ports. The shorter fluid flow path length means that the temperature gradient along the path length may be reduced. The mid port(s) may extend in the stacking direction through the height of the stack.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The stack is configured such that, in use, first fluid flow paths extend in opposite directions between the at least one first fluid mid-port and each respective opposed cell end. The flow path may be symmetrical with respect to the centre of the rectangular cell unit. Indeed, the port does not need to direct the fluid flow path and fluid flow from the port may be non-directional (there may not be defined tortuous flow paths in the cell unit). In other words, the flow path around (i.e. from or to) the mid-ports is substantially radial. That is, the flow path is not constrained to a channel around (i.e. from or to) the mid-port. The one or more active cell chemistry regions may substantially surround the mid-ports.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The mid-port may be disposed midway along both the cell unit's length and width. Rectangular cell units include square cell units in which the length and width of the cell unit are equal. The cell unit may be elongate, in which case the cell unit has a length greater than a width or vice versa. The rectangular cell unit may have rounded or radiused corners disposed between two pairs of parallel edges.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A rectangular cell unit may have two pairs of substantially parallel sides. In cases where a length of a first pair of sides is greater than a length of a second pair of sides, the fluid mid-ports may be disposed midway along the length of the first pair of sides.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cell unit may comprise a metal support plate and a separator plate, between which the first fluid volume is defined and contained.

At least one fluid port may be provided in each of the separator plate and the metal support plate, these being aligned to form respective first fluid mid-ports and first fluid passageway.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Usually, there are at least two separate active cell chemistry regions in each cell unit, each region respectively disposed between the mid-port and each opposed cell end.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The separate active cell chemistry regions may be disposed to each side of the mid-port. Smaller, separate, active cell chemistry regions generally have lower stress than a single region of equivalent area, thus the likelihood of stress-related failure is reduced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Alternatively, there may be a continuous active cell chemistry region in each cell unit with the mid-port(s) disposed within&#x2014;or surrounded by&#x2014;the active cell chemistry region. The continuous active cell chemistry region may be a single region in each cell unit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Usually, a dimension of the active cell chemistry region which is parallel to the fluid flow path and between the mid-port and one of the opposed ends of the cell unit is less than or equal to a dimension of the active cell chemistry region that is perpendicular to that fluid flow path.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The dimension of the active cell chemistry regions which is parallel to the fluid flow path and between the mid-port and one of the opposed ends of the cell unit may be taken to be the shortest distance from an edge of the active cell chemistry region that is proximal to the mid-port to an opposed edge of the active cell chemistry region that is proximal to the end of the cell unit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The length of the cell unit may be referred to as being the dimension of the cell unit which is generally parallel to the fluid flow path and the width of the cell unit may be referred to as being the dimension generally perpendicular to the fluid flow path. Usually, the length of the flow path across the active cell chemistry regions (between a mid-port and a respective end of a cell unit) is around half the length of the cell unit, more particularly it is not less than 45% of the length of the cell unit. When discussing the width of cell chemistry (that is, the dimension of cell chemistry which is generally perpendicular to the flow path), it may be assumed that usually the width is greater than or equal to 90% of the width of the cell unit (the width of the cell unit being the dimension of the cell unit which is generally perpendicular to the flow path). Thus, the proportion of the cell unit area which is covered by active cell chemistry regions may be maximised. It is desirable to dispose the active cell chemistry regions as close to the port(s) and cell periphery as possible, since when manufacturing the cell unit and stack, even small increments in effective cell coverage can have a significant effect on power density. Thus, an aim is to minimise the proportion of the cell area which is not coated with active cell chemistry regions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments the distance between the at least one first fluid mid passageway and each cell end is less that the width of the cell unit (the width is generally perpendicular to the fluid flow path, which is a line between a mid-passageway and a cell end), but this is not necessarily the case.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the cell unit's length is less than or equal to around 2.4 times the cell units width; there may be embodiments where the length is actually less than the width).

Preferably still, the cell unit's length is less than or equal to twice the cell unit's width.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment, the fluid flow paths are across a dimension of the active cell chemistry layers which is the shorter of the dimensions of length and width of the active cell chemistry layers. Thus, the cell unit may have a low aspect ratio. The aspect ratio may be defined as the dimension of the active cell chemistry region which is parallel to the fluid flow path divided by the dimension of the active cell chemistry regions that is perpendicular to the fluid flow path. Low aspect ratio means that the ratio between width (distance across active cell chemistry region between inlet and outlet ports) and length of active cell chemistry layers is less than 1.2, preferably between 0.3 and 1.2. Preferably, the aspect ratio is less than 1. More preferably, the aspect ratio is less than 0.8, preferably still the aspect ratio is between 0.3 and 0.8. Very low aspect ratios (for example, those less than 0.3) are advantages for cell performance but manufacturing constraints limit these.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fluid flow path across the shorter dimension may a) improve thermal distribution because the conduction path length from the hot inlet to the cooler outlet is reduced (as a result of the fluid entering or leaving the fluid volume midway along the cell unit's length) and may b) reduce the pressure drop between the middle fluid passageway and the cell end or an end fluid passageway, leading to increased net efficiency of a stack since parasitic loss from fluid blowers and/or pumps is reduced. The improved thermal distribution, i.e. a lower thermal density gradient may also lead to a reduced current density gradient.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each cell unit may have only one first fluid mid-port which is in fluid communication with the first fluid volume.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each cell unit may have only one first fluid mid-port, in which case the first fluid flow path divides and extends in the two opposed directions between the at least one first fluid mid-port and each respective cell end.

This aids in enclosing the first fluid volume, and means that is it straightforward to seal the first fluid volume from the second fluid volume. The active cell chemistry regions and the mid-port(s) are disposed between the respective fluid end ports. The fluid flow paths between each end port and the mid-port(s) therefore pass over the active cell chemistry regions and deliver and remove fluid therefrom (i.e., in SOFC operation, deliver fuel and remove exhaust from the fuel volume, or deliver oxidant and remove exhaust from the oxidant volume).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment cell unit, the first fluid volume is defined by two planar components of the cell unit and a weld line between the two planar components and around their periphery seals the first fluid volume, wherein the first fluid mid-port is in fluid communication with the first fluid volume.

The two planar components abut (i.e. are in contact with) one another around the annular feature.

The first fluid volume may be sealed from the second fluid volume by weld lines between adjacent cell units around the annular features. The second fluid ports (e.g. second fluid mid-ports) are fluid communication with the second fluid volume, each second fluid port may be provided with raised port features which surround the fluid port and allow fluid communication between the second fluid volume and the passageway defined by the second fluid port.

When used as an inlet passageway (such that the mid-port is a delivery or inlet port) to the first and/or second (respectively) fluid volume, the use of a mid-port as an inlet port aids stack warm-up, both in terms of speed of warm up and reduces temperature variation across the cell as the hot fluid enters each cell unit near the centre of the stack thereby reducing the path length for heat conduction from the inlet to the outlet for a given cell length.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably each cell unit comprises two first fluid mid-ports each in fluid communication with the first fluid volume and one second fluid mid-port in fluid communication with the second fluid volume, and optionally wherein the second fluid mid-port is disposed between the two first fluid mid-ports.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, flow in both fluid volumes is symmetrical, leading to improved thermal and fluid distribution.

The end passageways for one or both fluid types may be internally manifolded, but for maximum active cell chemistry surface area one type of fluid end passageway is preferably externally manifolded.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, the aligned first and second first fluid end ports and the two first fluid mid-ports form a diamond-shaped arrangement. The first fluid mid-ports may be disposed midway on cell unit's length and symmetrically toward edges of cell unit's width, and the first fluid end ports are disposed midway across the cell unit's width. Preferably, the diamond-shaped arrangement of ports is for the fuel ports, preferably the mid-ports are inlet ports to the first fluid volume and the end ports are outlet or exhaust ports from the first fluid volume. In this case, the second fluid mid-port is for oxidant, and preferably is an inlet port to the second fluid volume.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Usually, the first fluid volume is a fuel volume and the second fluid volume is an oxidant volume. Pressure drops across the active cell chemistry length are typically more pronounced for oxidant, and so it is preferable that the second, externally manifolded, fluid is oxidant because the gap between adjacent cell units is generally larger than a gap between metal substrate and separator plate in a cell unit, which defines the second fluid volume. This means that the first fluid volume, for fuel in this case, is contained or sealed within the cell unit and in fluid communication with the first fluid mid passageway and, where present, first fluid end passageways. Further, if the first fluid volume (which is enclosed by the cell unit) were to be adapted for air, then the gap between the metal substrate and separator plate would have to be increased, leading to greater material usage for creating the larger gap, and therefore a greater stack cost.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an alternative arrangement of ports of the cell unit, there may be two pairs of first fluid end ports in a cross-shaped arrangement with a single first fluid mid-port. The single first fluid mid-port may be disposed midway along both the length and width axes of the cell unit, and each of the first fluid end ports may be disposed toward a corner of the (rectangular or square) cell unit. In this case, there may be two second fluid mid-ports, with the first fluid mid-port disposed therebetween. The second fluid may have end passageways, the second fluid end passageways in fluid communication with the second fluid volume are provided that extend in the stack direction at or near each opposed stack end, these being externally manifolded passageways beyond each cell unit. Preferably, in this arrangement, the first fluid is fuel and the second fluid is oxidant.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ideally, the one or more first fluid mid-ports is or are symmetrically disposed within the cell unit about one or both axes of the cell unit. The mid-port(s) may be disposed toward the centre of either or both the length and width axes of the cell unit. Symmetrical positioning of the mid-port encourages symmetrical flow to or from the mid-port, and thus to symmetrical fluid distribution and even temperature profile across cell unit. Even temperature distribution across the cell unit, and more particularly across the active cell chemistry region(s) assists even degradation of the active cell chemistry through its lifetime.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When present, the one or more second fluid mid-port(s), preferably is or are symmetrically disposed within the cell unit about one or two axes of the cell unit.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an arrangement there may be too first fluid mid-ports and two second fluid mid-ports. The two first fluid mid ports and two second fluid mid ports may each be disposed either side of a line midway along the cell unit's length and one of each of the first fluid mid port and the second fluid mid-port disposed toward each edge of the cell unit's width. Thus, there may be pairs of mid-ports each pair of mid-ports having a first fluid mid-port and a second fluid mid-port, each pair toward each edge of cell unit's width. The centre of each pair is midway on cell unit's length, preferably in the first pair the first fluid mid-port is toward a first end of the cell unit's length and the second fluid mid-port is toward a second end of the cell unit's length (the first end opposite the second) and in the second pair the first fluid mid-port is toward the second end of the cell unit's length and the second fluid mid-port is toward the first end of the cell unit's length.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably, the one or more active cell chemistry regions are wrapped around at least one of any mid-ports or end ports provided in the cell units.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The fluid ports around which the active cell chemistry regions are wrapped may include one or more of: the at least one first fluid mid-port, the at least one second fluid mid-port and any cell end ports present. By wrapped it is meant that the active cell chemistry region at least partially encircles a port (e.g. around more than 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or around 360 degrees of the port). The shape of the edge of the active area may match or reflect the shape of the edge of the port, such that the active area at least partially surrounds the port. If the ports are circular, the edge of the wrapped active cell chemistry region takes the form of an arc. The edge of the active area may be equidistant from the port around the wrapped region. Alternatively or additionally, the wrapped edge of the active area may not be equidistant from the port, in particular the radius defining the edge of the active area may increase with distance from the port around which the active area is wrapped.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">This wrapping of the active cell chemistry regions maximises the area within the cell unit that is available for the active cell chemistry regions, thus maximising power density in the stack. In other words, when viewing the cell unit along its length from one cell end to the other opposed cell end, a particular position along that length that is simultaneously occupied by a port and cell chemistry (because the chemistry extends around the mid-port or end port in question), respectively, will achieve higher utilisation than cells with chemistry confined only to regions beyond regions where ports are located.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The active area may be wholly wrapped around a mid-port if the active cell chemistry region is a single region. The active cell chemistry region may be spaced from the port to allow space for a gasket and/or shaped port features. A barrier layer (for example an extended electrolyte layer) may extend underneath a gasket and a gasket may contact the barrier (e.g. electrolyte) layer, enabling tight wrapping of the active cell chemistry around the port.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively or additionally to wrapping, one or more of the ports may be elongated in the width direction of the cell unit. For example, one or more of the ports may be rectangular which may enable rectangular wrapping around the rectangular ports. In this case, it may be preferable that the mid-ports are rectangular as this may allow increased proportion of the cell unit area to be provided with active cell chemistry regions without necessarily wrapping the active cell chemistry regions. Similar is true for end ports.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one cell unit, one of the first or second fluid volumes is defined by a planar component having an elongate, shaped feature that extends at least partially around the periphery of the active cell chemistry region to confine a fluid flow path within that region.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Preferably, the planar component is a metallic component. The planar component may be an interconnecting plate, current collector plate, separator plate, cell chemistry supporting substrate or the like. The elongate feature acts to direct and retain fluid in one or both of the fluid volume(s). That is, the elongate feature greatly reduces air bypass around the sides of the cell unit (air bypass around the side of the cell unit cannot participate in chemical reaction at the active cell chemistry regions).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The elongate shaped feature may comprise feature in the planar component that forms a protruding rib on one side of the component and a channel on the other side of the component. Such a protruding rib on one side of the component may confine a flow path of the first fluid or a second fluid within the active cell chemistry region, and on its other side extend as a channel to encourage a flowpath along the periphery of that region, thereby delivering fluid toward a distal edge of the region. An elongate shaped feature that comprises a feature in the planar component that forms a protruding rib on one side of the component and a channel on the other side of the component may be a pressed or formed feature.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The rib protrudes into one fluid volume, and acts to contain that fluid, one of fuel or oxidant, (which would otherwise pass around the sides of the cell unit) in the fluid volume. The rib may form a depression in a second fluid volume which forms a supply channel to supply a second fluid, the other of fuel and oxidant.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The rib may be a formed or pressed feature, in which case the rib forms a depression in a second fluid volume which forms a supply channel to supply a second fluid, the other of fuel and oxidant. The rib may be a formed or pressed feature on an interconnect plate or separator plate and protrudes toward an adjacent cell unit in the stack.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Usually, the rib or elongate feature contacts an electrolyte or cathode layer of the active cell chemistry region or electrolyte beyond the region of the adjacent cell. Thus, a fluid volume is formed between the interconnect plate or separator plate and the active cell chemistry region of the adjacent cell unit. The protruding side of the rib or elongate feature acts to contain the fluid in the fluid volume formed between the interconnect plate or separator plate and the active cell chemistry region of the adjacent cell unit, preventing fluid from exiting the cell to the sides of the cell unit.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Preferably, the rib or elongate feature protrudes into a fluid volume that has externally manifolded passageways beyond the end of each cell unit, in which case the rib acts to confine and direct that fluid between the respective ends of the cell unit and the fluid mid-port. Preferably still, the rib or elongate feature protrudes into the oxidant volume, and the opposite side of the rib or elongate feature forms a supply channel for fuel in the opposite fluid volume.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The rib or elongate feature may comprise a pair of such ribs or elongate features aligned, in the stack, with an edge of the porous region or active cell chemistry region. Each rib or elongate feature is respectively disposed to an edge of the porous region or active cell chemistry region and, as a result, substantially aligned with the edge of the cell unit.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each rib or elongate feature may be continuous along the cell unit length. Alternatively, each rib or elongate feature may be discontinuous, with the discontinuity being by a fluid mid-port. The discontinuous ends of the rib or elongate feature may be proximal to a gasket or formed port feature, the gasket or formed port feature forming part of a middle fluid passageway, such that the rib or elongate feature and gasket or formed port feature co-operate to contain the fluid in the fluid volume.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The discontinuous rib or elongate feature may also curve toward the centre of the cell unit at the end of the rib or elongate feature which is proximal to a mid-port. For example, the rib or elongate feature may curve to match a curve in the edge of the active cell chemistry region, for example to match the curve or the active cell chemistry wrapped around a port. In this case, the rib or elongate feature is sized such that on the side which it is a channel, it delivers fluid (eg fuel) to the corners of the active cell chemistry regions at the ends of the cell unit. This is particularly preferable where the cell unit comprises two first fluid mid-ports (disposed toward opposed edges of the cell unit) with at least a second fluid mid-port disposed therebetween, the mid-ports aligned midway along the cell unit's length, and there is first and second first fluid end ports respectively disposed at or near each opposed cell end (i.e. similar to or the same as the &#x201c;diamond&#x201d; configuration described herein). In such a cell unit, the discontinuous ribs may curve toward the second fluid mid-port in the region of their end which is proximal to the first fluid mid-ports, and the end of the ribs is proximal to a gasket in the second fluid volume. In this case the rib may form a protrusion in the second fluid volume and a depression in the first fluid volume. As a result, the curved rib prevents bypass of second fluid out of the second fluid volume while providing a fluid delivery channel for first fluid to improve supply to areas of the cell chemistry regions near the corners of the cell unit, thus preventing fuel starvation in said areas. This has been shown to provide much more of an increase in uniformity in fuel supply to outlying regions than expected.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Where there are multiple mid-ports for one of the fluid volumes, partitioning by dividing ribs or 3D shaped formations (as soft barriers) or welds (as hard or absolute barriers) that extend from a particular mid-port for example across a cell can be used to ensure that fluid is only directed to a certain part of the active cell chemistry region. Where there are multiple chemistry regions, such dividing means can be used to ensure that an active cell chemistry region has a dedicated mid port supply passageway supplying fluid only to a particular chemistry region (e.g. a region on one half of the cell), whereas the other mid-port provides a dedicated supply passageway supplying fluid only to a remaining active cell chemistry region. Whilst this can have benefits it is not without risk in that failure of fluid supply within a dedicated fluid passageway could lead to fuel starvation of only the associated divided region leading to failure of part of the cell/stack.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one embodiment, the cell unit comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0081">a separator plate; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0082">a metal support plate carrying, on a first side thereof, the active cell chemistry region(s) provided over a porous region;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0083">the separator plate and the metal support plate overlying one another to form the cell unit;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0084">wherein:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0085">at least one of the separator plate and the metal support plate comprises flanged perimeter features formed by pressing the plate to a concave configuration;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0086">the separator plate and the metal support plate are directly adjoined at the flanged perimeter features to form the first fluid volume therebetween, optionally by welding;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0087">at least one fluid port is provided in each of the separator plate and the metal support plate, these being aligned to form the first fluid passageway within the flanged perimeter features, each port being either the first fluid mid-port and/or a first fluid end port and in communication with the first fluid volume; and,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0088">at least one of the separator plate and the metal support plate is provided with shaped port features formed around the at least one fluid port by pressing, which shaped port features extend towards the other plate, and elements of the shaped port features are spaced from one another to define fluid pathways between the elements from the port to enable passage of fluid from the at least one first fluid port to the first fluid volume.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">Instead of a metal support plate, a spacer and a separator plate, the cell unit may only comprise two layers/components i.e. the metal support plate and the separator plate, while still ultimately operating in substantially the same way, with substantially the same output per square centimeter of electrochemically active layer per cell unit. This simplifies the number of components needing to be supplied and treated (e.g. coated) and simplifies the assembly, as well as providing an immediate reduction in the amount of material needed, and thus a reduction in both the material cost and weight of each fuel cell unit.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">The concave configuration can give the relevant plate the appearance of a rimmed tray, with a correspondingly convex outside shape (outside relative to the fuel cell unit) and usually a planar base, the concavity thus defining (e.g. part of) the fluid volume in the assembled cell unit. In this concave configuration, the flanged perimeter features extend out of a plane of the original sheet of the separator plate, and/or of the metal support plate, toward a respective opposed surface of the other of the separator plate and the metal support plate. The fluid volume is thus bordered by formed flanged perimeter features, which are formed by pressing, such as by use of a die press, hydroforming or stamping. These are simple processes that are already being undertaken in the formation of central projections in the fluid volume, as found likewise on the separator plate in the prior art, for supporting and electrically connecting adjacent fuel cells via the electrochemically active layers. Such central in and out projections may thus also be pressed from the original sheet for the separator plate, either before or after the flanged perimeter features and the shaped features, but more preferably at the same time.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">In some embodiments the porous region is formed by holes drilled into the metal support plate&#x2014;usually laser drilled.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">In some embodiments the (active) fuel cell chemistry layers takes the form of an electrochemically active layer comprising an anode, an electrolyte and a cathode formed (e.g. coated or deposited) onto the metal support plate over the porous region that is provided within the metal support plate in such embodiments. This arrangement with the (non self-supporting, thin) chemistry layers provided directly on the metal support plate requires the minimum number of components. The metal support plate thus performs a dual function of supporting the cell chemistry and defining the fluid volume (together with the separator). Moreover, it will be appreciated that both the metal support plate and the separator have an oxidant-exposed side and a fuel-exposed side, and thus are components that are subjected to a demanding dual atmospheric environment.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0093">In other embodiments the porous region is provided on a separate plate (e.g. metal foil) over which the fuel cell chemistry layers are formed (e.g. coated or deposited), and the separate plate (carrying the fuel cell chemistry layers) is provided over a window (e.g. a frame) on the metal support plate.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0094">There can be multiple areas of fuel cell chemistry layers.

Thus, for counter-flow, the measured temperature of exhaust fluid better reflects the hottest temperature of the stack, which is an important parameter because, excess heat may lead to cell unit failure. Further, in counter-flow the hottest temperature is typically hotter than in co-flow (all other parameters being equal) therefore a greater fluid flow rate for cooling (typically using oxidant flow) is required in the counter-flow arrangement, thus increasing parasitic loss from blowers or pumps over the co-flow arrangement.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0102">In an alternative arrangement, there may be two first fluid mid-ports and two second fluid mid-ports.

Thus, there are pairs of mid-ports each pair of mid-ports having a first fluid mid-port and a second fluid mid-port, each pair toward each edge of cell unit's width. The centre of each pair is midway on cell unit's length: in a first pair the first fluid mid-port is disposed from midway toward a first end of the cell unit, and in the second pair the first fluid port is disposed from midway toward a second end of the cell unit, the first end opposite the second end.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0103">In an alternative arrangement, there may be one first fluid mid-port and one second fluid mid-port.

The second fluid mid-port disposed toward second edge of cell unit's width, and a pair of second fluid end ports are respectively disposed one at each end of the cell unit's length and toward the first edge of the cell unit's width.

The cell unit may comprise two planar components, with ports provided through each of the planar components. The two planar components define or enclose a first fluid volume therebetween. The one of the mid-ports may be provided with a raised port feature in the form of an annulus, the raised port feature protrudes from one or both of the planar components toward the other planar component (i.e. within and through the first fluid volume), such that the raised port feature in one planar component abuts or contacts the other planar component. A weld line may be provided around the raised port feature which seals the port from fluid communication with the first fluid volume. Ports in fluid communication with the first fluid volume (e.g. the first fluid mid-port) may be provided with raised port features around the port extending into the first fluid volume from one or both of the planar components to contact the other of the planar components, this acts to resist stack compression forces while allowing fluid communication between the port and the fluid volume. These ports may also be provided with annular raised features in one or both of the planar components and extending away from the other of the planar components in the cell unit, these raised features adapted for contact with an adjacent cell unit in a stack to seal said ports (with a weld line around the raised feature) to prevent fluid communication between said ports and a fluid volume defined between adjacent cell units.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">A cell stack may be an electrochemical cell stack comprising a plurality of planar cells stacked upon each other, wherein each cell: has a length greater than a width, comprises at least one cell mid-port disposed midway along the length of the stack, comprises at least first and second cell end ports respectively disposed at or near each opposed end of the length of the cell, comprises at least one active cell chemistry region comprising an electrolyte interposed between an air electrode and a fuel electrode; and, comprises an air fluid volume and a fuel fluid volume in communication with each of the air electrode and the fuel electrode respectively. The respective cell mid-ports may be aligned to form an internal fluid middle passageway extending in the stack direction and connected to either the respective air or the respective fuel fluid volumes of the cells. The respective first and second cell end ports may be aligned to form respective first and second internal fluid end passageways, each extending in the stack direction and connected to the same fluid volumes. The middle and end passageways may respectively form inlet and outlet passagesways, or vice versa, for that fluid volume, so as to define opposed flowpaths in that volume that extend across each cell between each cell mid-port and the respective corresponding end ports.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0109">In an example, the cell unit comprises inherent shaped features (for example, flanged perimeter features) that create a fluid volume in the cell unit. The cell unit may comprise flanged perimeter features, and the cell unit may be sealed around the flanged perimeter features to form a first fluid volume. Sealing may be by means of a weld around the flanged perimeter feature. Weld(s) may also be used around the mid-port(s) and end port(s) to seal the first fluid volume from the second fluid volume. The cell may comprise a metal substrate and a separator plate, at least one of which has a flanged perimeter feature.

This hard stop function can be helpful during manufacture of the fuel cell stack as by virtue of the gasket being compressible, to thus enable it to seal over the recesses in the outer surface of the fuel cell unit upon compression, there is a possibility of over compression of the stack during assembly, which over compression could crack or otherwise damage the electrochemically active layers on the metal support plate as the support structures <b>265</b>, <b>266</b> are also brought into contact with those electrochemical layers during that gasket compression. By having a hard stop, a limit can be set for that degree of compression, whereby over compression could be resisted by the hard stops, thus preventing inadvertent cracking of the electrochemically active layers on the metal support plate (and thus better tolerances for the engagement pressures within the fuel cell between the central projections and the electrochemically active layers).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0179">In an alternative, the raised members <b>320</b> may be a continuous annular raised member.

Nevertheless, the actual height h of the raised members <b>320</b>, may be varied or set at appropriate for achieving during assembly the required compression of the gasket, and thus the correct connection between the electrochemically active layer and the central projections, to ensure there is proper sealing over of the recesses in the outer surface of the fuel cell unit by the gasket and correct electrical connections across the whole set of central projections <b>330</b>. An electrically insulating coating or paste layer may be used on one or both of the abutting surfaces (the hard stop surface, formed by raised members <b>320</b>, and metal substrate of the adjacent fuel cell unit) of adjacent fuel cell units to prevent electrical contact between adjacent fuel cell units via the abutting surfaces.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0181">In a variant of this, instead of the raised members surrounding the outer perimeter of the gasket <b>334</b>, the gasket could have forms or holes within it to accommodate the raised members <b>320</b>, thus again providing a fixed position for the gasket relative to the raised members <b>320</b>, and potentially a fixed orientation for the gasket relative thereto (or fixed orientations, if the gasket can fit in more than one fixed orientation).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0182">In a variant of this, the raised members <b>320</b> surrounding the outer perimeter of the gasket are formed on the metal support plate <b>205</b> extending towards the separator plate <b>255</b> of a neighboring fuel cell unit.

Typically, the first fluid may be fuel and the second fluid may be oxidant (or air) when operating in SOFC mode. Generally, the mid-port(s) are fluid inlet ports. As a result, fluids which are input to the cell unit, which are hot fluids, are input toward the centre of the cell unit. This decreases stack warm-up time and encourages even thermal distribution.

The external manifold may merely be a gap or spacing between the cell and an outer jacket or housing. The second fluid mid passageway is formed by the second fluid mid-port <b>235</b> and the passageway is sealed from the first fluid volume by forming an annular port feature (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) or gasket <b>415</b>. If the latter is a conductive gasket or spacer, or if it is an annular formed port feature, then the mid passageway may be sealed by welding or brazing around the mid-port and through the conductive gasket or formed port feature.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0187">Thus, the first and second fluid flow paths extend from their respective mid-ports and are symmetrical about the mid-ports. It will be appreciated that the flow paths are shown schematically with arrows indicating the general direction of flow and, in fact, the flow will generally radiate or fan out from each port across the cell chemistry since it is not confined as it exits or spreads out over the cell chemistry. In particular, there are no three-dimensional channels forcing the flow in a particular tortuous flow path, rather the flow is unconstrained except at or near the perimeter of the electrochemically active layers <b>210</b>. Thus, while an arrow is shown to represent the flow path from, for example, first fluid mid-port <b>230</b><i>a </i>to first fluid end port <b>240</b><i>a, </i>that arrow represents a plurality of flow paths between said ports, ensuring that the each part of the electrochemically active layers <b>210</b> are supplied with first fluid and exhaust fluid is removed from each part of the electrochemically active layers <b>210</b>. However, each of the plurality of flow paths between said ports represented by the arrow has a main component in the length direction of the cell unit, i.e. between an edge of the electrochemically active layers <b>210</b> which is proximal to the mid-port <b>230</b><i>a </i>and an opposed edge of the electrochemically active layers <b>210</b> which is proximal to the end port <b>240</b><i>a </i>(which is also parallel to the cell unit length).
