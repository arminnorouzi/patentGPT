For individuals having hearing loss (e.g., partial hearing loss, full hearing loss, etc.), for instance, haptic stimulation can be used to provide and/or supplement important information typically conveyed through audio, which the user might otherwise miss or have difficulty interpreting. This can not only have safety benefits to the individual (e.g., to hear important sounds such as alarms, traffic, knocking, etc.), but can help the user comprehend his or her environment, engage in conversation, receive information, and/or otherwise interact with the world. For hearing-abled individuals, haptic stimulation can provide an additional level of immersion for the user in various environments (e.g., at concerts, in gaming, etc.) and be used in various ways to provide or supplement information. Conventional systems and methods for applying haptic stimulation, however, typically provide stimulation which is difficult to sense and be interpreted by the user.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the sensory output field to create an improved system and method for conveying audio information to a user through haptic stimulation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a schematic representation of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a schematic representation of the method for manufacture <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> depict a variation of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> depict a variation of an actuator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> depict a schematic representation of a variation of injection molding processes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a schematic representation of a variation of microphone placement in a rigid housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a variation of a result of a first injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a variation of a cross section of the rigid housing demonstrating a microphone assembly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a variation of information exchange between a haptic stimulation device and a user device executing a client application.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a schematic representation of a variation of the method for manufacture <b>200</b>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these preferred embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">1.

Benefits</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system and method for haptic stimulation can confer several benefits over current systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">First, in some variations, the system and/or method confers the benefit of enabling haptic stimulation to be individually felt at each of a set of haptic actuators, which can function to enable information associated with each of the set of haptic actuators to be discernable and interpretable. In specific examples, for instance, haptic coupling between adjacent actuators is minimized and/or eliminated based on any or all of: mechanical isolation (e.g., damping through silicone separation between adjacent actuators; damping through one or more coverings of the actuators such as fabric; etc.); signals processing and/or programming of actuation; properties of the actuators (e.g., selected frequency of vibration for each actuator); and/or based on any other suitable properties.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Second, in some variations, additional or alternative to those described above, the system and/or method confers the benefit of maintaining a proper placement of the system on the user's wrist such that the system is able to provide haptic stimulation at a partial or full circumference of the user's wrist. In specific examples, a notch or other support feature is present in a wristband device to prevent rotation and/or slippage of the wristband during wear.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Third, in some variations, additional or alternative to those described above, the system and/or method confers the benefit of enabling a robust connection between flexible and rigid components in order to conform to and provide comfort to the user, while protecting electronic components. In specific examples, for instance, a coupling between a rigid body and flexible wristband is configured such that the electronic components (e.g., PCBs) are not pulled on upon manipulation of the flexible band.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Fourth, in some variations, additional or alternative to those described above, the system and/or method confers the benefit of eliminating and/or reducing sound that reaches a microphone from a set of actuators. In a specific example, a microphone of the system is not directly coupled to a wristband housing the actuators, such that the majority of sound generated by the actuators that reaches the microphone has to travel outside of the system and re-enter rather than be propagated directly through the wristband hardware.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Fifth, in some variations, additional or alternative to those described above, the system and/or method confers the benefit of preventing damage (e.g., through ingress of wristband material, crushing, etc.) to a set of actuators during wristband manufacture. In a specific example, for instance, each of the set of actuators is surrounded by a set of custom caps prior to being integrated with any part of the wristband.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">3. System</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>100</b> for haptic stimulation includes: an actuation subsystem no having a set of actuators <b>112</b>, a support subsystem <b>120</b>, a rigid housing <b>130</b>, a sensor subsystem <b>140</b>, a control module <b>150</b>, and an electrical subsystem <b>160</b>.

The set of actuators <b>112</b> preferably includes multiple actuators but can alternatively include a single actuator (e.g., a stationery actuator, a translatable actuator, etc.). In variations including multiple actuators, the actuators can be of the same type (e.g., all LRAs, all ERMs, etc.) or any combination of actuators (e.g., LRAs and ERMs). In a first variation of the actuation subsystem <b>110</b>, the set of actuators includes a set of multiple (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, between 2 and 10, between 2 and 5, greater than 10, etc.) LRAs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In actuation subsystems <b>110</b> including multiple actuators, the actuators can be arranged in an array (e.g., 1-dimensional array, 2-dimensional array, 3-dimensional array, etc.), arranged at least partially circumferentially around the body part (e.g., around a wrist, around half of the circumference of the wrist, etc.), arranged along the body part (e.g., up and down an arm), arranged over a body region (e.g., over the user's trunk, stomach, etc.), arranged among different body parts of a user (e.g., arranged around both wrists), and/or arranged in any other suitable way. The vibratory elements <b>120</b> can be directly coupled to the skin of a user, separated from a user by an element of the housing (e.g., the wristband), separated from the user by air and/or another gap, placed over a user's clothing, and/or coupled to the user in any other way. In variations of the system <b>100</b> configured to apply haptic stimulation to a wrist of the user, the system <b>100</b> preferably includes 4 LRA actuators arranged around a portion of the circumference (e.g., half the circumference) of the wrist. Additionally or alternatively, the system <b>100</b> can include actuators circumscribing the entire wrist (e.g., 8 LRA actuators), and/or any other suitable number and arrangement of actuators.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Any or all of the actuators can be configured to vibrate at any suitable frequency or frequencies, such as any or all of: a fixed frequency (e.g., a single frequency); a range of frequencies (e.g., which can be adjusted and/or programmed according to the prescribed stimulation pattern, adjusted based on the vibration frequencies associated with the other actuators, etc.); and/or any other suitable frequency or combination of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In variations having multiple actuators (e.g., placed in a linear fashion along a wristband, arranged in an array on a vest, etc.), the system is preferably configured to reduce coupling between actuators (e.g., between adjacent actuators). This is preferably at least partially accomplished by using actuators having different vibration frequencies (e.g., different single vibration frequencies, different programmed vibration frequencies, etc.) from each other, which can function to reduce mechanical coupling between actuators. In a first set of specific examples, the actuation subsystem includes a set of multiple actuations, wherein each actuator (e.g., LRA) is associated with a different prescribed frequency, such as a single prescribed frequency. This can function to increase the ease in which a user can interpret the location (e.g., at an actuator, in-between actuators for haptic illusions, etc.) and/or source of a haptic stimulus; help a user interpret information and/or increase the amount of identifiable information being conveyed through haptic stimulation (e.g., associating particular phonemes with particular frequencies, adding another variable with which to distinguish haptic stimulation, etc.); increase the degree to which signals dampen between adjacent actuators; and/or perform any other suitable function(s). Additionally or alternatively, each actuator can be configured to vibrate at multiple frequencies, but be programmed to vibrate at different frequencies (e.g., when multiple actuators are being actuated simultaneously, when applying a stimulation pattern, at all times, etc.). Further additionally or alternatively, the actuators can be configured to vibrate at any suitable frequency or frequencies.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of the actuators is preferably configured to be actuated with a variety of different amplitude values (e.g., according to a prescribed stimulation pattern), which can function to adjust the intensity with which information is provided to the user. This can in turn function to differentiate between different audio information, such as, but not limited to any or all of the following ways: providing higher intensity stimulation for louder audio signals; providing different intensities of stimulation for adjacent actuators; increasing a range of different haptic stimuli able to be applied to the user (e.g., by adding in an adjustable amplitude parameter); enabling haptic stimuli to be distinguished from each other; enhancing the ability of the system to provide entertainment to the user (e.g., through control of intensities to represent and/or enhance a musical performance, to match the beat of a song at a concert, etc.); enable important audio to be easily detected (e.g., high amplitudes for sirens, smoke alarms, emergency vehicles, etc.); to enable the provision of tactile illusion stimulation (e.g., by actuating multiple actuators in rapid succession); and/or can perform any other suitable function(s).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally or alternatively, each of the actuators can be any or all of: actuated with a single and/or constant amplitude (e.g., each actuator actuates with the same amplitude, the actuators vibrate with different but fixed amplitudes, etc.); an amplitude of stimulation is determined in response to controlling a frequency of vibration (e.g., according to the spec of the particular actuators); and/or the actuators can be otherwise stimulated in accordance with any other suitable parameters.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a first set of variations, an amplitude of vibration of each haptic actuator is controllable and assigned based on an energy of the corresponding processed audio signal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a second set of variations, an amplitude of vibration of each haptic actuator is fixed and determined based on a fixed frequency value of the haptic actuator.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The set of actuators can additionally or alternatively be actuated in association with any suitable parameters having any suitable values such as, but not limited to, any or all of: speed, voltage, duration of stimulation, timing of stimulation, represented information associated with the actuator (e.g., particular phoneme, particular frequency range of audio signals, particular intensity range of audio signals, etc.), location of stimulation (e.g., in accordance with a tactile illusion), and/or any other suitable parameters.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The actuation subsystem preferably includes an actuator protection subsystem, which functions to protect the set of actuators during a manufacturing process and/or during use of the system. The actuator protection subsystem can protect the actuators from any or all of: fluid (e.g., injection molding material, air, etc.) ingress during an injection molding process; collapse of the actuators (e.g., due to air ingress during a heating and/or relatively high temperature process followed by an exit [e.g., rapid exit] of air during a cooling and/or relatively low temperature process); expansion of the actuators (e.g., due to air leakage during a cooling and/or relatively low temperature process followed by an ingress [e.g., rapid ingress] of air during a heating and/or relatively high temperature process); flexing of the actuators (e.g., while being curved around a wrist of the user); compression of the actuators (e.g., from the support subsystem); thermal effects on the actuators (e.g., from temperature changes in an environment of the user, from heating during use, etc.); fluid effects on the actuators (e.g., to seal off from fluid ingress); insulation and/or isolation from other components (e.g., electrical insulation, mechanical isolation, etc.); conductivity (e.g., electrical conductivity); and/or any other suitable effects. Additionally or alternatively, the set of coverings can function to localize haptic stimulation to the location of the actuator (e.g., by damping the stimulation); eliminate and/or minimize audio produced by the actuators; and/or perform any other suitable function(s).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The actuator protection subsystem preferably includes a set of one or more coverings configured to at least partially cover each of the set of actuators. Coverage of the set of actuators can have several functions. First, several types of LRAs as well as other types of actuators are conventionally manufactured with a set of holes, which can cause complications when integrating the actuators with other components of the system. First, the holes can permit ingress of materials (e.g., liquid silicone) during an integration of the actuators with a surrounding component (e.g., wristband) of the system (e.g., during a molding process, during an overmolding process, etc.). Furthermore, heating and cooling the actuators during manufacture can cause deformation to them (e.g., air entering and exiting the actuators through the holes causes them to crush). In specific examples involving injection molding processes (e.g., multiple injection molding processes), for instance, the heating and then rapid cooling of components can cause a rapid exchange of air in and out of actuators with holes, causing the actuators to be crushed as air rapidly exits. By covering these holes with a set of coverings, no or minimal air exchange can occur, thereby enabling the actuators to maintain a structural integrity.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In preferred variations, the covering includes a set of caps (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>), which are adhered together and/or to the actuator, wherein the caps cover the set of holes as well as provide a mechanical stability to the set of actuators. The caps are preferably made of a metallic material (e.g., steel, stainless steel, aluminum, chrome, brass, silver, gold, etc.), such as a stamped metal. The metallic material can function to provide a rigidity to the actuators; prevent rust; establish a conductive connection with other components; and/or perform any other function(s). Additionally or alternatively, the caps can be constructed in part or in full with any suitable material(s) such as, but not limited to, any or all of: a polymer (e.g., plastic, silicone, etc.); fabric; wood; rubber; organic materials; inorganic materials; and/or any other suitable materials.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In specific examples, a first cap (e.g., stamped steel) is secured (e.g., through press fitting, through adhesion, etc.) to the top (superior broad surface) of each actuator and a second cap is secured to the bottom (inferior broad surface) of each actuator.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally or alternatively, the set of coverings can be any or all of: wrapped around any or all of the actuators; cover the actuators; cover the sides of the actuators; and/or otherwise cover or interact with the actuators. In some variations, for instance, the set of coverings includes a fabric wrapped around the actuators, which functions to damp the haptic stimulus provided by the actuator.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further additionally or alternatively, the actuator protection subsystem can include any other suitable materials arranged in any form and in any suitable locations (e.g., on and/or coupled to actuator, separately from the actuators, etc.).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The information provided to the user through the set of actuators <b>112</b> is preferably in the form of a set of stimulation patterns (e.g., series of stimulation patterns), wherein the stimulation patterns prescribe any or all of the following to the set of actuators (e.g., individually, collectively, etc.): amplitude of vibration, timing of vibration (e.g., when to start, duration, when to end, etc.), sequence of vibration, identification of which of the set of actuators to vibrate, frequency of vibration, and/or any other parameter(s) of stimulation. In preferred variations, the stimulation pattern prescribes an amplitude of vibration and a duration of vibration to one or more actuators of the set of actuators, wherein each of the set of actuators is configured to vibrate at a fixed frequency. Additionally or alternatively, the stimulation pattern can prescribe a frequency of vibration, a dynamic pattern of vibration (e.g., alternating between actuators), and/or any other suitable characteristic or parameter(s) of vibration.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The stimulation patterns are preferably determined and/or prescribed based on a set of audio inputs, such as any or all of the audio information described above and/or below, wherein the stimulation patterns are determined (e.g., selected from a predetermined list, dynamically determined, determined in substantially real time, etc.) based on audio information such as any or all of: audio received at the haptic stimulation device, audio received at a user device, audio stored at a remote computing system, audio stored onboard the device, and/or any other suitable audio. In variations with audio inputs, the haptic stimulation pattern(s) can function to replace the audio information (e.g., for hearing impaired individuals, for individuals in distracting environments, etc.); enhance the audio information (e.g., to ensure that emergency sounds are heard, to enhance the user experience in an entertainment application such as a concert, etc.); create, prioritize, and/or otherwise alter audio information (e.g., haptic stimulation only provided based on desired and/or preferred sounds, etc.); and/or otherwise be used or implemented.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The stimulation pattern(s) associated with audio information can to convey any or all of: speech (e.g., such that the user can engage in conversation), music (e.g., composition of the music, &#x201c;feel&#x201d; of the music, etc.), environmental sounds (e.g., nature sounds, crosswalk indicator sounds, alarm clock, phone ring, phone notification, vehicle driving, etc.), safety sounds and/or alarms (e.g., smoke alarm, siren, vehicle horn, etc.), and/or any other suitable sounds.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The user of the device can be any or all of: a user with partial or full hearing loss (e.g., using the system to assist in conversation, safely interact with the environment, etc.), a user without hearing loss (e.g., to enhance a music experience, to supplement a musical concert with a haptic experience, to enhance a gaming experience, to provide redundant information in a supplemental form, etc.), a user with partial or full vision loss (e.g., to enhance auditory information, to provide a redundant source of information, to highlight important sound sources, etc.), or any other suitable user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The stimulation pattern(s) can correspond to (e.g., represent) one or more phonetic (e.g., speech) components (e.g., one or more frequency locations of a formant, peak frequency amplitudes, phonemes, sub-phoneme components, super-phoneme assemblies, morphemes, phones, diphones, triphones, diphthongs, triphthongs, letter, word, phrase, etc.) as well as one or more features of phonetic components (e.g., phoneme pitch, phoneme energy, phoneme tone, phoneme emphasis, etc.).
