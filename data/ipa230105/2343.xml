Impaired mitochondrial turnover is increasingly acknowledged to be a central factor in aging and in the etiology of several age-associated diseases (including Parkinson, Huntington's, and Alzheimer) (Terman, A., et al., Mitochondrial turnover and aging of long-lived postmitotic cells: the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis theory of aging. Antioxid Redox Signal, 2010. 12 (4): p. 503-35.). Recent evidence indicate that in type-2-diabetes (T2D) as well, mitochondrial turnover is suppressed, leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which results in beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis (Las, G., et al., Fatty acids suppress autophagic turnover in beta-cells. J Biol Chem, 2011. 286 (49): p. 42534-44; Masini, M., et al., Autophagy in human type 2 diabetes pancreatic beta cells.

At one end of mtQC, there is the synthesis of new mitochondria through biogenesis, and at the other end, their elimination through selective autophagy, mitophagy.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0144">The balance between these two opposing forces determines the mitochondrial turnover rate, allowing for a constant, tissue-specific, mitochondrial mass, which can be challenged by physiological demands. Physical exercise and calorie restriction, for example, enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing net mitochondrial volume, while mitophagy is triggered in some cell types during developmental stages, in response to oxygen deprivation and as a consequence of mitochondrial damage.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0145">During aging, there is a decline in mitochondriogenesis and mitophagy. While reduced biogenesis compromises the energy availability for the cell, reduced ability to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria has deleterious effects, since these organelles have declined dynamics and trafficking and are more prone to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative damage to biomolecules is largely related to aging and cell death. Long-lived cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes and beta-cells exhibit very low or non-existent replication capacity, and are as such particularly vulnerable to autophagy and mitophagy impairment and to excessive mitochondrial ROS formation.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0146">Boosting autophagy has been shown to be beneficial in animal models of neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases, hepatic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer, and small-molecule enhancers of autophagy are increasingly being tested with promising results. General stimulation of autophagy may help to revert mitophagy impairment when the impairment results from a compromise in the autophagic machinery (lysosome/autophagosome axis). However, stimulating autophagy per se does not address mitophagy-specific pathways. It is widely accepted that mitophagy is a selective event, with its own regulators, and mitophagy-targeted tools for high-throughput screening are being pursued.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0147">To date, genome-wide screens based upon the activation of Pink1/Parkin were developed to better understand activators of this regulatory axis. However, a broader assay for mitochondrial turnover is required to identify small molecules with different targets, and potentially unveil new mitophagy regulatory pathways, in a high-throughput manner While Pink1 and Parkin are strongly implicated in stress-induced mitophagy, very few studies have focused on physiological mitophagy and fewer on basal mitophagy.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0148">MitoTimer was previously engineered, by adding a mitochondrial-targeting sequence to the Timer protein (Hernandez, G., Thornton, C., Stotland, A., Lui, D., Sin, J., Ramil, J., et al.

Generation of a New MitoTimer Lentiviral Plasmid</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0152">The original MitoTimer plasmid consists of a lentiviral plasmid in which the MitoTimer sequence is placed downstream to a Tet-on promoter (i.e. doxycycline-dependent). Doxycycline was however recently reported to impair mitochondrial function in certain cell types (Moullan, N., et al., Tetracyclines Disturb Mitochondrial Function across Eukaryotic Models: A Call for Caution in Biomedical Research. Cell Rep, 2015). Preliminary tests showed that in INS1 cells (an insulin secreting cell line) it affects respiration as well. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. We therefore generated a new MitoTimer lentiviral plasmid which is regulated by EF1&#x3b1;, a constitutively active promoter. The lenti-vector for MitoTimer was constructed using conventional restriction and ligation. Briefly, MitoTimer cassette was amplified by PCR with primers having flanking restriction sites. Amplified fragment was purified, and digested by NotI and BglII. This fragment was ligated into the first ORF of pHAGE2 lenti-vector, having a constitutive EF1&#x3b1; promoter, and followed by an IRES-PURO cassette enabling positive selection. Lentiviral particles were generated in 293T cells by transfection of the pHAGE2 plasmid together with 4 packaging plasmids (namely Rev1, Tat1, Hgpm2, and VSVG). Supernatants were collected over 4 days and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Aliquots of concentrated lentiviral particles were stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The vector enables transduction of cell-lines and the selection for positive expressing cells by puromycin.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0153">INS1 cells were stably transduced with MitoTimer by lentiviral infection and were tested using known modulators of autophagy. The paradigm used was based on previous reports showing that the shift in emission from green to red occurs within 18 hours. Assuming that this shift is constant, changes in red FI occurring during this frame of time can result from an effect on MitoTimer clearance and not from an effect on synthesis. The paradigm employed consisted therefore of a treatment lasting 18 hours followed by imaging.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2. Testing of the New MitoTimer Lentiviral Plasmid</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0154">The new MitoTimer plasmid described in Example 1 herein was tested using a series of molecules known to modulate either autophagy or mitochondrial function. None of those molecules showed any reduction in red-to-green FI (data not shown), suggesting that mitochondrial clearance is already elevated under homeostasis in INS1 cells. Surprisingly, treatment with rapamycin, a bona fide stimulator of autophagy, led to an increase in red-to-green FI. This effect was highly reproducible, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, and was the result of increase in red FI, indicating a reduction of clearance. To ensure that rapamycin indeed suppresses mitochondrial clearance, we examined its effect on mitochondrial mass. Eighteen hours of exposure to rapamycin resulted in an increase in VDAC, Mfn2 and complex IV indicating an increase in mass. The results are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>. It is possible that this apparent discrepancy is due to the peculiarity of beta-cells, which under autophagic stress (starvation), increase mitochondrial fusion, which prevents mitophagy (Gomes, L. C., et al., During autophagy mitochondria elongate, are spared from degradation and sustain cell viability. Nat Cell Biol, 2011. 13 (5): p. 589-98).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3.

Highly toxic compounds were discarded by picking only compounds that left a higher cell number than the &#x2212;5.9. Compounds displaying high green FI (above 15) were also discarded to prevent the inclusion of autofluorescent molecules. Only molecules that filled the above criteria in both duplicates were further tested.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0158">The screen was performed during 8 sessions in Weizmann institute. All compounds were tested at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;M, in duplicates. The images were processed to reduce background (using Metamorph software) and then analyzed in GeneData software.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0159">The screen was performed using three libraries: (1) a library consisting of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC); (2) a library consisting of 3,840 compounds consisting of highly purified plant metabolites (Analyticon); (3) a diversity library consisting of 9,920 compounds (MayBridge). Using the above filters we detected 128 Hits (0.93%): 78 stimulators and 50 inhibitors. We subjected those compounds to a dose-response assay (concentrations: 10, 3.33, 1.11, 0.37 and 0.12 &#x3bc;M). Autofluorescence was determined by administrating the compounds to cells that do not express MitoTimer. The vast majority of compounds did not display any autofluorescence (Data not shown). Only compounds that displayed a dose-response curve reproduced in 3 separate experiments without autofluorescence were further examined.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0160">Among the stimulators, only two (both from MayBridge) showed a clear dose-response: SPB08007 (compound of structural Formula 6) and MWP00839. The results are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>), with SPB08007 displaying an activity of &#x2212;3.01837 and a qEC50 of 0.000049 and MWP00839 displaying an activity of &#x2212;0.7122 and a qEC50 of 0.0000497. The optimal dose for stimulating a reduction in red-to-green FI was 25 &#x3bc;M for both molecules. In view of the increase in mitochondrial clearance, we anticipated a reduction in mitochondrial mass. Staining of INS1 cells treated with the compounds and stained with mitotracker green (a fluorescent probe that binds mitochondrial proteins covalently) showed a reduction in fluorescence, indicating a decrease in mitochondrial mass. The results are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. This reduction was similar to the one obtained with Urolithin A, a molecule recently reported to induce mitochondrial clearance (Ryu, D., et al., Urolithin A induces mitophagy and prolongs lifespan in <i>C. elegans </i>and increases muscle function in rodents. Nat Med, 2016. 22 (8): p. 879-88).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0161">To corroborate the increase in mitochondrial clearance, we determined mitophagy by testing the compounds in INS1 cells expressing mCherry-GFP, a mitochondrial probe that emits green and red fluorescence under physiologic pH but red fluorescence only under acidic pH (such as that occurring in autolysosomes) and is therefore used for quantifying mitophagy. Unlike MitoTimer, which captures the accumulating effect of mitochondrial turnover, mCherry-GFP captures mitophagy at the time that it occurs. Since the timing of the induction of mitophagy by the hits was not known, we did a time-lapse. The cells were treated with the hits for 2, 8 and 18 hours. While after 2 hours and 18 hours, the molecules tended to increase the number of mitochondria inside autophagosomes (data not shown), only after 8 hours was this increase significant. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, SPB08007 (compound of structural Formula 6) and MWP00839 increased the number of red fluorescent dots found in acidic vesicles, indicating an increase in mitophagy. This increase was accompanied by an increase in autophagy, as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0162">The effect of the hits on respiration was determined using a Seahorse respirometer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, 18 hours exposure to both SPB08007 (compound of structural Formula 6) and MWP00839 decreased basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximal OCR (under FCCP induction). OCR under oligomycin was decreased as well, suggesting a reduction in proton leak. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, SPB08007 did not affect viability after 24 hours exposure while MWP00839 showed a toxic effect.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0163">To address the potential beneficiary effect of mitochondrial clearance by SPB08007 (compound of structural Formula 6), we employed lipotoxicity, a model that we have previously reported to impair autophagy and mitochondrial clearance by alkalization of the lysosomes (Las, G., et al., Fatty acids suppress autophagic turnover in beta-cells. J Biol Chem, 2011.286 (49): p. 42534-44). Co-treatment of INS1 cells with palmitate for 18 hours did not show any protection as compared to INS1 cells treated with palmitate alone, indicating that the effect of SPB08007 occurs upstream to lysosome alkalization. Nevertheless, when the cells were treated with palmitate for 24 hours and were then allowed to recover for 18 hours in the presence or absence of SPB08007, a slight but significant increase in recovery was observed, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 5.

The screening of 15,000 compounds (LOPAC&#x2014;pharmacologically active compounds, Maybridge&#x2014;diverse library, and Analyticon) was performed in INS1 cells stably expressing MitoTimer under EF-1-alpha promoter.

MitoTimer Optimization to Follow Mitochondrial Turnover in a High-Content Screen</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0188">The aging of the mitochondrial network can be followed through fluorescence switch of MitoTimer from green to red over time. Newly synthesized protein is incorporated into newly formed mitochondria. Where MitoTimer expression is inducible, for example under a doxycycline promoter, a pulse of doxycycline generates an initially green mitochondrial network which, after 16 h, becomes a mix of green and red fluorescence (observable as yellow and orange) and is seen as completely red after 48 h.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0189">We developed a system in which MitoTimer is stably expressed under the EF-1-alpha promoter. In this system MitoTimer is continuously expressed; basal rates of synthesis and degradation of mitochondria, and therefore MitoTimer, are steady, resulting in a constant red/green ratio. The ratiometric analysis corrects for differences in expression levels and gives a more robust index than the comparison of individual integrated fluorescence intensities.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0190">Manipulating mitochondrial turnover alters MitoTimer red/green ratio, in a manner inversely proportional to mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Therefore, green and red fluorescence intensities must be analyzed individually to conclude which events are impacting the ratio. Changes to MitoTimer green levels reflect protein incorporation into the mitochondria, mainly due to mitochondrial biogenesis or import, while changes in MitoTimer red fluorescence indicate changes in the degradation rate of the protein, if integrated green fluorescence intensity is not altered between experimental groups. Where green and red MitoTimer fluorescence intensities are affected, the ratio may not reflect changes on mitochondrial turnover.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0191">The length of the experiment was adjusted so that conditions affecting green MitoTimer levels did not result in changes in red MitoTimer levels. Once every green protein becomes red after 18-20 h, all cell treatments were performed under 18 h to isolate the effects on MitoTimer red from MitoTimer green readouts. This is particularly important in mitophagy studies since, in most cases, mitochondrial biogenesis increases in parallel to mitophagy.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0192">We tested three classes of compounds as controls to establish MitoTimer red/green ratio as an index to follow mitochondrial turnover in a High-Content Screen (HCS) aiming to find the best control for the screening: (1) Urolithin A, a natural compound discovered as a stimulator of mitophagy; (2) inhibitors of macro-autophagy, bafilomycin A and chloroquine, and (3) rapamycin, a classical mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor which stimulates macroautophagy in most cell types. Urolithin A significantly reduced MitoTimer red/green ratio in INS1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A</figref> and B), due to reduction in red fluorescence, indicating enhanced mitochondrial clearance. Preventing lysosome acidification and fusion with autophagosome as a result of bafilomycin A1 treatment enhanced the population of red mitochondria, and therefore, increased red/green MitoTimer ratio; the same was observed when neutralizing lysosome acidity with chloroquine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>). We previously demonstrated that inhibiting these last steps of autophagy affects MitoTimer red/green ratio readout in MEF cells. Rapamycin increased MitoTimer red/green ratio by 50% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>), due to an accumulation of red fluorescence over time, resulting in a time dependent increase in red/green ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b></figref> D and E).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0193">Although macroautophagy is required for the complete elimination of mitochondria and its inhibition certainly impairs basal mitophagy in some cell types, there is no evidence the stimulation of macroautophagy in the absence of mitochondrial stress can increase mitophagy, a selective event which require loss of &#x3c8;m and segregation of the damage units from the network. In fact, it has been demonstrated that autophagy activation by nutrient starvation or rapamycin impairs mitophagy due to mitochondrial elongation and inability to segregate.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0194">Rapamycin effect on MitoTimer red/green ratio was the strongest among all controls tested, and provided an average prime Z factor (Z&#x2032;) relative to vehicle, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) of 0.4 indicating a robust response, therefore, Rapamycin was used as a positive control in every cell plate. Briefly, z&#x2032; expresses how effectively the assay separates the positive and negative control values, based on means and standard deviations of both controls (full formula on methodology section), and it indicates the &#x201c;screenability&#x201d; of a high-throughput screen (HTS). The closer to 1 the z&#x2032; is, the more robust the assay is.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0195">Z-score was calculated for the experimental conditions; in this case, it determines how far a testing molecule is from the control, indicating the quality of the assay and providing a cutoff to establish hits in a HCS/HTS. In the present HCS, we focused on the search for molecules that enhance mitochondrial turnover (lower red/green MitoTimer ratio, with reduced red MitoTimer levels). To determine a small molecule is a hit, red/green MitoTimer ratio and red fluorescence reduction z-score was set to be higher than 0.5 from DMSO; and green fluorescence and cell number variation of less than 0.5 z-score from DMSO control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 7. Identification of 2 Chemically-related Compounds that Stimulate Basal Mitochondrial Turnover Through Mitophagy</heading><p id="p-0175" num="0196">The HCS steps are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Briefly, after establishing the best expression system which allowed a steady state red/green MitoTimer ratio in the controls for the screening, INS1 cells were plated in 384-well plates, and in each well, 10 uM of a given compound were added for 16-18 h and live-cell imaging was performed using FITC (excitation 482/35 nm, emission 520/35 nm) and TRITC (excitation 543/22 nm, emission 593/40 nm) channels. The small molecules were chosen from 3 libraries: LOPAC&#x2014;pharmacologically active compounds, Maybridge&#x2014;diverse library, and Analyticon. Individual cells were identified using the red channel, and red and green MitoTimer fluorescence were analyzed and ratio determined per cell. In the Hit finder software (GeneData), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the small molecules which impacted mitochondrial turnover based on the chosen parameters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) were identified. From 15,000 compounds, 47 reduced the red/green MitoTimer ratio, with an effect on red MitoTimer levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). The molecules that acted in a dose-response manner (4, 0.027%) were classified as the final hits. Amongst those, two benzothiophene derivatives from the Maybridge library, SPB08007 and MWP00839, are structurally similar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) and were further investigated.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0197">SPB08007 and MWP00839 at 10 uM reduced red/green MitoTimer ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b></figref> C and D), due to lowering the levels of red MitoTimer. These results indicate a higher mitochondrial turnover rate due to mitochondrial clearance. The maximum reduction on the ratio index was 40 and 60%, respectively, at 50 uM dose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b></figref> B, C and D), which also reflected an increase in MitoTimer green readout. Mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis have been reported to be activated in parallel and at the highest concentrations, SPB08007 and MWP00839 are likely stimulating the formation of new mitochondria as well.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0198">The impact of the hits on mitochondrial turnover was further confirmed by a mitophagy-specific assay, a protein with a tandem mCherry-GFP tag attached to the localization signal of the protein FIS at the OMM. Mitochondria of cells expressing this protein fluoresce red and green. When mitochondria enter the lysosomes, the GFP fluorescence is quenched, the remaining red fluorescence is seen as red puncta, representing the undergoing mitophagy events.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0199">INS1 cells treatment with SPB08007 and MWP00839 significantly increased the number of acidic puncta (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A</figref> and B). Interestingly, the formation of acidic puncta reached a peak at 8 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). In cells treated with MWP00839, the number of mitophagy events was sustained at 18 h, whereas in cells treated with SPB08007 mitophagy returned to control levels at 18 h, suggesting basal mitophagy can be stimulated, but is tightly regulated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> A). Basal mitophagy is currently being explored and, contrary to stress-induced mitophagy, was unveiled to be independent of PINK1 in most mammalian and Drosophila melanogaster tissues.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0200">A second fluorescence technique, Mitotracker Green (MTG) &#x201c;pulse-and-chase&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> C-E), was utilized to confirm faster mitochondrial clearance upon treatment with SPB08007 and MWP00839. After a pulse with the mitochondrial labeling probe MTG, INS1 cells were incubated with SPB08007 and MWP00839 and MTG fluorescence was chased after 18 h. The &#x201c;pulse-chase&#x201d; experiment allowed the quantification of the pool of mitochondria stained during the pulse and remaining after the 18 h treatment period. Control cells at &#x201c;time zero&#x201d; were stained with MTG before imaging and represented the 100% baseline. As expected, all groups had lower MTG content after 18 h of the pulse compared to control &#x201c;time zero&#x201d; and both SPB08007 and MWP00839 treatments resulted in lower MTG intensity compared to DMSO (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b></figref> D and E). These findings further confirm higher mitochondrial clearance upon treatment with SPB08007 and MWP00839. No differences in cell replication, which could account for MTG dilution, were observed between the groups (data not shown). At the dose used for most of the assays, the compounds conserved the cellular viability, and SPB08007 effects were comparable to DMSO control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0201">The degradation rate of mitochondrial proteins varies between them and differs from mitochondria as a whole, therefore, following specific mitochondrial proteins is a limited approach to infer changes in mitochondrial mass or turnover. Nonetheless, C-II protein SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B, Complex II) and C-III protein UQCRC2 (Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2) were increased by 2 and 1.5 fold, respectively, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>), similarly to what was previously observed following stimulation of mitophagy in C2C12 myotubes with Urolithin A. CI&#x2014;NDFUB8 levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A</figref> and D) were unaffected by SPB08007.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 8. SPB08007 Improves Mitochondrial Efficiency and Complex I Activity</heading><p id="p-0181" num="0202">SPB08007 increased basal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, B), glucose-stimulated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, C) and maximum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, E) mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (mtOCRs), while conserving mitochondrial coupling (oligomycin-sensitive respiration), resulting in higher ATP-linked oxygen consumption (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, D). In the absence of an effect on mitochondrial coupling or increased mitochondrial mass, higher basal respiration is normally a response to a higher energy demand, which can be triggered by mitophagy/biogenesis events and by other unknown cellular processes activated by this compound. The spare respiratory capacity (increase of mtOCR caused by the uncoupler FCCP) relative to basal respiration was unchanged by compound A, despite higher absolute values of mtOCR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, E), which indicates that mitochondria are using more of their respiratory reserve compared to the control, probably due to a higher energetic demand.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0203">The higher mitochondrial efficiency was associated with a two-and-a-half-fold increase in mitochondrial Complex I activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, B), which contributes to a faster flow of electrons (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The &#x3c8;m was not reduced by SPB08007 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, B), strongly indicating this drug mechanism of action is not through loss of &#x3c8;m. Indeed, anion radical superoxide formation, measured by Mitosox, was unaffected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> C, D). Thus, unlike other known mitophagy activators, SPB08007 is not causing mitochondrial stress or uncoupling.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0204">In fact, the &#x3c8;m was slightly, but significantly, raised by this drug, without parallel changes in mitochondrial morphology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). The ongoing basal mitophagy activation is likely eliminating the mitochondrial subpopulation with lower potential, as expected, increasing the pool of coupled mitochondria, with a higher average TMRE/MTG ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, B). The improved CI activity, without changes in CI protein levels, may also reflect the resulting concentration of &#x201c;young mitochondria&#x201d; (less damaged), as indicated by lower MitoTimer red/green ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Interestingly, mitochondrial proteins isolated from INS1 cells previously treated with SPB08007, were found to be less ubiquitinated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>), suggesting SPB08007 is not causing mitochondrial ubiquitination, but it is rather improving the elimination of organelles with higher ubiquitin content.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 9. SPB08007 Decreases Basal Insulin Secretion</heading><p id="p-0184" num="0205">Elevated basal insulin secretion under fasting conditions together with insufficient stimulated insulin release is an important hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In vitro, high basal insulin secretion has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, for example in response to glucolipotoxicity and PINK1 deficiency. SPB08007 significantly reduced insulin secretion at 2 mM glucose (basal), while maintaining the levels of glucose-stimulated secretion (16 mM of glucose) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>), resulting in a higher secretion fold in response to glucose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> B), which reflects a better metabolic coupling. We previously found similar results in mouse islets treated with serum of calorie-restricted animals, an in vitro model associated with extended cellular lifespan and improved mitochondrial function.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0206">Overall, by establishing MitoTimer as a feasible tool to follow mitochondrial turnover in a HTS/HCS, and focusing on mitochondrial clearance, we found 2 chemically-related small molecules that enhance basal mitophagy without causing mitochondrial stress. The existence of a &#x201c;spare basal mitophagy&#x201d; which can be activated in a physiological context presents an exciting, new model for studying mitophagy and suggests that novel regulators of this pathway could be viable targets for future drug development.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0207">While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes, and equivalents will now occur to those of ordinary skill in the art.
