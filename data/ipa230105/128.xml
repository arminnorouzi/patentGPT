Consequently, many examples of systems for extruding food products are known in the art. However, challenges remain in providing extrusion systems that can operate efficiently (e.g. with little or no downtime) and that produce food products with desired characteristics, for example in terms of sanitation and/or nutritional quality and/or taste/palatability.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, there is provided an extrusion system comprising: an extruder, operable to propel extrudate through an outlet thereof, during use; and a valve, which comprises: an inlet, fluidically connected to the extruder outlet, so as to receive extrudate therefrom, during use; a main conduit extending from the inlet to a main outlet; a dumping conduit, extending from a junction with the main conduit to a dumping outlet; and a flow control member, operable to move between: a plurality of flow controlling positions, in which extrudate is directed to the main outlet, with the flow control member providing, for each flow controlling position, a respective amount of impedance to flow along said conduit; and a flow diverting position, in which extrudate is directed along the dumping conduit to the dumping outlet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a further aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a valve for an extrusion system comprising: an inlet, configured for connection to an outlet of an extruder, so as to receive extrudate therefrom, during use; a main conduit extending from the inlet to a main outlet; a dumping conduit, extending from a junction with the main conduit to a dumping outlet; and a flow control member, operable to move between: a plurality of flow controlling positions, in which extrudate is directed to the main outlet, with the flow control member providing, for each flow controlling position, a respective amount of impedance to flow along said conduit; and a flow diverting position, in which extrudate is directed along the dumping conduit to the dumping outlet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following description, given by way of example only, which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further features will become apparent from the following description, given by way of example only, which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a sectional view of an extrusion system in accordance with a first example embodiment of the present disclosure, the section being taken along the length of an extruder barrel of the system;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a perspective view of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a further sectional view of the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the section being taken in a plane perpendicular to the plane in which the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is taken;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a sectional view of the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, with a flow control member for a valve of the system in a flow controlling position;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a sectional view of the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, with the flow control member in a flow diverting position;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows a sectional view of the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, with the flow control member in a pressure release position; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing various systems within the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Details of apparatus and kits according to examples will become apparent from the following description, with reference to the Figures. In this description, for the purpose of explanation, numerous specific details of certain examples are set forth. Reference in the specification to &#x201c;an example&#x201d; or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the example is included in at least that one example, but not necessarily in other examples. It should further be noted that certain examples are described schematically with certain features omitted and/or necessarily simplified for ease of explanation and understanding of the concepts underlying the examples.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Examples described herein relate to extrusion systems and, more particularly, to food extrusion systems, i.e. systems that extrude a food product.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Attention is directed firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, which show, respectively, a sectional view and a perspective view of an example embodiment of an extrusion system <b>1</b>. The plane in which the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is taken is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the extrusion system <b>1</b> includes an extruder <b>10</b>, which is operable to propel extrudate through an outlet <b>12</b>, during use. The extrudate may be a food product, for example containing protein and/or starch, and may for example be: an animal food product such as petfood kibble, treats, fish food, or general animal feed; or a human food product, such as a breakfast cereal, or a snack product. In some examples, the food product may be a cooked food product. As shown, the outlet <b>12</b> may, for example, be located at a longitudinal end of the extruder <b>10</b>. As also shown, the extruder <b>10</b> may, for example, include a barrel <b>11</b> and may include one or two (or potentially more) extrusion screws provided within the extruder barrel <b>11</b>. Such extrusion screws are not shown in the drawings for clarity, but are typically configured such that they are each rotatable about a respective axis parallel to the length of the extruder barrel <b>11</b>. The interior surface of extruder barrel <b>11</b> may have a shape that is complementary to such screws, where used. For example, where one screw is disposed within barrel <b>11</b>, the barrel <b>11</b> may have a helical groove on its interior surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">During use of the extrusion system <b>1</b>, a food product may be cooked within extruder barrel <b>11</b>, for example under significant pressure (e.g. 10-20 bar). Hence (or otherwise), the extruder <b>10</b> may include a heat exchanger, which may, for example comprise piping surrounding the barrel <b>11</b> that conveys steam during use, with heat being transferred from the steam to the contents of the barrel <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, it may be noted that the extrusion system <b>1</b> further includes a valve <b>20</b>. The features of this valve are shown clearly in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and will be discussed in detail below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, valve <b>20</b> includes an inlet <b>21</b>, which is fluidically connected to the extruder barrel outlet <b>12</b>. Consequently, the valve inlet <b>21</b> receives extrudate from the extruder <b>10</b>, during use. As may also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the valve <b>20</b> further includes a main conduit <b>22</b>, which extends from the valve inlet <b>21</b> to an outlet <b>23</b>. In some embodiments, the system <b>1</b> may comprise an extrusion die that is mounted on valve <b>20</b> and receives extrudate from main outlet <b>23</b>. Such an extrusion die will typically have multiple apertures from which extrudate is extruded. The system may further include a cutting assembly, for example comprising a rotating blade, that is operable to cut the output from each aperture into food items of desired length.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the particular example shown, the cross-sectional area of the portion of the main conduit <b>22</b> leading from the valve inlet <b>21</b> decreases with distance from the valve inlet <b>21</b>, before reaching a portion of the main conduit <b>22</b> where a flow control member <b>25</b> is located. However, this is by no means essential and the portion of the main conduit <b>22</b> leading from the valve inlet <b>21</b> could be shaped differently, for example having substantially constant cross-section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to main conduit <b>22</b>, valve <b>20</b> includes a dumping conduit <b>27</b>. As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, this dumping conduit <b>27</b> extends from a junction <b>24</b> with the main conduit <b>22</b> to a dumping outlet <b>28</b>. The main conduit and dumping conduit might therefore be described as being in a fixed arrangement relative to one another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the junction <b>24</b> may, for example, be located part-way along the length of the main conduit <b>22</b>. As illustrated, the dumping conduit <b>27</b> may, in some examples, extend generally perpendicularly to the main conduit <b>22</b>. As will be explained in further detail below, dumping conduit <b>27</b> may be used to discard extrudate, for example because it is unwanted or potentially contaminated, or in order to relieve pressure within the extruder <b>10</b>. A hopper can be placed beneath the dumping outlet <b>28</b> to collect the discarded extrudate.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, valve <b>20</b> further includes a flow control member <b>25</b>. In the particular example shown, the flow control member <b>25</b> is located at the junction <b>24</b> of the main conduit <b>22</b> and the dumping conduit <b>27</b>, though this is not essential. As will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the flow control member <b>25</b> is moveable between a number of different positions to control the flow of extrudate within the main conduit <b>22</b> and the dumping conduit <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the valve <b>20</b> may include a motor <b>26</b> for moving the flow control member <b>25</b> between these positions. The motor <b>26</b> may, for example, be controlled by a control system <b>5</b> for the overall extrusion system <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Such a control system <b>5</b> may, for instance, comprise one or more processors that may, for example, receive user input from a control panel, or from a computer (e.g. by means of a user interface displayed to the user). Where a computer is used, it may provide some or all of the one or more processors of the control system <b>5</b>. Such a motor <b>26</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, which is a further sectional view of the extrusion system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, with the section being taken in a plane perpendicular to the plane in which the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is taken. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is taken in a plane in which the length of main conduit <b>22</b> lies, whereas the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is taken in a plane that is perpendicular to the length of main conduit <b>22</b> and passes through junction <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, which shows a similar sectional view of the extrusion system <b>1</b> to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> show flow control member <b>25</b> in respective, different flow controlling positions. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>, in each such flow controlling position, extrudate is directed to main outlet <b>23</b>. However, the flow control member <b>25</b> provides a respective, different amount of impedance to the flow of extrudate along the main conduit <b>22</b> in each flow controlling position. The different impedances may be used to control the specific mechanical energy and/or the pressure and/or the rate of flow in the extruder <b>10</b>. In the particular example shown, these different impedances result from the movement of the flow control member <b>25</b> altering the width, w, and thus the area, of an opening or gap between flow control member <b>25</b> and the interior surfaces of main conduit <b>22</b>. As may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>, once the extrudate passes this opening or gap, the interior surfaces of the main conduit <b>22</b> channel or guide the extrudate to the main outlet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>, flow control member <b>25</b> rotates about an axis to move between the flow controlling positions. In the particular example shown, each of the flow controlling positions corresponds to a flow-contacting surface <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the flow control member <b>25</b> being oriented at a respective angle with respect to a length of the main conduit <b>22</b>. As shown, given that a significant amount of wear may occur on this flow- contacting surface <b>25</b><i>a, </i>it may, in some embodiments, be provided by a sacrificial member, which may be removed and replaced periodically.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It may be noted that the size of the gap/opening is at a maximum when the flow control member <b>25</b> is in the flow controlling position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Consequently, in this position (which might be described as an &#x201c;open&#x201d; position), the flow control member <b>25</b> presents a minimum amount of impedance, as compared with the other flow controlling positions. In this open position, at least one flow-contacting surface <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the flow control member <b>25</b> may, for example, be substantially continuous with the adjoining internal surfaces of the main conduit <b>22</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Such an arrangement may reduce the likelihood that portions of extrudate become stuck within the system <b>1</b>, potentially leading to unsanitary conditions, and/or may simplify cleaning of the system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, the flow control member <b>25</b> may be configured such that, in addition to directing extrudate to main outlet <b>23</b>, it blocks or prevents the flow of extrudate to the dumping outlet <b>28</b> when it is disposed in any of the flow controlling positions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference is directed next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, which shows a similar sectional view of the extrusion system <b>1</b> to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>, but with flow control member <b>25</b> in a flow diverting position. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in such a flow diverting position, extrudate is directed so as to flow along the dumping conduit <b>27</b> to the dumping outlet <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the interior surfaces of the dumping conduit <b>27</b> might therefore be described as channeling, or guiding the extrudate to the dumping outlet <b>28</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in such a flow diverting position the flow control member <b>25</b> may, in some embodiments, additionally block or prevent the flow of extrudate to the main outlet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the flow diverting position, dumping conduit <b>27</b> may be used to discard extrudate, for example because it is unwanted or because it is potentially contaminated. In particular examples, the system <b>1</b> (for example, using motor <b>26</b> under the control of control system <b>5</b>) may move the flow control member <b>25</b> to such a flow diverting position during startup, for instance because the initial output from the extruder <b>10</b> may not be of sufficient quality. More particularly, in embodiments where the extruder <b>10</b> is configured to cook the extrudate, the initial output from the extruder <b>10</b> may not be sufficiently cooked to destroy toxins and/or kill pathogens. This may, in some cases, present a food safety issue. By moving the flow control member <b>25</b> to such a flow diverting position during startup of the cooking extruder <b>1</b>, insufficiently cooked extrudate can be discarded.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In many embodiments, the extrusion system <b>1</b> may be configured (e.g. by suitable configuration of a control system <b>5</b> for the system <b>1</b>) to move flow control member <b>25</b> to only one flow diverting position. However, the system <b>1</b> could instead be configured to move flow control member <b>25</b> between multiple flow diverting positions, for example with flow control member <b>25</b> providing a respective, different amount of impedance to the flow of extrudate to dumping outlet <b>28</b> in each flow controlling position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Refence is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. As may be appreciated, in the particular example shown, flow control member <b>25</b>, main conduit <b>22</b> and dumping conduit <b>27</b> are shaped and arranged such that, as the flow control member <b>25</b> is moved from a flow controlling position to a flow diverting position, extrudate is at all times able to flow to at least one of main outlet <b>23</b> and dumping outlet <b>28</b>. Such an arrangement avoids &#x201c;dead- ending&#x201d; the extruder <b>10</b>, which can lead to the pressure within the extruder <b>10</b> spiking, which can be a safety concern.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, which shows a similar sectional view of the extrusion system <b>1</b> to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B</figref>, but with flow control member <b>25</b> in a pressure release position. It should be noted that it is strictly optional that the system <b>1</b> be configured to move the flow control member <b>25</b> to such a pressure release position; it is envisaged that suitable systems may be provided that are configured to move flow control member <b>25</b> to only flow controlling positions and a flow diverting position. Nevertheless, such a pressure release position may be of use to rapidly release pressure in the extruder <b>10</b> and/or the main conduit <b>22</b>, for example where the system <b>1</b> (for instance, control system <b>5</b> thereof) determines that the pressure in the extruder barrel <b>11</b> has exceeded a maximum safe value and/or determines that the pressure in the main conduit adjacent the main outlet <b>23</b> has exceeded a maximum safe value. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, in the pressure release position, the extruder barrel outlet <b>12</b>, the main outlet <b>23</b>, and the dumping outlet <b>28</b> are all in fluid communication. In consequence, pressure accumulated within the extruder barrel <b>11</b> and the main conduit <b>22</b> can be rapidly released via dumping outlet <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the flow control member <b>25</b> shown is shaped so it at most partially encircles or surrounds extrudate, with respect to the direction of flow. Hence (or otherwise), flow control member <b>25</b> does not define an enclosed passageway for the extrudate. Such constructions may be particularly compact, yet still enable the flow control member <b>25</b> to suitably direct extrudate to a desired one of the main outlet <b>23</b> or dumping outlet <b>28</b>. In the particular example shown in the drawings, where the flow control member <b>25</b> is rotatable, it is shaped such that, its cross-section, taken in a plane defined by length directions of the main <b>22</b> and dumping <b>27</b> conduits, is shaped generally as a segment of a circle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Returning briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, it may be noted that, in the particular embodiment shown, valve <b>20</b> further includes two ports <b>251</b><i>a, </i><b>251</b><i>b</i>. These ports <b>251</b><i>a, </i><b>251</b><i>b </i>are configured to receive a fluid (e.g. water) for flushing seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b </i>for the flow control member <b>25</b>. Such flushing may, for example, be carried out substantially continuously, during operation of the system <b>1</b>. In such embodiments, the flushing fluid may carry away any extrudate that passes seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b, </i>thus avoiding extrudate accumulating within the valve <b>20</b>, and may lubricate seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b, </i>reducing friction and increasing lifespan. Alternatively, such flushing might be carried out as part of a routine cleaning procedure for the system <b>1</b> that is, for example, performed periodically to maintain hygiene/sanitation requirements. Such seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b </i>may, for example, assist in sealing extrudate within main conduit <b>22</b>. In the specific example shown, flushing fluid is communicated to the seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b </i>via internal conduits <b>252</b><i>a, </i><b>252</b><i>b. </i>As shown, the ports <b>251</b><i>a, </i><b>251</b><i>b </i>may, for example, be located on the exterior of the valve <b>20</b>. Moreover, although two flushing ports <b>251</b><i>a, </i><b>251</b><i>b </i>are shown, more or fewer ports could be included in other embodiments. More generally, although such ports <b>251</b><i>a, </i><b>251</b><i>b </i>provide a convenient way of cleaning/flushing seals <b>253</b><i>a, </i><b>253</b><i>b, </i>they are by no means essential and other approaches for cleaning the valve <b>20</b>, and any seals it might have, are considered suitable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram showing various (sub)systems within the extrusion system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>. As may be seen, the extrusion system <b>1</b> may, in some embodiments, include a control system <b>5</b>, for example comprising one or more processors that may, for example, receive user input from a control panel, or from a computer (e.g. by means of a user interface displayed to the user). Where a computer is used, it may provide some or all of the one or more processors of the control system <b>5</b>. As shown, such a control system <b>5</b> may regulate the functioning of other systems and devices within the overall extrusion system <b>1</b>. For example, the control system <b>5</b> may control the operation of flow control member <b>25</b>(by controlling the operation of motor <b>26</b>) and/or may control the operation of extruder <b>10</b>. and/or a valve heating or cooling system <b>6</b>, which may be configured to heat the contents of main conduit <b>22</b> or may be configured to cool its contents. More particularly, the operation of such systems and devices may be based on output received from pressure sensors <b>51</b> and/or temperature sensors <b>52</b>, which may, for example, sense the pressure and/or temperature adjacent valve inlet <b>21</b> or pressure and/or temperature adjacent main outlet <b>23</b>. For example, flow control member <b>25</b> may be moved to an appropriate flow controlling position in response to the output from such sensors. The control system <b>5</b> may operate to achieve or maintain desired conditions for the extrudate by simultaneously controlling the operation of extruder <b>10</b> (e.g. to apply a suitable force to extrudate within the extruder, given the desired conditions) and flow control member <b>25</b> (e.g. to provide a suitable level of impedance by selecting a suitable flow controlling position, given the desired conditions).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the extrusion system <b>1</b> may optionally include one or more additional (sub)systems, such as: a valve heating or cooling system <b>6</b>, which may be configured to heat the contents of main conduit <b>22</b> or may be configured to cool its contents); and/or a flushing fluid supply system <b>7</b>, which, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, may be configured to supply fluid to flush seals within valve <b>20</b>, for example continuously or periodically.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, valve <b>20</b> may be configured as a heat exchanger, comprising at least one conduit <b>29</b><i>a, </i><b>29</b><i>b </i>for conveying a heat transfer fluid to exchange heat with extrudate within the main conduit <b>22</b>. In the specific embodiment shown, the valve <b>20</b> comprises an inlet conduit <b>29</b><i>a </i>and an outlet conduit <b>29</b><i>b </i>for conveying heat transfer fluid adjacent main conduit <b>22</b>. In some embodiments (particularly, but not exclusively, where the extruder <b>10</b> is a cooking extruder), the heat transfer fluid may be at a higher temperature than the temperature of the extrudate in the main conduit <b>22</b>, so that the temperature of the extrudate is maintained during passage through valve <b>20</b>. Changes in the temperature of the extrudate can alter the structure of the extrudate, which may, in turn, impact palatability and/or other key requirements of the product. Steam is considered a suitable heat transfer fluid for supplying heat to extrudate within the main conduit <b>22</b>. This is particularly the case in embodiments where steam is also used to heat the contents of the extruder barrel <b>11</b>. In such embodiments, a single steam generation system can supply steam to conduits for heating the extruder <b>10</b> and to conduits for <b>29</b><i>a, </i><b>29</b><i>b </i>heating the valve <b>20</b>. Water and oil are also considered suitable heat transfer fluids and could be utilized in place of steam in further embodiments.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although in the example above the heat exchanger acts to transfer heat to the extrudate in the main conduit <b>22</b>, it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the heat exchanger could be configured to transfer heat away from the extrudate in the main conduit of valve <b>20</b>, for example by using a suitable heat transfer fluid, such as cooled water.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In still further embodiments, the valve <b>20</b> might include a heater <b>6</b> instead of (or in addition to) a heat exchanger. Such a heater <b>6</b> might, for example, comprise one or more resistive heating elements that are operated during use to heat extrudate passing through the main conduit <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It may be noted that, in the particular example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, flow control member <b>25</b> is rotatable about an axis to move between the flow controlling and flow diverting positions. More particularly, the flow control member <b>25</b> is rotatable about an axis that is perpendicular to the length of the main conduit <b>22</b> and. In such embodiments, the flow control member <b>25</b> may extend beyond the main conduit on both sides with respect to the axis of rotation. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the flow control member <b>25</b> may include a first end potion <b>25</b><i>a, </i>which is located beyond one side of the main conduit <b>22</b> in the direction of the axis of rotation, and a second end potion <b>25</b><i>b, </i>which is located beyond the other side of the main conduit <b>22</b> in the direction of the axis of rotation. Such an arrangement may assist in rotatably mounting to the flow control member <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, in some embodiments, the axis of rotation for the flow control member <b>25</b> may, in addition to being perpendicular to the length of the main conduit <b>22</b>, be perpendicular to the length of the dumping conduit <b>27</b>, also.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the arrangements described above may be appropriate in some embodiments, for example because they are particularly compact, they are by no means essential. Indeed, it is to be understood that it is by no means essential that flow control member <b>25</b> is rotatable about an axis. Consequently, in other embodiments, the movement of flow control member <b>25</b> between the flow controlling positions and the flow diverting position might be a pure translation (i.e. without rotation) or might be a combination of a rotation and a translation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is to be understood that any feature described in relation to any one embodiment may be used alone, or in combination with other features described, and may also be used in combination with one or more features of any other of the embodiments, or any combination of any other of the embodiments.
