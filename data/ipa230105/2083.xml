level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Space vehicles traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO) require large amounts of liquid propellant not only to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth, but also to position the spacecraft in geosynchronous and transfer orbits. Orbiting propellant depots can extend the life and mission profile of space vehicles. However, in microgravity conditions, propellants inside the tank are dispersed randomly, and it can be difficult to predict their behavior. Also, the chaotic nature of fluid behavior in reduced gravity environments limit the assessment and management of space fluids for extraterrestrial applications. In-space refueling from an orbiting propellant depot can be used to extend the range and mission capabilities of these space vehicles. However, current in-space propellant transfer methods rely on expensive and heavy pumps and diaphragms that do not provide sufficient high transfer efficiency or reliability. These methods that rely on heavy pumps and pressurized inert gases are prone to accelerated boil-off and do not maintain propellant in usable and sustainable conditions long-term. Also, these methods require significant resources for liquid acquisition and utilize fault-prone components. Further, these methods require a separate supply of stored gases to generate high pressures for fluid separation. In addition, in microgravity conditions, propellants inside the tank are dispersed randomly, and it can be difficult to predict their behavior. Utilization of cryogenic resources is further limited by advanced thermal and structural operating requirements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for fluid management systems for space depot platforms that can maintain propellant in usable and sustainable conditions in reduced gravity environments in order to support the growing demand for LEO, cislunar and deep space exploration capabilities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one embodiment of the storage system disclosed herein comprises a first tank and a second tank for storing propellant, a rotatable shaft to which the first and second tanks are mounted for rotating the first and second tanks about an axis of the shaft, a drive motor for rotating the shaft so that upon rotation of the first and second tanks, liquid propellant is separated from gas in the propellant and settled to an outer portion of the first and second tanks, a first flow path formed in the shaft, a second and third flow path for transferring the settled liquid in the first tank and the second tank, respectively, to the first flow path, and a fourth flow path for transferring fluid from the first flow path to the spacecraft.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerals specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the systems and subsystems of one embodiment of a spacecraft on-orbit advanced refueling system (SOARS) of the present invention. Payload Systems can encompass technologies and mechanisms that drive depot kinematics and transfer dynamics. Bus Systems can include depot infrastructure and communications that support and operate Payload Systems. The SOARS Dynamics &#x26; Control Subsystem (DC S) can be used to initiate, control, and stabilize depot kinematics during operation. Propellant settling prior to transfer can be driven by thruster mechanisms to spin the system up-to-speed. During spin-up and transfer, the DCS can use thrusters to mitigate propellant slosh effects and settling instabilities that may emerge. If the depot configuration requires, a moving mass system can be incorporated into the DCS in integration to thrusters that can provide baseline shifts in system CG and trim instabilities. Attitude and (re-)orientation operations of the depot can be executed using existing thruster and moving mass mechanisms to maintain stability during obstacle avoidance and non-cooperative client maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The SOARS Propellant Transfer Subsystem (PTS) can provide reliable and efficient propellant management during depot-client transfer operations. Pressure controllers and necessary valves, pressure regulators, and flowrate sensors can be used to establish and maintain necessary pressures to initiate transfer and regulate mass flow rate. Propellant piping geometry and material selection can reduce transfer path length and ensure thermochemical compatibility with target propellant (i.e. liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, liquid methane, hydrazine). The SOARS Client Docking System (CDS) can support client agnostic berthing and depot-client mating during transfer/maintenance operations. Upon client approach, robotic mechanisms (i.e., robotic arms, autonomous tethers, etc.) can be utilized to guide the client to the target propellant transfer port. Prototype CDS can incorporate quick connect and disconnect adapters (QC/QD) to minimize client operations during docking. Adapter construction or selection can take into account thermal and fluid characteristics of the operating propellant and client propellant tank configuration. If the client does not have SOARS QC/QD adapters (e.g., legacy satellites in LEO), on-depot tooling and robotic mechanisms can be used to access the propellant tanks.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The SOARS Cryogenic Storage System (CSS) can enable long-duration storage of cryogenic propellants for client servicing. Passive components, such as cryogenic insulative materials and shielding structures, can be used to maintain thermal requirements. For active reestablishment of cryogenic fluids, the SOARS system can incorporate cryocooling and boil-off mitigation subsystems. The SOARS Communication System (CS) can execute data transfers for depot-to-client and depot-to-ground communications. Client-facing data can be used to enable assessment of propellant transfer status during operation, including alerting by fault detection systems. Over the lifetime of depot operation, ground-based communications may be required to monitor SOARS health and provide timely maintenance and repairs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The SOARS On-Board Computer (OBC) can manage general depot maintenance and operation signaling&#x2014;balancing navigation, fault detection, sensor fusion, and data analytics. Though the DCS can drive depot rotation and stabilization actuation, the OBC can execute navigation, attitude, and positioning of the depot to ensure proper orbital mechanics. Operation-related health monitoring, usage logging, and fault detection can be catalogued, and necessary responses to depot-client state changes can be managed via the OBC. Sensor data collected during operation can be fused intelligently to provide actionable insights for autonomous depot response and ground-crew decision making.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The SOARS Electrical &#x26; Power System (EPS) can serve to provide primary power to depot sensors-actuators through the use of appropriate solar panel arrays, batteries, and insulated electrical conduits. Full-scale SOARS depots can provide client auxiliary power or re-charging capabilities using SOARS stored power. The EPS can follow safety standards to mitigate the risk of electrical fires or spark-generation in the event of EPS damage. A SOARS Structural &#x26; Thermal System (STS) can be used to structurally support the depot subsystems and provide thermo-mechanically robust platforms, mounts and actuators to withstand the centrifugal loading of the depot structures, thermal expansion-shrinking and off-nominal dynamic loads generated by berthed non-cooperative clients and ensure long-duration cryogenic-compatibility.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An exemplary embodiment of is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a schematic view of a device and system for storing and transferring fluid/propellant in low or zero gravity environments in a SOARS. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the refueling device <b>1</b> rotates the depot tanks <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> about the rotational axis <b>30</b> to settle and separate the two-phase gas-propellant into liquid settled propellant <b>40</b> and volatile gas <b>50</b> using the centrifugal force caused by the rotation. The liquid settled propellant <b>40</b> is transferred to the client spacecraft <b>70</b> through transfer lines <b>60</b>. This transfer can be initiated by applying a pressure differential using stored gas or boil-off gases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a drive motor <b>110</b> rotates depot tank A <b>120</b> and depot tank B <b>130</b> about rotational axis <b>140</b> in order to settle and separate the two-phase gas-propellant into liquid settled propellant and volatile gas using the centrifugal force caused by the rotation. Reference numeral <b>145</b> shows a slip ring and load cell. The slip ring can be used to connect and deliver electrical signals (e.g., communications, data and control signals) and the load cell can be used to measure kinetic characteristics (i.e., reaction forces and torques) between the components, which can be used to maintain stability of the system. The control valves are used to transfer fluid between the tanks and the different components of the system. Compressed gas can be used to pressurize components in the system in order to drive fluid transfer to different components. Transfer valves <b>160</b> control the flow of liquid propellant from depot tank A and B to client tank <b>170</b>. The client tank <b>170</b> can include a docking interface to couple the client tank <b>170</b> to the other components of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Flow transmitters <b>180</b>/<b>190</b> measure the flow of propellant from the depot tanks A and B, respectively, to the client tank <b>170</b>. Pressure transducers <b>150</b> measure the pressures in depot tank A and depot tank B. Although two (2) depot tanks are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, any number of depot tanks can be used. Also, the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> can be adaptable to orbital vehicle-mounted and surface-mounted platforms. The embodiments show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> make it possible to minimize the use of expensive and failure-prone pumps and improve cryogen boil-off mitigation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows one possible arrangement for a SOARS operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a client satellite can dock with the SOARS for client refueling. The SOARS can be located at various orbital positions such as low earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), the first lagrangian point L1, the fourth lagrangian point L4, etc. The SOARS also can be used for lunar, Martian and asteroid missions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the device for storing and transferring fluid/propellant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> mounted in an ESPA standard ring or housing for transferring the fluid/propellant to a receiving tank mounted on an astrobee. The astrobees can be used to maintain stability during transfer. Air pressure can be used to transfer the fluid to the astrobees. Any type of spacecraft also can be used in place of the astrobees shown in the figures. Also, the astrobees could be replaced with thrusters or use the clients' thrust mechanisms to stabilize the system. The ESPA standard ring can include any number of docking ports, which can be self-aligning docking ports, that can be used to dock multiple astrobees or spacecraft to the ESPA standard ring for refueling. The tank configuration of the system can be modular and can be scaled to a larger number of tanks and and/or larger tanks. Also, the orientation and size of the system tanks can be configured to ensure rotational stability across all fluid distributions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show how the fluid from the rotating tanks housed in the ESPA standard ring shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is transferred to the receiving tanks of the astrobees/spacecraft. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the rotating tanks rotate about a shaft <b>310</b>. First, the fluid that has settled in the outside portion of the tanks due to the rotation is transferred through flow paths <b>410</b> to a center hub formed in the shaft <b>310</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the fluid is transferred through a pathway <b>420</b> formed in the shaft <b>310</b> to a position below the rotating tanks, and then to the receiving tanks of the astrobee/spacecraft through flow path <b>430</b> formed outside of the rotating tanks. The transfer of the fluid through the flow paths can be initiated by applying a depot-client pressure differential using stored gas or boil-off gases.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The shaft <b>310</b> can also include a rotary union and a slip ring integrated into the shaft <b>310</b> that allows fluid and electrical transfer between the rotating tanks and the shaft <b>310</b>. For testing purposes, water can be used, but in operation in space, any liquid such as liquid propellant or a biological sample can be used. The flow paths can be made using NPT and/or NPTF plated brass fittings with high pressure push-to-connect seals, but any other fittings and connections could be used based on fluid handling requirements. Check valves can be placed along the flow paths to control the flow of fluid therethrough.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a three-dimensional view of the rotating tanks housed in a frame <b>510</b> of one embodiment of the invention.

A motor <b>550</b> that drives the rotating tanks is also formed on the top plate <b>540</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows one of the rotating tanks of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the tank, the rotating tanks can include a camera system for monitoring and assessing internal mass distribution in the system. For example, machine vision (e.g., object recognition, density estimation, and volume estimation) can be used to assess the distribution of fluids and solids in the tank, which can be fed into a system inertia model that can predict instability using sensed kinematic and kinetic data to drive corrective actions. A mono/stereo/multi-camera system can be included as a measurement modality. The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> also can include a flowmeter for measuring flow through the flow paths, solenoid valves along the flow paths for opening and closing the flow paths to allow liquid transfer and enable target pressurization, pressure sensors, drain ports, fill/vent ports and flow instrumentation unit.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, a brushless DC motor, for example a 15 W 1/50 HP motor with a belt-driven aluminum shaft, could be used to create an angular velocity of 60 rpm for the rotating tanks. A motor driver can be used to limit torque output and define acceleration times. For the flowmeters, a Bell Systems 10-1000 mL/min oval gear microflow meter can be used. For the pressure sensors, Omega stainless steel 0-30 psi pressure sensors can be used. The tanks can be made of double-contained (nested) acrylic or polycarbonate of an appropriate thickness of approximately &#x215b;&#x2033;, for example. The tanks can be independently face-sealed with silicone or grease against aluminum caps.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows some of the phases of operation of the transfer of fluid from the rotating tanks of the SOARS to the astrobees. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the term &#x201c;astrobees&#x201d; is used, but the operation can be used for any type of space vehicles, clients or recipients. One or more astrobees can be pre-docked to stabilize the ESPA ring before the docking maneuver is conducted. In Phase 1, docking of the astrobee identifies the AR (augmented reality) tag of the SOARS docking port and maneuvers into alignment with the SOARS port. The AR tags allow the astrobee to identify the docking port and maneuver to the target. The AR tags, which are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, can contain various types of information of the docking port such as the type of docking interface, structural characteristics, pressure characteristics, the type of propellant/liquid that is provided at the docking port, operating pressures, etc. Other types of alignment tags can be used, such as QR (Quick Response) tags, RFID tags, etc. The astrobees can use internal sensors and controls for position-holding SOARS during operation. Then, the astrobee contacts the docking interface and the SOARS triggers the latching of the docking interface, tightens contact and seals the transfer lines. Servo-driven latching mechanisms and electrical contacts can be used within the docking interface to assist with the latching. Also, a multi-point circuit closure detector can be used within the docking interface to verify successful latching. In Phase 2, the SOARS spins up to a target angular velocity. In Phase 3, the air pumps turn on, pressure control solenoid valves (PCSV's) open to allow for pressurization. Once pressurized, flow transfer solenoid valves (FTSV's) open to allow liquid flow. Self-sealing ports for liquid and air allow for transfer between SOARS and the astrobee tanks. The PCSV's then can open and close to maintain a target pressure differential between the SOARS and astrobee tanks. Phases 1-3 can then be repeated with different operating parameters, such as different pressures, different angular velocities and different tank fills. The electronics enclosure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> can include microcontrollers, sensors, drivers, actuators and other electronics. Any type of a suitable microcontroller can be used such as two (2) teensy 4.1 Arduino-based microcontrollers. The microcontroller can be configured to execute software code to control the operation of the SOARS such as the rotational rate of the rotating tanks, tank pressures, and flow actuation. This software code architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> can be comprised of algorithmic modules to structure and store real-time system data, perceive system state, decide state change, and execute commands to maintain stable operation. The algorithmic modules, in their entirety or sub-section, can include some or all of the following module features: multi-modal data structuring and fusion, system and environment perception for machine situational awareness, system-environment state prediction and state change decision-making, and corrective action command and execution. Data ingestion and signal conditioning through the Sensor Interface pulls from multi-modal data streams (i.e., use cameras, pressures, flows, accelerations, torques). Structured data is stored in System Memory for downstream predictive functions and train leaning algorithms. Structured data is also passed downstream to the Perception Module, which can comprise of a system dynamics estimator to derive system-environment intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (i.e., system inertia, mass distribution, instability mode), and system and environment state classifiers to classify the system state based on sensor input and estimated derived parameters. The Decision Module takes in dynamics and state data to predict future system state using current classification and data streams, and to estimate the total system and environment state deviation across multi-dimensional target dynamics-state criteria. The Command Module takes in dynamics-state deviation data, in coordination with actuator and end-effector models (i.e., models of system components, such as thrusters, actuators, valves) and system reaction prediction models, to identify optimal corrective actions (e.g., pressurize, start transfer, change system attitude), to return system operation within target dynamics-states (e.g., mitigate instability, maintain state, or change state). All data and actions from these modules are tracked and stored in System Memory for training and optimization of learning algorithms within each module. Any or all system dynamics-state modules and algorithms may incorporate any combination of physics-based, heuristics-based, or empirically learned-trained real-time algorithmic models (e.g., neural networks). Modules and sections of this code may or may not be run simultaneously, in the background across multi-processor computer systems, and or sequentially in a reactive manner. Also, the electronics enclosure can include an on-board battery to supplement the astrobee batteries and/or other electrical systems.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a depot tank <b>800</b> that contains a liquid and a gas. As described above, the depot tank <b>800</b> is rotated about a shaft to induce the liquid to move towards the outer portion (left side) of the tank <b>800</b> and induce the gas to move towards the inner portion (left side) of the tank <b>800</b>. Baffles are formed inside the tank <b>800</b> to help guide the liquid towards the outer portion of the tank <b>800</b> and the gas towards the inner portion of the tank <b>800</b> where they are collected and processed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the depot tank <b>800</b> includes internal baffles <b>810</b> that can be used to channel/guide the fluid to the outer portion of the tank <b>800</b>. The baffles can form converging sections that help move the liquid further outward and the gas further inward. Openings <b>820</b> can be formed in the baffles through which the liquid and gas travel to the outer and inner portion of the tank, respectively. These openings can be one-way devices <b>830</b>, pass-through orifices, controlled flow channels that induce the desired flow regime. Depending on the fluid being stored and transferred, the openings can reduce flow, maintain pressure differential across the baffle, or manipulate the fluid characteristics (e.g., temperature, liquid-gas state change, density, etc.) in a one-way flow manner. A transfer flow path <b>840</b> connects the outer portion of the tank <b>800</b> to transfer the liquid to a spacecraft <b>850</b>. The baffles can incorporate vanes or surface patterning of various dimensions and configurations to control flow regimes of the bulk fluid and the wall boundary layer. Also, vanes can be used induce or stabilize flow turbulence for adjusting flow parameters (e.g., pressure, flow rate, bulk density, etc.) prior to flowing into desired regions of tank or across a baffle. Micropatterning having boundary layers can be used to control or reduce wall shear loads or adjust free-surface energy of the fluid-wall interface to drive desired flow regime. Thermal control or actuation (e.g., electromagnetic, mechanical, etc.) of the baffle may also be used to perturb or induce desired flow across or through the baffle. The material used for the baffles can be selected based on fluid storage and flow requirements. The exact configuration (size, number, orientation, instrumentation, actuation, temperature, and material composition, etc.) of the baffles can be set based on the fluid storage and flow requirements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> shows additional embodiments of the depot tanks.
