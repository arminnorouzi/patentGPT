Systems) mirror is an optical device using a mirror having a diameter of a sub-millimeter to ten and several millimeters, and is used in an optical sensor, optical communication, optical computing, a projection device, and the like. In particular, the optical scanning method in which the mirror twists and vibrates has a simple structure and high durability, and thus has been continuously developed. The performance of such a MEMS mirror is evaluated by a figure of merit &#x3b8;df using an optical swing angle &#x3b8; degree, a mirror diameter d mm, and a resonant frequency f kilohertz in some cases, and generally, the larger the figure of merit &#x3b8;df, the higher the performance of the application. For example, in a projector, the larger the optical swing angle &#x3b8;, the smaller the slow ratio, the larger the mirror diameter d, the higher the condensing property of the irradiation beam and the clearer the image, and the larger the resonant frequency f, the higher the resolution. In a distance sensor, the larger &#x3b8; is, the wider the detection region, the larger the mirror diameter d, the detection sensitivity is improved because the efficiency of taking in scatted light from an object, and the larger the resonant frequency f, the more detection points are.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a method of increasing the figure of merit &#x3b8;df, a coupled vibration structure (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 1), a structure in which an action point is provided outside an axis (see, for example, Patent Literature 1), and the like have been proposed. The coupled vibration structure requires a large dead space because a counterweight is provided around the mirror. Further, the structure in which an action point is provided outside an axis requires a large dead space particularly in the case where a twisting operation of two axes is necessary, because of the large vibration input unit. These dead spaces restrict the optical path of the laser incident on the MEMS mirror and the optical path of the reflected laser, which causes problems that the system performance is deteriorated and the system size increases.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2005-148459</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">Non-Patent Literature 1: Utku Baran, et al. &#x201c;Resonant PZT MEMS Scanner for High-Resolution Displays&#x201d; Journal of microelectromechanical systems, Vol. 21, No. 6, p.1303, December 2012</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, in the existing MEMS mirror, the dead space becomes larger as the figure of merit increases.

An insulation layer, a lower electrode layer, a piezoelectric element, and an upper electrode layer are deposited on the laminated silicon surface. After removing the silicon substrate of SOI of a region excluding a frame portion and a rib portion up to an SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer by selective dry etching, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer of the same region is removed. The piezoelectric element and the upper electrode layer other than a vibration input unit and a twist detection unit are removed by dry etching from the surface layer, and the lower electrode layer is removed leaving a piezoelectric element region and a wiring region. After that, a metal film for wiring of the upper electrode is deposited, and a reflective film is deposited on a mirror surface of the surface layer. Next, the silicon layer and the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer other than necessary parts such as a frame, a mirror, a beam, and a vibration input unit are removed. Further, as necessary, a reflective film is provided on the back surface of the mirror and a metal film is provided on the back surface of the frame. There may be a metal wiring for taking out on the frame surface, and there may be a metal film therearound. The metal films on the front and back of the frame can be used when bonding to a support casing. The mirror reflective film may be covered with gold, silver, aluminum, or a dielectric film thereof, or may be a dielectric multilayer film. In order to suppress the warp of the mirror surface, it is favorable that the reflective films on the front and back have the same layer configuration. These are examples, and various methods that are general as MEMS processes can be used for the production process. The cross section of the rib portion does not necessarily need to be rectangular, and may be a tapered shape or a reverse tapered shape. The rib may be laminated on the silicon surface.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Modified Example</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the embodiment of the present disclosure has been specifically described above, the content of the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment described above, and various modifications based on the technical idea of the present disclosure can be made.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The structure of the MEMS device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example, and can be modified to the extent that the effect in the present disclosure can be expected.
