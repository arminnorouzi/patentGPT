id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for improving the image quality of a Head-up display (HUD) system, the HUD system comprises an image display device and a reflecting element having a partially transmissive first reflective surface and at least one partially transmissive second reflective surface parallel thereto, wherein the second reflective surface is arranged on the side of the first reflective surface opposite the image display device and wherein the reflecting element

to reflect a portion of the reflected light beams toward a design detection point.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention further relates to a polarizing element configured to perform the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention further relates to a HUD system comprising a polarizing element according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The HUD was originally developed for the military with the aim of keeping the pilot watching the route and not having to look in any other direction. In contrast, with a traditional head-down display (HDD), one must look regularly at the dashboard and focus suddenly close after looking into the distance, which can be tiring. The head-up display also solves the problem of having to focus close by making a distant image plane. Originally military technology, it has now also appeared in the automotive industry and became available to civilian users. By projecting an image onto a reflective element, in other words combiner (such as a special windscreen or a special plate specially equipped for this purpose), the driver is able to obtain information while driving about speed, navigation, radio settings, error messages and other driving information which he or she would normally have to find by looking at the dashboard. In addition, dangerous situations (e.g. roadblocks, road bends in poor visibility conditions, pedestrians stepping off sidewalks, etc.) can also be visually predicted. Currently, the HUD system is found mainly in luxury cars, but the range of applications is expanding rapidly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The most common HUD solution installed in a vehicle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) essentially consists of an image display device <b>1</b> and an aspherical mirror <b>2</b>, where the reflecting element <b>3</b> is the windscreen. In this embodiment, the aspherical mirror <b>2</b> is intended to correct the distortion of the reflecting element <b>3</b> curved due to the windscreen design and to focus the dispersing light beams of the image display device <b>1</b>, the latter being a digital projector so as to form a distant image plane and create a projected image <b>4</b> which the driver sees at a comfortable distance as &#x201c;floating&#x201d; in front of the vehicle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show an enlarged view of the incident light beam <b>11</b> coming from the image display device <b>1</b> reflected from both the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b>, thereby creating first and second reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a </i>produce a primary image <b>8</b>, while the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>b </i>produce a secondary image <b>9</b>. The simultaneous appearance of two <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> images makes the result unenjoyable and even confusing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the appearance of the two images <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the intensities of the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>for unpolarized light. Due to multiple reflections, even more scattered light than shown in the drawing may appear, as is known to those skilled in the art. There are several known solutions for eliminating one of the two resulting images <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and for reducing the intensity of one of the light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>relative to the other (i.e. to improve the contrast ratio).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The intensities reflected on each surface are determined by the so-called Fresnel formulas. At a reflective surface, the incident light beam <b>11</b> and the reflected light beam <b>12</b> define a plane, the so-called plane of incidence <b>10</b>. The ratio of the intensity of the reflected light beam <b>12</b> and the incident light beam <b>11</b>, i.e. the reflection coefficient R=I<sub>R</sub>/I<sub>B </sub>(I<sub>B</sub>&#x2212;intensity of the incident beam, I<sub>R </sub>intensity of the reflected beam) depends on the angle of incidence &#x398;, the refractive indices of the materials on both sides of the surface (for air n=1, for a given glass n=1.518), and the relationship between the plane of incidence <b>10</b> and the polarization of the light beam, as is known to the person skilled in the art. These relationships are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Linearly polarized light is S-polarized when polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence <b>10</b> and P-polarized when parallel to the plane of incidence <b>10</b>. The so-called &#x398;<sub>B </sub>Brewster angle is also known, which is an angle of incidence characteristic of the material boundary at which the reflection coefficient of the P-polarization R<sub>P </sub>decreases to zero, while the reflection coefficient R<sub>S </sub>of the S-polarization is not zero. (For all other, not purely S- or P-polarizations, the reflection coefficient is composed of R<sub>S </sub>and R<sub>P</sub>). HUDs operating on the polarization principle try to take advantage of this effect and are designed at a Brewster angle. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show that illuminating the windscreen only at Brewster angle with S- and P-polarization still does not provide a system suitable as a head-up display, since in the case of S-polarization the projected image remains having ghost image (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) or in the absence of reflections in the case of P-polarization no reflected light enters the observer's eye (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), so the projected image will not be visible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the problem shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> known HUD systems use a solution where the reflection properties on the at least one surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b> are changed as a function of the polarization. In one known solution, a special thin film system is formed on one or even more surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b>. The function of the created high-reflection reflective layer <b>13</b> providing high reflection&#x2014;or the low-reflection anti-reflective layer <b>14</b> providing low reflection&#x2014;is to increase, or decrease, the reflection of light on the given surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>for a given type of polarization (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b></figref>). In the Brewster angle and in the region close to it, with the reflecting element <b>3</b> illuminated with light of the given type of polarization, it is possible to achieve a high contrast ratio of the reflections and thus to enjoy the reflected image, but the useful range is limited. In one possible embodiment, the windscreen is coated with, for example, 12 nm of Ag and 63 nm of SiO2 and is illuminated with S-polarized light beams <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The required thin film system is usually created on foil (e.g. 3M&#xae; WCF=Windshield Combiner Film) and laminated to the appropriate surface during manufacture. Cheaper solutions include a reflective film that can be applied to the windscreen even after manufacture by the user. An important aspect that cannot be overlooked when designing the reflection layers <b>13</b> is the transmission of the windshield, which is restricted by country (min. 75% in Europe, min. 70% in the USA). If a windscreen with a thin-film system reflects too much light and thus transmits little, the transmission may fall below the statutory value and thus not be marketable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another known solution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>), the polarization-dependent reflection is created by rotating the plane of polarization of the light beam passing through the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>. For example, an optical birefringent layer <b>15</b> (&#x3bb;/2 waveplate) with an optical axis <b>150</b>, preferably in the form of a film, is laminated to the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b> and the reflecting element <b>3</b> is illuminated with polarized light at an angle close to Brewster angle. A birefringent layer <b>15</b> of appropriate thickness (with an optical axis at an angle of 45&#xb0; to the plane of incidence coinciding with the plane of the drawing) rotates the plane of polarization of the illuminating light by 90&#xb0;, i.e. makes P-polarization from S-polarization and vice versa. Thereby, the incident light beam <b>11</b> coming at an angle close to the Brewster angle will, depending on its polarization, be reflected from one surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>with a lower intensity than from the other. Using S-polarization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the reflection from the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>is larger, while using P-polarization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), the reflection from the second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>is larger. Gradually deviating from the Brewster angle, this effect also deteriorates more and more, and a ghost image appears, so the useful angle range is limited.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further problem with the solutions comprising the birefringent layer <b>15</b> is that, when deviating from a design direction, the angle between the plane of incidence <b>10</b> and the optical axis <b>150</b> of the birefringent layer <b>15</b> differs from direction to direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i></figref>). As a result, the exact 90-degree polarization rotation for which the birefringent layer is designed is not met in each direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>a </i></figref>shows three light beams <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>and <b>11</b><i>c </i>which reach the user's eyes from different points in the perceived image. Of the three beams indicated, the first light beam <b>11</b><i>a </i>travels in a design direction <b>21</b>, and for this beam the angle between the optical axis <b>150</b> and the plane of incidence <b>10</b> corresponds to an angle &#x3d5;<sub>0</sub>=45 degrees which is optimal for the HUD system. This angle does not change along the vertical direction for the light beams <b>11</b> which are incident on the reflective element <b>3</b> closer to one of the horizontal edges of the image observed by the user. On the other hand, when the incident light beams <b>11</b> which are deviating from the vertical centreline of the image in a horizontal direction are observed, it is found that in the case of the beams <b>11</b> which are deviating from the vertical centreline of the image to the right, such as the beam <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the angle formed by the plane of incidence <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the optical axis <b>150</b> decreases, thus, the angle &#x3d5;<sub>1 </sub>associated with the light beam <b>11</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the angle &#x3d5;<sub>0</sub>, i.e., &#x3d5;<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;45 degrees. Similarly, for angles to the left of the vertical centreline of the image, such as light beam <b>11</b><i>c</i>, this angle increases, so the angle &#x3d5;<sub>2 </sub>between the plane of incidence <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the optical axis <b>150</b> is larger than the angle &#x3d5;<sub>0</sub>, i.e. &#x3d5;<sub>2</sub>&#x3e;45 degrees. The birefringent film rotates the polarization by 90-degrees only if the condition of &#x3d5;<sub>0</sub>=45 degrees is satisfied, however, at different angles the rotation of polarization will no longer be exactly 90 degrees and the intensity ratios of the light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>reflected from the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>differ from the ideal, hence the ghost image ratio increases. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>b</i></figref>, curved lines on the right indicate the same angular values in the projected image area. In the vertical centreline of the image, this angle is equally 45 degrees between the lower and upper edges of the image. For light beams <b>11</b> which are deviating from the vertical centreline of the image to the right, different curves denote the light beams <b>11</b> for which the optical axis is at an angle of less than 45 degrees to the plane of incidence <b>10</b>; wherein the optical axis <b>150</b> of the birefringent layer <b>15</b> forms an angle with the plane of incidence <b>10</b> of 40 degrees along the first curve, 35 degrees along the second curve, 30 degrees along the third curve and 25 degrees along the fourth curve.

For each light beam <b>11</b>, the deviation of the angle of the optical axis <b>150</b> from the ideal angle of 45 degrees leads to a deterioration in the image quality proportional to the deviation, i.e., the ghost image ratio increases.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the ghost image ratio during the deviation in vertical and horizontal angles to a system according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, illuminated by S-polarization.

(The latter performs a safety function. Its purpose is to prevent glass shards from falling on the occupants in the event of an accident.) The birefringent layer <b>15</b> is also typically enclosed between the two layers of glass to protect it (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). This does not significantly degrade the contrast, but makes the birefringent layer <b>15</b> more protected from mechanical influences. Such a solution is known, for example, from patent documents U.S. Pat.

The advantage of these two solutions is that they operate in P-polarization, i.e. polarizing sunglasses do not block the visibility of the image. Systems based on the P-polarization principle described earlier have not become widespread because in rainy weather&#x2014;and because of all kinds of external dirt at all&#x2014;light is scattered on the outer surface and the image deteriorates. In contrast, in the above mentioned two arrangements, the highest intensity of reflection takes place in the PVB 16 layer, so rainy weather is not a hindrance. The mechanical protection of the film or films placed between the layers of glass is provided by the outer layers of glass.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat.

Proper operation is typically achieved within a range of &#xb1;3-9&#xb0;, i.e. on just a palm of the surface of the windshield (the exact value depends on the method and the definition of &#x201c;proper operation&#x201d; as already described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b><i>a</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">From the HUD systems comprising an image display device <b>1</b> and a reflecting element <b>3</b>, which are described above and schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, it can be generally said that in only one direction, the so-called <b>21</b> design directions where they work flawlessly i.e. ghost image free. Conventional HUD systems are designed so that the displayed image is ghost free viewed from the design direction, i.e. the design direction <b>21</b> is what the HUD system is optimized for. Deviating from this direction vertically and horizontally, an increasingly stronger ghost image appears. The useful area <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is the spatial angle range where the ghost image is not yet disturbing. Depending on the individual, the ghost image ratio becomes inconvenient above 3-5% approx.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the solutions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>, the light exiting the image display device <b>1</b> is passed through a simple linear polarizer <b>19</b>, which thus has a homogeneous polarization. The polarized light beams are reflected from the first mirror <b>17</b> and the second mirror <b>18</b> to the reflecting element <b>3</b> and then reflected from there to the user's eyes. The second mirror <b>18</b> is preferably an aspherical surface mirror that produces converging beams from the projected diverging beams. Since in the known solutions the optical axis of the linear polarizer <b>19</b> is the same at all points, the polarization axes of the passing linearly polarized light beams will also point in the same direction. Therefore, moving towards the edges of the image perceived by the user, i.e. deviating from the design direction <b>21</b>, the polarization planes of the incident light beams <b>11</b> are also increasingly rotated relative to the planes of incidence <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>a </i></figref>shows three incident light beams <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c </i>which have the same polarization and reach the user's eyes from different points of the image generated by the image display device <b>1</b>. Of the three beams shown, the light beam <b>11</b><i>a </i>travels in the ideal direction, i.e. in the design direction <b>21</b>, and the direction of polarization of this beam corresponds to the ideal polarization direction for the HUD system, i.e. the polarization axis of the light beam <b>11</b><i>a </i>forms an angle &#x3b2;<sub>0</sub>=90 degrees with the plane of incidence <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the light beam <b>11</b><i>a</i>. This angle does not change along the vertical direction for the light beams <b>11</b> which are incident on the reflective element <b>3</b> closer to one of the horizontal edges of the image observed by the user. On the other hand, when light beams <b>11</b> deviating from the vertical centreline of the image in a horizontal direction are observed, it is found that in the case of beams <b>11</b> which are deviating from the vertical centreline of the image to the right in the horizontal direction, such as in the case of the light beam <b>11</b><i>b</i>, this angle decreases, so the angle &#x3b2;<sub>1 </sub>for the light beam <b>11</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the angle &#x3b2;<sub>0</sub>. i.e. &#x3b2;<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;90 degrees. Similarly, for angles to the left of the vertical centreline of the image, such as the light beam <b>11</b><i>c</i>, this angle increases, so that the angle <b>132</b> for the light beam <b>11</b> is larger than the angle &#x3b2;<sub>0</sub>, i.e. &#x3b2;<sub>2</sub>&#x3e;90 degrees. Since in a given plane of incidence <b>10</b> the incident light beams <b>11</b> can be considered to be purely S-polarized only at &#x3b2;<sub>0</sub>=90 degrees, we can no longer speak of purely S-polarized beams at different angles. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>, curved lines on the right indicate the same angular values <b>13</b> in the projected image area. In the vertical centreline of the image, this angle between the lower and upper edges of the image is equal to 90 degrees. For light beams <b>11</b> deviating horizontally to the right of the vertical centreline of the image, the angles of view at which the polarization axis makes an angle of less than 90 degrees with the plane of incidence <b>10</b> are shown along different curves. The polarization axes of the light beams <b>11</b> form an angle of 85 degrees along the first curve, 80 degrees along the second curve, 75 degrees along the third curve and 70 degrees along the fourth curve with the plane of incidence <b>10</b> belonging to the given light beam <b>11</b>. Similarly, in the case of light beams <b>11</b> deviating horizontally to the left of the vertical centreline of the image, the light beams <b>11</b> for which the polarization axis forms an angle of more than 90 degrees with the plane of incidence <b>10</b> are shown along different curves. The polarization axes of the light beams <b>11</b> form an angle of 95 degrees along the first curve, 100 degrees along the second curve, 105 degrees along the third curve and 110 degrees along the fourth curve with the plane of incidence <b>10</b>. For each polarized light beam <b>11</b>, the deviation of the angle of the polarization axis from the ideal 90 degree angle leads to a deterioration in the image quality proportional to the deviation, i.e., the ghost image ratio increases.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inventors have found that in the case of prior art HUD systems, the reflecting element <b>3</b> is illuminated with homogeneous light, i.e. with light polarized in the same way for each light beam <b>11</b>, therefore, the polarization will be appropriate only for the light beams reflected in the design direction <b>21</b>. That is, moving towards the edges of the image&#x2014;due to the rotation of the planes of incidence <b>10</b>&#x2014;the polarization of the light beams <b>11</b> arriving there will be suboptimal compared to the design direction and ghost images will appear. In other words, with current HUD systems, only the centre of the image will be ghost image free, so the area where an image of acceptable quality can be displayed is limited.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors have found that in the existing HUD systems the polarization axes of the incident light beams <b>11</b> belonging to the reflected light beams <b>12</b> coming from the edges of the observed image and the planes of incidence <b>10</b> are at an angle to each other which does not correspond to the design angle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention is further based on the recognition that the polarization states of the light beams <b>11</b> can be set in accordance with predetermined optimal polarization states corresponding to the propagation directions of the light beams <b>11</b> by means of an appropriately designed polarizing element arranged in the path of the incident light beams. With said optimal polarization states, a substantially ghost free image can be achieved even at the edges of the image.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus which are free from the disadvantages of the prior art solutions. It is an object of the present invention to improve the image quality of current HUD systems, in particular to reduce ghost image ratio and increase the area that can be considered substantially ghost image free.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The objective of the invention is therefore to transform the HUD system in such a way that it does not simply emit homogeneously polarized light onto the reflecting element <b>3</b>, but rather polarized light with the polarization required to achieve the minimum ghost image ratio arrives at each point of the reflecting element <b>3</b>. Light having linear or elliptical (including circular) polarization may be suitable for this, depending on how the HUD works.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the invention, the object is achieved by a HUD system which comprises an image display device and a reflecting element having a partially transmissive first reflective surface and at least one partially transmissive second reflective surface substantially parallel thereto, and a layer selected from a group consisting of polarization-dependent reflection layer anti-reflection layer and optical birefringent layer, wherein the second reflective surface is on the side of the first reflective surface opposite the image display device and wherein the reflecting element is adapted to produce reflected light beams from incident light beams originating from points of an image generated by the image display device and being incident on the reflective surfaces and to reflect at least a portion of the reflected light beams toward a design detection point, and which reflecting element is arranged relative to the image display device such that a portion of the incident light beams reflected in the direction of the design detection point reaches the first reflective surface at a Brewster angle. In the light path between the image display device and the reflecting element, it comprises a polarizing element for setting the polarization states of the incident light beams reflected by the reflecting element towards the design detection point, so that the intensity ratio, which is calculated by dividing a minimum of an intensity of the reflected light beam first reflected by the first reflective surface and an intensity of the reflected light beam first reflected by the second reflective surface by a maximum of the two said intensities, has a minimum.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An image display device (also known as a projection unit) typically produces an image with a width defined in a first direction and a height defined in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The light beams emanating from here may pass through additional deflecting optical elements before reaching the light-transmitting and reflective reflecting element (i.e. the windscreen), from where the reflected or transmitted light enters the user's eyes. In a preferred embodiment, the image display device projects substantially linearly polarized light onto the reflecting element, for example, the image display device may comprise a linear polarizer. The reflecting element, like all windscreens, reflects light with a given polarization characteristic to a large extent and transmits light with a different polarization characteristic to a large extent. The optical element arranged in the path of the projected linearly polarized light beam sets the polarization states of the incident light beams reflected in the direction of the design detection point (i.e., the light beams defining the projected image) as described above, which can be understood as modifying the polarization properties of these light beams as a function of the vertical and/or horizontal angle (&#x3b1;v, &#x3b1;H) enclosed with the design direction pointing to the detection point.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further object of the invention is a method according to claim <b>1</b> for improving the image quality of a HUD system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention further relates to a polarizing element according to claim <b>6</b>, which is configured to carry out the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the invention the polarization properties of the light beams <b>11</b> incident on the reflecting element <b>3</b> are set differently for each direction of incidence by means of a suitably designed polarizing element, so that the ghost image after reflection from the reflecting element <b>3</b> is minimal. With such a solution, the contrast ratio of the ghost image can be significantly reduced for each pixel, i.e. the image area perceived as ghost image free by the user can be significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further details of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

For the sake of clarity and simplicity of the description, the figures already described will be referred to only to the extent necessary.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The method according to the invention is aimed at improving the image quality of a HUD system comprising an image display device <b>1</b> and a reflecting element <b>3</b> having a partially transmissive first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and at least one partially transmissive second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>substantially parallel thereto, and a polarization-dependent reflection layer <b>13</b> and/or an anti-reflection layer <b>14</b> and/or an optical birefringent layer <b>15</b>, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>b</i></figref>. The second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>is located on the side of the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>opposite to the image display device <b>1</b>, i.e. the light beams produced by the image display device <b>1</b> first arrive at the surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and passing through it reach the second surface <b>3</b><i>b</i>. In the context of the present invention, polarization-dependent reflection layer <b>13</b> and anti-reflection layer <b>14</b>, respectively, mean layers (e.g. film, coating, etc.) whose reflection is maximal or minimal for a given polarization (e.g. for S-polarization) of light. That is, these layers reflect (reflection layers <b>13</b>) or transmit (anti-reflection layers <b>14</b>) the given type of polarized light with high efficiency. The reflection layer <b>13</b> and the anti-reflection layer <b>14</b> can also be arranged on or between the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, as described previously.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment, the reflecting element <b>3</b> is provided as a windscreen of a vehicle, the inner surface of which is the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the outer surface of which is the second surface <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The reflective surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>are adapted to produce reflected beams <b>12</b> from incident light beams <b>11</b> originating from different points of the image generated by the image display device <b>1</b> and arriving at the reflective surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>and to reflect a portion of the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>towards a design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>located within a design detection region <b>23</b>. It is noted that the image generated by the image display device is the image perceivable on a screen or other surface of the image display device. The image observed by the user of the HUD system is referred to as the projected image. The reflecting element <b>3</b> is preferably arranged so that at least a portion of the incident light beams <b>11</b> arrives at the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>at a Brewster angle. Note that the design detection region <b>23</b> in the context of the present description denotes a region comprising spatial positions from which the user is expected to view the image generated by the HUD system, so this is a design parameter. Accordingly, the design detection region <b>23</b> depends on the environment of the HUD system, for example in case of a HUD system designed for installation in a given type of vehicle it depends on the location of the driver's seat with respect to the windscreen. Practically, for example the positions of the eyes of users (drivers) of different height may be determined when seated in the driver's seat of the given type of vehicle in a driving position (i.e. the seat is set at a right height and distance for comfortable driving). A region encompassing the determined eye locations may be considered as the design detection region <b>23</b> and e.g. a centre point of the design detection region <b>23</b> may be considered as the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a</i>. It is further conceivable to determine only the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a</i>, for example the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>may correspond to a point located half way between the two eyes of a user having an average height who is seated in the driver's seat in a driving position. A further possibility is to determine the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>for a given user. By default, when the HUD system is used as intended, the earlier described design direction <b>21</b> points to the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a</i>. It is further noted that the reflecting element <b>3</b> reflects only a portion of the light beams originating from the points of the image generated by the image display device <b>1</b> in the direction of the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a</i>; the other beams of light are reflected in other directions. However, since only these light beams reach the hypothetical user viewing from the design detection point <b>23</b><i>s </i>(whereby these light beams form the projected image), consequently, the method according to the invention only deals with the incident light beams <b>11</b> which create these light beams, and in the further steps of the method these are referred to as incident light beams <b>11</b> reflected in the direction of the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the present invention, optimal polarization states are determined for the incident light beams <b>11</b> reflected by the reflective surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>in the direction of the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>for which optimal polarization states the intensity ratio of the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>first reflected by the first reflective surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and first reflected by the second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>during the reflection of the given incident light beam <b>11</b> is minimal. Note that in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, for the light beams <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>reflected by the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, this intensity ratio is zero (since the P-polarized light beam <b>11</b> incident at a Brewster angle passes completely through the surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>, so there is no reflection), i.e. the minimum intensity ratio of the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>is also zero. From the point of view of the HUD system, this is the ideal case, because then no ghost image appears at all. As used herein, the reflected light beams <b>12</b><i>b </i>first reflected by the second reflective surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>are understood to mean the light beam passing through the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>and first reflected by the second surface <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The higher order light beams shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> reflected between the first and second surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>and reflected by the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>towards the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>are not taken into account for the sake of simplicity. The optimal polarization states may be determined for each incident light beam <b>11</b> reflected by the reflective surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>in the direction of the design detection point <b>23</b><i>a </i>or for only some representative incident light beams <b>11</b>. For example, only one incident light beam <b>11</b> may be taken into account for given areas of the image generated by the image generating device <b>1</b>. For example, all the light beams <b>11</b> originating from an image area of 10&#xd7;10 pixels may be represented by a single light beam <b>11</b> e.g. originating from a central pixel of the given image area.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The polarization states of the light beams <b>11</b> can be given by the so-called Jones vectors, i.e., the amplitude of the vibrations of the light beam components and their phase angle, as is known to those skilled in the art. (If the phase differences of the Jones vectors X and Y are 0&#xb0; or 180&#xb0;, we speak of linear polarization, if 90&#xb0;, we speak of circular polarization. In all other cases, it is called elliptical polarization.)</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an exemplary embodiment, one or both of the first and second reflective surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>are provided with a reflection layer <b>13</b> and/or an anti-reflection layer <b>14</b> designed for a particular type of linear polarization (S- or P), as already shown in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. The reflections and transmissions on the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b> provided with the reflection layer <b>13</b> are as follows. For each material boundary, for each direction, a reflection and transmission coefficient can be determined, the so-called Fresnel coefficient. Thus, for a reflecting element <b>3</b> (e.g. glass), the following coefficients can be determined for the first surface <b>3</b><i>a</i>: r<sub>12</sub>, t<sub>12</sub>, r<sub>21</sub>, t<sub>21 </sub>and for the second surface <b>3</b><i>b</i>: r<sub>23</sub>, t<sub>23</sub>, r<sub>32</sub>, t<sub>32</sub>. The coefficients are complex numbers, depending on the angle of incidence and the complex refractive index of the material on both sides of the surface, as well as the structure of the thin film applied to the surface. Furthermore, the coefficients also depend on polarization and can be determined separately for S-polarization (r<sub>12S</sub>, t<sub>12S</sub>, r<sub>21S</sub>, t<sub>21S</sub>, r<sub>23S</sub>, t<sub>23S</sub>, r<sub>32S</sub>, t<sub>32S</sub>) and for P-polarization (r<sub>12P</sub>, t<sub>12P</sub>, r<sub>21P</sub>, t<sub>21P</sub>, r<sub>23P</sub>, t<sub>23P</sub>, r<sub>32P</sub>, t<sub>32P</sub>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the Jones vector of an incident beam is:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>

Preferably, the polarizing element <b>20</b> has a substantially flat surface. Such an arrangement can be seen, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i></figref>, in which the polarizing element <b>20</b> arranged in the path of light beams <b>11</b> coming from the image display device <b>1</b> and passed through a linear polarizer <b>19</b> is configured so that its polarization axis varies from point to point and accordingly, the polarization axes of the transmitted light beams <b>11</b> also vary according to the exit positions of the light beams <b>11</b>. Thus, in this example, the light beams <b>11</b> passed through the polarizing element <b>20</b> will be linearly polarized light beams with different polarization axes, which, depending on the design of the reflecting element <b>3</b> (see below), reach the different points of the surfaces <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting element <b>3</b> as purely S-polarized or purely P-polarized beams.
