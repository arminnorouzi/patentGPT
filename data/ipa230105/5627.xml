More particularly, the present embodiments relate to molten salt reactors that utilize passive cooling systems to prevent or decrease the probability of a potential complete or partial core collapse.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern nuclear reactors utilize physical principles of fission nuclear chain reactions and/or nuclear fusion reactions to generate heat. The generated heat may be used for a variety of purposes, such as electricity generation and/or heat transfer. In particular, the heat is generated at a reactor core, which contains a fissile material. Once a criticality is reached, the fissile material undergoes nuclear fission and emits heat and nuclear particles, such as free neutrons. Some of these emitted nuclear particles may further be absorbed by other fissile atoms, thereby causing a nuclear chain reaction. To avoid a runaway nuclear chain reaction, which may cause a reactor core collapse, coolant may be circulated to cool the reactor core, thereby moderating the nuclear chain reaction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If the mechanisms that circulate the coolant become damaged, the cooling provided by the circulating coolant becomes ineffective. In such cases, this may result in runaway heating of the reactor core, reactor core collapse, and consequent breach of the containment structures. The general population may additionally be at risk due to the proliferation and spread of potentially dangerous radioactive materials escaping containment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reactor designs, such as Generation III/IV reactor designs, are intended to reduce the probabilities of core meltdown and breach. However, these reactor designs rely on active cooling systems, where a mechanical pump or a similar device acts to remove heat from a nuclear system. If the mechanical pump fails, therefore, a catastrophic reactor core collapse may result.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a closed-vessel molten salt reactor (cvMSR) is provided.

In some cases, heat generated from the nuclear fission chain reaction may heat a fluid surrounding the moveable container, thereby creating a heated fluid, and the heated fluid may move toward the number of hollow chambers of the cover to be transported along the number of hollow chambers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reference will now be made to representative embodiments illustrated in the accompanying figures.

A closed-vessel nuclear reactor as described herein can be defined by an interior volume into which fissile material can be disposed. A first internal surface (e.g., an internal sidewall that may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;moderator surface&#x201d;) of the closed-vessel nuclear reactor can be formed from and/or with graphite or other moderator material and a second internal surface opposite the first surface (e.g., another internal sidewall that may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;control surface&#x201d;) can be formed from and/or with boron carbide (or other borates) as a control material that absorbs neutrons.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As a result of this construction, adjusting a position and/or orientation of the closed-vessel nuclear reactor is all that is required to control reaction speed or, alternatively, to terminate the reaction. In particular, when the closed-vessel nuclear reactor is oriented such that the fissile material contacts a moderator surface, fission reaction within the closed-vessel nuclear reactor can be moderated to an implementation specific degree. In addition, when the closed-vessel nuclear reactor is oriented such that the fissile material contacts the control surface, the reaction may be stopped. In this manner, by controlling an orientation of the closed-vessel nuclear reactor, the reaction therein can be effectively moderated and/or terminated entirely. In some embodiments, an &#x201c;upright&#x201d; orientation refers to an orientation of a closed-vessel nuclear reactor in which a fission reaction therein is moderated and/or otherwise controlled and an &#x201c;inverted&#x201d; orientation refers to an orientation of the same reactor in which the fission reaction is controlled to a point of potentially stopping the reaction entirely.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The output heat can be used to heat one or more fluids or gases (e.g., air, helium, CO2 as examples), which in turn can, in some constructions, be leveraged to drive a turbine to generate electricity. In other cases, the output heat can be used as a direct resource, for example to heat a home or building or for a manufacturing purpose.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some cases, output heat can be used to change a position of the reactor itself, thereby moderating the reaction. For example, in some embodiments, a closed-vessel nuclear reactor can be supported by a movable structure that selectively expands when heated to a certain degree. The structure can be formed/architected such that expansion due to heat tilts or otherwise reorients the closed-vessel nuclear reactor in order to slow the reaction contained therein, thereby reducing output heat. As output heat is reduced, the structure may contract, which in turn may reorient the closed-vessel nuclear reactors and augment reaction speed again.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, a closed-vessel nuclear reactor as described herein can be additively manufactured either on-site or in a manufacturing facility. In a more simple phrasing, an enclosure of a closed-vessel nuclear reactor as described herein can be 3D printed. More specifically, control materials/surface and/or moderator materials/surface can be printed and thereafter submitted to curing or finishing conditions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some constructions, a closed-vessel nuclear reactor can be wrapped in carbon fiber tow and high temperature epoxy for strengthening purposes. In some constructions, the epoxy material can be doped with an absorbent material such as boron or tungsten to shield radiation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The foregoing examples are not exhaustive; more generally and broadly, described herein is a nuclear reactor and, more specifically, a closed-vessel molten salt reactor (cvMSR) as a type of nuclear fission reactor. In many embodiments, a cvMSR as described herein has a structure that facilitates passive cooling of a molten salt mixture and includes fail-safe structures, such as glass-forming frit additives positioned below a suspended container of the cvMSR, and ceramic structures designed to moderate, suspend, and/or prevent a nuclear and/or chemical reaction. The cvMSR may additionally be rotatable to agitate, cool, and/or heat the salt/fissile material mixture.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Conventional nuclear reactors, such as Generation III/W (&#x201c;Gen III/W&#x201d;) reactors, are used to initiate and control a fission nuclear chain reaction. In order to provide cooling for such reactors, one or more pumps may be used to circulate water, or another coolant, past a reactor core to absorb heat generated by the reactor core.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, in the event of a core collapse, one or more pumps may cause generation of a jet of water, or other coolant, to the reactor core to quickly cool a reactor core in the hopes of avoiding core collapse. In the event of a power outage, backup generators may engage to activate the one or more pumps. However, active systems may still fail at a number of levels such as, but not limited to, complete power outage of both primary and backup systems, broken equipment (e.g., pumps), corrosion, cross-contamination, and so on.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, conventional cooling systems comprise a large, and complex, arrangement of pipes for transporting coolant. Having a large number of pipes within a cooling system introduces additional points of failure as pipes may corrode, may be blocked, and so on. Furthermore, such arrangements may be extremely costly in design efforts, construction, and maintenance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the event of a core collapse, or near-core collapse, conventional cooling mechanisms may further act to destroy the reactor core. For example, if a large amount of water were applied to a malfunctioning reactor core, the water and/or heat may destroy internal components of the reactor core, necessitating a complete replacement. Such replacement may be extremely costly, even if a core collapse is avoided.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments described herein generally reference a closed-vessel molten salt reactor (cvMSR). The cvMSR contains a solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials, in which a nuclear fission reaction may occur at low pressures (e.g., atmospheric pressure). The solution of fissile material and/or salt materials is heated at, or around, 500&#xb0; C. to melt the salts and initiate the chain reaction through a nuclear fission reaction. Once initiated, the chain reaction continues and causes heating of a surrounding fluid (e.g., a fluid external to a container containing the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials). The term &#x201c;fluid,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to any liquid or gas, including supercritical states. According to some disclosed embodiments, a surrounding fluid may be air, though other fluids, such as other gas mixtures, water, other liquids, and so on, may be used as a surrounding fluid. The heated surrounding fluid may then be used for any number of purposes, such as heating a building and/or area, producing steam for producing electricity, and so on and may be transported to a customer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cvMSR may additionally be both suspended, rotatable, and moveable, within an enclosed chamber, with the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials provided within the cvMSR. As the cvMSR rotates, the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials may be agitated to propagate the chain reaction and to heat the walls of the cvMSR, thereby providing heat. Such heat may then be removed from the exterior surface of the closed reactor vessel by circulating a heat transfer material around the exterior of the closed reactor vessel. The heat may then be used for any number of purposes, such as heating a building/area and/or producing steam for energy generation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials may be formed from any number of materials, such as thorium, uranium, plutonium, lithium-beryllium fluoride, lithium fluoride, uranium tetrafluoride, and so on. In some cases, the salt materials consist of lithium and beryllium fluoride salts and the fissile materials comprise low-enriched uranium fluorides. The salt materials may be solid under a threshold temperature (e.g., 500&#xb0; C.) and may liquify within a range of about 500&#xb0; C.-1400&#xb0; C., at pressures around atmospheric pressure. Though the salt materials may be liquid through the range of about 500&#xb0; C.-1400&#xb0; C., an operating range of the cvMSR may be from about 550&#xb0; C.-1000&#xb0; C., or may be any range within a temperature range at which the salt materials are liquid (e.g., to avoid high temperatures). As the salt materials melt, the fissile materials may engage in a nuclear fission chain reaction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In embodiments described herein, fission materials and/or salt materials may be added to the cvMSR through the use of input/exhaust ports and waste materials/gas (e.g., xenon gas) may be removed from the cvMSR through the input/exhaust ports. The input/exhaust ports may be located at both ends of the cvMSR. In some embodiments, input/exhaust ports on a first end are used to introduce material/gases to the cvMSR and input/exhausts ports on a second end, opposite from the first end, are used to remove material/gases from the cvMSR.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cvMSR may be recycled from pre-fabricated containers (e.g., an ISO shipping container) or may be manufactured specifically for use as a cvMSR. The cvMSR may be hollow, so as to contain the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials, and may be shaped as a rectangular-cuboid, though the cvMSR may have any shape. In addition, the cvMSR may have a tunnel that extends through a length of the cvMSR. As discussed below, the cvMSR may additionally include corrugations on both internal and external portions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The corrugations may act to agitate a surrounding fluid outside of the cvMSR, as described above, and a solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials within the cvMSR. In addition, the corrugations may act as a heat sink and may transfer heat with respect to an internal volume of the cvMSR and an external volume surrounding the cvMSR.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Ceramic tiles and/or ceramic elements may additionally be provided on an interior surface of the cvMSR. In some cases, thermo-ceramic coatings are provided on an interior surface of the cvMSR. Additionally or alternatively, different forms of ceramic tile may be affixed to different interior surfaces. For example, a first ceramic may be affixed to one internal wall and may act as a fission catalyst. Additionally or alternatively, a second ceramic may be affixed to a different internal wall to moderate or halt a fission process. Ceramics may include any type of ceramics such as boron ceramics, graphite ceramics, and so on.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the potential event that the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials overheats, the cvMSR may be rotated and/or rocked (either manually or automatically) such that the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials comes into contact with a ceramic that inhibits a fission reaction. In this way, a chain reaction may be stopped or slowed to achieve a particular temperature.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To restart the reaction, the cvMSR may be rotated to an original position (e.g., in contact with a ceramic that acts as a catalyst for a nuclear reaction) and associated resistive heaters may add heat to the system. As the term is used herein, rocking may refer to rotation of the cvMSR back-and-forth at or below 180&#xb0; from a starting position, where the starting position is defined as a position of the cvMSR where criticality is at a maximum level.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">An additional failsafe may be provided in the event that the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials melts, or otherwise breaches, the cvMSR. Glass-forming frit additives may be provided beneath the cvMSR and may, with the addition of a molten solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials, melt into a borosilicate or phosphate glass, thereby neutralizing radioactive materials and preventing further fission.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additional details of a cvMSR are provided herein. Through the use of such a cvMSR, a safety of a molten salt fission reaction may be improved even with a low-cost system. The cvMSR additionally provides the benefits of, for example, being resistant to geological activity (e.g., earthquakes) and of being rotatable (e.g., configured to rock at or below 180&#xb0; from a starting position) to control a fission reaction and/or a temperature output (e.g., a temperature of air or other fluid surrounding a suspended container of an cvMSR). As discussed herein, the cvMSR may be any type of reactor, including a breeder reactor and/or a burner reactor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>10</b></figref>.

The enclosure <b>102</b> may additionally comprise additives, such as concrete additives, that prevent leakage of radioactive material from the containment room and/or the suspended container <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The trench depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, therefore, may be created by digging into the ground, by removing soil <b>104</b>, and by pouring or otherwise placing a material such as concrete into the hole. In this way, the enclosure <b>102</b> may be provided within the ground and may be surrounded by soil <b>104</b>. While the enclosure <b>102</b> is described as being surrounded by soil <b>104</b>, it is appreciated that any enclosure <b>102</b> may be used and may be provided anywhere above, on, or below a surface of the Earth. In some cases, the enclosure <b>102</b> is formed as a concrete rectangular-cuboid and has a height between <b>8</b> and <b>50</b> feet, though any height, material, or shape may be used, based on space constraints, client needs, and/or desired heating capabilities.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain cases, the enclosure <b>102</b> may be positioned within or on top of a manmade structure and/or building, presuming the manmade structure and/or building is of sufficient structural strength and possesses sufficient safety considerations.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the cover <b>122</b> may have a number of hollow chambers/voids that run across a length of the cover <b>122</b>. During an operation of the cvMSR <b>100</b>, hot air, or other suitable fluids (e.g., liquids or gases), surrounding the cvMSR <b>100</b> may be produced (e.g., hot air within the enclosure <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the hot air rises, it may be captured within the hollow chambers of the cover <b>122</b>. The hollow chambers may transport the hot air across a length/width of the cover <b>122</b> and may provide the hot air at an edge of the cover <b>122</b>. The hot air may then be provided to ducting and/or transport structures to heat an area and/or to produce steam when applied to a reservoir of water. Described generally, the hot air may travel along the cover <b>122</b> and may be provided to a customer to, for example, provide heat to particular systems, such as a Brayton turbine. The cover <b>122</b> may have a thickness of around <b>18</b> inches (in.), though any thickness may be provided. While the term &#x201c;hot air&#x201d; is used above, it is noted that the fluid surrounding the cvMSR <b>100</b> is not limited to air and may include any gas (e.g., carbon dioxide) or liquid (e.g., water).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a suspended container <b>106</b> may be suspended within the trench defined by the enclosure <b>102</b>. Any manner of suspension may be used to suspend the suspended container <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, a chain, such as a stud link or open link chain, affixes the suspended container <b>106</b> to walls of the enclosure. In such cases, the chain may be affixed to a front, side, top, bottom, and so on, wall of the suspended container <b>106</b>. Instead of, or in addition to, chains, other suspension materials, such as ropes, wire, woven materials such as carbon fiber materials, and so on, may be used to suspend the suspended container <b>106</b>. Alternatively or additionally, end portions of the suspended container may be coupled to a rotating mechanism (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A glass <b>120</b> and/or glass-forming frit additives may be provided at a bottom portion of the enclosure <b>102</b>. The glass <b>120</b> may be any glass capable of neutralizing radioactive wastes (e.g., high-level radioactive wastes HLW) such as borosilicate glass and/or phosphate glass. In the event that a molten salt breaches outer layers of the suspended container <b>106</b>, gravity may direct the molten salt toward the glass <b>120</b>. Through the process of vitrification, the molten salt may melt the glass <b>120</b>, which may then be reformed once cooled. As the glass <b>120</b> may neutralize a fission chain reaction, the glass <b>120</b> may be used as a failsafe to contain/neutralize any radioactive material, thereby preventing additional chain reactions from occurring, in the event that the suspended container <b>106</b> is breached.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The suspended container <b>106</b> may include various corrugated surfaces, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>. Various kinds of corrugation may be provided, including corrugations with different patterns. For example, a first corrugation <b>112</b><i>a </i>may comprise horizontal corrugations where the corrugations extend across a length of the suspended container <b>106</b>. The second corrugation <b>112</b><i>b </i>may comprise vertical corrugations where the corrugations extend across a width of the suspended container <b>106</b>. Similarly, corrugations within an internal tunnel <b>108</b> may be formed from horizontal corrugations, vertical corrugations, any combination thereof, and so on.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The corrugations <b>112</b><i>a</i>,<b>112</b><i>b </i>may act as turbulence-producing elements and may agitate a fluid surrounding the suspended container <b>106</b>. In some cases, the fluid surrounding the suspended container <b>106</b> is air, though other fluids, such as water, may be used in addition or as an alternative fluid. By agitating the surrounding fluid, a heat transfer between the suspended container <b>106</b> and the surrounding fluid may be increased. Additionally, the corrugations <b>112</b><i>a</i>,<b>112</b><i>b </i>may act as a heat sink and may provide increased surface area for a heat transfer between the suspended container <b>106</b> and the surrounding fluid. In some cases, the corrugations are specifically tailored for the purposes of acting as a heat sink or agitating a fluid. For example, some corrugations may include elongated fins while others may include a number of peaks and valleys.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The corrugations <b>112</b><i>a</i>,<b>112</b><i>b </i>may additionally mechanically strengthen the suspended container <b>106</b>, such that the side-walls of the suspended container <b>106</b> are resistant to potential deforming forces.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The suspended container <b>106</b> may have a main body formed from a metallic material, such as a stainless steel.

Ceramic tiles may be affixed to internal surfaces of the suspended container <b>106</b>, such as internal surfaces depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The ceramic tiles may be made with certain specifications and may be formed with materials such as boron or graphite.

Thermo-ceramic coatings may be used in additional or alternative cases.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Heating elements <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b</i>, such as resistive heaters, may additionally be provided along a length of the suspended container <b>106</b>. The heating elements <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b </i>may be used to introduce heat to the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials, so as to melt the salt materials into molten salt, and to provide conditions where a fission chain reaction may occur. As noted above, a certain temperature, such as 500&#xb0; C., may be necessary to melt the salt materials and, accordingly, the heating elements <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b </i>may heat the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials to that temperature. Though the heating elements <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b </i>are described as resistive heaters, any type of heating element may be used including ceramic heaters, conductive heaters, and so on.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a first heating element <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be positioned on a corner opposite from the second heating element <b>110</b><i>b</i>.

This may permit quick and steady heating of the solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials. Once the level of criticality necessary to initiate a fission reaction occurs, both the first heating element <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the second heating element <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be turned off. Either the first heating element <b>110</b><i>a </i>or the second heating element <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be re-activated when a temperature begins to decrease, as may be detected by one or more temperature sensors.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A number of input/exhaust ports <b>114</b> may additionally be provided to introduce new materials (e.g., fuel/a solution of fissile materials and/or salt materials) and/or to exhaust waste materials such as gases (e.g., xenon, hydrogen, krypton, and so on).

As described above, the suspended container <b>306</b> may be rotated during operations of the cvMSR <b>300</b> for a variety of purposes. For example, during a cold start process when a salt mixture <b>324</b> is solid (e.g., at or around atmospheric pressure and/or below about 500&#xb0; C.), at least one of heating elements <b>310</b><i>a</i>,<b>310</b><i>b </i>may be activated to provide heat to the salt mixture <b>324</b>. To increase a rate of heat transfer from the heating elements <b>310</b><i>a</i>,<b>310</b><i>b </i>to the salt mixture <b>324</b>, the suspended container <b>306</b> may be rotated such that one heating element (e.g., heating element <b>310</b><i>a</i>) is submerged underneath the salt mixture <b>324</b>. The suspended container <b>306</b> may be rocked back-and-forth to agitate the salt mixture <b>324</b> and to ensure different portions of the salt mixture <b>324</b> come into contact with at least one heating element <b>310</b><i>a</i>,<b>310</b><i>b</i>. Internal walls of the suspended container <b>306</b> may additionally be corrugated to both provide increased structural stability and to agitate the salt mixture <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some cases, to agitate the salt mixture <b>324</b> the suspended container <b>306</b> is rocked back-and-forth at or below 180&#xb0; from a starting position. As described above, this rocking process may agitate the salt mixture <b>324</b> to ensure even heating and/or to ensure that the salt mixture <b>324</b> has a consistent consistency and/or material concentration throughout.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the salt mixture <b>324</b> heats up to a certain temperature (e.g., 500&#xb0; C.), the salt mixture <b>324</b> may change state (e.g., from a solid to a liquid) or may otherwise begin a nuclear fission chain reaction. The fissile materials may be dissolved within the salt mixture <b>324</b>. Once criticality is reached, fission may occur (e.g., by releasing neutrons from unstable atomic nucleuses, thereby initiating a chain reaction when the neutrons interact with other nucleuses). Once the reaction is capable of being sustained (e.g., via a chain reaction), one or more of the heating elements <b>310</b><i>a</i>,<b>310</b><i>b </i>may be deactivated. The heating elements <b>310</b><i>a</i>,<b>310</b><i>b </i>may be periodically reactivated when heat is required in the system. A temperature of the reaction may be limited by chemical principles (e.g., limited to a value of 1300 &#xb0; C.), though an operating temperature of the reaction may be set lower (e.g., anywhere between 500&#xb0; C.-1300 &#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The cvMSR <b>300</b> may operate under epithermal or fast neutron spectrums and a variety of mixtures may be used as the salt mixture <b>324</b>, including mixtures with fluorides, radioactive isotopes, actinides, any combination thereof, and so on. A breeding ratio of the cvMSR <b>300</b> may be established at any value. If the breeding ratio is less than <b>1</b>, additional fuel for the salt mixture <b>324</b> may be periodically provided through the input/exhaust ports <b>314</b>. Even in cases where the breeding ratio is greater than or equal to 1 (e.g., when the cvMSR <b>300</b> generates more fissile material than it consumes), additional fuel or other materials may be provided to the salt mixture <b>324</b> through the input/exhaust ports <b>314</b>. In some cases, gases, such as hydrogen or natural gases, are injected into the suspended container <b>306</b> through the input/exhaust ports <b>314</b> to, for example, raise temperatures and/or increase stability. It is additionally noted that a top surface of the salt mixture <b>324</b> may be below or above any of the input/exhaust ports <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The input/exhaust ports <b>314</b> may additionally remove gases generated during criticality, such as xenon or other gases that may be detrimental to fission criticality, that are not reabsorbed immediately into the salt mixture <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the event of a core collapse (e.g., when the salt mixture <b>324</b> becomes too hot and/or experiences a runaway event), walls of the suspended container <b>306</b> may be at risk of melting or degradation. In some cases, a potential core collapse may be detected when a temperature of the cvMSR <b>300</b> reaches a threshold temperature (e.g., 1300 &#xb0; C.). In such cases, the suspended container <b>306</b> may be controllable to rotate to agitate the salt mixture <b>324</b>, thereby releasing heat. Additionally or alternatively, internal walls of the suspended container <b>306</b> may be provided with a ceramic layer designed to moderate, or stop, a fission reaction. For example, one internal wall of the suspended container <b>306</b> may be coated with a ceramic (e.g., graphite) that acts as a moderator (e.g., converting a fast neutron fission reaction to a epithermal fission reaction). Another internal wall may be coated with a ceramic (e.g., a borate) to cool a rate at which a fission reaction occurs. By rotating the suspended container <b>306</b>, the salt mixture <b>324</b> may come into contact with one or more of the ceramic coatings, thereby affecting a rate of fission. In some cases, an internal wall is coated with a ceramic designed to induce, or catalyze, a fission reaction. Additionally, though ceramic coatings (e.g., through spray depositions) are described, any ceramic may be used to cover an internal wall of the suspended container <b>306</b>, including ceramic tiles, ceramic laminates, and so on. If the internal ceramics fail to cool the salt mixture <b>324</b> sufficiently, a glass <b>320</b> (e.g., a borosilicate glass) may be provided underneath the suspended container <b>306</b> as an additional failsafe. If the salt mixture <b>324</b> melts, or otherwise escapes, the suspended container <b>306</b>, gravity will cause the salt mixture <b>324</b> to come into contact with the glass <b>320</b>. According to particular properties of the glass <b>320</b>, the fission reaction may be neutralized, thereby preventing a runaway chain reaction.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, an internal tunnel <b>308</b> may be provided that extends through the suspended container <b>306</b>. The internal tunnel <b>308</b> may additionally be corrugated, both on an internal and an external wall, and an internal wall of the internal tunnel <b>308</b> (e.g., a wall on an interior cavity) may be provided with a ceramic layer similarly as discussed above. In some cases, the internal wall of the internal tunnel <b>308</b> is not provided with a ceramic layer in contrast to an internal wall of the outer suspended container <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">An enclosure <b>302</b>, such as a concrete enclosure, may be positioned underground and may be surrounded by soil <b>304</b>. A cover <b>322</b> may be positioned on top of the enclosure <b>302</b> and may have a number of voids/channels configured to transport hot air along a length of the cover <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is further noted that the corrugations on the suspended container <b>306</b> may additionally agitate a fluid surrounding an external volume surrounding the suspended container <b>306</b>. Heat generated from the salt mixture <b>324</b> may be transferred (e.g., via a heat transfer process) to the external fluid (e.g., air) and the external fluid may become superheated. This superheated fluid may be transported along the cover <b>322</b> through the channels and may be provided to a client (e.g., as used in energy generation and/or heating). Though the surrounding fluid is described as air, any fluid may be used, including another gas or a liquid such as water.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a tilting operation of a suspended container.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a suspended container may have a first state <b>406</b><i>a </i>where a horizontal axis is substantially parallel to a cover <b>422</b> and/or substantially perpendicular to a sidewall of an enclosure <b>402</b>. To maximize criticality and/or to agitate an internal salt mixture, the suspended container may be tilted to a second state <b>406</b><i>b</i>. A transition between the first state <b>406</b><i>a </i>and the second state <b>406</b><i>b </i>may occur at any rate.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additionally, the suspended container may oscillate between the first state <b>406</b><i>a </i>and the second state <b>406</b><i>b</i>, either quickly or slowly, to maximize a criticality of a salt mixture and/or to agitate the salt mixture. As noted above with respect to rotating processes, during a tilting process, a top surface of the salt mixture may be below, above, or at input/exhaust ports at all times during the tilting process. A mechanical mechanism (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) may be used to tilt the suspended container. In some cases, the same mechanism that rotates the suspended container may additionally tilt the suspended container. In other cases, specialized mechanisms configured to only perform one function (e.g., tilting or rotation) may be provided.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">An enclosure <b>402</b>, such as a concrete enclosure, may be positioned underground and may be surrounded by soil <b>404</b>.

A glass <b>420</b> may be provided underneath the suspended container and may neutralize a salt mixture, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some cases, the suspended container may be tilted between various states (e.g., a first state <b>406</b><i>a </i>and a second state <b>406</b><i>b</i>) to inject and/or remove materials and/or gases into or from a salt mixture. For example, the suspended container may be tilted such that a surface of the salt mixture is below, above, or at a particular input/exhaust port. Gases (e.g., helium) from a storage container may be injected into the salt mixture to purge, or otherwise remove, gases from the salt mixture (e.g., xenon). The purged gases may be removed from the suspended container by exiting through any input/exhaust port described herein.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a cvMSR <b>500</b> and an associated airflow circulation around the cvMSR <b>500</b>, as depicted by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A first duct <b>534</b><i>a </i>and a second duct <b>534</b><i>b </i>may connect a first fan <b>532</b><i>a </i>and a second fan <b>532</b><i>b </i>to an internal cavity defined by the enclosure <b>502</b>.

As the air enters the enclosure <b>502</b>, the suspended container <b>506</b> (and, in particular, corrugations of the suspended container <b>506</b>) may agitate the air such that an airflow is produced around the suspended container <b>506</b> and/or through the internal tunnel <b>508</b> of the suspended container. Heat generated by a salt mixture contained within the suspended container <b>506</b> may be transferred to the air or other gases surrounding the suspended container <b>506</b> through, for example, conductive heat transfer. A rate of heat transfer may be increased by an increased surface area of the suspended container <b>506</b> (e.g., through corrugations on a surface of the suspended container <b>506</b> and/or by the presence of the internal tunnel <b>508</b>), by a material of the suspended container <b>506</b> (e.g., a metal or a ceramic), by an airflow rate, and so on.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Due to the heat transfer, the airflow surrounding the suspended container <b>506</b> may become hotter and may begin to rise toward the cover <b>522</b>. Channels/voids within the cover may receive the heated air and may transport the heated air for use in other operations (e.g., heating a property or generating steam for energy production).
