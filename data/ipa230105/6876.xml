Among other impairments, nonlinearity and memory effects can cause severe spectral regrowth. Spectral regrowth significantly degrades the signal quality due to high out-of-band power. Memory effects cause asymmetricity in transmitted signals. These impairments become more severe and complicated in current and next-generation wireless systems where wide bandwidths, high frequencies, high power, and high-order modulation are used. Moreover, in an edge device of 5G communication systems, both the high transmission power and the limited supply voltage can worsen the non-linearity of RF circuits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The existing RF circuits in wireless communication systems can be further improved to benefit operators and users.

However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description. It will be appreciated, however, by one skilled in the art, that the invention may be practiced without such specific details. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the included descriptions, will be able to implement appropriate functionality without undue experimentation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the invention provide an artificial-intelligent (AI) based method and system to compensate for impairments caused by an RF communication circuit; e.g., an RF transmitter (Tx) circuit, an RF receiver (Rx) circuit, etc. The RF communication circuit described herein includes multiple RF circuit components; e.g., filters, mixers, local oscillators, RF amplifiers, baseband amplifiers. These RF circuit components cause multiple types of signal impairments such as I-Q gain asymmetry, frequency-dependent I-Q mismatch (FDIQ), frequency-independent I-Q mismatch (FIIQ), nonlinearity, direct current (DC) offset, etc. Calibrating each of these circuit components independently is not only time-consuming but also inefficient due to the large amount of calibration data needed. Furthermore, per-component calibration may produce a local optimization for each component, but the aggregation of the local optimizations may not produce a global optimization for the entire RF communication circuit.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The AI-based method and system disclosed herein utilize neural networks to compensate for the aforementioned impairments. Initially, an emulator neural network is trained to emulate the characteristics of a multi-component RF communication circuit. For an RF Tx circuit (also referred to as &#x201c;Tx circuit&#x201d;), a compensator neural network is connected to an input end of the trained emulator neural network and is trained to compensate for the impairments caused by the Tx circuit. For an RF Rx circuit (also referred to as &#x201c;Rx circuit&#x201d;), a compensator neural network is connected to an output end of the trained emulator neural network and is trained to compensate for the impairments caused by the Rx circuit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description unless otherwise stated, a signal that includes both an in-phase signal component and a quadrature signal component is represented by an upper-case letter. Each of the in-phase signal component and the quadrature signal component is represented by a lower-case letter. For example, signal X=x(I)+x(Q), and signal V=v(I)+v(Q). Furthermore, to simplify the notations, an analog signal and its corresponding digital signal are represented by the same letter. For example, digital signal Z after the digital-to-analog conversion is still represented by Z, and analog signal V after the analog-to-digital conversion is still represented by V.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an RF communication assembly <b>180</b> according to one embodiment.

Thus, the multi-objective loss function may include a frequency-domain loss such as the MAE between the STFT of x and the STFT of {circumflex over (x)}, where STFT stands for Short Time Fourier Transform which is applied on both x and {circumflex over (x)}.
