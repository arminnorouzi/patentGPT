The PSS and the SSS are mainly used to help user equipment (UE) identify a cell and synchronize with the cell. The PBCH includes most-basic system information, for example, a system frame number or intra-frame timing information. The UE cannot access the cell unless the UE successfully receives the synchronization signal block.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two types of SSBs are defined in NR. One is a cell-defining (CD) SSB, and is referred to as a CD-SSB for short, and the other is a non-cell-defining SSB (NCD) SSB, and is referred to as an NCD-SSB for short. The NCD-SSB indicates a frequency domain position of the CD-SSB. Generally, in one frequency domain bandwidth, NR may support a plurality of SSBs but support only one CD-SSB. Data transmission is performed in a cell by using a frequency domain position of a CD-SSB. This manner limits a coverage area of the cell.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application provides a synchronization signal block determining method and a related apparatus, so that a terminal device can determine a second SSB based on a detected first SSB, and the second SSB may be considered as a backup SSB for the first SSB.

The association in this application may also be referred to as mapping, corresponding, or relating. That there is a QCL relationship between two signals indicates that the two signals may use one or more of a same delay spread, a same Doppler spread, a same average gain, a same average delay, a same spatial domain parameter sending or receiving signal, or a same beam used to send or receive a signal. A QCL relationship parameter may include one or more of a Doppler spread, a Doppler frequency shift, an average delay, a delay spread, and a space domain reception parameter. In a possible solution, the QCL relationship may be classified into four types: &#x201c;QCL-T eA&#x201d;: {Doppler frequency shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread}; &#x201c;QCL-T eB&#x201d;: {Doppler frequency shift, Doppler spread}; &#x201c;QCL-T eC&#x201d;: {Doppler frequency shift, average delay}; and &#x201c;QCL-T eD&#x201d;: {space domain reception parameter}. Generally, the QCL relationship parameter may be selected randomly, for example, the average gain and &#x201c;QCL-T eD&#x201d; are selected.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Beam: A beam in an NR protocol may be referred to as a spatial domain filter, a spatial filter, or a spatial parameter. A beam used to send a signal may be referred to as a transmission beam (Tx beam), or may be referred to as a spatial domain transmission filter or a spatial transmission parameter. A beam used to receive a signal may be referred to as a reception beam (Rx beam), or may be referred to as a spatial domain reception filter or a spatial reception parameter (spatial RX parameter).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The transmission beam may refer to distribution of signal strength formed in different directions in space after a signal is transmitted through an antenna, and the reception beam may refer to distribution of signal strength, in different directions in space, of a radio signal received from an antenna. In addition, the beam may be a wide beam, a narrow beam, or a beam of another type. A technology for forming the beam may be a beamforming technology or another technology. The beamforming technology may be specifically a digital beamforming technology, an analog beamforming technology, a hybrid digital/analog beamforming technology, or the like.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The beam generally corresponds to a resource or a signal. For example, during beam measurement, the network device measures different beams by using different resources, and the terminal device feeds back measured resource quality, so that the network device knows quality of a corresponding beam. During data transmission, beam information is also indicated through a resource corresponding to the beam information. For example, the network device indicates information about a PDSCH beam of the terminal device by using a resource in a transmission configuration indicator (TCI) in DCI.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Optionally, a plurality of beams that have a same communication feature or similar communication features are considered as one beam. One beam may include one or more antenna ports, configured to transmit a data channel, a control channel, a sounding signal, and the like. The one or more antenna ports forming the beam may also be considered as one antenna port set.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In embodiments of this application, unless otherwise specified, the beam is a transmission beam of the network device. During beam measurement, each beam of the network device corresponds to one resource. Therefore, an index of the resource may be used to uniquely identify a beam corresponding to the resource. The beam may be represented, in a standard, by using the QCL relationship. In embodiments of this application, a plurality of beams having the QCL relationship may be considered as one beam.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A system information block (SIB) includes system information. A cell may have a plurality of system information blocks, and these system information blocks carry different information, for example, a SIB 1. The SIB 1 mainly carries configuration information of some cells, for example, information related to random access, information related to a PDCCH, information related to other information blocks, information about a cell accessed by the UE, and identification information of the cell.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A synchronization signal block (SSB) may also be referred to as a synchronization signal/physical broadcast channel (synchronization signal/PBCH) block. The synchronization signal block may include one or more of a PBCH, a primary synchronization signal (PSS), and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS). The synchronization signal block may also be referred to as the SSB or the SS/PBCH block for short. The PBCH may include a main information block (MIB), PBCH content generated by a physical layer, and a demodulation reference signal of the PBCH.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Two types of SSBs are defined in 3GPP defined 5G New Radio (NR). One is a cell-defining (CD) SSB, referred to as a CD-SSB for short, and the other is a non-cell defining (NCD) SSB, referred to as an NCD-SSB for short. The NCD-SSB is not associated with the SIB 1, and therefore cannot define a cell. The NCD-SSB may indicate a frequency domain position of the CD-SSB. The terminal device may distinguish between the CD-SSB and the NCD-SSB based on a value of k<sub>SSB</sub>. For example, when the value of k<sub>SSB </sub>ranges from o to 11, the SSB is a CD-SSB; and when the value of k<sub>SSB </sub>is 12, 13, or 15, the SSB is an NCD-SSB.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following describes an SSB transmission mode in an existing technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of accessing a cell by a terminal device according to an embodiment of this application. First, a terminal device blindly detects an SSB in a specific bandwidth. After detecting a CD-SSB, the terminal device receives MIB information carried in the CD-SSB. The MIB information includes a CORESET time-frequency position indication of a SIB 1 and another indication (for example, a sub-carrier spacing). The terminal device receives a CORESET of the SIB 1 based on the CORESET time-frequency position indication of the SIB 1. The CORESET of the SIB 1 includes a PDCCH of the SIB 1. The PDCCH of the SIB 1 indicates related information such as a PDSCH position and a modulation and coding scheme of the SIB 1. The terminal device receives a PDSCH based on an indication of the PDCCH. In NR, the PDCCH of the SIB 1 and the PDSCH of the SIB 1 correspond to a same sub-carrier spacing. Generally, if the terminal device finds a CD-SSB, the terminal device camps on a cell corresponding to the CD-SSB (or if the terminal device finds a plurality of CD-SSBs, the terminal device may choose to camp on a cell corresponding to one CD-SSB). If the terminal device finds an NCD-SSB, the terminal determines, based on a value of Kssb, that the SSB is an NCD-SSB; and if no associated SIB 1 is found, the terminal device continues to detect a CD-SSB. It can be learned that, in an existing technology, one cell corresponds to one CD-SSB, and a coverage area of the cell is affected by communication quality of the CD-SSB and a noise signal in the environment.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Based on the network architecture, the terminal device, and the network device described in the foregoing content, the following describes an SSB transmission method provided in embodiments of this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of an SSB determining method according to an embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">S<b>101</b>. A terminal device detects a first synchronization signal block (SSB).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The first SSB is a CD-SSB. In other words, the first SSB is associated with a SIB 1, and may define a cell.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Specifically, a frequency domain position of the first SSB belongs to a global synchronization channel number (GSCN) or a synchronization raster (sync raster). It should be noted that there is a series of GSCNs in NR, and each GSCN corresponds to one frequency domain position. A frequency domain range of the GSCN is 24.25 GHz to 100 GHz. Starting from 24.2508 GHz, one raster is set every 17.28 MHz. There are a total of 4384 rasters, and indexes are 0 to 4383. For a frequency range above 52.6 GHz, a bandwidth of the frequency range may be greater than or equal to 5 GHz, and 5000/17.28=290. As a result, existing data bits fail to indicate all synchronization rasters in one frequency band, and other positions are non-synchronization rasters or non-GSCNs. Refer to Table 1.

If the frequency domain position of the second SSB belongs to the GSCN, in a process of blindly detecting the SSB, a terminal device A may detect the first SSB, a terminal device B may detect the second SSB, the terminal device A determines a cell by using the first SSB, and the terminal device B determines another cell by using the second SSB. In other words, if the frequency domain position of the second SSB belongs to the GSCN, two cells may be determined by using the first SSB and the second SSB. Therefore, the frequency domain position of the second SSB does not belong to the GSCN. In this manner, another terminal device can be prevented from detecting the second SSB, so that a problem that the cell corresponding to the first SSB is different from the cell corresponding to the second SSB is not generated.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">In some embodiments, the first SSB and the second SSB corresponding to a same time index have a quasi co-location (QCL) relationship. Specifically, the same time index may indicate a same symbol position or a same slot position. That there is a quasi co-location (QCL) relationship between the first SSB and the second SSB indicates that the first SSB and the second SSB may use one or more of a same delay spread, a same Doppler spread, a same average gain, a same average delay, a same spatial domain parameter sending or receiving signal, or a same beam used to send or receive a signal. In this manner, the terminal device can receive information about the first SSB and the second SSB.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">In some embodiments, the method in this embodiment of this application may also be applied to transmission of a common physical downlink control channel. The common physical downlink control channel includes a physical downlink control channel for the system information, a physical downlink control channel for a paging message, and a physical downlink control channel for a random access response. Positions of a plurality of common physical downlink control channels may be configured by using the system information.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and the foregoing descriptions, it can be learned that in this embodiment of this application, the terminal device may find the second SSB based on a detected first SSB. The second SSB may be considered as a backup SSB for the first SSB.
