This is due to the pivot door design. This relative motion, however, creates wear and damage to the S-hook. The S-hook is a safety critical component of a TRAS primary lock. The robustness of the lock, however, is compromised by this wear.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">US 2020/0063474 A1 describes a locking mechanism for a thrust reverser door which uses an S-shaped locking member comprising respective locking hooks arranged at the opposed arms of the locking member. A pivot is arranged between the arms of the locking member, around whose axis the locking member rotates. A coupling is provided for coupling the locking member to an actuator for rotating the locking member around the pivot axis. The S-shaped locking member therefore pivots about a point in the middle of the S-shaped hook.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A catch is described herein for use in a locking mechanism, and in particular a latch-type locking mechanism, the catch comprises a catching portion and a retaining portion.

In use, the catch receives the latch to lock the mechanism and releases the latch to unlock the mechanism. Latching mechanisms which use an S-shaped locking member as the latch have a hook at either end of the S-shaped locking member and so use two catches, each of which receives one of the hooks that is provided at either end of the S-shaped locking member.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A known catch <b>10</b> for use in a latching locking mechanism is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The catch <b>10</b> comprises two portions&#x2014;a catching portion <b>1</b> and a retaining portion <b>2</b>. The retaining portion <b>2</b> is configured to retain the catch in position relative to the component that it is locking. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the retaining portion is configured to be attached, or connected, in use, to whichever component is to be locked by the locking mechanism.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The catch <b>10</b> comprises, at the end that is furthest from the retaining portion <b>2</b>, the catching portion <b>1</b>, which in this example comprise a first barrel-shaped portion <b>1</b>, onto/around which the hook of an S-shaped locking member can latch or be released from. In use, a second catch <b>10</b> would be provided on a second component that is being locked together with a first component and the hooks of the S-shaped locking member would latch onto and engage with the catching portions <b>1</b> of each of the catches <b>10</b> and lock the two components together.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the retaining portion <b>2</b> of the known catch <b>10</b> is generally flat or at least shaped so as to match the surface of the section of the component to which the catch <b>10</b> is being retained/attached. These portions <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> of the catch are formed as one piece, that is, the retaining portion <b>2</b> of the catch cannot move relative to the catching portion <b>1</b>. Such known designs for locks are therefore rigid and do not allow any pivoting or reduction in relative motion with an S-hook when an s-hook is connected to the catching portion <b>1</b>. This is because the retaining portion <b>2</b> is not movable relative to the catching portion <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The new types of latching locking mechanisms described herein and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref> differ to this in the respect that they allow the catching portion of the catch itself to pivot relative to the retaining portion and therefore eliminate relative movement and resultant wear.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An example of a new type of latching locking mechanism <b>101</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The locking mechanism <b>101</b> comprises first and second catches <b>105</b> in combination with an S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> which functions as a latch in use, the hooks at either end of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> being received or released by each of the catches <b>105</b>. The S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> comprises respective first and second hooks <b>210</b> provided at the respective ends of opposed arms of the locking member <b>200</b>. The hooks <b>210</b> of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> engage with the first and second catches <b>105</b>, which are attached to and provided on the each of the components that are being locked together when the locking member <b>200</b> is in the locked position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, in a thrust reverser door system for an aircraft, bucket doors are installed after the nozzle of a jet engine and opened and closed like a clam shell. The upper and lower doors have catches on each corner and the locking member <b>200</b> engages with the catch on the corner of both the upper door and the lower door to lock them in position relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">These new catches <b>105</b> prevent wear on the locking mechanism by allowing the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> to pivot relative to the retaining portion <b>120</b> using a pivoting means. Since the retaining portion holds the catch <b>105</b> in position relative to the component being locked (either by being attached to the component itself, or held in place due to tensile force in use), the catch allows the catching portion <b>100</b> to pivot relative to the component <b>5</b> to which the catch <b>100</b> is attached. In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> the pivoting means comprises a spherical device. This eliminates relative motion at the catch/S-hook interface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An example of a new type of locking mechanism with such a pivoting means incorporated therein is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> and will now be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although in the examples described herein an S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> is used, the new catches <b>105</b> described herein are not limited to this and may be used with other latching members.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the retaining portion <b>120</b> of the new type of catch <b>105</b> may be retained in position relative to the component that is being locked, by being attached to the component <b>5</b>, such as a component of the thrust reverser doors of an aircraft as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In other examples, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>, the retaining member <b>120</b> holds the catch in position relative to the component, due to its contact with the surface of the component and the tensile force that is exerted on the catch <b>105</b> when the locking member <b>200</b> is hooked onto the catching portion <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The catch <b>105</b> comprises a catching portion <b>100</b> and a retaining portion <b>120</b>. In the same way as in the known mechanisms, at a first end, which, in use, is furthest away from the component <b>5</b> being locked, the catch <b>105</b> has a first, barrel shaped catching portion <b>110</b> for receiving and engaging with the hook <b>200</b> of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> in use. At its second end, which is closest to the component <b>5</b> being locked, the catching portion <b>100</b> is positioned and configured so as to be held within, and extend away from, a recess <b>125</b> of the retaining portion <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned briefly above, in contrast to the known latching mechanism as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the new catch <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> further comprises a pivoting means <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> which allows the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> to pivot relative to the retaining portion <b>120</b> of the catch <b>105</b> in use. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the pivoting means comprises the catching portion <b>100</b> having a spherical upper end <b>115</b> which fits into a correspondingly shaped spherical recess <b>125</b> in the retaining portion <b>120</b>. That is, the retaining portion <b>120</b> is not rigidly connected to the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b>, and instead, the upper end <b>115</b> of the catching portion <b>100</b> (i.e., that furthest away from the latching portion <b>110</b>) is spherical and sits in a correspondingly spherically shaped recess <b>125</b> in the retaining portion <b>102</b>. The catching portion <b>100</b> extends through a cavity <b>126</b> in the recess <b>125</b> and away from the retaining portion <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. Although the examples described herein have a pivoting means <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> that comprises a spherical portion and a correspondingly shaped recess, other pivoting means may be provided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In summary, the end <b>115</b> of the latching portion <b>100</b> that is furthest away from the catching (i.e., barrel-shaped) portion <b>110</b> has a spherical head and the spherical head is shaped and sized so as to sit in a correspondingly shaped recess <b>125</b> in the retaining portion <b>120</b>. Due to the fact that these two portions <b>100</b>, <b>120</b> of the catch are not fixedly attached to each other, the latching portion <b>100</b> can pivot and move relative to the retaining portion <b>120</b> in use.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">This relative movement can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. In this example, the hook <b>210</b> of the locking member <b>200</b> may be shaped and sized so as to be configured to hook onto the first, barrel-shaped portion <b>110</b> of the catch <b>105</b> in use. The retaining portion <b>120</b> is attached to a component <b>5</b> of the aircraft such as a section of a reverse thrust door, for example. The latching mechanisms could also be used to lock other components, however, and are not necessarily limited to use in a thrust reverser door system.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> the hook <b>210</b> of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> is latched onto the barrel-shaped portion <b>110</b> of the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> in use. The locking member <b>200</b> in this position remains stationary. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, however, the head <b>115</b> of the catching portion <b>100</b> undergoes translation T and the upper, spherical part <b>115</b> of the catching portion <b>100</b> translates axially within the spherical recess <b>125</b> of the retaining portion <b>120</b> of the catch <b>105</b>. As can be seen in this figure, although the upper, spherical, part <b>115</b> of the catching portion <b>100</b> (which is provided in the recess <b>125</b> of the retaining portion <b>120</b>) is now able to move axially, the lower part of the latch (i.e. the portion including the barrel-shaped catching portion <b>110</b>) is able to remain in the same position and rotate around the barrel profile of the barrel-shaped portion <b>110</b> of the latching portion <b>100</b>. In both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> the locking member <b>200</b> remains stationary.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Due to the unique structure of this latching mechanism, the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> is configured to rotate about its own axis and enable fore/aft motion and due to the pivoting means <b>115</b>, <b>125</b>, the device is configured to allow motion in all axes.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, this latch concept may also include a centering means <b>300</b> which ensures that the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> re-centres each time before engagement with the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b>. The centering means <b>300</b> is configured to center the latching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> prior to engagement with the hook <b>210</b> of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The centering device <b>300</b> may comprise a seal or seals that is/are positioned between the spherical head <b>115</b> of the latching portion <b>100</b> and the recess <b>125</b> of the retaining portion <b>120</b>. Although in this example, the seals also center the catching portion <b>100</b> relative to the retaining portion <b>120</b> of the catch, a separate centering means could be provided, in addition to, or in replacement of the seals <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Fore/aft motion can continue to be accommodated by rotation of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b> around its own axis although the spherical device <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> will allow motion in all axes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref> depict the latching mechanism when the hook is disconnected and connected, respectively.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts the movement of the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> and the</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">S-shaped locking member <b>200</b>. As can be seen in this figure, to allow the catching, or barrelled portion <b>110</b> of the catch <b>105</b> to roll along the flat profile of the hook <b>210</b> of the locking member <b>200</b>, the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> is required to pivot around its own centerline and also move vertically. The vertical movement can be accommodated by the main door seal. Under normal operation the door is able to overstow, and therefore the catching portion <b>100</b> of the catch <b>105</b> can move vertically by around 6 to 7 mm. For a catch <b>105</b> of height 70 mm (R<b>1</b>) an axial movement of 2 mm requires the catching portion <b>100</b> to move 0.060 mm in a vertical direction. The barrelled latch enables rotation of the catching portion <b>100</b> against the hook <b>210</b> of the S-shaped locking member <b>200</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
