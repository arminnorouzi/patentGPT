More specifically, the technology described herein generally relates to interpreting one or more frames of content, converting such content frame(s) into mini-banner content elements and embedding such content elements into a presentation of a primary content frame. More specifically, the technology relates to the interpreting, converting, embedding, presenting, storing and otherwise processing of various forms of audio, audio visual, graphical, visual, augmented reality, virtual reality, and other forms of content for presentation of such content as mini-banner secondary content presented in conjunction with one or more other frames of primary content.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, content exists in numerous forms including but not limited to audio, video, audio-video, graphical, virtual, tactile or otherwise. As used herein, content generally refers to any form of content and is not limited to its form or means of presentation to one or more persons. Content commonly can be further distinguished by its intended function. For example, certain content is referred to herein a &#x201c;primary content&#x201d; (PC). Non-limiting examples of primary content include feature films, televisions shows, audio recordings, webcasts, computer or other forms of electronic content, computer games, and otherwise. As defined herein, &#x201c;primary content&#x201d; is that content which one more persons (herein, &#x201c;users&#x201d;) specifically selects to &#x201c;consume&#x201d; by listening, watching, or otherwise, being presented with such content and at any given time. It is to be appreciated, that primary content may be consumed by a user at any time, such as when the primary content is originally broadcast or otherwise first available for consumption, or at any later time. Further, it is commonly appreciated that primary content may be consumed using a growing and evolving selection of devices, systems, mediums, technologies, communications structures, formats, and otherwise. Non-limiting examples of primary content consumption devices include televisions, graphical displays on tablets, smartphones and other devices, virtual reality presentation devices, augmented reality systems, audio systems, and otherwise.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to primary content, other forms of content, herein &#x201c;secondary content&#x201d; (&#x201c;SC&#x201d;) is also commonly presented to a user. As used herein &#x201c;secondary content&#x201d; refers to content, in any format, that a user does not specifically request to consume. Secondary content may often be provided for a user's consumption in conjunction with or separate from any given piece or collection of primary content. Such pieces and/or collection of primary content, with respect to which one or more given elements of secondary content are to be consumed, may be determined in advance, real-time, after-time, based on any factor or variable, or otherwise determined. Non-limiting examples of secondary content include television commercials, web commercials, instructional content, augmenting reality content, virtual reality content, and other forms of content, the selection of which a user often has little, if any, control.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Today, various devices, systems, features and functions enable consumers of primary content to often skip, delay, fast-forward, ignore, delete, bypass, or otherwise not consume secondary content that has been presented for consumption to a user. For conciseness purposes only, such non-consumption of secondary content is defined herein as &#x201c;skipping.&#x201d; Skipping can occur, for example, with the use of automated skipping features, fast forwarding through recordings, and otherwise. Often secondary content is required to be consumed in order for the user to consume given primary content.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, various devices, systems and processes today exist which enable creators of such secondary content to target given secondary content to particular users. By the use of demographic, personally identifying, anonymized data, user preferences and/or otherwise, producers, distributors and others associated with the providing of secondary content can specifically provide secondary content that actually is of interest to specific users. Users can be identified and/or targeted as one or more persons or groups of persons, such as a household or otherwise. Content that such specific users actually desire to consume, but, due to skipping, do not actually consume is often a missed opportunity for both the provider of the secondary content, the user, and others. Users often desire to know about secondary content of interest to them. Thus, a need exists for notifying users that skipped secondary content may actually contain content of interest to that user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the providing of secondary content as full frame advertisements, is often undesirable from the user's perspective, as such presentation often results in the expenditure of time and resources (e.g., screen area and processor time) that such user may desire to not spend on consuming secondary content that may or may not be of actual interest to them. Hence, the above described problem of secondary content that is of interest to such user often ending up being &#x201c;skipped&#x201d; is often exacerbated by device limitations and user preferences, with the end result being the secondary content of actual interest to the user not being consumed due to a lack of user awareness of the existence of such secondary content. Thus, devices, systems and methods are needed for addressing the above and related problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The various embodiments of the present disclosure relate in general to devices, systems, and methods for use in generating, embedding, presenting and storing mini-banner content.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, a mini-banner content system may include a secondary content system element having first non-transient computer executable instructions which configure a content interpreter to interpret secondary content and identify aspect information and output the aspect information.

It is to be appreciated that the features and functions of the content interpreter <b>108</b>, content converter <b>110</b>, and otherwise may be provided by hardware, software, and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For at least one embodiment, secondary content system <b>106</b> may include a content interpreter <b>108</b> configured to interpret received frame(s) of secondary content. More specifically, the content interpreter <b>108</b> may be configured to apply artificial intelligence and/or machine learning to interpret content provided in the received one or more frames of secondary content and identify one or more aspects for such content. Such aspects may include those presentable to a user via use of an actual device, system, or property thereof. For example, audible content aspects may include, but are not limited to, frequency characteristics which correspond to sounds produced by a given person, group of persons, instrument, article of nature, article of commerce or otherwise. Similarly, visual content aspects may include, but are not limited to, one or more pixels or collections of pixels that may occur on one or more planes of reference, such as a mono-plane, a stereo (left-view, right-view) plane, a virtual-reality plane, augmented plane, or otherwise, where such pixels are representative of a real, virtual, augmented, or other humanly visually perceptible object or group of objects.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with at least one embodiment, the interpreting of content generally means to discern one or more aspects of such content so as to determine a feature, function or characteristic that can be associated with one or more real, augmented, or virtual elements that represent the associated content. It is to be appreciated, that content aspects may occur statically as at a given point of time, such as a photograph, or dynamically over a span of time, such as aspects provided for a motion picture, a video, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the interpreting of content per at least one embodiment, may arise with respect to any aspect thereof. For example, an interpretation of a frame of audio presenting a song for user consumption may include identify a person singing, a composer of such song, a musician or band of musicians playing such song, instruments utilized, a time, a place, or otherwise. Similarly, an interpretation of a frame of video promoting sells of a car, such as the frames <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may include an identification in such video of various aspects, such as the type, age, make, model, color, or other characteristic of the car. Similarly, other non-tangible aspects associated with the car may also be interpreted, such as financing option, sales offered, discounts, price, or otherwise. Such interpretation may occur using any desired technology or combinations thereof which facilitate content interpretation, such as image recognition, text recognition, speech recognition, metadata interpretation, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the aspects of the car, such as its size and dimensions, may be shown in multiple perspectives in the secondary content, as shown by frames <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>300</b>-<i>n </i>where respective first secondary content, second secondary content, and nth secondary content frames are shown. Background aspects may also arise in secondary content, but are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Such background aspects are not presented in the illustrative figures, but, could include any aspect of a frame of secondary content such as weather, location, geography, or otherwise. The content interpreter <b>108</b> may be configured to ignore or interpret such background aspects, as based upon any factor, such as one or more descriptors associated with the given secondary content that identify the central aspect or aspects of the secondary content, presented by the secondary content, one or more user preferences, device, technology, bandwidth or other technological constraints, or in view of any other desired factor. It is to be appreciated that for at least one embodiment, descriptors may be provided in meta data associated with a given secondary content or obtained from other sources that designates which aspects(s) of such secondary content are to be interpreted for use in mini-banner conversion, generation, embedding, presentation, storage or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As discussed above, it is to be appreciated that any given frame may have multiple aspects. For example, a frame of video a house for sale, such as the frames <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, may include multiple aspects, such as a house <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> and a financing option <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>. The aspects may be shown in single or multiple perspectives, as shown by frames <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>300</b>-<i>n </i>where respective first multi-element secondary content, second multi-element secondary content, and nth multi-element secondary content frames are shown. Accordingly, for at least one embodiment, the content interpreter <b>108</b> may be configured as a multi-element content interpret <b>302</b> that is configured to identify multiple aspects in one or more frames of content.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the secondary content system <b>106</b> may include a content converter <b>110</b>. As shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, the secondary content converter <b>106</b> may be configured to receive information (&#x201c;info&#x201d;) from the content interpreter <b>108</b>, which may be configured, as per the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as a single aspect content interpreter or, as per the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, as a multi-aspect content interpreter <b>302</b>. Based on the received information, the content converter <b>110</b> may be configured to identify and/or generate one or more mini-banner content (MBC) elements, such as a first mini-banner content <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> or a first multi-element mini-banner content <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, which respectively correspond, represent and/or reflect a given aspect of a frame of secondary content (e.g., a car) as interpreted by the content interpreter <b>108</b> or multiple aspects of the frame of secondary content (e.g., house and financing terms) as interpreted by multi-aspect content interpreter <b>302</b>. MBCs may be converted to provide any desired perspective, including three-hundred-sixty-degree, stereo image, augmented reality, virtual reality, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">More specifically and for at least one embodiment, a mini-banner content element generally is a virtual element that corresponds to the one or more content aspects identifiable in a given frame of secondary content. For example, a frame of an advertisement depicting a given car may be interpreted by content interpreter <b>108</b> as depicting aspects including a certain year, make and model of the car. This aspect information is then conveyed to the content converter <b>110</b> which may be configured to obtain one or more virtual representations of the given car, the representation(s) each being an element, from an element database <b>112</b>. The element database <b>112</b> may be provided by any party, for example, by the manufacturer of the given car, by an advertiser promoting the car in the secondary content, by a content distributor, from unrelated third-party entities, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, certain elements may not be available from an element database <b>112</b>. Accordingly, and for at least one embodiment, the content converter <b>110</b> may be configured to generate content elements. Content elements may need to be generated, for example, when a desired element does not exist in an element database <b>112</b>. For example, a first element corresponding to a car's aspect, such as a side view, may exist in element database <b>112</b>. However, a second element, such as a rear view may not so exist. Accordingly, content converter <b>110</b> may be configured to generate a rear-view element based upon available information and using known or later arising rendering technologies. As discussed below, each of the side view element and the generated rear view element may be collectively bundled to provide a mini-banner content element, such as a mini-banner virtual reality content element, or an augmented reality content element, one or more of which enables a user to view an otherwise static image of a given car, in virtual reality, augmented reality, or otherwise and from one or more views.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Likewise, an element may not be accessible by a given secondary content system <b>106</b>. Further an element may be deemed improper for any reason, such as type of content, characteristics of the content, user characteristics (e.g., age), or otherwise, use restrictions, such as promotional use terms or the like, and otherwise. Accordingly, for at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, elements may be obtained or generated, as desired for any particular use or implementation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When generated, any desired technology may be utilized to convert info, about aspects of secondary content, into content elements. Such technologies may include device renderings based upon generalized dimensions or other characteristics of an item, avatar generation techniques, and otherwise. Further, the obtained and/or generated elements are bundled by content converter into a mini-banner content element. Such mini-banner content element may be bundled for standard reality, virtual reality, augmented reality, or other use configurations. As described herein, standard reality includes non-stereoscopic presentations of content to a user and virtual reality includes all other presentations.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">One example of a content converter <b>110</b> generating a mini-banner virtual reality content element is shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where the content converter <b>110</b> is a multi-element virtual reality (VR) content converter <b>304</b> configured to convert, for example, an aspect of a frame of secondary content, such as a promotional term, such a &#x201c;Zero Down, Low 3.5% APR Financing,&#x201d; as shown by second multi-element secondary content <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>, into a mini-banner virtual reality content element depicting &#x201c;3.5% APR&#x201d; in a stereoscopic (Left/Right) view, as shown by second mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>L and <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>R. It is to be appreciated that &#x201c;L&#x201d; and &#x201c;R&#x201d; designate respective images for a user's left and right eyes needed to provide a virtual reality representation of a secondary content element.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As further shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, a content converter may be configured to generate mini-banner virtual reality content, as shown by a conversion of a first secondary content element <b>200</b>-<b>1</b> into mini-banner VR content elements <b>206</b>-<b>1</b>L and <b>206</b>-<b>1</b>R. As shown, corresponding conversions may be performed of second secondary content aspect <b>200</b>-<b>2</b> into second mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>206</b>-<b>2</b>L and <b>206</b>-<b>2</b>R and/or nth secondary content aspect <b>200</b>-<i>n </i>into nth mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>206</b>-nL and <b>206</b>-nR. Likewise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, creation of virtual reality mini-banner content elements may occur with respect to single or multiple elements of a given frame of secondary content where, for example, both the house and the promotional term aspects in frame <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> are converted into mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>L and <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>R, where only the promotional term element in frame <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> are converted into mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>306</b>-<b>2</b>L and <b>306</b>-<b>2</b>R, and where only the house image aspect in frame <b>300</b>-<i>n </i>is converted into mini-banner virtual reality content elements <b>306</b>-nL and <b>306</b>-nR.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is to be appreciated that by converting a secondary content aspect into a mini-banner content element, whether virtual reality (VR) or standard (i.e., non-virtual reality), significant savings can be realized in the amount of data needed to communicate a second content aspect, the amount of data storage needed for such content aspect, computational and/or display resource needed to present a secondary content aspect&#x2014;as represented by a mini-banner content element, and otherwise. Further, the conversion of secondary content aspect into mini-banner content elements may also provide, for at least one embodiment, presentation, manipulation and other characteristics not present using a secondary content aspect itself. Examples of such additional capabilities possible using mini-banner content elements include, but are not limited to, providing virtual-reality representations, providing manipulations of an element in different time, space, environments, backgrounds, or otherwise, and providing access to views and other information, such as information accessible via the Internet or otherwise, that is not available or accessible using a secondary content aspect itself. For example, a conversion of a secondary content aspect depicting a front view of a given car into a mini-banner virtual reality content element may enable a user to view virtual top, bottom, front, back, sides, interior, and other views of the given car&#x2014;such views not being provided in the secondary content aspect itself, while also directly accessing a website providing car configuration options to the user. Other associated uses arising from mini-banner content elements may arise, as desired for any given embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and as discussed above, for at least one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> may include one or more mini-banner content element databases <b>114</b> configured to store mini-banner content elements. The mini-banner content element database <b>114</b> may be configured to store given mini-banner content elements in one or more of a standard (non-virtual reality formatted) context form and/or a virtual reality context form, as provided by respective partitions <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B. That is, the system may be configured such that upon a given secondary content aspect being interpreted, elements obtained and/or generated, and such elements being converted into mini-banner content elements, such interpretations and/or conversions need not be repeated. It is to be appreciated, that such functionality facilitates the use of fewer network and/or computing resources, as interpretations of secondary content aspects and/or conversions of elements into mini-banner elements may otherwise be time, computing, network resource, or otherwise used. It is to be appreciated that mini-banner content elements may include one or more elements obtained from element database <b>112</b> or generated by content converter <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for at least one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> may include a mini-system presenter <b>116</b>. A mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may include, be utilized in conjunction with, or be separate from any content processing utilized for and/or with a presentation/display system of primary content or secondary content. Non-limiting examples of such systems include set-top boxes utilized with cable, satellite, Internet, streaming and other content presentation services, smart-phones, computers, tablets, lap-tops, gaming devices, computing devices, audio, video and other presentation devices, and otherwise. The mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may be configured to embed one or more mini-banner content elements onto, in, and/or present with primary content. Further, it is to be appreciated that primary content may also be converted, generated, embedded and otherwise as mini-banner content elements in conjunction with other primary content presentations and/or secondary content presentations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As per at least one embodiment, the mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may include a database <b>118</b>, such as one provided on a digital video recorder, a cloud storage, or otherwise. It is to be appreciated that herein any known or later arising data storage technologies may be utilized for any data storage needed, including but not limited to local data storage, remote data storage, cloud-based storage, distributed storage, or otherwise. The database <b>118</b> may be partitioned or otherwise provided into distinct categories of content storage, such as, saved primary content <b>118</b>A, saved mini-banner content (SMBC) <b>118</b>B, saved mini-banner virtual reality content (SMBVRC) <b>118</b>C, user saved secondary content (SC) <b>118</b>D, and user information (UI) <b>118</b>E, such as user preferences, demographics, settings and otherwise. For at least one embodiment, the saved content, in one or more of the categories, may include content designated for storage on the database <b>118</b> by any person or entity. For example, a content distributor may designate certain primary content and certain mini-banner content and/or mini-banner virtual reality content for storage on a given mini-system presenter <b>116</b>. Similarly, a user may designate certain content for storage, such as a mini-banner content element that is of interest to the user. Further, the designation of certain content for storage in database <b>118</b> may result in an automatic, semi-automatic, manual or other designation of related content for storage on the database <b>118</b>. For example, the mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may be configured such that when a user designates MBC or MBVRC elements for storage, storage also occurs of any secondary content in which a secondary content aspect arises and corresponds to the stored MBC/MBVRC element. For example, selection for storage of an MBC element for a given car may also result in storage of secondary content related to such given car. Further, it is to be appreciated that a given MBC or MBVRC element may correspond to one or more secondary content. For example, an MBC for the given automobile may correspond to each of a first secondary content (e.g., a first TV commercial for the car) and a second secondary content (e.g., a second TV commercial for the car). Thus, it is to be appreciated that by use of mini-banner content elements, storage space savings may be realized by the saving of a single mini-banner content element versus multiple secondary content frames.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and for at least one embodiment, a mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may also be configured to include a content detector <b>120</b>. The content detector <b>120</b> may be configured to determine a form of primary content that is being presented or to be presented to the consuming person. For example, if the primary content is three-dimensional content, the content detector <b>120</b> will recognize the same and instruct system <b>116</b> components to present mini-banner content in a corresponding format, such as a VR format. The system <b>116</b> may also include a display driver <b>122</b>. It is to be appreciated, however, the that display driver may be provided by a stand-alone device, such as TV or otherwise. The mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may also include a communications interface <b>124</b>. Such interface <b>124</b> may be configured to facilitate communications by and between the mini-system presenter <b>116</b> and any other system <b>100</b> component or element, which also include user elements <b>130</b>, such a display/presentation devices and otherwise. As per above, such communications may utilize any know or later arising technologies suitable for the purpose presenting mini-banner content elements to one or more users. The system may also include a user interface element <b>126</b>. Such user interface element <b>126</b> may include any known or later arising technologies including but not limited to touch, voice, gesture, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The mini-system presenter <b>116</b> may also include a mini-content embedder <b>128</b>. As shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the mini-system content embedder <b>128</b> may be configured to embed a mini-banner content (MBC) element into a presentation of primary content <b>400</b>. For example, a presentation of a frame of primary content <b>400</b> may include a story about a cabin in a forest. Such presentation may occur using a display device suitably coupled to a mini-system presenter <b>116</b>. An advertisement, for example, secondary content <b>200</b> about an automobile, is to be presented in conjunction with the primary content <b>400</b>. The secondary content <b>200</b> may be interpreted at the time of presentation or otherwise using content interpreter <b>108</b> to recognize the car aspect of the secondary content. Further, the information generated by the content interpreter <b>108</b> may be communicated to a converter, such as content converter <b>110</b>, which obtains and/or generates one or more corresponding mini-banner content (MBC) elements. Similarly, a virtual reality content converter <b>204</b> may be utilized which generates one or more sets of mini-banner virtual reality content (MBVRC) elements <b>206</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The mini-banner content elements may be provided to mini-content embedder <b>128</b>. Mini-content embedder <b>128</b> suitably presents such mini-content banner elements in one or more MBC frames <b>402</b>. The MBC frame(s) <b>402</b> may be presented with the primary content <b>400</b> to form combined content such as a primary mini-banner content image <b>404</b>. The MBC frame(s) <b>402</b> may be presented in any format, such as picture-in-picture, as an overlay, as a portion of the primary content, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Similarly, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> with respect to virtual reality primary and/or secondary content, the mini-system content embedder <b>128</b> may be configured to embed mini-banner virtual reality content (MBVRC) elements into primary content. For example, primary content may include primary virtual reality content (PVRC) <b>406</b>. One or more secondary content aspects may be desired to be presented in conjunction with the primary virtual reality content <b>406</b>. When the one or more secondary content elements are in standard content form <b>202</b>, such content may be interpreted and converted into MBVRC elements <b>210</b>-L and <b>210</b>-R, as discussed above. Similarly, one or more secondary content elements may be provided as secondary virtual reality content (SVRC) aspects, such as aspects <b>408</b>-L and <b>408</b>-R. These SVRC elements may be interpreted and then converted by a VR content converter, such as converter <b>204</b>. The resulting mini-banner virtual reality content (MBVRC) elements may then be provided to mini-content embedder <b>128</b>. Mini-content embedder <b>128</b> suitably presents such mini-content banner virtual reality content (MBVRC) elements in one or more MBVRC frames <b>410</b> with the primary virtual reality content <b>406</b> to form a combined primary mini-banner virtual reality content image <b>412</b>. The MBVRC frames <b>410</b> may be presented in any format, such as picture-in-picture, as an overlay, as a portion of the primary content, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at least one embodiment of the present disclosure includes a method for interpreting and converting secondary content aspects into mini-banner content elements and embedding the mini-banner content elements with primary content. The method begins, as per Operation <b>500</b>, with receiving secondary content. Such secondary content may be received at any time prior, during, or after presentation of primary content. Further, secondary content may be associated at any time for presentation in conjunction with more than one primary content presentations, such as an automobile advertisement designated for presentation during each of a football game and a baseball game. Further, it is to be appreciated that method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may also be used with respect to primary content which may also be converted, generated, embedded and otherwise as mini-banner content elements in conjunction with other primary content presentations and/or secondary content presentations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As per Operation <b>502</b>, the received secondary content is interpreted. Such interpretation may include interpreting one or more various aspects of the secondary content. Such one or more various aspects may arise in the same or different formats, for example, audio, video and other formats. As shown, Operation <b>502</b> may include one or more sub-operations that may be format and/or aspect specific. Examples of such sub-operations include parsing secondary content audio aspects, as per Operation <b>502</b>A, and adding descriptors or &#x201c;tags&#x201d; to such parsed audio aspects, as per Operation <b>502</b>B. Examples further include parsing and tagging of video, as per Operations <b>502</b>C and <b>502</b>D, and parsing and tagging of other forms of content aspects, as per Operations <b>502</b>E and <b>502</b>F. For at least one embodiment, content parsed and/tagged for a first format, such as audio, may be used in parsing and tagging content in a second format, such as video. For example, secondary content about an automobile may include audio aspects which identify the year, make and model of the promoted vehicle. Such audio information may be used to interpret the corresponding video aspects as relating to the audibly described vehicle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As discussed above, Operation <b>502</b> results in the generation of information (&#x201c;info&#x201d;) regarding one or more secondary content aspects. Such information is communicated to a standard or virtual reality content converter.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Per Operation <b>504</b>, conversion of the one or more secondary content aspects into mini-banner content elements proceeds based on the information received from a content interpreter. Such conversion operations may include identifying corresponding elements as per Operation <b>504</b>A. Such identification may be used to search, as per Operation <b>504</b>B, an accessible database for elements, standard or virtual reality, that correspond to the aspect identified in the information and can be used to form a mini-banner content element. Alternatively, if an attempted identification and searching for saved elements is unsuccessful, content conversion may include generating an element, as per Operation <b>504</b>C. Again, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other advanced computing technologies may be utilized to generate the one or more elements to be used in a mini-banner content element. It is to be appreciated that such advanced computing technologies may be especially useful in generating elements from secondary content containing only standard elements (non-VR elements).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As per Operation <b>504</b>D, the method may include generating the mini-banner content element from the one or more elements obtained or generated per Operations <b>504</b>A-<b>504</b>C. It is to be appreciated that such generated mini-banner content elements may be suitably saved. For at least one embodiment, the generation of mini-banner content elements may be not be needed when an element obtained from storage or generated is sufficient, in and by itself for eventual embedding with primary content. As discussed above, once a secondary content aspect is identified, elements found and/or generated, and mini-banner content elements generated, such aspects, elements and/or mini-banner content elements may be saved for use with other secondary content referencing the same element or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As per Operation <b>504</b>E, the method may include processing of elements and/or mini-banner content elements for presentation in other environments such as virtual reality environments, augmented reality environments, and otherwise. Such processing again may used advanced computing technologies to provide any desired view, orientation, lighting, or otherwise with respect to one or more elements or mini-banner content elements. Results arising from such virtual reality and/or other reality processing may also be saved for further use, as per Operation <b>504</b>D.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As per Operation <b>506</b>, the method may include receiving primary content. The primary content may be received by a mini-system presenter or other device and using any known or later arising technologies.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As per Operation <b>508</b>, the method may include embedding the previously identified mini-banner content element onto the primary content presentation. It is to be appreciated that the embedding may occur before presentation of the primary content or during a first or later arising presentation of the primary content. As discussed above, the embedding may occur in any format, such as picture-in-picture, overlay, standard reality, virtual reality, or otherwise. The embedding may occur for any desired length of time, such as during an entirety of a presentation of primary content or any portion thereof. User preferences may be utilized in determining the periods, conditions, or otherwise and if at all, during which mini-banner content elements are presented in conjunction with primary content.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As per Operation <b>510</b>, when mini-banner content elements are embedded with primary content, the method may include the operation of determining whether one or more mini-banner content elements are selected by the user. For at least one embodiment, selection of a mini-banner content (MBC) element or a mini-banner virtual reality content (MBVRC) element may occur using any technology, such as voice, touch, gesture or otherwise. For at least one embodiment, selection may occur as a matter of viewing condition, such as a user must view a given quantity of mini-banner content associated with given secondary content under one or more conditions. For at least one embodiment, selection may occur in a multiple part method with a selection or tagging by a user of an MBC/MBVRC element during presentation of the primary content followed by a later arising accessing of such tagged MBC/MBRVC element for any purpose.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As per Operation <b>512</b>, when a mini-banner content element is selected, the method may include the operation of presenting the related secondary content or other related content to the user. For at least one embodiment, other related content may be any content that relates, in whole or in part, to a selected MBC or MBVRC element.
