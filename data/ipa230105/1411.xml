It is to be understood that other examples may be utilized, and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims. It is to be understood that features of the various examples described herein may be combined, in part or whole, with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">PCR is a method used in molecular biology to make many copies of a nucleic acid segment. Using PCR, a single copy (or more) of a nucleic acid sequence is exponentially amplified to generate thousands to millions or more copies of that particular nucleic acid segment. PCR is a temperature-mediated process involving cycling a reaction volume, or mixture, between set temperatures. Many PCR methods utilize the visible range of fluorescent spectroscopy to detect nucleic acids. With fluorescent spectroscopy, a fluorescence signal is detected from a labeled fluorescent tag after washing the unconjugated tag. Upon excitation from an external light source, these fluorescent labels emit a signal. A transducer, such as a photodetector, can collect these signals and transduce them to the electrical domain (i.e., voltage or current) for signal amplification and conditioning.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Detection mechanisms for fluorescent amplification utilize multiple devices. For instance, many fluorescence detection systems include an excitation light source, a fluorophore, wavelength filters to isolate emission photons from excitation photons, and a detector that registers emission photons and produces a recordable output, usually as an electrical signal. Moreover, depending on the fluorescent markers used, different respective optical filters may be used. The use of these multiple devices increases the cost and time of performing nucleic acid amplification and detection. In microfluidic devices which perform PCR in a portable handheld device, difficulty may arise in orienting circuitry for heating reaction fluids, and detecting fluorescent signals, in such a position that high throughput PCR may be performed without local overheating of the reaction volume of the PCR device and without incorporating external devices. Fluorescent labels, when attached directly to a probe molecule, allow for almost instantaneous detection. Fluorescence analysis is very sensitive, especially when special optical detection equipment is used. However, while sensitive optical detection equipment is available, it is rather expensive and thus out of reach for many researchers. Additionally, for each fluorescent probe used, when performing PCR or any other analytical technique involving microfluidic devices, a different respective light source and associated filter(s) may be used to detect the fluorescent signal. The present disclosure relates to an apparatus comprising a microfluidic reaction chamber to contain a reaction fluid for amplification of nucleic acids, and a reaction chamber circuit disposed within the microfluidic reaction chamber. The apparatus and method described herein may include the use of multiple filters and may therefore allow for multiple fluorescent probes to be used with a single handheld device. This reduces the use of multiple reaction chambers for multiple fluorescent probes (e.g., enabling multiplexing), and provides an integrated device for performing PCR and fluorescent detection. Moreover, the positioning of the reaction chamber circuit in the apparatus described herein, provides for high thermal efficiency, which permits the rapid and specific temperature changes for PCR to be achieved within the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus comprising a microfluidic reaction chamber to contain a reaction fluid for amplification of nucleic acids, and a reaction chamber circuit disposed within the microfluidic reaction chamber. In various examples, the microfluidic reaction chamber includes a base wall defined in part by a substrate, a top wall parallel to the base wall and defined in part by a transparent lid, a first side wall perpendicular to the base wall and defined in part by the transparent lid, and a second side wall perpendicular to the base wall and defined in part by the transparent lid. The reaction chamber circuit is disposed within the microfluidic reaction chamber, and includes a top surface parallel to and proximal to the top wall of the microfluidic reaction chamber, a bottom surface parallel to and distal to the top wall of the microfluidic reaction chamber, a first side wall parallel to the first side wall of the microfluidic reaction chamber, and a second side wall parallel to the second side wall of the microfluidic reaction chamber. As described herein, the top surface of the reaction chamber circuit, the bottom surface of the reaction chamber circuit, the first side wall of the reaction chamber circuit and the second side wall of the reaction chamber circuit are in fluidic contact with the reaction fluid. Moreover, the bottom surface of the reaction chamber circuit includes a photodetector to detect a fluorescence signal from a labeled fluorescent tag in the reaction fluid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In additional examples, the apparatus includes a substrate, a transparent lid, and a reaction chamber circuit. The substrate includes a proximal end and a distal end opposite the proximal end, a first fluid channel traversing a width of the substrate, a second fluid channel traversing a width of the substrate, and a base wall disposed between the first fluid channel and the second fluid input/output. The transparent lid is coupled to the proximal end of the substrate and the distal end of the substrate to form a microfluidic reaction chamber. The reaction chamber circuit extends from the proximal end of the substrate to the distal end of the substrate and includes a top surface proximal to the transparent lid and a bottom surface distal to the transparent lid.

As used herein, a reaction fluid refers to or includes a fluid including components to perform nucleic acid amplification with fluorescence detection. The components in the reaction fluid may include, a biologic sample that contains the target sequence(s) to be amplified, an enzyme that polymerizes new nucleic acid strands, two (or more) nucleic acid primers, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), a buffer solution providing a suitable chemical environment for amplification and optimum activity and stability of the polymerase, and a reporter molecule such as fluorophores. Examples of the polymerase enzyme include, but are not limited to, DNA polymerase such as Taq DNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase.

The transparent lid <b>109</b> may comprise glass, quartz, poly (methyl methacrylate), polycarbonates, cyclic olefin copolymer, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, and polyvinyl chloride for example, although other suitable materials are also contemplated. The substrate <b>105</b> may, for example, comprise a silicon-based wafer or may be formed of single crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, gallium arsenide, glass, silica, ceramics, plastics, or a semiconducting material, for example. In some examples, the substrate <b>105</b> may be a composite material, and/or include multiple layers of different materials.
