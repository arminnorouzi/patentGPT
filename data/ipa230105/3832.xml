level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A radar system may perform measurement (for example, speed measurement, distance measurement, and positioning) on an object (for example, a vehicle or a pedestrian), and the radar system is widely applied in many fields (for example, the unmanned driving field and the intelligent transportation field).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an actual application process, the radar system sends a transmit signal to surroundings. After the transmit signal reaches an obstacle (the object), the obstacle reflects the transmit signal, so that the radar system can receive a reflected signal. The radar system can measure the object based on the transmit signal and the reflected signal. However, in the actual application process, the radar system may receive many interference signals. For example, the interference signals include a signal transmitted by another radar system, a signal maliciously attacked by a hacker, and an environmental interference signal. Because characteristics of many interference signals of a radar are very similar to those of a real reflected signal, the radar system cannot accurately distinguish between the reflected signal and the interference signal, and cannot accurately measure the object.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a radar system, and a signal processing method and apparatus. This improves measurement accuracy of the radar system on an object.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a radar system, including a transmitting assembly, a receiving assembly, and a controller. The transmitting assembly is configured to generate and transmit N first signals, where characteristics of the N first signals are different, the characteristic includes a wavelength and/or a delay, and N is an integer greater than 1. The receiving assembly is configured to receive a second signal. The controller is configured to determine, based on the characteristics of the N first signals, whether the second signal includes an echo signal corresponding to the first signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the foregoing process, a transmit signal transmitted by the transmitting assembly includes N (N is an integer greater than 1) first signals, and wavelengths and/or delays of the N first signals are different. The controller may determine, based on a characteristic of the transmit signal (wavelengths and/or delays of the N first signals are different), the echo signal in a signal received by the receiving assembly. A characteristic of the echo signal is the same as the characteristic of the transmit signal. Therefore, the controller can accurately determine, based on the characteristic of the transmit signal, the echo signal in the signal received by the receiving assembly. This improves object measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a possible implementation, the transmitting assembly includes a laser and a signal processor. The laser is configured to: generate a third signal, and send the third signal to the signal processor. The signal processor is configured to process the third signal to obtain the N first signals.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the foregoing process, the N first signals with different wavelengths may be obtained by disposing one laser in the radar system, so that the radar system has low costs and a small size.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the signal processor includes a frequency multiplication crystal group and/or a delayer group. The frequency multiplication crystal group is configured to convert a signal with a single wavelength into signals with N wavelengths. The delayer group is configured to convert a signal with a single delay into signals with N delays.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the foregoing process, the signals with N wavelengths may be generated through the frequency multiplication crystal group, and signals with N delays may be generated through a delayer. There is no need to dispose a plurality of lasers in the radar system, so that the radar system has low costs and a small size.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible implementation, the signal with a single wavelength may be converted into the signals with N wavelengths in the following manner: converting the third signal into N first signals, where wavelengths of the N first signals are different.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the foregoing process, the third signal generated by the laser is converted into the N first signals with different wavelengths, so as to generate the N signals with different wavelengths. The foregoing operation process is simple and easy to implement.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the frequency multiplication crystal group includes N&#x2212;1 frequency multiplication crystals, the N first signals include the third signal and signals that are output by the N&#x2212;1 frequency multiplication crystals, and wavelengths of the signals that are output by the frequency multiplication crystals are different.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the foregoing process, each frequency multiplication crystal may output a signal with one wavelength. In this case, the N&#x2212;1 frequency multiplication crystals output N&#x2212;1 signals with different wavelengths. The wavelengths of the N&#x2212;1 signals are different from a wavelength of the third signal, in this case, the N&#x2212;1 signals that are output by the N&#x2212;1 frequency multiplication crystals and the third signal constitute N signals with different wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation, a signal with a single delay may be converted into signals with N delays in the following manner: converting the third signal into the N first signals, where delays of the N first signals are different.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the foregoing process, the third signal generated by the laser is converted into the N first signals with different delays, to generate N signals with different delays. The foregoing operation process is simple and easy to implement.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible implementation, the delayer group includes N&#x2212;1 delayers, the N first signals include the third signal and signals that are output by the N&#x2212;1 delayers, and delays of signals that are output by the delayers are different.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the foregoing process, each delayer may output a signal with one delay. In this case, the N&#x2212;1 delayers output N&#x2212;1 signals with different delays. The delays of the N&#x2212;1 signals are different from a delay of the third signal, in this case, the N&#x2212;1 signals that are output by the N&#x2212;1 delayers and the third signal constitute N signals with different delays.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible implementation, a signal with a single wavelength may be converted into signals with N wavelengths in the following manner: converting the third signal into N fourth signals, and sending the fourth signals to the delayer group, where wavelengths of the N fourth signals are different. The delayer group separately performs delay processing on the N fourth signals to obtain the N first signals, where wavelengths of the N first signals are different, and delays of the N first signals are different.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the foregoing process, the third signal that is output by the laser is first converted into the N fourth signals with different wavelengths, and then the N fourth signals are sent to the delayer group, so that the delayer group performs different delay processing on the N fourth signals, to obtain N first signals with different wavelengths and different delays. Only one laser is required to obtain the N first signals with different wavelengths and different delays, so that the radar system has low costs and a small size.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation, the signal processor further includes an optical fiber coupler, a first optical fiber, and a signal separation assembly, and the first optical fiber is separately connected to the first optical fiber coupler and the signal separation assembly. The first optical fiber coupler is configured to couple the N fourth signals to the optical fiber. The first optical fiber is configured to transmit the N fourth signals to the signal separation assembly. The signal separation assembly is configured to: separate the N fourth signals, and send the N separated fourth signals to the delayer group.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the foregoing process, the first optical fiber is disposed in the radar system, so that the transmitting assembly may be deployed more flexibly.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a possible implementation, the signal separation assembly includes N&#x2212;1 grating elements, the delayer group includes N&#x2212;1 delayers, and each grating element is configured to reflect a signal with one wavelength. The i<sup>th </sup>grating element is configured to: reflect the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal, and transmit the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal to the i<sup>th </sup>delayer. The i<sup>th </sup>delayer is configured to perform delay processing on the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal to obtain the i<sup>th </sup>first signal, where i is a positive integer less than N. The (N&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>grating element is further configured to transmit the N<sup>th </sup>fourth signal to obtain the N<sup>th </sup>first signal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the foregoing process, each grating element may reflect a signal with one wavelength and project a signal with another wavelength. In this way, signals with a plurality of wavelengths may be accurately separated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a possible implementation, the signal processor further includes N&#x2212;1 circulators. Before transmitting the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal to the i<sup>th </sup>delayer, the i<sup>th </sup>grating element is further configured to transmit the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal to the i<sup>th </sup>circulator, and the i<sup>th </sup>circulator is configured to transmit the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal in a preset direction. Correspondingly, the i<sup>th </sup>fourth signal that is output by the i<sup>th </sup>circulator is further transmitted to the i<sup>th </sup>delayer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the foregoing process, a signal transmission direction may be conveniently changed through the circulator, so that components in the radar system are deployed more flexibly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a possible implementation, the transmitting assembly further includes a fiber collimator, a beam splitter, a first detector, and a scanner. The fiber collimator is configured to transmit the N first signals to the beam splitter. The beam splitter is configured to: transmit the N first signals to the scanner based on first energy, and transmit the N first signals to the first detector based on second energy, where a ratio of the first energy to the second energy is a preset ratio. The scanner is configured to transmit the N received first signals. The first detector is configured to: convert the N received first signals into a first electrical signal, and send the first electrical signal to the controller. The controller is further configured to: when the second signal is an echo signal, perform at least one of the following processing based on the second signal and the first electrical signal: speed measurement, distance measurement, and positioning.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the foregoing process, the beam splitter may split the first signal, so that the scanner may transmit a part of the first signal, and the first detector converts the part of the first signal into the first electrical signal and transmits the first electrical signal to the controller. In this way, the first electrical signal obtained by the controller may match the first signal transmitted by the scanner, so that the controller can accurately perform measurement (for example, speed measurement, distance measurement, or positioning).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a possible implementation, the transmitting assembly further includes a neutral density filter, and the neutral density filter is located between the beam splitter and the first detector. The neutral density filter is configured to perform attenuation processing on the N first signals sent by the beam splitter to the first detector.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the foregoing process, the neutral density filter may perform attenuation processing on the N first signals sent by the beam splitter to the first detector. In this way, damage to the first detector caused by excessively strong energy of the N first signals reaching the first detector may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a possible implementation, the controller is further configured to: generate a scan control signal, and send the scan control signal to the scanner, where the scan control signal is used to control an angle at which the scanner transmits a signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a possible implementation, the transmitter transmits the N first signals based on the scan control signal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the foregoing process, the controller may control the angle at which the scanner transmits a signal. This not only flexibly controls the scanner, but also may control the scanner to transmit a signal at a wider angle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a possible implementation, the scanner is further configured to send angle data to the controller, where the angle data includes a transmit angle at one or more transmit moments.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the foregoing process, after the scanner sends the angle data to the controller, the controller may learn the transmit angles of the scanner at the moments. In this way, the controller may control the scanner more accurately, and may perform more accurate measurement based on the angle data.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a possible implementation, the controller is further configured to: generate a frequency control signal, and send the frequency control signal to the laser. The laser is specifically configured to generate the third signal based on the frequency control signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the foregoing process, the controller may further control the laser to transmit the third signal, so that flexibility of the radar system is high.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a possible implementation, the receiving assembly includes a telescope, a second optical fiber, and a second detector.
