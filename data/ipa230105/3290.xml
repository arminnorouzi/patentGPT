Backlash is problematic in systems that change direction (e.g., a gear is driven to change directions and rotate in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions), and systems that require movement with a high degree of precision. In some implementations, it is important to ensure that gears can change rotational direction and stop rotating at a stable position with a high degree of precision. One example implementation is an antenna array system, wherein a scanning antenna array is positioned in real-time based on a received input to ensure the antenna array is pointed in the correct direction for receiving and/or transmitting electromagnetic signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Backlash is sometimes referred to as lash, play, or slop. Backlash in a gear system results from clearance between the teeth of two gears. This is sometimes described as lost motion in a mechanism driven by the gear system due to the gaps/clearance in between the teeth of two gears. Backlash occurs when a first gear rotates in one direction, through a certain angle or distance corresponding to the backlash clearance, without the teeth of the first gear meeting and/or applying force or movement to the teeth of the second gear.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Backlash in mechanical systems results in mechanical and energy losses in the operation of the system. In other words, backlash causes electrical and mechanical energy to be expended without translating into movement or drive in the mechanical system. In systems in which backlash is undesirable, this may cause unpredictable positioning of shafts and gears, as well as unpredictable operation of the mechanical system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain applications, positioning of gears and shafts is important for computational and feedback purposes. For example, in antenna positioning and communications machinery, it may be important to determine an angular position of the antenna with respect to other elements of machinery in the system or elements outside of the machinery. Other applications such as weaponry, satellite communications, optical systems, etc. may also rely on accurate positioning or positioning data of various parts of machinery such as gears, shafts, and other elements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current designs of the anti-backlash gears include multiple gears, multiple springs, and multiple connection points where the springs are connected to both gears. Accordingly, the traditional anti-backlash gears are manufactured in separate pieces in multiple steps and are then assembled to form a complete anti-backlash gear. Because of the multiple parts and pieces, traditional anti-backlash gears are more complex, more difficult to install, and use more energy, processes, create re-installation and maintenance challenges, and power then are necessary or desirable. As such, a current need exists for anti-backlash gears that are less complex, easier to use, contain fewer parts, and are easier and more efficient to manufacture and implement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore one object of this disclosure to provide anti-backlash gears that are simpler, more efficient to manufacture, and easier to implement than traditional anti-backlash gears. It is further an object of this disclosure to provide alternative anti-backlash gears that prevent or reduce backlash in mechanical systems. It is a further object of this disclosure to provide anti-backlash gears that may be manufactured more simply than traditional anti-backlash gears, including anti-backlash gears that may be manufactured as a single indivisible element in a single manufacturing process, such as, for example, three-dimensional printing processes (e.g., additive manufacturing processes) or others.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Non-limiting and non-exhaustive implementations of the present disclosure are described with reference to the following figures, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views unless otherwise specified.

The anti-backlash gears of the present disclosure are simpler and contain fewer parts than traditional anti-backlash gears. In some cases, the anti-backlash gears of the present disclosure are manufactured in a single process as a single indivisible element, thereby greatly simplifying the anti-backlash gears. The anti-backlash gears described herein are simpler to manufacture, install, and implement than traditional anti-backlash gear.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A gear described herein includes a central hub comprising a central hole disposed therethrough a plurality of compliant members attached to the central hub and extending radially outward relative to the central hole. The gear is such that each of the plurality of compliant members is configured to elastically deform when exposed to an applied force.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A gear system described herein includes an anti-backlash gear and a mating gear. The anti-backlash gear includes a central hub comprising a central hole disposed therethrough and a plurality of compliant members attached to the central hub and extending radially outward relative to the central hole. The anti-backlash gear is such that each of the plurality of compliant members is configured to elastically deform when exposed to an applied force. The mating gear comprises a plurality of teeth configured to interface with two or more of the plurality of compliant members of the anti-backlash gear.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The anti-backlash gears described herein are particularly beneficial in cases wherein a gear changes directions during use, and specifically when the gear must be driven with precise movements. An example use-case for the anti-backlash gears described herein is finely tuned antenna movements, for example, when an antenna array is electronically scanned back and forth to receive or transmit electromagnetic signals. In this use-case, the gears that move the antenna array back and forth must be capable of moving in either direction and must be capable of moving with precision to ensure the antenna array is pointed in the desired direction. The anti-backlash gears described herein are best suited to cases when the torsional load is relatively small.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The anti-backlash gears described herein include a plurality of compliant teeth that are each formed from two or more compliant members. The compliant members extend radially outward relative to a central hole disposed through a central hub. The compliant members are &#x201c;compliant&#x201d; such that they are flexible and elastic. The compliant members are fabricated of a material configured to deform or displace when exposed to an applied force, and then return to an equilibrium position when the applied force is removed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The compliant members of the anti-backlash gear may be displaced by a tooth of another gear (may be referred to as a mating gear herein) engaged with the anti-backlash gear of the present disclosure. The tooth of the other gear may enter between compliant members of the compliant teeth of the anti-backlash gear and may displace/deform the compliant members apart to accommodate the tooth of the other gear. The &#x201c;compliant&#x201d; or elastic nature of the compliant members cause the compliant members to pinch and exert a force on both sides of the tooth of the mating gear. This reduces or eliminates backlash in the system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The anti-backlash gear may be manufactured by any known machining/manufacturing methods and techniques such as casting, molding, cutting, three-dimensional printing (aka additive manufacturing), etc., and any combination of the foregoing. In various embodiments, the anti-backlash gear may be manufactured in metal, printed in metal, or any other material with sufficient strength to withstand loads experienced by the anti-backlash gear. In certain embodiments, the whole anti-backlash gear is manufactured in a single manufacturing process as a single indivisible element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The anti-backlash gears according to embodiments described herein are useful for any application in which backlash is undesirable or unacceptable and should be reduced or eliminated. Embodiments of the anti-backlash gears described herein may be particularly useful in applications where determining angular position of gears and/or shafts attached to the gears is important.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific techniques and embodiments are set forth, such as particular techniques and configurations, to provide a thorough understanding of the device disclosed herein. While the techniques and embodiments will primarily be described in context with the accompanying drawings, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the techniques and embodiments may also be practiced in other similar devices.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The pitch circles <b>116</b>, <b>126</b> meet at pitch point <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown, when the first gear <b>110</b> and the second gear <b>120</b> engage with one another such that their respective pitch circles <b>116</b>, <b>126</b> are tangential to one another, the first tooth <b>122</b> of the second gear <b>120</b> contacts the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> at a contact point <b>114</b>. However, the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> does not contact the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b> at the same time. Thus, there is a gap between mating elements, i.e.., the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear and the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gap left between the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear and the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear is backlash <b>130</b> of the gear system <b>100</b>. The backlash <b>130</b> represents space between mating components of the gear system <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the backlash <b>130</b> may cause lost motion in the gear system <b>100</b> before movement of the first gear <b>110</b> allows the tooth <b>112</b> to contact the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, if the first gear <b>110</b> were to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> must traverse the space between the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> and the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b> (i.e., backlash <b>130</b>) before encountering the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear. Similarly, when the first gear <b>110</b> rotates such that the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> contacts the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b>, a gap (backlash) is formed between the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear and the first tooth <b>122</b> of the second gear. Therefore, if the first gear <b>110</b> were to change direction and rotate in a clockwise direction, then there would be lost motion cause by the backlash formed between the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> and the first tooth <b>122</b> of the second gear <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lost motion caused by the backlash <b>130</b> causes mechanical and energy losses in the gear system <b>100</b>. In other words, energy is spent to move the first gear <b>110</b>, but that energy does not translate into power transfer or movement of the second gear <b>120</b> until the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> contacts the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b>. This lost motion and backlash is undesirable in many gear systems.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Backlash is particularly undesirable in gear applications that utilize precise positioning of gears and/or shafts to perform operations and calculations and to perform positioning adjustments. The backlash <b>130</b> introduces an unknown element to the positioning of first gear <b>110</b>, the second gear <b>120</b>, and any shafts attached to the gears <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. For example, the backlash <b>130</b> makes it difficult to know exactly how the first gear <b>110</b> and the second gear <b>120</b> are positioned with respect to each other. For example, at a stopping point of the gear system, the tooth <b>112</b> of the first gear <b>110</b> may be in contact with the first tooth <b>122</b> or the second tooth <b>124</b> of the second gear <b>120</b> or may be positioned somewhere in between. It is difficult to precisely determine or control the positioning of the gears <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> when the placement of the gears <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> is unknown due to backlash <b>130</b>. This leads inaccurate calculations, operations, and/or adjustments in gear systems.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrate traditional embodiments of anti-backlash gears. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a front view of a traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> where two gears of the anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> are viewed as being directly superimposed on each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a straight-on side view of the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a front view of the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> wherein the two gears are in motion and not perfectly superimposed on each other.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> includes a floating gear <b>210</b> and a fixed gear <b>220</b> that both interface with a central hub <b>202</b>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the floating gear <b>210</b> has been rotated in a clockwise direction relative to the fixed gear <b>220</b>. With the floating gear <b>210</b> rotated relative to the fixed gear <b>220</b>, the spring <b>216</b> stretches and exerts a force on the floating gear <b>210</b> and the fixed gear <b>220</b>. This may be referred to as a &#x201c;loaded position&#x201d; of the gear <b>200</b>. The force exerted on the floating gear <b>210</b> and the fixed gear <b>220</b> acts to pull or rotate the floating gear <b>210</b> back to be directly superimposed over the fixed gear <b>220</b> (See the view illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) when the floating gear <b>210</b> is released. Additionally, as the floating gear <b>210</b> is rotated relative to the fixed gear <b>220</b> the positions of the teeth <b>212</b> and the teeth <b>222</b> are moved closer together.

The closing of the distance between the teeth <b>212</b> and the teeth <b>222</b> allows for a tooth of another gear engaged with the anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> to be squeezed between a tooth <b>212</b> of the floating gear <b>210</b> and a tooth <b>222</b> of the fixed gear <b>220</b>.

When the tooth <b>312</b> of the mating gear <b>324</b> is pinched between the teeth <b>212</b>A and <b>222</b>A, backlash between the teeth of gear <b>200</b> and the teeth of mating gear <b>324</b> is reduced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> is configured to reduce backlash between the tooth <b>312</b> of the mating gear <b>324</b> and the teeth <b>212</b>A, <b>222</b>A of the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b>. The traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> is installed by rotating the floating gear <b>210</b> to create a space between the teeth <b>212</b>A, <b>222</b>A which were previously overlapped in the equilibrium position of the gear <b>200</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Once the floating gear <b>210</b> is rotated to a loaded position and enough space is between tooth <b>212</b>A and tooth <b>222</b>A to accommodate the tooth <b>312</b> of the mating gear <b>324</b> therebetween, the floating gear <b>210</b> is released to return toward equilibrium. In the process of returning toward equilibrium, the teeth <b>222</b>A, <b>212</b>A contact opposite sides of the tooth <b>312</b> of the mating gear <b>324</b>. The force exerted by the springs <b>216</b> continuously tries to get the gears of gear <b>200</b> to return to the equilibrium position.

Due to the pinching action and force of the teeth <b>212</b>A, <b>222</b>A on the tooth <b>312</b> caused by the spring <b>216</b>, backlash between gears is reduced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Traditional anti-backlash gears, such as the gear <b>200</b> described and illustrated herein, have several drawbacks and disadvantages. For example, the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> includes a plurality of separate parts that are assembled into a single gear. The traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> includes at least the floating gear <b>210</b>, the fixed gear <b>220</b>, the central hub <b>202</b>, and the springs <b>216</b>. The parts shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>3</b></figref> do not limit what parts are included in traditional anti-backlash gears. In fact, other gears known in the art may include several other elements not listed here. For example, some traditional anti-backlash gears may include a pin that may be inserted through holes in the floating gear <b>210</b> and the fixed gear <b>220</b> to hold the gear in the loaded position while the gear is installed in place; once in place, the pin may be removed to move the gear back toward equilibrium.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, traditional anti-backlash gears are made in several pieces that must be assembled. This increases the number of manufacturing processes and time it may take to make traditional anti-backlash gears. After all pieces are manufactured, assembly time also needs to be considered. The multiple parts, processes, and time needed to manufacture a single traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> are complex, require additional time and energy to complete, and add possibilities for error in the manufacturing and assembly of the anti-backlash gears.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, additional installation steps are needed to implement traditional anti-backlash gears. For example, a user installing the gear needs to take time and effort to properly move the floating gear <b>210</b> to the loaded position, hold the gear in the loaded position while installing the gear, and release the gear at the right time and in the right place to properly install the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b>. Accordingly, additional skill and training is necessary for users using and installing the gear <b>200</b> and/or other traditional anti-backlash gears. Such additional training and skill adds to the possibility that a traditional anti-backlash gear may be used or installed incorrectly.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Due to the rigid nature of the teeth of the anti-backlash gear <b>200</b>, the gear must be loaded properly before installation to ensure proper force is exerted on the tooth <b>312</b> of the mating gear <b>324</b> by the teeth <b>212</b>A and <b>222</b>A of the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b>. Without proper installation, traditional anti-backlash gears may not prevent or reduce backlash properly, or at all. A user may believe that they have installed the gear correctly but may still unknowingly experience backlash in the system and incorrect positioning of the gears, which may make systems that contain such gears inaccurate and may even cause such systems to malfunction or break. Due to the limitations and disadvantages of traditional anti-backlash gears, there exists a need for simpler, more reliable anti-backlash gears that are more energy efficient, more time efficient, and easier to manufacture, install, and implement.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> illustrate various view of an anti-backlash gear <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a straight-on front view of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the anti-backlash gear. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates a straight-on side view of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b>.

The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may alternatively mate with a linear gear (may be referred to as a rack and pinion gear). The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is not limited to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> and may be modified to resemble a helical gear, bevel gear, miter gear, worm and worm gear, screw gear, or another gear. Additionally, the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may be configured to mate with any of a spur gear, helical gear, linear gear, bevel gear, miter gear, worm and worm gear, screw gear, or other gear. The functionality of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is not necessarily dependent on its geometry and arises more from the compliant or spring-like nature of the compliant members <b>434</b> and compliant teeth <b>432</b>. Thus, the geometry of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may be altered and optimized while continuing to include compliant members as described herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is configured to interface with a mating gear.

The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is particularly suitable in implementations that do not require a high torque load. Further, the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is particularly beneficial when a gear changes its direction of rotation and/or when its important to ensure that a gear is rotated with a high degree of precision.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> does not require the use of a fixed gear and a floating gear, like the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C and <b>3</b></figref>. The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> represents a significant improvement over the traditional anti-backlash gear <b>200</b> because it reduces manufacturing cost, reduces the quantity of separate components that may fail during operation, and enables greater degrees of precision when rotating the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> and a mating gear.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> includes a gear body <b>426</b>.

The mating gear comprises a plurality of mating teeth that are configured to be disposed within the teeth gap <b>438</b> defined by two compliant teeth <b>432</b>. The mating teeth engage with the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> and cause the distance G<b>2</b> of the teeth gap <b>438</b> to widen by causing at least two compliant members <b>434</b> to bend away from a mating tooth. Thus, the distance G<b>2</b> of the teeth gap <b>438</b> changes during operation as the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> interfaces with a mating gear.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the distance G<b>1</b> of the member gap <b>436</b> changes during operation as the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> interfaces with the mating gear. When a mating tooth engages with the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b>, the mating tooth will be disposed within a tooth gap <b>438</b> and cause the neighboring compliant members <b>434</b> to bend away from the mating tooth. Thus, when the neighboring compliant members <b>434</b> bend away from the mating tooth, they will bend inward toward a center point of their respective mating teeth <b>432</b>. Thus, the distance G<b>1</b> of the member gap <b>436</b> will decrease and close when a mating tooth engages with the corresponding tooth gap <b>438</b>. When that mating tooth no longer engages with the corresponding tooth gap <b>438</b>, the compliant members <b>434</b> will bounce back to their equilibrium position and the distance G<b>1</b> of the member gap <b>436</b> will return to its equilibrium position.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The teeth gaps <b>438</b> between the compliant teeth <b>432</b> comprise a tapered geometry such that a proximal portion of the teeth gaps <b>438</b> is narrower than a distal portion of the teeth gaps <b>438</b> (wherein the central hub <b>428</b> defines the interior/proximal region of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b>). The tapered geometry of the teeth gaps <b>438</b> enables the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> to interface with a mating tooth of a mating gear. The mating tooth of the mating gear engages with the tooth gap <b>438</b> between compliant teeth <b>432</b>. The mating tooth may thereby widen the distance G<b>2</b> between the compliant teeth <b>432</b>. When a compliant member <b>434</b> is deformed or deflected by an outside force, (such as a mating tooth of a mating gear) the compliant, elastic nature of each compliant member <b>434</b> acts to move the deflected compliant member <b>434</b> back to its equilibrium position (further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may be fabricated using additive manufacturing processes, including plastic additive manufacturing and/or metal additive manufacturing.

Firstly, while traditional anti-backlash gears are made of multiple different parts, the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may be manufactured as a single indivisible element. For this reason, the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> may be manufactured in one process instead of multiple processes, which are needed for fabricating and assembling traditional anti-backlash gears.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, when traditional anti-backlash gears are installed, they must be pre-loaded by twisting the floating gear or the fixed gear to add tension to the springs. Then traditional anti-backlash gear must be installed and the tension in the springs released at the right time in the right place to properly install the traditional anti-backlash gear. In contrast, the solid nature of the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> allows the gear to engage with other gears in a manner like that of any gear. Accordingly, the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> of the present disclosure is easier to manufacture, install, and use than traditional anti-backlash gears. This reduction in parts, manufacturing processes, and steps to install the anti-backlash gears <b>400</b> described herein money, time, energy, study, and skill that are required in the fabrication and use of traditional anti-backlash gears.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, the flexibility, elasticity, and compliance of compliant members of the anti-backlash gears according to the present disclosure allows the anti-backlash gears to accommodate and fit multiple sizes of gears in a gear system. The flex in compliant members allows said members to flex to accommodate different sized teeth of gears. Accordingly, the anti-backlash gears disclosed herein allow for simpler and more efficient manufacturing, implementation, and use over traditional anti-backlash gears.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> of the present disclosure is not limiting and other similar embodiments of the anti-backlash gears are considered within the scope of this disclosure. For example, the shape of compliant members may be different than that shown in the figures and still be within the scope of the disclosure. For example, compliant members may have a different shape and profile than that shown in the figures and still perform the same or similar functions of preventing backlash in gear systems. Compliant members may have cross-sections that are circular, elliptical, rectangular, or other geometric shapes without departing from the scope of this disclosure. While compliant members are shown as members that are slightly bent at the ends, the compliant members may have a different shape or profile without departing from the disclosure (e.g., straight, curved more, curved less, curved outward, curved inward). Furthermore, any number of compliant members may be used to form a single compliant tooth and any number of compliant members or compliant teeth may be disposed around the anti-backlash gear, depending on the needs of a current situation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">While the anti-backlash gear <b>400</b> is shown as being a substantially circular in shape, the gear may have any acceptable shape known for gears without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
