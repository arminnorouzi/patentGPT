HVAC system <b>10</b> includes HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, a supply air duct <b>20</b>, a return air duct <b>22</b> (collectively, &#x201c;ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>&#x201d;), dampers <b>24</b>, and air filters <b>26</b>. Additionally, HVAC system <b>10</b> includes an HVAC controller <b>30</b> configured to control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to regulate one or more parameters within building <b>12</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a dial <b>32</b> and an analog display <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">HVAC system <b>10</b> may include one or more devices for regulating an environment within building <b>12</b>. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control the comfort level (e.g., temperature and/or humidity) in building <b>12</b> by activating and deactivating HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> in a controlled manner. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> via a wired or wireless communication link <b>38</b>. In some examples, a wired communication link <b>38</b> may connect HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> and HVAC controller <b>30</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be a thermostat, such as, for example, a wall mountable thermostat. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be programmable to allow for user-defined temperature set points to control the temperature of building <b>12</b>. Based on sensed temperature of building <b>12</b>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may turn on HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> or turn off HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> in order to reach the user-defined temperature set point. Although this disclosure describes HVAC controller <b>30</b> (and controllers shown in other figures) as controlling HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, external computing device <b>36</b> may also be configured to perform these functions. The techniques of this disclosure will primarily be described using examples related to temperature, but the systems, devices, and methods described herein may also be used in conjunction with other sensed properties, such as humidity or air quality. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control all of the critical networks of a building, including a security system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may provide heated air (and/or cooled air) via the ductwork throughout the building <b>12</b>. As illustrated, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may be in fluid communication with one or more spaces, rooms, and/or zones in building <b>12</b> via ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, but this is not required. In operation, when HVAC controller <b>30</b> outputs a heat call signal to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> (e.g., a forced warm air furnace) may turn on (begin operating or activate) to supply heated air to one or more spaces within building <b>12</b> via supply air ducts <b>20</b>. HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, which include an air movement device <b>18</b> (e.g., a blower or a fan), can force the heated air through supply air duct <b>20</b>. In this example, cooler air from each space returns to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> (e.g. forced warm air furnace) for heating via return air ducts <b>22</b>. Similarly, when a cool call signal is provided by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, a cooling device (e.g., an air conditioning (AC) unit) of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may turn on to supply cooled air to one or more spaces within building <b>12</b> via supply air ducts <b>20</b>. Air movement device <b>18</b> may force the cooled air through supply air duct <b>20</b>. In this example, warmer air from each space of building <b>12</b> may return to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> for cooling via return air ducts <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some examples, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may include any one or combination of a fan, a blower, a furnace, a heat pump, an electric heat pump, a geothermal heat pump, an electric heating unit, an AC unit, a humidifier, a dehumidifier, an air exchanger, an air cleaner, a damper, a valve, and a fan, however this is not required. HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may include any device or group of devices which contributes to regulating the environment within building <b>12</b> based on signals received from HVAC controller <b>30</b> or contributes to regulating the environment within building <b>12</b> independently from HVAC controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may include one or more dampers <b>24</b> to regulate the flow of air, but this is not required. For example, one or more dampers <b>24</b> may be coupled to HVAC controller <b>30</b> and can be coordinated with the operation of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may actuate dampers <b>24</b> to an open position, a closed position, and/or a partially open position to modulate the flow of air from the one or more HVAC components to an appropriate room and/or space in building <b>12</b>. Dampers <b>24</b> may be particularly useful in zoned HVAC systems, and may be used to control which space(s) in building <b>12</b> receive conditioned air and/or receives how much conditioned air from HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In many instances, air filters <b>26</b> may be used to remove dust and other pollutants from the air inside building <b>12</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, air filters <b>26</b> is installed in return air duct <b>22</b> and may filter the air prior to the air entering HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, but it is contemplated that any other suitable location for air filters <b>26</b> may be used. The presence of air filters <b>26</b> may not only improve the indoor air quality but may also protect the HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> from dust and other particulate matter that would otherwise be permitted to enter HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include any suitable arrangement of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include processing circuitry comprising microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry, or a combination of any of the foregoing devices or circuitry. Accordingly, the processing circuitry may include any suitable structure, whether in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof, to perform the functions ascribed herein to HVAC controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a memory configured to store information within HVAC controller <b>30</b> during operation. The memory may include a computer-readable storage medium or computer-readable storage device. In some examples, the memory includes one or more of a short-term memory or a long-term memory. The memory may include, for example, random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), magnetic discs, optical discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable memories (EEPROM). In some examples, the memory is used to store program instructions for execution by the processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. In some examples, the memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be able to store data to and read data from memory included in external computing device <b>36</b> and/or memory included in external database <b>48</b>. The memory may be used for storing network settings such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or a Media Access Control (MAC) address of HVAC controller <b>30</b>, external computing device <b>36</b>, and/or a router.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a set of wire terminals which make up a terminal block (e.g., a wall plate or a terminal plate) for receiving a set of control wires for one or more HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> of HVAC system <b>10</b>. The memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may store one or more wiring configurations for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, allowing HVAC controller <b>30</b> to determine which of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> are connected to HVAC controller <b>30</b>. The memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may also store settings for HVAC system <b>10</b> which correspond to the one or more wiring configurations for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>. For example, if HVAC controller <b>30</b> is wired to an AC unit of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may determine one or more settings for controlling the AC unit to turn on and turn off.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, the memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may store program instructions, which may include one or more program modules, which are executable by HVAC controller <b>30</b>. When executed by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, such program instructions may cause HVAC controller <b>30</b> to provide the functionality ascribed to it herein. The program instructions may be embodied in software, firmware, and/or RAMware.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a dial <b>32</b> which is located at an outer circumference of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be fixed to a wall or another surface such that dial <b>32</b> may be rotated relative to one or more other components (e.g., analog display <b>34</b>) of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. Dial <b>32</b> may represent a user interface such that processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive, dial <b>32</b> and/or dial circuitry electrically connected to dial <b>32</b>, information indicative of a user input. In some examples, the user input may represent a user selection of a set point parameter value (e.g., a set point temperature), a user selection of information to be displayed by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, or a user selection of another setting. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may smoothly rotate with respect to analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may rotate with one or more steps such that as dial <b>32</b> rotates, dial <b>32</b> &#x201c;snaps&#x201d; into position after every interval of rotational distance. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may smoothly rotate with respect to analog display <b>34</b> and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may output an audio signal (e.g., a clicking noise) for every interval of rotational position (e.g., every one degree) in which dial <b>32</b> rotates.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, dial <b>32</b> does not move inwards in response to a force applied to dial <b>32</b>. For example, dial <b>32</b> may rotate about a center axis which passes through a center of dial <b>32</b> without moving along the center axis in response to one or more forces applied to dial <b>32</b>. When HVAC controller <b>30</b> is mounted on a vertical surface such as a wall, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may prevent dial <b>32</b> from depressing inwards towards the vertical surface while allowing the dial <b>32</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may include a set of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) configured to illuminate a portion or a whole of dial <b>32</b>, but this is not required. The processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may selectively illuminate one or more LEDs of the set of LEDs in order to indicate a set point temperature or convey other information. In some examples, the set of LEDs included in dial <b>32</b> may illuminate dial <b>32</b> to indicate that HVAC system <b>10</b> is in a heating or indicate that HVAC system <b>10</b> is cooling. For example, when HVAC system <b>10</b> is heating (e.g., HVAC controller <b>30</b> is outputting one or more instructions for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to increase a temperature within building <b>12</b>), the LEDs of dial <b>32</b> cause dial <b>32</b> to illuminate at a first color. When HVAC system <b>10</b> is cooling (e.g., HVAC controller <b>30</b> is outputting one or more instructions for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to decrease a temperature within building <b>12</b>), the LEDs of dial <b>32</b> cause dial <b>32</b> to illuminate at a second color.

For example, user devices <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>N (collectively, &#x201c;user devices <b>8</b>&#x201d;) may communicate with HVAC controller <b>30</b> via network <b>6</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may, in some examples, be configured to communicate directly with network <b>6</b> without communicating with network <b>6</b> via a gateway device (e.g., a Wi-Fi router) within building <b>12</b>. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive instructions from one or more of user devices <b>8</b>. The instructions may include, for example, a request to change a set point temperature for an area within building <b>12</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may change the set point temperature in response to receiving the instruction. In turn, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to control the temperature within building <b>12</b> to reach the new set point.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, responsive to detecting a rotation of dial <b>32</b> while HVAC controller <b>30</b> is in the idle state, HVAC controller <b>30</b> transitions out of the idle state to a set point state. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may change a temperature set point for an area within building <b>12</b> in response to detecting the rotation of dial <b>32</b>. In other words, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may determine that a rotation of dial <b>32</b> while HVAC controller <b>30</b> is in the idle state represents a user request to change a temperature set point. In transitioning out of the idle state, the processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may display the temperature set point for the area within building <b>12</b> on analog display <b>34</b>. Additionally, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may display the temperature set point changing as dial <b>32</b> rotates. For example, the analog display <b>34</b> may show the temperature setpoint cycle through a range of degrees, where each change from one degree to another degree is reflected on analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may emit a noise each time the temperature set point changes from one degree value to another degree value.

In the cooling set point mode, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to change a cooling set point, and in the heating set point mode, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to change a heating set point. A cooling set point may represent a temperature set point for controlling HVAC components <b>16</b> to decrease or maintain a temperature within building <b>12</b> as compared with a temperature outside of building <b>12</b>.

For example, if the HVAC controller <b>30</b> sets the heating set point to be greater than the cooling set point, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may simultaneously attempt to heat building <b>12</b> and cool building <b>12</b> when the current temperature is between the heating set point and the cooling set point. Performing only one of heating and cooling is more energy efficient that performing both of heating and cooling at the same time. Consequently, it is beneficial for HVAC controller <b>30</b> to maintain the heating set point to be less than or equal to the cooling set point. Consequently, when processing circuitry <b>42</b> decreases the cooling set point to be lower than an initial heating set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may also decrease the heating set point in unison with the cooling set point. Additionally, or alternatively, when processing circuitry <b>42</b> increases the heating set point to be greater than an initial cooling set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may also increase the cooling set point in unison with the heating set point.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control LEDs <b>58</b> to indicate a change in the heating set point and/or a change in the cooling set point as the changes are happening. In one example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may decrease the cooling set point by two degrees in response to receiving a rotation input to dial <b>32</b>, and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control LEDs <b>58</b> to show the cooling set point &#x201c;move&#x201d; across the set of markers <b>56</b>. For example, as dial <b>32</b> is rotating, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to transition from illuminating a first marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to illuminating a second marker of the set of markers <b>56</b>, and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to transition from illuminating the second marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to illuminating a third marker of the set of markers <b>56</b>. The second marker is one degree lower than the first marker, and the third marker is one degree lower than the second marker. As such, a user may view the transition of the set point by observing the set of markers <b>56</b>.

In turn, the &#x201c;HEAT&#x201d; mode indicator may start blinking, as seen in configuration <b>84</b> of analog display <b>34</b>. After the set point mode is changed from the cooling set point mode to the heating set point mode, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may change the heating temperature set point based on a rotation of dial <b>32</b>. After a period of time following the rotation of dial <b>32</b>, analog display <b>34</b> may transition to sixth configuration <b>86</b>, where the &#x201c;AUTO&#x201d; mode indicator is lit up, indicating a return to the automatic set point mode.

For example, controller <b>30</b> may update one or both of the cooling set point and the heating set point based on information received a user device of user devices <b>16</b> (e.g., user device <b>16</b>A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>. In some examples, user device <b>16</b>A may represent a smart phone, a tablet, a desktop computer, or another device configured to execute an application for controlling one or more parameters of controller <b>30</b>. As such, controller <b>30</b> may receive information indicative of a user selection of the heating set point and/or a user selection of the cooling set point, and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the heating set point and/or the cooling set point based on the user selection.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a third set of configurations of analog display <b>34</b>, in accordance with one or more techniques described herein.

As seen in configuration <b>92</b> of analog display <b>34</b>, the heating set point is initially at marker <b>102</b>B and the cooling set point is initially at marker <b>102</b>C. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive a clockwise rotational input to dial <b>32</b>. In response to the clockwise rotation, analog display <b>34</b> may transition from configuration <b>92</b> to configuration <b>94</b>. At configuration <b>94</b>, the heating set point may reach the temperature value of the cooling set point. As such, HVAC controller <b>30</b> illuminates marker <b>102</b>C to indicate that both of the heating set point and the cooling set are at 72&#xb0; F. Configuration <b>94</b> represents an intermediate configuration in a transition from configuration <b>92</b> to configuration <b>96</b>. In response to the clockwise rotation, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may increase the heating set point to 74&#xb0; F., which is greater than the initial cooling set point of 72&#xb0; F. When HVAC controller <b>30</b> increases the heating set point to 74&#xb0; F., the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may also increase the cooling set point to 74&#xb0; F. to match the heating set point.

Since the heating set point of 70&#xb0; F. is lower than the initial cooling set point 72&#xb0; F., HVAC controller <b>30</b> may decrease the cooling set point from 74&#xb0; F. to the initial cooling set point of 72&#xb0; F. when HVAC controller <b>30</b> decreases the heating set point from 74&#xb0; F. to 70&#xb0; F.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an example operation for changing one or more temperature set points of the HVAC controller <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, in accordance with one or more techniques described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is described with respect to HVAC controller <b>30</b> and HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>.
