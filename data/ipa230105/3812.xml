In this case, in junctions with different sign combinations, the phase is shifted by &#x3c0; radian in order to reduce junction energy (the overlap integral at the junction of the order function becomes positive by shifting the phase). Examples are illustrated in the inset of FIG. 5 on p. 521 of NPL 16, FIG. 1 of p. 912 of NPL 18, and the inset of FIG. 3.34 (a) on p. 194 of NPL 19.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0079">The other of the two junctions is, for example, a junction in which the amplitude of the order function is inverted from positive to negative during the junction without passing an electric current through the junction.

Representative examples are described in NPL 2 and NPL 3. Research on qubits, which are basic elements of quantum computers, has been actually conducted by using this method (NPL 4 to NPL 8).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0089">However, if a magnetic field is applied to the entire device having a target circuit in order to achieve the above method, a portion that is not desired to be exposed to an external magnetic field will also be exposed to the external magnetic field. Even if a line is drawn to a position near the target circuit in order to prevent such a situation, and a magnetic field is generated by a coil near the target circuit, the magnetic field leaked from the lead-in wire causes a magnetic field to be generated at an unintended place. The biggest problem is that, in both cases, the degree of coupling to an external circuit is large, which in turn results in exposure to the noise generated by the external circuit. There is another problem in that the external circuit and the lead-in wire function as an antenna causing crosstalk with the environment, so that information is dissipated. This will significantly reduce the performance of a qubit if the target circuit is a qubit. This effect has already been discussed in detail in NPL 2 and NPL 3 (Originally, NPL 2 and NPL 3 intentionally employ an external field as a phase shifter as a model for studying how quantum information escapes into an environment. In other words, using this as it is only results in construction of a system that is not suitable for qubits.). From the standpoint of engineering, a lead-in wire line for generating an external magnetic field makes a circuit configuration complex and occupies a large area of a superconducting chip, so that the area available for a functional portion is reduced. Such problems are also simply described in NPL 23.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0090">Even in the case of using a method for shifting a phase by passing a current through a non-junction portion without using a magnetic field, that is, the method expressed by Equation (5), since it is a method that uses, for example, a lead-in wire line and an external power supply (NPL 13), the problem of noise related to a lead-in wire line and an external power supply cannot be solved.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0091">A method for supplying a magnetic field or a current that does not require a current supply from an external power supply so as to be disconnected from the external power supply has been also proposed (NPL 10 to NPL 12).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0092">NPL 10 discloses a method of placing a magnetic material adjacent to a target circuit and using a magnetic field that is generated by the magnetic material. However, as described in the disclosure, the magnitude of the generated magnetic field depends on temperature. This implies that it is difficult to adjust the magnitude of a magnetic field. In addition, a magnetic field affects places other than a target circuit, and thus, there is a problem in that it is difficult to design a circuit for integration.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0093">NPL 11 and NPL 12 propose a method in which a closed circuit that is dc-connected to a target circuit is provided and in which a unit flux quantum is captured in the closed circuit so as to cause a phase shift to occur by using the effect of Equation (5) and the effect of Equation (8). This method requires a closed loop having a geometric size that is approximately equal to or larger than that of a target closed circuit, and thus, there is a disadvantage in that the area of a chip having a circuit cannot be effectively used. In addition, a current that flows for a phase shift and a current that is used for a signal are DC-connected to each other, and thus, both the currents are mixed. The current that is used for a signal can also bypass a control loop, and thus, a problem related to electric current redistribution in the case of integration also becomes complex, which makes circuit design difficult.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0094">In addition, in the method described in NPL 11 and the method described in NPL 12, the critical current of a control loop needs to be greater than the critical current of a Josephson junction of a target circuit. This implies that it is difficult to move a control magnetic flux quantum in and out while maintaining a low temperature (i.e., at a superconducting transition temperature or lower). In other words, circuit reconfiguration cannot be performed while maintaining a low temperature.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0095">Furthermore, a control closed loop also serves as an antenna, and thus, for example, there may be a problem in that it will easily absorb external noise. All of these are structural problems due to the DC coupling of the control loop and the target closed circuit, and these problems cannot be solved as long as this method is used.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0096">In recent years, a &#x3c0; junction has attracted attention as a method of achieving a phase shifter without using an additional control loop.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0097">As a &#x3c0; junction, a method that uses d-wave superconductivity or the like, which has been described in, has been found to be experimentally possible in NPL 16 to NPL 19 and has been applied to superconducting electronics in PTL 7 and NPL 20.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0098">However, in order to use this method, it is necessary to form a junction between niobium and a copper-oxide high-temperature superconductor such as YBCO or a junction between copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors. This junction technology is so difficult that it cannot be compared with a junction formed by using only niobium and is still in a research stage, and a processing technology at a practical level has not been mature enough.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0099">As a &#x3c0; junction, there is also a method that uses a magnetic material. This method is a technology that has been theoretically proposed by NPL 22 more than 30 years ago. However, it takes 15 years to achieve (NPL 25), and the technology is still in a development stage. It is a technology that has recently been introduced in Japan (NPL 26) and is a promising technology.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0100">However, a phase shifter that uses this method needs to be incorporated in a target circuit in a direct current manner due to its structure. A normal junction and a junction using a magnetic material need to be incorporated in the same circuit, and in addition, the absolute values of critical current densities of these junctions need to be the same. High technology is required for adjusting the critical currents of different types of junctions with a favorable mutual affinity, and such a phase shifter has not yet been put to practical use.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0101">In addition, it is not always fit in with superconductivity also in terms of process. In other words, a superconducting material and a magnetic material are alternately handled, and thus, it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of occurrence of a trouble such as contamination, which is mixing of a magnetic material into a superconductor. When contamination occurs, the superconducting property is destroyed. This is a disadvantage of using a magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0102">In other words, to add a line of a magnetic material that is still in a research stage in terms of materials technology to process lines of aluminum and niobium, which have been used as standard materials for superconducting electronics, has a risk that a currently working superconducting line will stop working.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0103">As a method of causing a phase shift, there is also a method that uses a phase difference soliton. Although this method is very favorable, a line with a phase difference soliton and a line that handles a signal are still connected in a direct current manner. Consequently, there is a technical problem to overcome. This technical problem will now be described.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0104">In the methods that have been proposed in the related art (PTL 2 to PTL 4 and PTL 6), a phase difference soliton is to be generated on the same line as a target circuit. This is because the main purpose of this technology is to use a phase difference soliton itself as an information carrier.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0105">A phase difference soliton is obtained by a special superconductor that is called a multicomponent superconductor, and a method for searching for such a superconductor and a method of achieving such a superconductor have also been proposed (PTL 11 to PTL 13).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0106">Regarding a phase difference soliton, PTL 2 to PTL 6 and PTL 11 to PTL 13 disclose that a multicomponent superconductor that generates a phase difference soliton is used alone for electronics.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0107">The reasons why only using a multicomponent superconductor alone for electronics has been proposed are as follows.

Basically, the circuit <b>103</b> and the phase shifter <b>101</b> vertically overlap each other, and thus, the bulkiness of a phase shifter in the area direction of a circuit, which has been mentioned as a problem in NPL 11 and NPL 12, is eliminated.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0183">In addition, the phase shifter <b>101</b> is disposed directly under the circuit <b>103</b>, and thus, leakage of a magnetic field to places other than the circuit <b>103</b> can be minimized. Note that also in the case where the phase shifter <b>101</b> is disposed directly above the circuit <b>103</b>, a similar effect can be obtained. The fact that a magnetic flux is likely to concentrate around a hole or a vortex also provides the effect of suppressing leakage of a magnetic field to places other than the circuit <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0184">In the case of a bi-layer film that is formed by sandwiching the Josephson barrier layer <b>7</b> between the first superconducting ultrathin film <b>8</b> and the second superconducting ultrathin film <b>9</b>, which are the same type of superconducting ultrathin films, the fractional flux amount is absolutely determined by the ratio between the thicknesses of the films (NPL 35). Thus, in particular, a concern about variations in the amount of magnetic flux depending on temperature, which has been mentioned as a problem in NPL 10, is greatly reduced.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0185">In addition, the fractional flux amount can be freely set by the ratio between the thicknesses of the films. This provides a degree of freedom that is not disclosed in the method that uses a &#x3c0; junction in which a phase shift is fixed to &#x3c0; radian (PTL 7 to PTL 10 and NPL 16 to NPL 30). In addition, the phase shifter <b>101</b> itself is a superconductor, and thus, it also serves as a noise filter.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0186">A superconductor can only be in a state of allowing specific magnetic flux quanta such as a fractional flux quantum and a unit flux quantum or a state of not allowing any of them and cannot continuously be in an intermediate state between these states.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0187">In other words, fluctuations in the magnetic field near the ring are likely to be suppressed by the phase shifter itself. NPL 11 and NPL 12 also disclose that a ring added for a phase shifter plays a similar role. By playing this role, however, a Meissner current or a screening current flows through the ring, which in turn results in noise.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0188">In contrast, according to the present embodiment, the current that flows along the outer edge of the phase shifter <b>101</b> is in charge of blocking disturbance. On the other hand, it is a current around a vortex inside the phase shifter <b>101</b> (a superconducting disk) or around a hole formed in the phase shifter <b>101</b> (i.e., the current flowing along the inner edge) that generates a fractional flux quantum as the phase shifter <b>101</b>, and thus, it is perfectly protected against disturbance.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0189">The phase shifter <b>101</b> that has been described in the present embodiment can be replaced as it is with many memory devices of single-flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits that have been proposed (e.g., NPL 9, NPL 11, NPL 12, NPL 20, and NPL 29) and phase shifters for qubits (NPL 2 to NPL 8, PTL 10, NPL 21, NPL 23, and NPL 27) in principle and has extremely high compatibility with the related art.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0190">In principle, the size of the phase shifter <b>101</b> can be reduced to the size of a vortex. With the effect of the thin films, the size of a vortex in the case of niobium can easily be reduced to smaller than 1 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0191">In addition, in the case of selecting niobium as the first superconducting ultrathin film <b>8</b> and the second superconducting ultrathin film <b>9</b> of the phase shifter <b>101</b>, all the circuits can be fabricated by the process for niobium. In the case of employing the infrastructure for fabricating a superconducting circuit using niobium, it is not necessary to make any changes to the infrastructure for niobium. In addition, as the infrastructure for niobium, the manufacturing technology is mature, and thus, it is easy to handle. Accordingly, the existing SFQ and qubit technologies can be fully utilized as legacies. Especially for qubits, an external field can be completely replaced with the phase shifter <b>101</b> of the present embodiment while suppressing crosstalk with the environment, which has been a problem in the method of using an external field as a phase shifter, to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0192">As described above, the structure according to the present embodiment can bring revolutionary changes into both technologies for SFQ memories and qubits.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0193">Note that, although a method of applying a fractional flux quantum to a SFQ memory is also disclosed in NPL 41, no specific technical contents, such as those described in the present embodiment, are disclosed or proposed in NPL 41.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0194">A method for searching for multicomponent superconductivity usable for the phase shifter <b>101</b> by detecting a fractional flux quantum is a highly potential application circuit using the present invention. Advantageous effects of this application circuit will be described below.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0195">As described in PTL 6, NPL 33, and NPL 34, in the related art, fractional flux quanta have been determined by using a scanning SQUID magnetic susceptibility microscope. The present invention has the following advantages over the above method and provides great advantageous effects.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0196">The present invention provides a structure in which the distance between a device that detects a magnetic flux and a target sample is small and in which substantially the entire magnetic flux amount of a target fractional flux quantum is guided to a sensing device (a ring of a SQUID) at once.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0197">In contrast, in a method of the related art that uses a scanning SQUID magnetic susceptibility microscope, a gap is generated between a sample and a detection device, the gap being much larger than the gap that can be generated when the sample and the detection device are brought into close contact with each other, and the tendency for a large amount of magnetic flux that does not pass through the detection device to be generated cannot be eliminated (NPL 34). In addition, because of the structure in which a detection coil is spatially scanned so as to detect its magnetic flux amount, unlike the case where all the magnetic flux of a fractional flux quantum enters the detection coil at once, it is necessary to calculate the total amount by integration after measurement. In the integration, it is necessary to subtract the offset of a measurement system. Due to this subtraction, the fact that there will be large arbitrariness in estimation of an absolute amount cannot be denied. The present invention can suppress this arbitrariness to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0198">In addition, it also has a great advantageous effect on convenience relating to measurement. A device such as that disclosed in NPL 34 involves a large consumption of liquid helium. More specifically, determination of whether a single target sample includes a fractional flux quantum requires consumption of 100 liters of helium and a measurement time of 24 hours or more in total. In addition, the measurement that takes 24 hours or more requires a person who continuously monitors and controls the operation of a measurement system. This is because a person needs to intervene in the measurement approximately every 30 minutes in order to check a measurement location and temperature stability, to monitor the flow rate of helium for temperature control, to monitor whether measurement equipment is operating properly, and to check whether the gap between a sample and a sensor deviates from a proper value with time.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0199">In other words, a fully automated measurement cannot be performed. The device itself is delicate and needs constant repairs to operate, and only a highly skilled person can operate the device. In addition, as described in NPL 42, there has been an imbalance between the supply and demand of helium, resulting in a shortage in the supply of helium, and the price of helium has skyrocketed. In order to cause the device to operate, it is necessary to prepare about 400,000 yen only for liquid helium per experiment. Under this situation, the device is caused to operate only about three times a year, and it actually takes about 20 years to determine a fractional flux quantum. It is impractical to use such a device for searching for a multicomponent superconducting material. In contrast, in application of the present invention, only the following need to be prepared: a basic skill for cryogenic experiment, a freezing store that does not use any liquid helium, measurement equipment having a basic electrical property, and a normal control computer. The existence or nonexistence of a fractional flux quantum can also be determined immediately. In addition, a continuous automatic operation can be easily performed 24 hours 365 days, and it brings great advantageous effects with its advantages.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0200">Although, NPL 43 discloses a method of processing a sample that is subjected to searching and measuring the magnetic susceptibility of the sample, it is clear that the present invention also has an advantage over this method. The technical contents disclosed in NPL 43 will now be briefly described. A hole is formed in a target sample, and the sample is placed onto a cantilever. When a magnetic flux quantum enters the hole, the magnetic flux quantum causes a change in magnetization. It is a method of measuring, with high accuracy, the change in the magnetization by measuring a shift in the resonance frequency of the cantilever.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0201">In such a method, there is always a possibility that a problem concerning evaluation of magnetic susceptibility when there is a magnetic flux amount &#x3a6;<sub>0 </sub>of a magnetic flux quantum will occur. In other words, a problem is likely to occur in calibration of the amount measured by a measurement device, that is, a calibration process. Although the magnetic flux amount &#x3a6;<sub>0 </sub>is an absolutely constant amount, how much magnetization a target material has, when the target material has the magnetic flux amount &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>, depends on the geometric shape of the target material or the London penetration depth of the target material, which is a superconducting property thereof.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0202">Thus, if calibration that is performed while mistaking the magnetic susceptibility when the target material has a magnetic flux amount 2&#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>, which is twice &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>, for the magnetic susceptibility when the target material has the magnetic flux amount &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>, is used as a standard, a possibility of drawing a wrong conclusion that the magnetization is obtained by &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>/2 despite the fact that the target material has only the magnetic flux amount &#x3a6;<sub>0 </sub>cannot be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0203">In addition, as actually described in NPL 43, magnetization derived from a target magnetic flux quantum is extremely small compared to the background of measurement, and there is also the arbitrariness when its slight change is determined by subtracting the background.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0204">In the present invention, an absolute amount of deviation from the amount of magnetic flux that is an integral multiple of a magnetic flux quantum can be directly estimated as the critical current of the DC-SQUID device <b>100</b>, and in the first place, there is no background problem such as that mentioned above. In addition, calibration of a magnetic flux quantum &#x3a6;<sub>0 </sub>is not necessary in principle. These are great advantageous effects that are alternatives to a method of the related art that requires calibration of the magnetic flux quantum &#x3a6;<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0205">In addition, for reference, the problem concerning calibration of the magnetic flux quantum &#x3a6;<sub>0 </sub>has not been solved in the fractional flux quantum evaluation technology disclosed in NPL 33 as in the technology disclosed in NPL 43.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0206">In the technology disclosed in NPL 33, an object to be measured has a ring-like shape, and a change in the amount of the current that flows through the ring is measured by replacing it with a change in the mutual induction current with a sensing coil. There is arbitrariness in calibration of the mutual induction coefficient. There is also arbitrariness that comes from a large background. The present invention has an advantageous effect of suppressing these arbitrarinesses to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0207">In addition, as described in PTL 11, although a method of applying an alternating-current electric field to a material to be determined and determining from its response whether it is multicomponent has been proposed, an absolute amount of the magnetic flux amount of a generated fractional flux quantum cannot be determined by this method, and in addition, it cannot be determined by this method whether it is applicable to electronics. Also regarding this, the present invention has advantageous effects of determining an absolute amount of a fractional flux quantum and determining applicability to electronics.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0208">Here, in order to avoid misunderstanding, fundamental differences between the technology for measuring a fractional flux quantum disclosed in NPL 16 and the technology disclosed in the present invention will also be described.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0209">NPL 16 discloses a method of forming a closed loop including a junction by using a sample and measuring a fractional flux quantum. This is originally intended to detect a sign inversion of a superconducting order function, and the technical contents are different from those of the present invention. In addition, a feature of the present invention is detecting a phase shift of a superconducting order function that is generated by a target material without the assistance of a junction, and the physical contents are also completely different from those of NPL 16.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0210">Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described above, arbitrary modifications may be freely made within the gist of the present invention. In either case, according to the present invention, by capturing a fractional flux quantum in a phase shifter and overlapping with a target circuit, a phase shift can be easily generated in the target circuit without increasing the area of the circuit. This method enables a circuit design that has a configuration extremely simpler and a high reliability compared to a qubit phase shifter of the related art and a phase shifter in an SFQ circuit of the related art and that easily replaces one in the related art. The present invention provides an innovative measure for improving integration of low-temperature memory, which has been difficult to achieve in superconducting electronics, a long coherence time in a qubit.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0180" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0211"><b>1</b> upper electrode</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0212"><b>2</b> lower electrode</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0213"><b>3</b> direct-current power supply</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0214"><b>4</b> direct-current voltage measuring instrument</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0215"><b>5</b> Josephson barrier layer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0216"><b>6</b> insulating layer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0217"><b>7</b> Josephson barrier layer</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0218"><b>8</b> first superconducting ultrathin film</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0219"><b>9</b> second superconducting ultrathin film</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0220"><b>10</b> hole</li>        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0221"><b>100</b> direct-current superconducting quantum phase interference device (DC-SQUID device)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0222"><b>101</b> phase shifter (superconductor)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0013" num="0223"><b>103</b> circuit (closed-loop circuit directly used for computation or storage)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0014" num="0224">D outer diameter of SQUID ring</li>        <li id="ul0004-0015" num="0225">X place where fractional vortex is present</li>        <li id="ul0004-0016" num="0226">Y unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0017" num="0227">P<b>1</b> to P<b>4</b> position</li>        <li id="ul0004-0018" num="0228">PL Josephson junction</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="8.47mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="8.47mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="9.14mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="8.13mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="8.47mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00006" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00006.NB"><img id="EMI-M00006" he="8.13mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00006.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00007" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00007.NB"><img id="EMI-M00007" he="8.47mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00007.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00008" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00008.NB"><img id="EMI-M00008" he="9.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00008.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00009" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00009.NB"><img id="EMI-M00009" he="9.91mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00009.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00010" nb-file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00010.NB"><img id="EMI-M00010" he="8.47mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003813A1-20230105-M00010.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
