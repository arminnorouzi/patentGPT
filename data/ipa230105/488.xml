Such apparatus generally include a pair of jaws or finger-like structures between which the body tissue to be joined is placed. When the surgical stapling apparatus is actuated, or &#x201c;fired&#x201d;, longitudinally moving firing bars contact staple drive members in one of the jaws. The staple drive members push the surgical staples through the body tissue and into an anvil in the opposite jaw which forms the staples. If body tissue is to be removed or separated, a knife blade can be provided in the jaws of the apparatus to cut the body tissue between the lines of staples.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Surgical supports, e.g., meshes or buttress materials, may be used in combination with surgical stapling apparatus to bridge, repair, and/or reinforce tissue defects within a patient. A clinician may manually attach the buttress materials to the surgical stapling apparatus in the operating room during a surgical procedure, or utilize a surgical stapling apparatus including buttress materials pre-installed thereon, e.g., by an expensive automated attachment process. The buttress material reinforces the staple or suture line as well as covers the juncture of the body tissues to reduce leakage prior to healing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to buttress material attachment onto a surgical stapling apparatus. Surgical buttresses and buttress attachment assemblies of this disclosure are designed to make buttress material attachment in the operating room a simple, straightforward, and cost-effective procedure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a surgical stapling apparatus including a loading unit and a surgical buttress assembly.

Accordingly, while the body <b>192</b>, the proximal tab <b>194</b>, and the distal tab <b>196</b> of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> may be flexible and have a little give (e.g., when formed from fibers and/or a foam), stretching of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> primarily occurs in the expandable region <b>198</b>. The expandable region <b>198</b> is formed from elastic materials that stretch upon application of a force thereto and return to its original shape in the absence of the force.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a method of loading the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> onto the staple cartridge assembly <b>150</b>, the proximal tab <b>194</b> of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> is slid over the hooks <b>162</b> of the hook assembly <b>160</b> such that the fingers <b>166</b> pass through the proximal opening <b>195</b> to retain the proximal tab <b>194</b> of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> thereon, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The distal tab <b>196</b> of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> is then pulled distally in the direction of arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d; such that the body <b>192</b> of the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> extends over the tissue facing surface <b>156</b> of the staple cartridge assembly <b>150</b> and the expandable region <b>198</b> transitions to the expanded state so that the distal tab <b>196</b> can be looped around the cartridge tip <b>158</b>. Upon engagement of the distal tab <b>196</b> with the cartridge tip <b>158</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the expandable region <b>198</b> returns to its unexpanded state and the staple cartridge assembly <b>150</b>, loaded with the cartridge buttress <b>190</b>, is ready for use.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally or alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, an anvil assembly <b>140</b> may include a hook assembly <b>160</b> for releasably securing a proximal tab <b>184</b> of an anvil buttress <b>180</b> to the anvil assembly <b>140</b>. The anvil buttress <b>180</b> is substantially the same as the cartridge buttress <b>190</b> and includes a body <b>182</b> configured and dimensioned for positioning on the tissue facing surface <b>146</b> of the anvil assembly <b>140</b>, a proximal tab <b>184</b> extending proximally from the body <b>182</b>, an expandable region <b>188</b> extending distally from the body <b>182</b>, and a distal tab <b>186</b> extends distally from the expandable region <b>188</b>. In aspects in which both the staple cartridge assembly <b>150</b> and the anvil assembly <b>140</b> include a hook assembly <b>160</b>, the hook assemblies <b>160</b> are positioned in either lateral or longitudinal spaced relation relative to each other so as not to interfere with open and closing of the first and second jaw members <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The expandable region <b>188</b>, <b>198</b> of the anvil and cartridge buttresses <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> minimizes the occurrence of buttress deformation during the loading process by returning the anvil and cartridge buttresses <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> back to their original shape (e.g., providing tension or tautness) after the anvil and cartridge buttresses <b>180</b>, <b>190</b> have been elongated during assembly over the hook assembly <b>160</b> and/or the anvil or cartridge tips <b>148</b>, <b>158</b>.
