A heat sink or a heat dissipating component may be arranged on the chip, facilitating the elimination of the heat dissipation effect of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b>. Although the thickness of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b> along the first direction AB may be increased, but the manufacturing area thereof along the second direction CD may be reduced. In addition, considering that the blind hole is limited by the dielectric thickness, the increased thickness of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b> in the first direction AB may be conducive to better setting the blind hole.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Along the first direction AB, the first electronic element <b>14</b> arranged on the substrate <b>11</b> may be an inductive element. A switching element <b>211</b> such as a transistor or a MOS tube and other semiconductor element product such as a capacitor or PMIC may be arranged on the inductive element. When the circuit board is a PCB mother board, the first electronic element <b>14</b> may be sunk into the PCB mother board. A PMIC, a resistor or a capacitor may be surface-mounted on the inductive element. The outer surfaces of the PMIC, the resistor and the capacitor may be treated for heat dissipation. If the PMIC is a plastic-package means, then the PMIC does not need to be re-plastic-packaged.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, regarding the power density U, which may be calculated by U=P/S, since the area S in the first direction AB decreases, if the power P of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b> remains unchanged, then the heat dissipation performance of the second electronic element <b>2</b> is improved because of that, and the computing power of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b> is increased. In other words, the number of on and off frequencies of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) in the second electronic component is increased. IGBT is a composite fully-controlled voltage-driven power semiconductor device composed of a bipolar transistor (BJT) and an insulated gate field effect transistor (MOS), and has the advantages of both the BJT and the MOS. The IGBT may greatly increase the power density of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b>, improve the working performance of the voltage regulation module <b>200</b>, and may have a wide range of applications in the fields of CPU and GPU.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">To solve the above-mentioned technical problem, another technical solution adopted by the present disclosure is to provide a voltage stabilizer <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a voltage stabilizer according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.
