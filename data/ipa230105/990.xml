These events are triggered by cytokines and growth factors that are released at the site of injury. Many factors can complicate or interfere with normal adequate wound healing. Chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers are particularly troublesome and challenging to treat.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A scar is the mark left in the skin by new connective tissue that replaces tissue which has been injured. Scarring in the skin after trauma, surgery, burn or sports injury can be a medical problem, resulting in loss of function, restriction of tissue movement and adverse psychological effects. Skin fibrosis, an irreversible pathological process that causes a loss of normal tissue structure and organ function, is associated with scarring. While the pathways and processes underlying scar formation have been better understood in the recent years, no effective therapeutic approaches for scar management are available, and there are no prescription drugs for the prevention or treatment of dermal scarring.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently available techniques for treating scarring (e.g., silicone sheeting (pressure therapy), topical ointments, resurfacing, peel, dermabrasion, lasers, cryosurgery, bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil injection, excision (revision surgery, radiotherapy), reconstruction possibly with skin grafts, flaps, etc.) focus on improving the aesthetics of existing scars, and have issues related to scarring recurrence and side-effects, such as dermal atrophy and hypopigmentation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Wnt pathway has been recently shown to play a key role in dermal fibrosis and scarring. The Wnt pathway is an evolutionary conserved pathway that regulates crucial aspects of cell fate determination, cell polarity, cell migration, neural patterning, and organogenesis during embryonic development. This pathway is instrumental in ensuring proper tissue development in embryos and tissue maintenance in adults. Wnt signaling is involved at the beginning stages of skin development. Following gastrulation, embryonic cells of the ectoderm and the mesoderm differentiate to form the epidermis and dermis, respectively.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although there are at least three distinct Wnt signaling pathways involved in the signal transduction process, the canonical (or &#x3b2;-catenin dependent) Wnt pathway is the most understood. &#x3b2;-Catenin is the key effector molecule resulting from the signaling of the canonical Wnt pathway, and its protein levels are regulated through a &#x201c;destruction complex&#x201d;. In the absence of a Wnt signal, the transcriptional activator &#x3b2;-catenin is actively degraded in the cell by the actions of a protein complex, designated the &#x201c;destruction complex&#x201d;. Within this complex, Axin-1 and -2 with adenomatous polypsis coli form a scaffold that facilitates &#x3b2;-catenin phosphorylation by casein-kinase 19&#x3b1; and glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3b2;. Phosphorylated &#x3b2;-catenin is recognized and ubiquitinylated, resulting in its proteosomal degradation. Tankryase I and II (TNK1 and 2) are poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that function to parsylate and destabilize Axin-1 and -2 proteins, thus destabilizing the &#x3b2;-catenin destruction complex. Once the destruction complex is destabilized, this allows &#x3b2;-catenin to be dephosphorylated, and subsequently stabilized and allowed to accumulate in the cytoplasm and enter the cell nucleus, where it interacts with members of the Tcf/Lef family. &#x3b2;-catenin converts the Tcf proteins into potent transcriptional activators by recruiting co-activator proteins, thus ensuring efficient activation of Wnt target genes. The Wnt pathway, once activated by the Wnt family of natural ligands, upregulates TNK1 and 2 to help destabilize the destruction complex. Studies have shown that TNK1 and 2 are critical regulators of canonical Wnt signaling.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Canonical Wnt signaling is over-activated in a variety of tumors where it plays a central role in cell growth and metastasis. In addition, the Wnt pathway has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in the adult epidermis, indirectly impacting the rate and extent of skin wound healing and fibrosis or scarring. Further, the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway has been shown to cause overstimulation of dermal fibroblasts, which can give rise to myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are endowed with contractile function, which allows them to play a role in extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers to close open wounds. Overexpression of myofibroblasts causes excess collagen and ECM protein secretion, which in turn causes fibrosis and scarring. Sustained &#x3b2;-catenin activity in dermal fibroblasts promotes fibrosis by upregulating expression of ECM protein-coding genes. &#x3b2;-Catenin levels have been shown to regulate wound size and mediate the effect of TGF-&#x3b2; in cutaneous healing. The Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway has been shown to be upregulated in hypertrophic scars and keloid fibroblasts. Thus, the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway induces &#x3b2;-catenin signaling in cutaneous mesenchymal cells, leading to their activation and induction of a sustained fibrotic response.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">TNK1 and 2 have been shown to be druggable targets for modulation of the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway. However, recently it has been demonstrated that systemic inhibition of TNK1 and 2 can cause intestinal toxicity due to inhibition of intestinal crypt cell renewal, a process primarily driven by the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin pathway.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">XAV939 is a small molecule that selectively inhibits Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin-mediated transcription through TNK 1 and 2 inhibition with an IC50 of 11 nM/4 nM in cell-free assays, regulates axin levels, and does not affect CRE, NF-&#x3ba;K, or TGF-&#x3b2;. Recently, topical application of XAV939 in a mouse ear punch assay demonstrated that XAV939 significantly increased rate of wound closure with reduced fibrosis (scarring). However, XAV939 was dissolved in DMSO and used only as a &#x201c;research tool&#x201d; compound due to its very low aqueous solubility (&#x3c;1 mg/mL). The problem with this approach is that humans cannot tolerate the use of DMSO. A soluble form of XAV939 suitable for humans is required for practical and medical use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect of the present invention, a composition for treating a wound is provided.

The covalent linking can be accomplished by using a linker (or linker moiety). In some embodiments, the linker can include 2-25 carbons. In some embodiments, the linker is linear. In other embodiments, the linker is branched. The linker can be saturated or unsaturated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">In some embodiments, the linker can comprise a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>25 </sub>alkylene group, where the carbons and hydrogens in the alkylene group can be substituted by oxygen or other atoms or groups such as hydroxy, carboxy, amino, alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkynyl, nitro, etc. In some embodiments, the linker can comprise one or more &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O&#x2014; units.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">In some embodiments, the linker comprises -R<sup>x</sup>-R<sup>S</sup>-R<sup>y</sup>-, wherein R<sup>x </sup>and R<sup>y </sup>are each independently selected from the group consisting of &#x2014;CO&#x2014;, &#x2014;COO&#x2014;, &#x2014;NH&#x2014;, &#x2014;NH&#x2014;NH&#x2014;, &#x2014;NH&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CO&#x2014;, &#x2014;CS&#x2014;, &#x2014;S&#x2014;, &#x2014;O&#x2014;, and wherein R<sup>S </sup>(which is also referred to as the spacer group in this application) can be an unsubstituted or substituted, saturated or unsaturated linear alkylene group having 2-20 backbone carbons.

In some embodiments, in the GO-HA conjugate, the weight ratio of GO:HA can be from about 1:1 to about 1:20, or from about 1:6 to about 1:10.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">In general, the composition overall can appear as a slightly dark or black viscous liquid. XAV939 is evenly dispersed in the viscous suspension, which is stable at room temperature for months. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises a surfactant that enhances mixability or solubility of hydrophobic substances in water. In some examples, the surfactant can be a non-ionic hydrophilic material such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PEG can have a number-averaged molecular weight of from about 100 to about 10,000 Daltons, or about 200 to about 4000 Daltons, e.g., from about 200 to about 1000, from about 200 to about 800, from about 200 to about 500, from about 200 to about 400, from about 300 to about 400, from about 350 to about 450, about 200, about 250, about 300, about 350, about 400, about 450, about 500, about 550, about 600, about 650, about 700, about 750, about 800, about 850, about 900, about 950, about 1000 Daltons, etc. In some embodiments, the PEG can be present in the composition in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 20 wt % of that of the total composition. For example, the PEG can be from about 0.2 wt % to about 10 wt %, or from about 0.5 wt % to about 10 wt %, or from about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % of the total composition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">Other non-ionic hydrophilic material such as copolymers of PEG and PPG (polypropylene glycol), e.g., poloxamers, can also be used. In one example, Poloxamer-188 (which has an average molecular weight of about 8400 Daltons) can be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">In some embodiments, the composition further comprises pharmaceutical carriers or excipients compounds or materials which enable the compositions to be presented in topically administrable semi-solid aqueous gel forms. For example, carboxymethylcellulose can be used as a gel-forming agent. However, other cellulose derivatives such as microcrystalline cellulose as well as polysaccharides such as alginate and agarose, tragacanth, guar gum, xanthum gum, are also suitable as gel-forming agents. The gel may, if required, be made thicker and/or stiffer by addition of a relatively resilient gel-forming material such as a cross-linked fibrous protein, e.g. gelatin or collagen cross-linked with formaldehyde.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">In some embodiments, the composition can be in a form of a cream, which can include those excipients suitable for a cream formulation, such as paraffin oil, vaseline, wax, organic esters such as cetyl palmitate, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">In some embodiments, the composition of the invention further comprises a thickener for desired viscosity of the composition for skin delivery. For example, the thickener can include hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). HPC can make the composition into a smooth film for easy application. It also reduces evaporation and allows the wound to stay moist longer, a factor that has been shown to improve healing and result in decreased scarring. There are different grades of HPC available according to molecular weights or viscosity of certain concentrations of HPC water solution.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034">In some embodiments of the composition, XAV939 can constitute from about 0.001 wt % to about 5 wt % of the total composition (including water). In some embodiments, XAV939 can constitute from about 0.01 wt % to about 2 wt %, from about 0.02 wt % to about 1 wt %, or from about 0.05 wt % to about 0.5 wt % of the total composition. In some embodiments, GO-HA constitutes from about 0.001 wt % to about 5 wt % of the total composition. In some embodiments, GO-HA can constitute from about 0.01 wt % to about 2 wt %, from about 0.02 wt % to about 1 wt %, or from about 0.05 wt % to about 0.5 wt % of the total composition.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">In the compositions as described herein, other pharmaceutical or therapeutic compounds may be included in addition, or as an alternative, to XAV939. In other words, the compositions with XAV939 present or with XAV939 removed can also serve as a base dispersion medium in which other pharmaceutical or therapeutic agents, especially those which are hydrophobic, may be dispersed, e.g., for topical administration to treat wound. These agents may include antifibrotic compounds such as pirfenidone, halofuginone, nintedanib, tocilizumab, rilonacept, etc., anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, antibiotics, etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">In another aspect of the invention, a medical device is provided, which includes the composition as described herein, and a substrate upon which the composition is applied. The medical device can be in a form that facilitates topical administration of the composition, where the substrate can be constructed with suitable strength and flexibility for covering, securing and/or protecting the wound. For example, the substrate can be a patch, a pad, a tape, a bandage, a gauze, a suture, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">In yet another aspect of the invention, a method of treating a cutaneous or dermal wound in a subject (e.g., a human or a non-human animal) is provided. The method comprises contacting the wound with an effective amount of the composition as described herein. The wound can be a type where its normal healing is accompanied by scar formation. The wound can be a surgical wound that is caused by a physical impact that disrupts the structure and function of the skin (such as a laceration, abrasion, cut, scratch or puncture by a knife, scalpel, bullet, or other sharp or blunt objects). The wound can also be caused by excessive (low or high) temperature, such as a burn. The wound can also be a chronic wound that does not heal in expected time due to the lack of one or more of the main requirements of healing, including a good supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients, and a clean and infection-free environment. Examples of chronic wounds include ischemic wounds where the wound area is not getting sufficient blood supply. Diabetic ulcers are a common type of ischemic wounds.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">The composition(s) of the present invention described herein can be administered by applying the composition(s) topically on the wound site.

In some examples, this is accomplished by dissolving XAV939 first in a non-ionic hydrophilic polymer, e.g., PEG-400 (or PEG 400, having an average molar mass of about 400), and then the XAV939 solution is added into the GO-HA conjugate water solution.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043">The present invention provides a wound treatment strategy that simultaneously addresses several facets of wound healing by synergistically combining a multi-functional scaffold (GO) conjugated to a highly hygroscopic material (HA) traditionally beneficial in wound healing, and aqueous solubilization of a potent Wnt pathway inhibitor (XAV939) for improved healing of cutaneous wounds with reduced scarring. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed the compositions and methods of the present invention can prevent, reduce, or inhibit dermal fibrosis and scarring in wound healing by inhibiting TNK1 and 2 via XAV939 targeting the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin in the skin, thereby directing wound healing toward a regenerative process rather than a fibrotic process. It is believed that XAV939 is coated onto the GO as a nanocarrier due to the ability of GO to complex (via &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; interactions) hydrophobic compounds, and with the hydrophilic HA linked to GO, rendering the hydrophobic compounds &#x201c;water soluble&#x201d;. Also, GO may serve as a scaffold for cell growth and communication due to its good biocompatibility, and properties that influence cell-cell-communication, cell division and cell fate, as well as possible suppression of microbes.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044">Additional benefits of the topical composition and topical administration of embodiments of the present invention is low toxicity and high bioavailability of the beneficial components to the site of injury/wound.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">The following examples are provided for purpose of illustration of certain aspects of the description herein and should not be deemed to limit the invention in any way.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0046">The instrumentation used in the Examples: FT-IR: Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR with a SmartOrbi Diamond ATR accessory; 1H NMR: 500 MHz Bruker DRX500 or AV-500 NMR spectrometer; UV-Vis: Shimadazu Pharma Spec UV1700.
