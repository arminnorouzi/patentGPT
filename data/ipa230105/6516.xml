A value of the magnetic stator field may particularly be expressed by three orthogonally oriented vector components, wherein components of the magnetic stator field parallel or antiparallel to three predefined spatial directions are determined by the three vector components.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">In the following, a magnetic stator field may be a magnetic field of a single stator conductor. Alternatively, a magnetic stator field may be a superposition of individual magnetic fields of different stator conductors.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">According to an embodiment, determining the values of the magnetic stator fields in the first magnetic stator field determining step is carried out by a plurality of measurements of a plurality of magnetic field sensors of the sensor module.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">This achieves the technical advantage that determining the plurality of values of magnetic stator fields for a plurality of different energizing currents and for a plurality of spatial regions at the stator module may be performed by the stator module. By this, it may be achieved that a compensation of the contributions of the magnetic stator fields to the measured values of the total magnetic field may be performed during the operation of the planar drive system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">For this purpose, different magnetic stator fields may be generated by applying different energizing currents to different stator conductors of the stator module and corresponding measured values may be recorded by the plurality of magnetic field sensors of the sensor module of the stator module without the presence of a rotor or without the influence of a magnetic rotor field. The recorded values of the magnetic stator fields on the corresponding energizing currents may be stored in corresponding data sets. When operating the planar drive system or when driving the rotor by generating corresponding magnetic stator fields, contributions of these magnetic stator fields to the measured values of the total magnetic field recorded by the magnetic field sensors may be determined and compensated for.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">This allows a high flexibility of the compensation by determining the magnetic stator fields for different energizing currents and different spatial regions of the stator module at arbitrary times during operation of the planar drive system. Thus, operation-related changes in the magnetic stator fields of the stator module may be taken into account in the compensation. Hereby, a position determination of the rotor and, in connection to this, a control of the rotor may be further specified and improved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">According to an embodiment, at least one measured value of the total magnetic field is determined for each magnetic field sensor in the total magnetic field determining step; and<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0038">wherein in the compensating step contributions of the magnetic stator fields to the measured values of the total magnetic field are compensated for each magnetic field sensor, and wherein for each magnetic field sensor at least one measured value of the magnetic rotor field is generated for the spatial area of the respective magnetic field sensor.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">This achieves the technical advantage that precise position determining and, associated with this, precise control of the rotor of the planar drive system is possible. By correcting the measured values of the total magnetic field recorded by the respective magnetic field sensor for each magnetic field sensor of the sensor module of the stator module with respect to the contributions of the magnetic stator fields to the measured values of the total magnetic field recorded by the magnetic field sensors, a precise determination of the magnetic rotor field for the respective spatial area of the magnetic field sensor may be achieved for each magnetic field sensor.
