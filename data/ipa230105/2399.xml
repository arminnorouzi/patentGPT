It functions as a heterodimer formed with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and regulates gene transcription by binding to the response elements of the target gene promoter. The FXR-RXR heterodimer binds with highest affinity to an inverted repeat-1 (IR-1) response element, wherein consensus receptor-binding hexamers are separated by a nucleotide. FXR is activated by bile acids (the end product of cholesterol metabolism) (Makishima et al., <i>Science </i>(1999), 284: 1362-1365; Parks et al., <i>Science </i>(1999), 284:1365-1368; Wang et al., <i>Mol.

The amount of the amorphous form of the compound in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effectively and detectably for treating or lessening the disease mediated by FXR in a patient.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, an adjuvant, or an excipient, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. As described in the following: <i>In Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>21st edition, 2005, ed. D. B. Troy, Lippincott Williams&#x26; Wilkins, Philadelphia, and <i>Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology</i>, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties, disclosing various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium incompatible with the compound or the amorphous form disclosed herein, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other components of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046">The amorphous form of the present invention can be used as an active ingredient and uniformly combined in a mixture with a drug carrier according to conventional drug compounding technology. The carrier can be in various forms according to the formulation required for administration, such as oral or parenteral (including intravenous). When preparing a composition for oral dosage form, any conventional pharmaceutical medium can be used, for example, water, glycol, oil, alcohol, fragrance, preservative, colorant, etc., can be used when preparing oral liquid medicaments such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or, for example, starch, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrants, etc., can be used in the preparation of oral solid preparations such as powders, hard capsules, soft capsules and tablets, among which solid oral preparations are more preferable than liquid pharmaceuticals.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">Because tablets and capsules are easy to take, they represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in this case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously used. If necessary, tablets can be coated with standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active ingredients. Of course, the percentage of active ingredients in these compositions can be varied, and the percentage can conveniently vary from about 2% to about 60% of the unit weight. The active ingredient can be administered intranasally in the form of, for example, droplets or spray.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">The tablets, pills, capsules, etc. may also contain: binders (such as tragacanth, gum arabic, corn starch or gelatin); excipients (such as dicalcium phosphate); disintegrants (such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid); lubricants (such as magnesium stearate); and sweeteners (such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin). When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain a liquid carrier (such as fatty oil) in addition to the aforementioned types of materials.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0049">A variety of other materials can be present as coatings or to modify the shape of the dosage unit. For example, tablets can be coated with shellac, sugar, or both. In addition to the active ingredients, syrups or elixirs may contain sucrose as a sweetener, methyl or propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate as preservatives, dyes and flavoring agents (for example, cherry flavored or orange flavored).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0050">Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0051">The amorphous form of the present invention can also be administered parenterally. A solution or suspension of these active substances can be prepared by mixing appropriately with a surfactant (such as hydroxypropyl cellulose) in water. In glycerin, liquid polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof, and in oil, dispersants can also be prepared. Under normal conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the immediate preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the pharmaceutical form must be sterile and must be a fluid in an easily injectable form. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved under conditions that resist the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">Any suitable method of administration can be used to provide an effective dose of the amorphous form of the present invention to mammals, especially humans. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, intraocular, pulmonary, and nasal administration methods can be used. Dosage forms include tablets, lozenges, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, emulsions, ointments, aerosols, and the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">The therapeutically effective dosage of the amorphous form, the pharmaceutical composition, or the combinations thereof, is dependent on the species of the subject, the body weight, age and individual condition, the disorder or disease or the severity thereof being treated. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine the effective amount of each of the active ingredients necessary to prevent, treat or inhibit the progress of the disorder or disease.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">When using the compound of the present invention or its amorphous form to treat or prevent the disease mediated by FXR described in the present invention, the compound of the present invention or its amorphous form is administered at a daily dose of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably in a single daily dose, or in divided doses of 2 to 6 times a day, or by continuous release, having obtained a generally satisfactory result. For most large mammals, the total daily dose is about 1.0 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably about 1 mg to about 50 mg. For a 70 kg adult, the total daily dose is generally 7 mg to about 350 mg. This dosage method can be adjusted to provide the best therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">The amorphous form of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof can be effectively used for preventing, managing, treating, or lessening the disease mediated by FXR in patients, especially effectively used for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, chronic intrahepatic cholestasis, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC), drug-induced bile duct damage, gallstones, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B, sebaceous gland disease, alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, bile duct obstruction, gallstone disease, liver fibrosis, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD), colitis, neonatal jaundice, nuclear jaundice, venous occlusive disease, portal hypertension, metabolic syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, acute stroke, thrombosis, hyperchole sterolemia, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, erectile dysfunction, gastrointestinal tumor and liver tumor , etc.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) prepared according to the method of Example 1 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) prepared according to the method of Example 1 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermogram of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) prepared according to the method of Example 1 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the changes of X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) during the stability experiment under high temperature condition according to the method (1) of Example 3 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the changes of X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) during the stability experiment under high humidity condition according to the method (2) of Example 3 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the changes of X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) during the stability experiment under light condition according to the method (3) of Example 3 of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) graph of the amorphous form of the compound having Formula (I) prepared according to the method of Example 1 of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0064">The invention will now be further described by way of examples without limiting the invention to the scope of the described examples.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">The X-ray powder diffraction analysis method used in the present invention was an Empyrean diffractometer, and an X-ray powder diffraction pattern was obtained using Cu-K&#x3b1; radiation (45 KV, 40 mA).
