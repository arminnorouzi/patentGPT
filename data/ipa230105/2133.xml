Said cutting blades require suitable packaging for sales, storage, and transport. Various requirements for designing and producing the packaging are thereby presented by sales, storage, and transport, as well as by the production and disposal of packaging and cutting blades.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flexible packaging for cutting blades is known from the German utility patent specification DE 20 2007 019 086 U1, comprising a flexible first layer having at least one hollow space formed therein and forming a basis for receiving a cutting blade, a flexible second layer disposed over the base, and a seal, wherein the seal is implemented about the circumference of each hollow space in order to encapsulate a cutting blade disposed in the hollow space.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods for producing a packaging and packaging strips are disclosed in the European patent specification EP 1 968 868 B1. The methods disclosed therein comprise attaching a first layer to a second layer in order to produce a connected region comprising a removable seal. Perforation cuts are provided through the first layer. A cut running transversely is provided through both the first and the second layer, wherein the cut running transversely crosses the perforation cut at least once in order to produce a segment forming a flap.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">European patent specification EP 0 922 651 B1 discloses reclosable, dust-protected packagings comprising a front side wall and a rear side wall disposed overlapping each other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The German patent specification DE 10 2008 015 079 A1 discloses multiple packagings for two or more contents separated from each other, each present in a casing comprising a hollow space. Two adjacent casings are connected by means of a common edge of two or more areas of each casing abutting each other at an angle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The European patent specification EP 0 260 345 A2 discloses packaging units having a plurality of folding boxes and a method for producing packaging units having a plurality of folding boxes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to provide an improved packaging for cutting blades, particularly for better fulfilling the various requirements from sales, storage, transport, production, and disposal of packaging and cutting blades. A further object of the present invention is to provide associated methods for packaging cutting blades and for producing multiple packagings made of a plurality of packagings connected to each other for cutting blades.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the invention is achieved for a first consideration by a packaging for cutting blades comprising a substantially flat base layer made of a first packaging material and a substantially flat cover layer made of a second packaging material, the cover layer being disposed on a top side of the base layer and connected to the base layer at least in segments. The base layer comprises a blade receptacle designed for receiving a single cutting blade. A segment of the cover layer forms a cover of the blade receptacle, the cover being releasable in order to expose a single cutting blade received by the blade receptacle. The first packaging material and the second packaging material are made primarily of cardboard.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other words, the first and second packaging materials are each a material having a mass and/or volume content of cardboard of greater than half of the total volume and/or the total mass thereof. The first and second packaging material can particularly be made of 50% or greater, 60% or greater, 70% or greater, 80% or greater, particularly preferably 90% or greater, further preferably 95% or greater of cardboard, relative to the total volume and/or the total mass of the corresponding packaging material in each case. The proportion of each packaging material not made of cardboard is thereby preferably formed by various filler and/or additive substances, individually or in conjunction with each other, selected according to the concrete application. The filler and/or additive substances are thereby preferably selected in order to advantageously influence a property of the corresponding packaging material. In a further advantageous embodiment, the surface of the first and second packaging material, or the cardboard used therein, preferably comprise markings, particularly in the form of printing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cardboard of the first packaging material and of the second packaging material according to the first consideration of the invention is thereby preferably produced by means of arbitrary production methods selected according to the concrete application. It is particularly preferable that the production method for the first packaging material and the production method for the second packaging material are identical. Alternatively, different production methods for the first and second packaging materials are preferable. The cardboard of the first packaging material and/or of the second packaging material is particularly preferably solid cardboard, corrugated cardboard, or an arbitrary combination of solid and corrugated cardboard. It is preferable that the first and/or the second packaging material form a multilayer composite made of a plurality of identical or different layers of cardboard.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an advantageous embodiment, a first starting material on which the production process for the first packaging material and/or the second packaging material is based is predominantly or entirely a recycled material, particularly recycled cardboard. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, a first starting material on which the production process for the first packaging material and/or the second packaging material is based is partially, predominantly, or entirely a cellulose obtained from certified sustainable sources. In a further, particularly advantageous embodiment, the first starting material made of recycling material can be combined with the second starting material made of cellulose from certified sustainable sources at arbitrary ratios.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base layer and the cover layer are substantially flat, that is, said layers have a length and width extending in a plane. Said plane is preferably planar. Alternatively, it is preferable if the plane is curved in one or both directions defining the plane. The base layer and cover layer each have a thickness perpendicular to the corresponding plane of the length and width, wherein the corresponding thickness is substantially less than the corresponding length and corresponding width. The corresponding thickness is particularly 20% or less, 15% or less, 10% or less than the corresponding length and width of the base layer or cover layer. The connection between the base layer and cover layer at least in segments can be made by means of arbitrary, suitable means, preferably coordinated with the packaging materials used. The base layer and the cover layer are preferably glued, welded, pressed, connected by means of joining elements, and/or combinations thereof at a connecting segment. It is further preferable if the connecting segment connects a back side of the cover layer to a top side of the base layer in a flat manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The packaging preferably comprises a rectangular shape, wherein the length and width thereof can particularly correspond to a credit card format. It is further preferable that the length and width of the base layer correspond to the length and width of the cover layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further or alternatively preferred embodiment, the segment of the cover layer forming the cover is a partial segment of the cover layer. Alternatively or particularly preferably, the cover layer comprises a first partial segment forming the cover and a second partial segment set up for remaining connected to the base layer after the cover is removed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A packaging according to the first consideration of the invention is particularly advantageous, as the use of cardboard in the packaging material facilitates disposing of and recycling of the packaging.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment of the packaging according to the first consideration of the invention, the blade receptacle is designed for limiting a displacement, at least in one plane parallel to the base layer, of an individual cutting blade received by the blade receptacle. The displacement of a cutting blade can thereby be limited by the blade receptacle to a dimension making it impossible or at least sufficiently improbable that a cutting blade received in the packaging will be damaged during transport and handling of the packaging. The blade receptacle is preferably designed for completely preventing displacement of a single cutting blade received therein. Arbitrary known means for producing a form fit or force fit between the blade receptacle and the cutting blade can be considered to this end, particularly by means of form-fit elements, undercuts, adhesive layers, and/or anchoring elements and clamping elements or segments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above disclosed refinements and features of the packaging according to the first consideration of the invention can be applied separately to all further considerations of the invention comprising identical or similar features and/or preferable refinements, without necessarily applying the other features of the first consideration of the invention as well. In this respect, reference is made in full to the above description for the following embodiments as well, wherein concrete embodiment examples can also be found in the description of the figures.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a second consideration of the invention, optionally implementing a preferred refinement of the packaging of the first consideration, a packaging is provided comprising a substantially flat base layer made of a first packaging material and a substantially flat cover layer made of a second packaging material, the cover layer being disposed on a top side of the base layer and connected to the base layer at least in segments. The base layer comprises a blade receptacle designed for receiving a single cutting blade, so that a cutting edge of a received cutting blade comprises a blade orientation specified by the blade receptacle. The first packaging material comprises at least a first rigidity along a first primary material direction and a second rigidity along a second primary material direction. The base layer and/or the cover layer is disposed so that the first primary material direction is aligned parallel to the blade orientation. Alternatively or in combination, the second packaging material comprises at least a third rigidity along a third primary material direction and a fourth rigidity along a fourth primary material direction. The base layer and/or the cover layer is disposed so that the third primary material direction is aligned parallel to the blade orientation. Alternatively, the base layer and/or cover layer can be disposed so that the second and/or fourth primary material direction is parallel to the blade orientation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the first rigidity is greater than the second rigidity. In an alternative embodiment or a refinement, the third rigidity is greater than the fourth rigidity. Alternatively, the first and second rigidity can be equal and the third and fourth rigidity can be equal. In a further alternative, the first, second, third, and fourth rigidity are equal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further preferred embodiment, the first and/or the second packaging material comprises a further rigidity along a further primary direction in each case. The corresponding primary directions of one of the two packaging materials can thereby particularly be perpendicular to each other. In a further refinement of the second consideration of the invention, the first and second and the third and fourth primary directions are thereby in a plane extending parallel to the base layer and the cover layer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because a first primary material direction is parallel to the blade orientation, the bending behavior of the packaging can be adapted according to the requirements of the cutting blade for a preferred handling. In an embodiment example, a long, thin cutting blade, thereby being very flexible, can be received in the blade receptacle. Depending on the application, it can be advantageous that the packaging prevents flexing of the long, thin cutting blade. In such a case, the first rigidity of the first packaging material is preferably adapted to be greater than the second rigidity of the first packaging, whereby bending of the packaging in the longitudinal direction of the cutting blade is made more difficult. In a further advantageous refinement, a third primary material direction of the second packaging material can also be aligned parallel to the blade orientation, wherein the third rigidity is greater than the fourth rigidity. If desired, the reinforcing effect can thereby be further reinforced by the alignment of the first primary material direction. As is explained by the present embodiment example, the primary material directions of the first and/or second packaging materials can be aligned in an arbitrary manner in order to achieve a desired rigidity behavior of the packaging. For example, it can also be desirable to set the rigidity of the base layer, of the cover layer, and/or of the entire packaging so that bending of the packaging, including the blade received therein, is facilitated in a direction parallel or transverse to the cutting edge.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment of the packaging of the second consideration, the first and/or the second packaging material is a corrugated cardboard, the corrugation direction thereof corresponding to the first and/or third primary material direction. Said preferred embodiment is based on the idea that the flexural rigidity of corrugated cardboard is greater transverse to the corrugation direction than along the corrugation direction. In an alternative, preferred refinement of the second consideration, the corrugation direction of the corrugated cardboard used corresponds to the second and/or third primary material direction. As is evident from the above explanations, any suitable material having anisotropic rigidity can be used as the first and/or second packaging material as a substitute for corrugated cardboard or in addition to the corrugated cardboard used. The use of plastics is thereby particularly conceivable, particularly having undergone orienting of the polymer chains present therein due to corresponding drawing, rolling, or casting processes before, during, and after the production thereof. It is further conceivable to provide a desired anisotropy to an isotropic material by introducing reinforcing materials, such as fibers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The blade receptacle of the first and second considerations of the invention can optionally be provided on or in the base layer as a separate element, or by machining the base layer. In a preferred embodiment, the blade receptacle is implemented by a recess in the base layer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or second consideration of the invention, the recess has an inner contour corresponding at least in segments to the outer contour of an individual cutting blade. For example, a form fit can be produced between the blade receptacle and a cutting blade received in the blade receptacle for limiting or completely preventing displacing of the cutting blade at least in the plane of the base layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or second consideration of the invention, the packaging further comprises a substantially flat substrate made of a third packaging material applied to the back side of the base layer. The third packaging material can be different from or identical to the first and/or the second packaging material and can comprise any property and any feature, in isolation or in combination, disclosed with respect to the first and the second packaging material. In this respect, reference is made to the above description for advantages and refinements. Applying the substrate can particularly take place in the same manner as connecting the base layer and the cover layer. Alternatively or in addition, a different, suitable connection can be selection. The base layer and substrate can particularly be glued to each other flatly and thus substantially integral in design, so that said layers form an integral, two-layer composite. For example, a substrate can be advantageous in order to further reinforce the packaging, to dispose a plurality of packagings on a continuous substrate, or to achieve an appearance of the packaging attractive to the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or second consideration of the invention, part of the blade receptacle is formed by a pass-through opening in the base layer extending from the top side to a back side of the base layer. A substrate preferably applied to the back side of the blade receptacle then preferably forms a back wall of the blade receptacle. Such a three-layer packaging can provide advantages when producing the packaging. It can thus be possible, when the pass-through opening is produced in the base layer by means of a punching process, to subsequently complete the blade receptacle by applying the substrate to the back side of the base layer. Such producing in separate steps can simplify the production process and thus make said process less expensive.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or of the second consideration of the invention, the packaging further comprises a profiled cutout designed for hanging the packaging on a corresponding counterpart of a storage facility. In a preferred refinement, the packaging further comprises tear-off region, wherein the profiled cutout is disposed in the tear-off region. The tear-off region is disposed in a segment of the base layer, the cover layer, and/or the substrate, wherein the tear-off region is bounded from the other packaging by a perforation along which the tear-off region can be tom off. By hanging up the packaging at a corresponding storage facility by means of the profiled cutout, the storage of the packaging and further the access to the stored packaging can be facilitated, for example in a salesroom. The profiled cutout particularly has the shape of a Euro perforation. For the case that the profiled cutout, complete with a tear-off region, can be tom off, said tearing off can advantageously facilitate the handling after purchase, for example. It can thus be possible for a customer to remove the tear-off region, when the profiled cutout is no longer needed after the purchase, and thus reduce the storage space required by the packaging.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or of the second consideration of the invention, the substrate and the cover layer are implemented integrally and connected to each other by means of an intermediate segment. This is preferably achieved in that a substrate is divided into two regions by an intermediate segment, a first region remaining as the substrate and a second region implemented toward the substrate. The base layer is disposed between the substrate and the cover layer. The second region is thereby preferably folded over by about 180&#xb0; along the intermediate segment, for example formed by a folded edge in the substrate, until said region makes contact on the base layer. Such a packaging can be advantageous because the quantity of semi-finished goods required for producing the same is further reduced. In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or of the second consideration of the invention, the base layer and the cover layer are implemented integrally and connected to each other by means of an intermediate segment. Producing such a packaging preferably occurs in an analogous manner, as described above with respect to the packaging wherein the substrate and the cover layer are implemented integrally, wherein said embodiment can provide analogous advantages. A substrate is optionally mounted under the base layer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further, preferred embodiment, the substrate, base layer, and cover layer are implemented integrally. A first intermediate segment connects the substrate and base layer, while a second intermediate segment connects the base layer and cover layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference is made to the figure description for further explanation of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or of the second consideration of the invention, a tear line is provided in the cover layer and limits, at least in segments, the segment of the cover layer forming the cover. It is particularly preferable that the tear line is a perforation enabling the cover to be removed from the cover layer, and thus providing access to the blade receptacle. It is further preferable that the segment of the cover layer forming the cover is completely surrounded by the tear line, whereby the cover can be completely separated from the packaging. Alternatively, the tear line can only partially surround the segment forming the cover. A segment of the edge of the cover is thus cut out by the tear line. Said cut out segment can be connected to the cover layer; in this case, the cut-out segment can form a hinge line when the tear line is separated. It can thereby be made possible to fold the cover open and closed. Alternatively, the cut-out segment is disposed on the edge of the packaging, whereby said region is implemented as a flap, for example, in order to facilitate grasping the cover. The contour of the cut-out segment at the edge of the cover can thereby take on any arbitrary shape enabling or supporting the function as a hinge line or alternatively as a flap, particularly such shapes as explained in the figures and the figure descriptions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a further preferred embodiment, optionally of the first or of the second consideration of the invention, a back side of the cover layer and the top side of the base layer are at least connected to each other at least one connecting segment, wherein the at least one connecting segment is disposed in a region of the cover layer outside of the cover. Said arrangement can facilitate removing the cover, as the user thereby need only cut through the tear line, but need not expend any further effort for overcoming the connecting segment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further advantageous consideration, it can thereby be avoided that the connection between the base layer and cover layer is also removed unintentionally when removing the cover.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above disclosed refinements and features of the packaging according to the second consideration of the invention can be applied separately to all further considerations of the invention comprising identical or similar features and/or preferable refinements, without necessarily applying the other features of the second consideration of the invention as well. In this respect, reference is made in full to the above description for the following embodiments as well, wherein concrete embodiment examples can also be found in the description of the figures.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a third consideration of the invention, a multiple packaging made of a plurality of packagings connected to each other is provided, wherein the packagings are preferably according to the first or to the second consideration of the invention. It is further preferable that the multiple packaging comprises packagings both according to the first and according to the second consideration in combination. The multiple packaging particularly comprises packagings connected to each other in each of which one single cutting blade or at least two, preferably not more than four cutting blades are individually packaged.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The multiple packaging according to the third consideration of the invention comprises a continuous, substantially flat base layer made of a first packaging material, a continuous, substantially flat cover layer made of a second packaging material, the cover layer being disposed on a top side of the base layer and connected to the base layer at least in segments. The base layer and the cover layer implement a plurality of packagings disposed in a row along at least one first row direction, wherein a separation region is disposed between each of two packagings adjacent to each other in the first row direction. Each separation region runs transverse to the first row direction, at least in segments, and/or separates a first from a second packaging. Each separation region comprises a planned parting line disposed or implemented either in the base layer or in the cover layer. The separation region further comprises a hinge line in the other layer of the multiple packaging in which the planned parting line is not disposed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The base layer and the cover layer of the multiple packaging are continuous, that is, the base layer and the cover layer each form a contiguous layer extending over the entire multiple packaging. This further means that the base layer and the cover layer of the multiple packaging each form the base layer and the cover layer of each individual packaging of the multiple packagings connected to each other for forming the multiple packaging.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The individual packagings from the plurality of packagings are disposed in a row in at least one first row direction. In a preferred embodiment, the multiple packaging thus forms a chain of individual packagings disposed successively in the first row direction. In a further preferred embodiment, the multiple packaging comprises a second row direction along which individual packagings are also disposed in a row. In this manner, the first and the second row directions implement a multiple packaging made of rows and columns of individual packagings. It must be understood that only one individual column or one individual row can also be provided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The separation regions between each of two individual packagings adjacent to each other in a row direction subdivide the multiple packaging into individual segments in which the individual packagings are implemented. The planned parting line of each separation region thereby forms a line along which the layer in which said parting line is disposed can be separated. Said parting line preferably forms a separation and/or break point. The individual packagings can be broken or separated from each other at said separation and/or break point.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The planned parting line is preferably a marking along which the corresponding layer is to be cut apart by the user, for example by means of a knife or a scissors or simply by tearing. In a further preferred embodiment, the planned parting line is implemented by a weakening of the corresponding layer. In preferred embodiments, the weakening is thereby implemented in the form of a local notch and/or a tear line along at least one segment of the planned parting line. Such a tear line thereby weakens the layer in which said tear line is disposed along said line relative to adjacent regions of the layer, particularly such regions comprising no tear line. In preferred embodiment, the tear line is implemented as a partial or continuous perforation. Alternatively or in combination, the tear line is implemented as a regional reduction in the thickness of the corresponding layer. The tear line thus allows cutting apart the corresponding layer in which said tear line is implemented. The hinge line of each separation region is implemented such that when the corresponding layer is cut apart along the planned parting line, a rotational degree of freedom is produced between two packagings adjacent to each other along the separation region. A first adjacent packaging can thus be folded over relative to a second adjacent packaging. It can be advantageous to thus fold over a first packaging relative to the second packaging, such that the first packaging rests on the second packaging. The arrangement of individual packagings in a row, resulting in a predominantly flat extent of the multiple packaging, can thus be transformed into a stack of individual packagings in the manner of an accordion without completely breaking the connection between the individual packagings along a separation region. The hinge line can thereby be designed in any arbitrary manner able to provide a rotational degree of freedom. The hinge line can preferably be a fold line first introduced in the packaging material by folding over the packagings. In other words, it is preferable when an elasticity of the packaging material makes it possible that a line running parallel to the tear line functions as a hinge line as soon as the other layer in each case has been cut apart along the planned parting line, without the corresponding packaging material requiring any further processing along the hinge line. In other preferred <b>3</b><i>o </i>embodiments, the hinge line can also be implemented by a local weakening, for example by reducing the thickness of the corresponding layer. The separation regions can thereby take on any arbitrary contour, preferably adapted to the application, running transverse to the corresponding row direction at least in segments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment of the multiple packaging according to the third consideration of the invention, the corresponding separation region is designed so that two adjacent packagings can be separated from each other, particularly tom off, along a planned parting line. In a further preferred embodiment, the base layer comprises a blade receptacle for each individual packaging. In a further preferred embodiment, the cover layer comprises a segment for each packaging forming a cover of the blade receptacle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a further preferred embodiment of the multiple packaging, the segment of the cover layer forming the cover is bounded by a second tear line at least in segments, so that the corresponding covers of the individual packagings can be removed from the cover layer in any arbitrary sequence. This is achieved particularly in that the first and the second tear lines are disposed spaced apart from each other, particularly so that said tear lines do not intersect. It can thus be made possible to advantageously remove cutting blades from the multiple packaging in any arbitrary sequence. In embodiments in which the individual packagings can be separated from each other along the planned parting line of the separation region, each cover of the corresponding individual packagings is thereby further removable regardless of whether the individual packaging is connected to an adjacent packaging or not. This can be advantageous because the user thereby obtains greater flexibility in the utilization of the packaging.
