The goal of the model is to maximize an expected sum of future discounted rewards. In order to implement a label-free six-dimensional object pose optimization solution by using the reinforcement learning, appropriate operations that map the label-free six-dimensional object pose optimization solution to the reinforcement learning are needed when implementing the technology. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which shows a schematic diagram of principles involved in the reinforcement learning-based label-free six-dimensional object pose prediction method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The correspondence between six key elements in the reinforcement learning and respective elements in the solution provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure is described below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Agent, which is also referred to as Intelligence Agent, is mainly composed of a reinforcement learning model, i.e., the pose prediction model mentioned above. The pose prediction model can be implemented by a deep neural network, an input parameter of the pose prediction model is the two-dimensional image including the target object, i.e., the target image, and an output parameter of the pose prediction model is the action information of the target object. The pose prediction model is configured to provide the action information of the target object outputted based on the target image, and the training process of the model is actually a process of adjusting the action information of the target object. For example, the policy network is updated (i.e., adjusting parameters of the model) to obtain higher reward values (i.e., higher performance).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The pose prediction model includes a basic network and a policy network. The policy network includes a rotation amount branch network, a translation amount branch network and a value function branch network. The basic network is configured to extract features from the target image, the rotation amount branch network is configured to predict a rotation amount of the target object based on the features, the translation amount branch network is configured to predict a translation amount of the target object based on the features, and the rotation amount branch network and the translation amount branch network are connected together to determine a value function of the policy network based on the rotational distribution feature and the translational distribution feature of the target object.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Schematically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it shows a schematic structural diagram of a pose prediction model. A backbone includes first <b>11</b> convolutional layers of FlowNet-S. The pose prediction model includes a basic network <b>41</b> and a policy network. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the policy network is lightweight in both training and reasoning aspects, and does not use a large number of optical flow calculations and mask branches. The policy network includes a rotation amount branch network, a translation amount branch network, and a value function branch network, that is, two independent branches are adopted to predict the separate rotation distribution and translation distribution. Each of the two branches includes 2 fully connected layers and 256 hidden units, followed by one additional fully connected layer connected thereto. The last fully connected layers of the two branches are connected together and then connected to two fully connected layers to generate the value function. In this way, the value function branch network shares the same parameters with the rotation amount branch network and the translation amount branch network, and can be used to optimize the two types of operations, rotation and translation at the same time. Before being fed into the backbone, the input image and a corresponding mask are preprocessed, the preprocessing includes cropping and upscaling, and the target object in the preprocessed input image and corresponding mask occupies a main position of the image. Taking the preprocessed input image and corresponding mask as input parameters, the basic network <b>42</b> is configured to extract a feature map <b>43</b> from the input parameters <b>41</b>. The translation amount branch network is configured to predict a translation amount at of the target object based on the feature map, the rotation amount branch network is configured to predict a rotation amount a<sub>R </sub>of the target object based on the feature map, and the value function branch network is configured to determine a value function <b>44</b> of the policy network based on the rotational distribution feature and translational distribution feature of the target object.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Environment corresponds to a target for adjustment, i.e., the target object to be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">State, also referred to as state information, includes all knowledge that the environment can provide and is used to instruct the policy network to rotate and translate the three-dimensional model. At a current time step k, an observed image of the three-dimensional model, a real mask image frame corresponding to the observed image, a rendered image, and a render mask corresponding to the rendered image are determined by a current pose. These four images are connected together to form state information sk, which is used as an input parameter of the policy network.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">During testing, since the real mask image frame of the target object is not available, a render mask image frame of an initial pose can be used instead.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Reward, also referred to as reward value, is a scalar that represents a performance difference of the target object before and after applying the action information. In an exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the state information of the target object at time k is Sk, the action information output by the pose prediction model based on the S<sub>k </sub>is a<sub>k</sub>, and the reward value of the target object after applying the a<sub>k </sub>can be recorded as r<sub>k</sub>, representing the performance change of the target object before and after applying a<sub>k</sub>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Action, also referred to as action information, is the relative SE (3) transformation performed by the policy network at each time step, which will affect a state of the environment. The representation of relative action can be used because it has the property of separating rotation and translation, that is, the effect of rotation and the effect of translation do not affect each other. Rotation and translation actions are randomly selected from two parameterized distributions of the policy network. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods, the value function of the policy network is estimated by connecting the rotational and translational distribution features together. Continuous distribution and discrete distribution of the policy model are evaluated separately. Taking Gaussian distribution as the form of the continuous distribution and categorical distribution as the form of the discrete distribution as an example, 13 operations were manually made for the discretely distributed rotation action and the discretely distributed translation action respectively, 12 operations of which include rotation or translation in positive and negative x, y, and z directions by a fixed stride, and the last operation of which is to maintain no translation/rotation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Policy, also referred to as a policy network, is used to indicate a mapping relation between the state information and the action information. The policy network is a deep neural network, input parameters of which are the state information of the target object, and output parameters of which are the action information of the target object.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The reinforcement learning makes a policy decision through an interactive process between the model and the environment. Unlike supervised or unsupervised learning, the reinforcement learning relies on cumulative rewards rather than labels for training and learning. The goal of the reinforcement learning is to continuously interact with the environment, optimize its own policy based on a return of the environment, and then obtain a higher return by collecting the updated policy.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an exemplary embodiment, the modeling is performed by a reinforcement learning method of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be noted that the network structures and parameters shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are only exemplary and explanatory, and are not intended to limit the technical solutions of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which shows a flowchart of a reinforcement learning-based label-free six-dimensional object pose prediction method according to another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.

In a pose-free case, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a two-dimensional mask-based reward mechanism, and a reward value of the mechanism includes a differential reward value, a goal achievement reward value, and a concentration reward value. The differential reward value is used to indicate a matching degree between a current rendered image and the observed image, the concentration reward value is used to indicate a matching degree in geometric position between the current rendered image and the observed image, and the goal achievement reward value is used to indicate whether to stop updating the policy network.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The differential reward value is used to indicate the matching degree between the current rendered image and the observed image. Optionally, the differential reward value is determined based on Intersection-over-Unions (IoUs) corresponding to two adjacent time nodes. The IoU is an overlap ratio of the current render mask with the real mask, i.e., a ratio of an intersection of the current render mask and the real mask to a union of the current render mask and the real mask.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Schematically, the computer device obtains IoUs corresponding to two adjacent time nodes, respectively maps the two IoUs to a predetermined piecewise function to obtain corresponding mapping values, and determines an absolute value of a difference between the two mapping values as the differential reward value. The embodiments of the present disclosure do not limit a setting manner of the predetermined piecewise function.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The concentration reward value is used to indicate the matching degree between the current rendered image and the observed image in the geometric position. Optionally, the concentration reward value is determined based on a distance between a center of gravity corresponding to the current render mask and a center of gravity corresponding to the real mask. The current render mask is a mask of the target object in the current rendered image, and the real mask is a mask of the target object in the observed image. For example, the computer device determines the &#x2212;0.5 power of the distance between the center of gravity corresponding to the current render mask and the center of gravity corresponding to the real mask as the concentration reward value.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The goal achievement reward value is used to indicate whether to stop updating the policy network. Optionally, the goal achievement reward value is a first value by default, which is used to indicate not to stop updating the policy network. If the IoU corresponding to the current time node is greater than a preset threshold, the goal achievement reward value is adjusted from the first value to a second value which is used to indicate to stop updating the policy network. For example, the first value is 0, the second value is 1, and the preset threshold is 0.95. The embodiments of the present disclosure do not limit the specific values of the first value, the second value, and the preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">It should be noted that the embodiments of the present disclosure do not limit the specific calculation methods of the differential reward value, the goal achievement reward value, and the concentration reward value.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In Step <b>505</b>, the policy network is updated based on the at least one sample data set. The at least one sample data set includes the state information and the action information of the target object, and a corresponding reward value.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Since the high-dimensional state space brings high variance and instability to the training of the policy network, millions of samples are usually required to fully utilize the powerful function of the reinforcement learning model. However, it is difficult to present such a huge number of sample images in six-dimensional object pose prediction. In embodiments of the present disclosure, a task-specific compound reinforcement optimization method is provided for the six-dimensional object pose prediction, that is, an online policy and an offline policy are combined to make full use of the rendered image.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In a possible implementation manner, the computer device updating the policy network based on the at least one sample data set includes: updating the policy network based on the at least one sample data set through a PPO algorithm; and updating a value function of the policy network based on cached data in a priority queue that is set. The cached data is the at least one sample data set that is stored in a buffer and has been used.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The computer device updates the policy network based on the at least one sample data set through the PPO algorithm. The at least one sample data set includes the state information and the action information of the target object, and the corresponding reward value. For example, one sample data set is a state-action reward function (S<sub>k</sub>, a<sub>k</sub>, r<sub>k</sub>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">After the policy network is updated, the sample data set is no longer associated with a current policy network, that is, the action information has been sampled by a previous policy network rather than the current policy network. Therefore, the sample data set cannot be used for online policy optimization. In order to further make full use of the used sample data and make full use of the validity of the data, an offline policy value is introduced to update the policy network to assist the optimization of the policy network and to speed up the training process. By setting the priority queue in the buffer to store the used data samples, the value function of the policy network is updated based on the cached data in the priority queue that is set. The priority queue is a first-in and first-out data structure.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">To sum up, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a reinforcement learning-based label-free six-dimensional object pose prediction method, which solves the problem of six-dimensional object pose prediction based on a target image without real pose annotation, while avoiding the domain difference resulted from model training based on synthetic data. To achieve this, on the one hand, the six-dimensional object pose optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process, and the reinforcement learning is introduced. Given an initial pose estimate, the three-dimensional model of the target object is sequentially rotated and/or translated to align with the observed value. On the other hand, to train the pose prediction model, a two-dimensional mask-based reward value is designed, which is calculated based on the current rendered image and the two-dimensional mask of the target image. For each pose optimization process, the accumulated reward is maximized, resulting in a policy that can approach the target pose smoothly and quickly. Further, a compound reinforcement optimization method is proposed to efficiently learn the operation policy. Compared with existing supervised methods, the embodiments utilize a Markov decision process to optimize delayed accumulated rewards from weakly supervised mask similarity, rather than from real six-dimensional object pose annotations. Furthermore, on the LINEMOD and T-LESS datasets, better pose prediction performance is obtained compared to methods that do not use real six-dimensional pose labels.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The apparatus embodiments of the present disclosure are described below.
