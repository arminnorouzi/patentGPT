Conventional apparatuses and methods, however, suffer from one or more disadvantages. For example, conventional lung isolation tubes and methods require a connector set with clamps in order to close airflow through a lumen. Conventional lung isolation tubes and methods also employ undesirably complex lumen control valves. Further, conventional lung isolation tubes and methods include complex lumen suction ports. Still further, conventional lung isolation tubes and methods are difficult to utilize in emergency situations in the field.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be desirable, therefore, if an apparatus and method for a lung isolation tube assembly could be provided that would not require a connector set with clamps in order to close airflow through a lumen. It would also be desirable if such an apparatus and method for a lung isolation tube assembly could be provided that would not require complex lumen control valves. It would be further desirable if such an apparatus and method for a lung isolation tube assembly could be provided that would not include complex lumen suction ports. It would be still further desirable if such an apparatus and method for a lung isolation tube assembly could be provided that would be easy to use in emergency situations in the field.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Advantages of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an advantage of the preferred embodiments of the invention claimed herein to provide an apparatus and method for a lung isolation tube assembly that uses a control valve in order to close airflow through the lumens.
