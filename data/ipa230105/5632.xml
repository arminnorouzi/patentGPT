Among this waste, the highly active raffinate from the first extraction cycle of the PUREX process is of special importance both from the point of a specific radioactivity level and from the point of its content of fission product nitric salts, the higher being burnup of spent nuclear fuel, the more important being these aspects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The related art discloses a method of concentrating raffinates comprising evaporation of a highly active raffinate (HAW) simultaneously with distillation of nitric acid, condensation of the distillate thus produced, its subsequent evaporation for purification from aerosol contamination with radionuclides mixed with MAWs, also with nitric acid distillation and its subsequent rectification at the final stage of the process [Fuel reprocessing (Reactor Hand-book, v.2). Eds Stoller S.M., Richards R.B. Interscience Publishers. N-Y, London, Toronto, 1961, p. 179], wherein evaporation operations are usually carried out in an evaporator having an external heating chamber and natural circulation of the bottoms solution. However, evaporation according to this scheme is applicable without limitation only to refining cycle raffinates, while, for a highly active raffinate, concentration is limited by impurity salts present that are weakly soluble in nitric acid at its high concentration in the evaporation bottoms solution. In particular, when evaporating a highly active raffinate from reprocessed NPS SNF (HAW), such impurity is a heavy barium nitrate sediment clogging the circulation pipe. Recently, for this reason as well as due to the presence in great quantities s of tritium in HAW from reprocessed NPS SNF, the stages of concentrating HAW and MAW with regeneration of nitric acid contained therein have been separated to a fullest degree possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To increase solubility of barium nitrate during HAW evaporation various artificial techniques are used, in particular, dilution of the initial solution with the distillate from nitric acid regeneration [Zilberman B.Ya., Saprykin V.F., Makarychev-Mikhailov M.N. Management of high level wastes (HLW) from nuclear power plant spent fuel reprocessing in terms of tritium localization and nitric acid regeneration. 1993'Int. Conf. on Nuclear Waste Manag. and Environ. Remediation. (Proc. Conf. Prague, 1993). Vol. 1, p. 375-378. Am. Soc. Mech. Engineers, N-Y, 1993].</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the process may also be carried out in a semi-continuous mode in a convection apparatus with multi-tier coil pipes or a horizontal heating chamber, where sediment is accumulated in the bottom part and subsequently washed out (pulverized) [Warner B.F. Operational experience in the evaporation and storage of highly active fission-product wastes at Windscale/Management of Radioactive Wastes from Fuel Reprocessing (Proc. Symp.Paris, 1972), OECD/NEA, Paris, 1973, p. 339]. A modification of this process is HAW evaporation in a pan-type apparatus by heating through the coil pipe and simultaneous denitration of nitric acid by adding formic acid and its regeneration by oxidative absorption of nitrogen oxides [Miura N., Watahiki M., Nakamura Yo. E. et al. Operation experience and anti-foam study at the Tokai reprocessing plant. Proc. Int. Conf. GLOBAL'97 (Jap.), v. 2, p. 1238-1243]. This method has the following disadvantages: it is carried out in a semi-continuous mode with substantial accumulation of the bottoms solution, which is driven by the necessity to provide a large heating surface with a limited heat transfer through the &#x201c;pan&#x201d; walls and the coil pipe when it is impossible to arrange a tubular heating chamber, as well as, the necessity to initiate the process each time when it is restarted by way of adding a sodium nitrate solution to avoid an uncontrolled surge.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A modification of this process is a method used at UP-2 and UP-3 plants where instead of formic acid formaldehyde is used [Schneider J., Bretault Ph., Masson M., Juvenelle A., Bosse E., Huel C. Highly Active Liquid Waste concentration using the formaldehyde denitration process in the French reprocessing plants. Proc. Intern. Conf. &#x201c;Global 2009&#x201d; (Paris, France, 06-11.09.2009). CEA, 2009. Paper 9343]. The process does not require initiation and ensures more complete decomposition of nitric acid. However, as the inspection showed, the process comes with partial loss of nitric acid due to irreversible formation of nitrous oxide, without any description of required gas purification in the original.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method closest to the claimed one is the method for concentrating radioactive waste described in Patent RU2596816 (Bull. 25, 2016), which is taken as the prototype. This method consists in incomplete decomposition of nitric acid with formaldehyde throughout continuous evaporation of the raffinate in an evaporation apparatus with an external heating chamber and circulation of the bottoms solution when a water solution of formaldehyde is fed to the apparatus bottom part at the ratio of 2 moles of formaldehyde to 1 mole of decomposed nitric acid entered with the feed solution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in this method rather concentrated formaldehyde solutions (6.5 moles/L, i.e. twice diluted formalin) are used, which cannot ensure fire and explosion safety of radiochemical production facilities. Furthermore, it is established that the evaporation of a highly active raffinate allows to reduce an acidity of the bottoms solution, without formation of nitrous oxide, only to 3.8-4 moles/L (the total nitrate ion is by 1.7-2 moles/L higher), which is on the brink of barium nitrate crystallization.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Many aspects of the present disclosure can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.

When starting the process, a solution of the formaldehyde/formic acid mixture is used with the maximum formaldehyde content of 6.5 moles/L, but not less than 0.65 moles/L, and its missing part is replaced with formic acid in the quantity of 2.2-2.7 moles of formic acid instead of 1 mole of formaldehyde.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The consumption of the reducing mixture in terms of formaldehyde is app. 0.3 moles per 1 mole of nitric acid in a RAW evaporated solution.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An evaporation degree, with due regard to dilution of the bottoms solution with the solution comprising the reducing agent, is limited by barium nitrate solubility at a nitric acid residual concentration in the bottoms solution not lower than 2.5 moles/L and a nitrate ion concentration not less than 4 moles/L that is created by nitric acid and fission product salts contained in the highly active raffinate from extraction reprocessing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The solution comprising the reducing agent contains water in the quantity of at least 0.35 kg per 1 L of the solution.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These operations enable to select a mode wherein, when a model highly active raffinate with a given concentration degree is evaporated (a bottoms solution specific volume is not higher than 0.4 m<sup>3</sup>/t of SNF), no barium nitrate precipitate is formed, and no nitrous oxide is released. However, in this case fire and explosion safety of the process increases due to a sharp (up to 10 times) reduction in the concentration of formaldehyde in the reducing mixture and possible continuation of the process with no formaldehyde.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above description may be supported by examples obtained during the evaporating of model solutions at a bench-scale plant the layout of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The plant comprises: 1&#x2014;an initial solution weigh feeder, 2&#x2014;a formaldehyde weigh feeder, 3&#x2014;an evaporator, 4&#x2014;a steam generator, 5&#x2014;a condenser, 6&#x2014;a weighing tank for receiving a bottoms solution, 7&#x2014;a buffer tank for receiving a distillate, 8 and 9&#x2014;laboratory variable autotransformers, 10&#x2014;a transformer, 11&#x2014;a fuse, 12&#x2014;a manometer, 13&#x2014;a valve for controlling discharge of heating steam condensate, 14&#x2014;an emergency valve, 15&#x2014;an absorber, 16&#x2014;a weigh feeder of reflux to the absorber, 17&#x2014;a tank for collecting regenerated nitric acid, 18&#x2014;a solenoid valve for discharging a bottoms solution, 19&#x2014;a valve for discharging steam to the atmosphere, 20&#x2014;a heating chamber of the evaporator, 21&#x2014;a separator of the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The evaporation is carried out in equilibrium conditions while keeping a constant level of the bottoms solution and in conditions of reflux absence owing to electric heating of the separator (21) of the evaporator (3).

After the solution in the evaporator (3) boils, batch feeding of the initial solution and reactants starts. The initial solution and denitrating reactant are fed under the surface of the solution in the evaporator (3) with the use of the weigh feeders (1) and (2). In order to collect nitric oxides, the reflux liquid is fed, with the use of the weigh feeder (16), to the top of the absorber (15) onto a spiral dump packing. Air is fed under the packing to the absorber. The bottoms solution flowrate is measured with the use of the weighing tank (6) for receiving the bottoms solution. A preset evaporation degree is maintained with the use of the solenoid valve (18). The condenser (5) and the absorber (15) are cooled with running water.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The process is conducted in the automatic mode and is controlled by an ACS. All the data on the process is displayed on an operator console. A required evaporation coefficient, a coefficient of reactant consumption/initial consumption ratio, reflux liquid consumption for the absorber (15) are set on the operator console. The data on the current reactant consumption, the solution level and density in the evaporator (3), a steam pressure in the system, and a current electric power of the steam generator (4) are displayed on the console. The process of measuring the solution level in the evaporator (3) is continuous and is conducted in real time with the use of a hydrostatic densimeter/level meter. In order to maintain a permanent solution level in the evaporator (3), the ACS adjusts consumption of the initial reactant and the denitration reactant coupled thereto and, while proceeding from the preset evaporation degree, sets bottoms solution consumption automatically. The overall plant productivity is adjusted by changing power supplied to the steam generator, said power being set manually with the use of the laboratory variable autotransformer (9).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The proposed method is illustrated by Examples.

stop, first the feed (HAW) and the water solution of the mixture of formaldehyde (taken in the form of formalin) and formic acid are dosed simultaneously to a model or stored bottoms solution, and after the stationary mode is achieved, the formic acid solution is used, reactant concentrations being selected in the claimed limits depending on a particular plant during a period of start-up and
