The mobile home is constructed on the steel chassis and comes in a wide variety of styles, sizes, and optional features. Advantageously, mobile homes may be constructed in a manufacturing facility and then transported to the desired location.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The steel chassis of the mobile home generally has two longitudinal girders and a plurality of spaced apart joists perpendicular to the girders. A wheel axle assembly, normally having a plurality of individual wheel axles, is attached between the mid-point of the chassis and one end of the chassis and a trailer hitch it attached at the opposite end of the chassis for towing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Both the wheel axle and the trailer hitch are permanently attached to the chassis of the mobile home. When the mobile home is transported to the desired location, the towing vehicle simply detaches the trailer hitch and leaves it and the wheel axle in place on the chassis. Once the mobile home is installed in the desired location, the wheel axle and trailer hitch serve no purpose and simply remain permanently attached to the chassis of the mobile home. These parts are expensive, which adds to the overall cost of the mobile home unit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A mobile home chassis, according to the present invention, has a generally flat rectangular shape with a front, rear, sides, top, bottom, and midpoint between the front and the rear.

An axle assembly is releasably attached to the bottom of the chassis between the midpoint and the rear of the chassis and a hitch assembly is releasably attached to the bottom of the chassis and extending forwardly from the front of the chassis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, the mobile home chassis has a generally flat rectangular shape with a front, rear, sides, top, bottom, and midpoint between the front and the rear. The chassis has two girders arranged parallel to each other and extending between the front and rear of the chassis having bottom flanges extending outwardly from the girders parallel to the bottom of the chassis. A plurality of joists is attached perpendicular to the girders and spaced apart from each other. A first axle assembly attachment zone is located between the midpoint and the rear of the chassis for releasably attaching an axle assembly to the bottom of the chassis and a second axle assembly attachment zone is located between the midpoint and the front of the chassis for releasably attaching an axle assembly to the bottom of the chassis. A first hitch assembly attachment zone is located at the front of the chassis for releasably attaching a hitch assembly to the bottom of the chassis and a second hitch assembly attachment zone is located at the rear of the chassis for releasably attaching a hitch assembly to the bottom of the chassis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, a preferred embodiment thereof will now be described in detail by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of a mobile home chassis, according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the chassis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear view of the chassis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a front view of the chassis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top view of the axle assembly of the chassis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view of the axle assembly, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view of the hitch assembly of the chassis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of the hitch assembly, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a side view of an alternative configuration of the chassis, configured for towing from the front of the chassis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a side view of the chassis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, configured for towing from the rear of the chassis.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mobile home chassis, according to the present invention, has removable axle and hitch assemblies to permit the wheel axle and hitch to be easily removed at the installation site of the mobile home and re-used.
