A cushioning member is placed at or near the back vent on the interior surface of the case and may substantially or completely surround the back vent. When a PED is placed within the case, the fit of the PED and the case causes the cushioning member to press against the PED in order to create a cushion for the PED in the event of an outside force being applied to the case.

A PED may include a tablet, smartphone, e-readers, and the like. However, the use of a PED in this fashion implies multiple considerations. One of these considerations is the protection of the PED. It may be desirable to place the PED in a case for protection from external forces and/or other environmental hazards. Due to the portable nature of the PED, it may be desirable to place the PED in a case because the PED may be subject to certain stresses due to its portability (such as drops, casual handling, casual placement, etc.). A PED case can help protect the PED by taking the brunt of the force from these types of events. It may also be desirable to place the PED in a case because the environment around the PED (including, but not limited to, the temperature, humidity, and surrounding objects or environmental substances such as liquids, dirt, and/or dust) may be dynamic and unpredictable, with some such environments (or substances from those environments) having the potential to damage the PED.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another consideration accompanying the use of the PED is heat dissipation. Due to a desire for the PED to remain fully functional apart from a physical connection with any other device, a PED typically integrates all components (electronic or otherwise) that it needs in order to perform its processing and user interaction tasks. These may include components that generate a non-trivial amount of heat when in use, such as power source(s) (typically one or more batteries), processors (e.g., a system on a chip (SoC), a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU)), and/or power converters, among other possibilities. In order to prevent damage to these or other components of the PED and/or to prevent or minimize any necessary throttling of the performance (and thus heat output) of these or other components of the PED, it is usually necessary to provide for the dissipation of generated heat away from the PED.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A third consideration accompanying the use of the PED is peripheral access. A PED may have peripherals such as buttons, speakers, cameras, microphone, etc., that may not function well (or at all) unless they remain uncovered by another material. For example, a camera peripheral of the PED that is covered by opaque rubber of a traditional case will not be able to capture images as intended by the manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The protection consideration on the one hand and the heat dissipation and peripheral access considerations on the other hand are in many cases contrary to one another. For example, in many instances, the protection of the PED in a traditional case may have an adverse effect on the heat dissipation from the PED, if (as is often the case) the material of the case acts to some extent as a heat insulator. Further, a traditional case that covers a peripheral (e.g., a camera, button, microphone, or speaker) of the PED may degrade or impede the functionality of that peripheral. However, using the PED without a case may raise the risk of damage to the PED due to careless/rough handling and/or other external forces and hazards. The present disclosure describes PED cases that are effective at dissipating heat in a passive manner, providing access to peripherals, and providing protection to the PED from careless/rough handling and/or external forces and hazards.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front or interior of a PED case <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment. The PED case <b>100</b> includes a body <b>102</b>, back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> and sealing members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>. The body <b>102</b> comprises one or more interior surfaces (including an interior backplane <b>114</b> and interior edges such as an interior edge <b>116</b>) that are shaped and/or otherwise configured to accept a PED as an installed PED to the PED case <b>100</b>. The body <b>102</b> of the PED case <b>100</b> may be made of plastic, rubber, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), or another appropriate material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> may present through the interior backplane <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the portion(s) of the PED that are exposed through the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> may not be sensitive to potentially harmful environmental substances (e.g., liquids, dirt, and/or dust), or such portion(s) may be otherwise hardened against environmental substances.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may expose an area of a PED that has been placed in the PED case <b>100</b> to open air. This may allow for heat transfer from a portion of a PED installed in the PED case <b>100</b> directly to the surrounding environment. The back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be shaped and positioned such that they are optimally used for heat transfer purposes with a predetermined PED. For example, the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be placed such that, when a known model of PED is placed within the PED case <b>100</b>, one or more components of the PED that are known to generate a relatively greater amount of heat are substantially aligned with one of the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. For example, it may be that when the known PED that is a tablet computer is placed within the PED case <b>100</b>, the battery of the tablet computer is substantially in line with the back vent <b>104</b> and the CPU of the tablet computer is substantially in line with the back vent <b>106</b>. Thus, these components (which may generate a relatively greater share of the heat within the tablet computer) can quickly dissipate heat through the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> without such heat transfer being slowed by heat passage through the material of the body <b>102</b> of the PED case <b>100</b> first. In some embodiments, a heat outtake (either active or passive) of the PED (not shown) may align with one or more of the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vents <b>104</b>,<b>106</b> may be configured in different shapes, sizes, and number to improve thermal venting and/or for aesthetics. As illustrated, the vents <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be symmetrically aligned on the backplane <b>114</b> such that they are equadistant from a center axis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The back vents <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> may expose peripherals of an installed PED (e.g., a camera and/or a microphone) to the outside environment, allowing for the necessary peripheral access. For example, this placement may allow a camera to take photos and/or video and the microphone to be used without interference from the PED case <b>100</b>. Thus, the vents <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> may also be referenced herein as peripheral apertures as the primary purpose is to allow access to peripheral devices. The back vents <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> may also allow for heat transfer from the portion of an installed PED against which they are placed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Sealing members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may be attached substantially around the perimeter of corresponding vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. The sealing members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> prevent the entry of potentially harmful environmental substances into the PED case <b>100</b> (due to their placement directly against the back of the PED when the PED is installed) at the locations of the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. The sealing members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may also be referred to as cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> in that they cushion and/or support the PED near the areas exposed through the vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> and thus help to keep an installed PED in position within the PED case <b>100</b>. Thus, the sealing or cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may be formed of a compressible material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may be installed at, near, and/or around the edges of the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> where the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> present through the interior backplane <b>114</b> (or other interior surface) of the body <b>102</b>, and they may completely or substantially surround the back vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>. Other placements and shapes of back vents with associated cushioning members are contemplated. Further, one of skill in the art will appreciate that any number of vents and corresponding sealing members may be disposed the backside of the case. Thus, 2, 3, 4, or more vents may be used as needed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may help cushion the areas of an installed PED that are near the vents <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, and may reduce or eliminate the stresses that those areas might otherwise be placed under due to events related to the portability of the PED, such as drops, casual handling, casual placement, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When uncompressed, it may be that the sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> rise above the interior backplane <b>114</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the PED case <b>100</b>. When a PED is inserted into the PED case <b>100</b>, the interior backplane <b>114</b> (and/or other interior surface with a cushioning member) may be pressed towards the PED due to the fit of the PED case <b>100</b> around the PED. The pressure thus formed may cause the sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> to be pressed against the PED. The sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may be made of a material different than the body <b>102</b>, such as rubber, TPU, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foam, or any other material sufficient to act as the sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> as herein described.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The material(s) of the sealing/cushioning members <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may be the same as, or different from, the material(s) of the body <b>102</b> of the PED case <b>100</b>.
