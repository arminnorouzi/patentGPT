No element, act, or instruction used herein should be construed as critical or essential unless explicitly described as such.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following discussion, the use of Controlled Source Electromagnetic (CSEM) for near-subsurface void detection is described. There is a general oversimplification of modeling efforts in the CSEM world that has led to the conventional conclusion that there can be no mechanism for bi-static responses from subsurface geology using electromagnetic (EM) methods. However, recent experiments and data sets have shown that in near-surface (less than 800 m depth) environments there are weak but significant responses from the earth that exhibit the behavior of bi-static doublets that can be used for void detection as described below. Although the description below is written in terms of void detection, the same techniques may be used for detecting conductive elements, such as a large metallic object.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The proposed mechanisms for detecting bi-static doublets are related to low-frequency permittivity values that exceed those modeled for low frequencies and un-modeled drift velocities due to mineral content that act in a semiconductor manner with voltage fields present. As described in detail below, a system that places CSEM receivers in the near field of the CSEM transmitter and within a large voltage field may be used to perform these techniques. Other mechanisms that are not modeled or described in detail below may provide additional electron drift velocity components and charge mobility. The described techniques may be called Cross-Correlation Electromagnetic Tomography.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the CSEM transmitter and receivers may be implemented as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,810,804, entitled &#x201c;Collecting and Transmitting Control Source Electromagnetic Signals,&#x201d; issued Nov. 7, 2017, U.S. Pat. No. 11,221,429, entitled &#x201c;COHERENT TRANSMIT AND RECEIVER BI-STATIC ELECTROMAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL TOMOGRAPHY,&#x201d; issued Jan. 11, 2022, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. The same equipment may be used for both near-surface and deep subsurface work, but the techniques for use of the equipment may vary.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The techniques described herein use a very long Pseudo-Random Numeric (PRN) code that is over 8191 chips long. Each bit in the pseudorandom binary sequence is known as a chip. In the example described below the PRN code comprises 16383 chips with an 8-second code period that is transmitted continuously by the controlled source electromagnetic transmitter. The PRN code creates a broad spectrum signal that is not coherent with noise sources, providing significant advantages in signal detection and signal-to-noise ratios. The spectrum may be in the low frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 KHz. In one example, the spectrum was 200 Hz-600 Hz. The use of a broad spectrum signal is required since not all of the spectrum is present in the received signal. The controlled source electromagnetic transmitter current and voltage data are recorded at the source.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An array of a plurality of surface CSEM receivers is deployed to record the response created by the CSEM transmitter providing power into the ground. Each member of the array of surface CSEM receivers thus receives a signal corresponding to the signal generated by the CSEM transmitter that is reflected from the subsurface. Each recording instrument in the CSEM transmitter and CSEM receiver array is precisely synchronized, preferably to better than 100 nanoseconds difference, across all devices with very low drift. In addition, each recording instrument has as high a sample rate as attainable, preferably at least 50,000 samples per second. Those configurations are due to the high velocity of the recorded electromagnetic response. Depending on various electrical properties of the subsurface structure, the velocity of the received signals may vary in a range of 3,000 m/sec to over 100,000 m/sec. Therefore, lower sample rates or poor synchronization would not allow the system to resolve the doublets.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart <b>100</b> illustrating a technique for detecting near-subsurface voids according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a preliminary resistivity survey of the near-surface impedances of a target area may be performed in block <b>110</b> using an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) system. ERT systems are readily available. An example of an ERT system is the Super Sting Monitoring System from Advanced Geosciences Inc. at www.agiusa.com. The preliminary resistivity survey may be used to provide calibration markers for the cross-correlation data and also allow the creation of a velocity model from inverted ERT data in block <b>120</b> that converts time-based information into subsurface depth information. Different subsurface materials may produce significant differences in signal velocity. Techniques for creating a velocity model are well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art and need not be described further herein. People skilled in the art may also define the velocities in the very low frequency range as a pseudo velocity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While there may be similarities between cross-correlation electromagnetic tomography data and inverted ERT data, the cross-correlation is not inverted data, but a direct measurement that only requires a velocity model. In general, the cross-correlation electromagnetic tomography techniques described here depend upon several considerations for a successful operation:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Depth: 1 m to 800 m</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Subsurface impedance: &#x3c;100 ohm meters. I.e., electromagnetic velocities of &#x3c;100,000 m/s</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The subsurface feature should be below the surface but above a first low resistivity area. Generally, the subsurface feature, such as a tunnel, should have a response from all three lines of receivers, A, B, and C, where the response should be small and the time between the peaks and valleys in the cross-correlation should also be small. Obtaining a response on all three receivers A, B, and C with approximately the same time delay increases the certainty that the response is from a subsurface linear structure. Although three lines of receivers A, B, and C are described in the examples below, arrays with different numbers of lines of receivers may be used. For example, an array with six lines of receivers may provide better results for a more complex subsurface structure shape with a larger vertical extent, such as a tomb.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In block <b>130</b> the CSEM transmitter and CSEM receivers are positioned over the target area. An example of an array layout may have short CSEM receiver antenna lengths, for example, 3-meters to 12-meters, and CSEM receiver spacing may be 6-meter to 24-meter spacing depending on the estimated depth and size of the target. However, different use cases may employ different CSEM receiver antenna lengths and different spacing. The CSEM transmitter is attached to a grounded dipole that is of sufficient length to ensure that the measurement area is away from the extreme field curvature at the power-ground coupling points.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The CSEM receivers are operatively distributed across the surface of the earth relative to a corresponding CSEM transmitter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example layout of the CSEM transmitter <b>1010</b> and CSEM receivers <b>1020</b> where the target area is small. For a large target area, as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, CSEM receivers may be laid out as two strips of equipment, using two CSEM transmitters <b>1110</b>, <b>1120</b> and two arrays of CSEM receivers <b>1130</b>, <b>1140</b>, to obtain two points in a large field for the target tunnel or other subsurface feature. If there is a deviation in the tunnel or other subsurface feature between the two distant measurement points, there may be a need for a third strip in the center of the field. There is no need to cover the whole area.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In block <b>140</b>, the CSEM transmitter transmits a signal into the ground, using the PRN codes described above. The CSEM transmitter signals are recorded for later cross-correlation with the signals received by the array of CSEM receivers, which also record the received signals. The transmitted and received signal data may be stored in any desired way, as long as timestamps are associated with the signal data, as well as an identification of which CSEM receiver in the array of CSEM receivers is associated with the received signal data.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In block <b>150</b>, the signal data captured from the CSEM transmitter and CSEM receivers are cross-correlated in the frequency domain, using software cross-correlation techniques. The resulting cross-correlated data produces a data set that is the cross-correlation for each CSEM receiver and CSEM transmitter across the CSEM receiver array. In one embodiment, the CSEM transmitter data may be extended by some number of frames (e.g., 3 frames) before cross-correlating the CSEM receiver data to ensure a &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d; in the middle of the data. In another embodiment the data frames can be stacked in the frequency domain to provide improved signal to noise (SNR) and reduced spectral leakage prior to cross correlation. In some embodiments, phase information in the data may be unwrapped. No effort to fix any unwrap phase errors is required, as the overall result does not change.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In block <b>160</b>, software may analyze the cross-correlated data for each CSEM receiver-transmitter pair set to detect peaks and valleys within the cross-correlated data. In block <b>170</b>, software may sort the cross-correlated data by significance as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. Finally, in block <b>180</b>, software may identify groups of doublets that are co-located in time and space as indicating the presence of a near-subsurface void or conductive element.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The significance of a peak or valley is controlled by bin separation. In the example illustrated in the figures, peak/valley and valley/peak pairs need to be close together in time to be a small structure, such as an elongated void. Different combinations of positions along the array and timing between each doublet provide information about the shape and depth of the sub-surface void or conductive element.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the following example data, there are three lines of receivers in the array laid east to west. The offset for each line from the transmitter is C line @ 10-meter, B line @ 15-meter, and A line @ 20-meter. The transmitter grounded dipole is 300 meters long.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate how the data can be related to the surface using a simple spreadsheet and that depth can be estimated using a velocity model. Although illustrated for simplicity in the form of a spreadsheet in the figures, any format of data storage usable by the software may be used for the analysis. In this example, an experiment was performed using the described techniques to locate some subsurface tunnels <b>225</b> and <b>235</b> that were already known to exist by the client CSEM receivers were placed at lines A, B, and C as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the actual position of an anomaly of interest is indicated approximately by the orange line mark <b>290</b> as the bi-static response is halfway between the CSEM receiver location and the CSEM transmitter. This is distinct from the expected typical EM response that would be immediately above the subsurface anomaly in this example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, area <b>210</b> illustrates the presence of doublets on receiver lines B and C, but not receiver line A. Area <b>220</b> illustrates the presence of doublets on receiver lines A and B, while area <b>230</b> illustrates doublets on receiver lines A, B, and C. Area <b>240</b> illustrates the presence of doublets on receiver line C only. Area <b>250</b> illustrates a high-velocity zone in which the PRN code was inverted on receiver lines A, B, and C. Area <b>260</b> illustrates variably spaced doublets on receiver lines A and C. Area <b>270</b> illustrates doublets on receiver lines B and C. And area <b>280</b> illustrates another PRN code inversion subsurface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">There are two techniques to sort the cross-correlation data into useful groups that may be used to detect the near subsurface voids of interest:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first method is qualitative and observes trace shape and makes a determination based on the quality of the trace as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which illustrates traces from an area with no void, the curves exhibit no relatively flat area. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, however, which illustrates traces from an area with a void, the curves exhibit a relatively flat area <b>510</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also includes clear indications of doublets <b>520</b> in the curves <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second technique, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, is quantitative and first removes all large peaks and valleys that are due to large resistivity changes in the subsurface and the airwave. These are generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> at <b>610</b> and <b>620</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the result of this first step. The next step is to remove all doublets that exceed a certain timespan defined from the velocity model, resulting in the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. For example, a 3-meter void would cause a doublet with a shorter time-space than a 10-meter void, so if the expected void is a 3-meter void, a doublet with a longer time-space corresponding to a 10-meter void may be eliminated. Finally, depending on foreknowledge of the void type, a search is done for groups of adjacent doublets that are co-located in time, depth, and spatially relevant response within the A, B, and C array lines. The results are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The results in this example revealed the existence of known tunnel <b>225</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A previously unknown tunnel <b>245</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> was also identified and later confirmed. In addition, the doublets indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> suggested the presence of an additional tunnel <b>255</b> below tunnel <b>225</b>, the presence of which was later confirmed by the client. The doublets of area <b>260</b> also suggested a tunnel, and the presence of a tunnel with a middle section that had been concrete-filled was later confirmed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Numerous other quantitative methods can be used to analyze this data including ideas such as differential analysis and inversion of the data using a velocity model created from the ERT inverted resistivity data used to provide more accurate depth and orientation information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">While certain example embodiments have been described in detail and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, which is determined by the claims that follow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
