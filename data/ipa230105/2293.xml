More specifically, embodiments herein relate to production of a high purity isoamylene product via decomposition of tertiary amyl alkyl ether. Even more specifically, embodiments herein relate to production of a high purity isoamylene product via decomposition of tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">ISOAMYL ETHER PRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">TAME and other isoamyl ethers may be produced by reaction of isoamylene with an alcohol. The reaction of an alcohol and an olefin and separation of the reactants from the reaction products by fractional distillation has been practiced for some time. The process is variously described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,232,177; 4,307,254; 4,336,407; 4,504,687; 4,987,807; 4,950,803; and 5,118,873. Other more recent patents discussing the production of TAME or co-production of TAME and MTBE include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,232,509; 5,248,837; 6,232,509, 5,792,891; 7,553,995; 6,583,325; 7,141,705; 7,030,277; and 9,254,479, among others.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various feed streams containing isoamylene in admixture with other hydrocarbons may be used to produce isoamyl ethers. Feed streams and sources suitable for the production of TAME or other isoamyl ethers include hydrocarbon fractions including C5 hydrocarbons that contain isoamylenes, specifically 2-methyl-1-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene. Refinery streams are usually separated by fractional distillation, and a light naphtha cut is one such refinery stream. Because they often contain compounds that are very close in boiling points, such refinery separations are not precise. A refinery C5 stream, for instance, may contain C4s and up to C8s and higher. Hydrocarbon components in these mixtures may be saturated (alkanes), unsaturated (mono-olefins), or poly-unsaturated (diolefins). Additionally, the components may be any or all of the various isomers of the individual compounds. Such refinery mixtures can easily contain 150 to 200 components, including the desired isoamylenes. In addition to a light naphtha cut, other isoamylene-containing hydrocarbon streams may be utilized in the present process, including a C4-C5 cut, a C5 cut, a C4-C6 cut, a C5-C6 cut, and many other C5-containing mixtures as may be envisioned by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments herein, TAME production is from a feed source with minor amounts of C4s and majority of the cut is C5s; some small percentage may be C6s but for gasoline blending, lifting of the C6s in the depentanizer is limited to avoid having a bigger TAME unit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As an example of the production of TAME, methanol and the isoamylene containing C5 stream may be fed to a reactor or a catalytic distillation column where they are contacted with a catalyst. The methanol preferentially reacts with isoamylene, forming TAME. When produced in a catalytic distillation column, the TAME is typically heavier than the unreacted C5 components of the feed mixture and the methanol, hence it drops in the column and may be collected as a bottoms fraction. Concurrently, the unreacted C5's (e.g. n-pentane, n-pentenes) are lighter and may be collected as an overhead fraction. Similar reactions may occur between ethanol and isoamylene, forming tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE). The ethers product usually has 1-2 wt % of unreacted C5s to maximize the TAME product purity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">TAME and other isoamyl ethers may be formed by the reaction of isoamylene and methanol (alcohol) at mild operating conditions over an acid catalyst. The selectivity of this reaction is limited by equilibrium constraints. By using a catalytic distillation column, essentially complete conversion is attainable. The alcohol and isoolefin are fed to a distillation column reactor having a distillation reaction zone containing a suitable catalyst, such as an acid cation exchange resin, in the form of catalytic distillation structure. As embodied in the etherification of isoamylene, the olefin and an excess of methanol may be first fed to a fixed bed reactor wherein most of the olefin is reacted to form the corresponding ether, tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME). The fixed bed reactor may be operated at a given pressure such that the reaction mixture is at the boiling point, thereby removing the exothermic heat of reaction by vaporization of the mixture.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The effluent from the fixed bed reactor is then fed to the distillation column reactor wherein the remainder of the isoamylenes are converted to the ether and the methanol is separated from the ether, which is withdrawn as bottoms. The C5 olefin stream generally contains only about 10 to 60 percent olefin, the remainder being inerts that are removed in the overheads from the distillation column reactor. The overhead hydrocarbon raffinate contains an amount of methanol up to the azeotropic concentration of about 12 wt %. This stream may then be washed with water to separate methanol from the hydrocarbons. Methanol is then distilled to remove the water.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The etherification processes typically utilizes strongly acidic ion exchange resins as etherification catalysts, which are strongly acidic organic polymers. As an isoamylene molecule meets alcohol at an active site, the reaction takes place rapidly forming ether.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The bottoms product, as noted above, contains the isoamyl ether, such as TAME. In addition to the isoamyl ether, the bottoms product, being a crude or commercial grade isoamyl ether product, may contain various C5s, C6s, C7+components. Depending upon the efficiency of the upstream etherification process and the separations therein, the resulting commercial grade isoamyl ether, such as TAME, may include C5s, C6s, C7+, methanol, water, diisoamylene (DIA) and tertiary amyl alcohol (TAA), among other components, byproducts, and impurities.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">HIGH PURITY ISOAMYLENE PRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The crude or commercial grade isoamyl ether, which may be produced as described above, for example, may then undergo feed separations, back-cracking, and product separations to recover a high purity isoamylene product. Catalysts that may be used to facilitate the cracking of the ethers to form olefins and alcohols may include various acidic catalysts, including acid-treated silica-alumina catalysts, zeolites, and HF treated clays, among others known in the art.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, commercial grade TAME containing C5s, C6s, C7+, methanol, water, diisoamylene (DIA) and tertiary amyl alcohol (TAA) first undergoes removal of the C5s, C6s, C7+, DIA, methanol and some TAA in the feed purification section. The feed purification section is composed of a Lights and a Heavies Column in tandem. The Lights Column removes the bulk of the C5s, C6s, Methanol.. The Heavies Column removes the DIA, some TAA and majority of the C7+. The purified TAME is superheated and vaporized via high pressure steam then fed into a decomposition reactor wherein the decomposition reactions take place. As the TAME decomposition is an endothermic reaction, either medium or high pressure steam is used to provide the heat needed in the decomposition reactors. The vapor phase decomposition reaction is carried out between 130&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 2 to 12 barg. TAME then decomposes to 2-methyl 1-butene and 2-methyl 2-butene (referred to as isoamylenes or IA). Any remaining TAA present in the reactor feed also decomposes to isoamylenes and water, at the same decomposition rate. The methanol produced from the decomposition reaction also forms DME as a by-product. Other by-products formed in the reactor are DIA, isopentane and linear pentenes. As the TAME decomposition reactions can be carried out in lower conditions, there is lesser formation of DME and DIA as compared to MTBE decomposition. The reactor effluent is then washed in a methanol extraction column via countercurrent water washing to recover the methanol. The overhead of the methanol extraction column comprised of IA, linear pentenes, DME, DIA, and unconverted TAME is then sent to a Crude Column to separate the C5s and DME in the overhead and the unconverted oxygenates and DIA in the bottoms. The placement of the Methanol Extraction Column and Crude Column in the TAME decomposition unit typically depends on whether the decomposition unit is integrated with the upstream TAME unit or just standalone. The bottoms of the Crude column can either be recycled to the front end feed purification section to remove the DIA formed and to optimize the production of IA from the unconverted TAME or sent to the upstream TAME unit. The bottoms of the Methanol Extraction Column comprised mainly of methanol, water and some TAA are then sent to a Methanol Recovery Column (MRC) to recover methanol. Depending on the amount of TAA present in the MRC feed, a side draw is taken from the tower to purge out any TAA. The overhead of the Crude Column composed mostly of the C5s and DME is then sent to an Isoamylene Purification Tower where DME is vented. The bottoms is the high purity isoamylene. The methanol recovered from the MRC is then sent to the upstream TAME unit to reduce the methanol requirement of the TAME unit or to an optional Methanol Finishing Column to further purify the methanol and produce commercial grade methanol with purity of 99.90 wt % as a minimum</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, commercial grade TAME containing C5s, C6s, C7+, methanol, water, diisoamylene (DIA) and tertiary amyl alcohol (TAA) first undergoes removal of the C5s, C6s, C7+, DIA, methanol and some TAA in the feed purification section. The feed purification section is composed of a Divided Wall Column(DWC), combining the functions of separate Lights and Heavies Column. The DWC removes the bulk of the C5s, C6s, Methanol and TAA from the distillate of the column, while DIA, some TAA and majority of the C7+ are removed from the bottoms. The purified TAME is drawn from the side of the DWC, superheated and vaporized via high pressure steam then fed into a decomposition reactor wherein the decomposition reactions take place. Since the TAME decomposition is an endothermic reaction, high pressure steam is used to provide the heat needed in the decomposition reactors. The vapor phase decomposition reaction is carried out between 130&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 2 to 12 barg. In various embodiments, the decomposition reaction may be carried out at a temperature in a range from a lower limit of 130&#xb0; C., 135&#xb0; C., 140&#xb0; C., 150&#xb0; C., 160&#xb0; C., 170&#xb0; C., 185&#xb0; C., or 200&#xb0; C. to an upper limit of 190&#xb0; C., 200&#xb0; C., 210&#xb0; C., 220&#xb0; C., 230&#xb0; C., 240&#xb0; C., 250&#xb0; C., or 260&#xb0; C., and at pressures in a range from a lower limit of 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 or 6 barg to an upper limit of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 barg. TAME then decomposes to 2-methyl-1-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene (IA). Any remaining TAA present in the reactor feed also decomposes to isoamylenes and water, at a lower decomposition rate. The methanol produced from the decomposition reaction also forms DME as a by-product. Other by-products formed in the reactor are DIA, isopentane and linear pentenes.

As the TAME decomposition reaction is an endothermic reaction, medium orhigh pressure steam <b>24</b> is also used to provide the heat needed in the decomposition reactors.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vapor phase decomposition reaction may be carried out at a temperature between about 130&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. and at a pressure of between about 2 barg to 12 barg. TAME then decomposes to 2-methyl-1-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene (IA). Any remaining TAA present in the reactor feed also decomposes to isoamylenes and water, at a similar decomposition rate depending on the age of the catalyst. The methanol produced from the decomposition reaction may also form dimethyl ether (DME) as a by-product. Other by-products formed in the reactor are DIA, isopentane and linear pentenes. Since the reactor condition is mild, the formation of DME and DIA are relatively low.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The decomposition reactor effluent <b>27</b> is then fed to a methanol recovery zone <b>28</b> to recover a methanol fraction <b>29</b>, and an oxygenates and C5s fraction <b>30</b>. Methanol recovery zone <b>28</b> may include various configurations to separate the methanol from the oxygenates and the target C5 olefins. In some embodiments, the decomposition reactor effluent <b>27</b> may initially be washed in a methanol extraction column (not shown) via countercurrent water washing to recover the methanol. The bottoms of the methanol extraction column, mainly methanol, water and some TAA, may then be sent to a methanol recovery column (MRC) (not shown) to recover methanol fraction <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The C5s and similar boiling components recovered via flow line <b>30</b> from the methanol recovery zone, including IA, linear pentenes, DME, DIA, and unconverted TAME, may then be sent to an Isoamylene Lights column <b>34</b> to vent <b>33</b> any DME formed from the rest of the methanol-free reactor effluent <b>38</b> that then feeds the Isoamylene Finishing Column <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Depending on the amount of TAA present in the MRC feed, a side draw may be taken from the tower <b>38</b> to purge out any TAA in some embodiments. The bottoms <b>38</b> of the Isoamylene Lights Column <b>34</b> is mostly C5s and oxygenates is then sent to an isoamylene finishing column <b>40</b>, where the high purity isoamylene is taken overhead as product <b>42</b>. The bottoms <b>44</b> from the isoamylene Finishing Column, including the unreacted TAME and TAA, is then recycled to the front end purification section <b>12</b> to optimize the production of isoamylene.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The recovered isoamylene fraction <b>42</b> may have an isoamylene content greater than 90 weight percent; greater than 95 weight percent in other embodiments; greater than 97 weight percent in other embodiments; greater than 98 weight percent in other embodiments; greater than 98.5 weight percent in other embodiments; greater than 99 weight percent in other embodiments; greater than 99.1 weight percent in other embodiments; and greater than 99.5 weight percent in yet other embodiments. In other embodiments, the isoamylene recovered may have a purity of at least 99.9 weight percent.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The methanol <b>29</b> recovered in methanol recovery zone <b>28</b> may then be sent to the upstream TAME unit to reduce the methanol requirement of the TAME unit. This stream effectively integrates TAME production and isoamylene production, providing desired synergies with respect to raw material consumption.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For a TAME decomposition unit fully integrated with a TAME unit, the Isoamylene Lights Column <b>34</b> may be located before the Methanol Recovery zone <b>28</b>. In this configuration, the bottoms of the Isoamylene Lights Column <b>34</b> contains the unreacted oxygenates for recycle and the overhead stream then feeds the Methanol Extraction Column. The overhead of the methanol extraction column is the methanol-free C5s that eventually feeds Isoamylene Finishing Column <b>40</b> where DME is vented overhead. Bottom stream <b>44</b> in this case is the high purity isoamylene product.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a simplified process flow diagram of a system for producing high purity isoamylene according to embodiments herein is illustrated, where like numerals represent like parts. In this embodiment, the separations conducted in the first two distillation columns (<b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are combined within a divided wall distillation column <b>17</b> to recover the purified TAME <b>22</b> as a side draw. The remaining components of the back-cracking process, separations, and recycle, are as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, embodiments herein may produce a high purity isoamylene stream via TAME decomposition. Embodiments herein may thus be useful in expanding the use of TAME beyond gasoline blending uses, opening a new route for the use of TAME in petrochemical applications. Isoamylene present in steam cracker unit C5s or light cut naphtha, for example, is difficult to separate from linear pentenes through conventional distillation. Converting the isoamylene to TAME via etherification, followed by decomposition, as described herein, may advantageously result in a high purity isoamylene with very low impurities that is suitable for petrochemical applications in the production of fragrances, pesticides, peroxides, polymer antioxidant and hydrocarbon resin. Embodiments herein may thus be useful in expanding the purpose of gasoline blending TAME units while preserving use of much of the existing equipment in these units.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which these systems, apparatuses, methods, processes and compositions belong.
