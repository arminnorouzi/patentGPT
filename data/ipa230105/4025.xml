id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present disclosure relates to use of single vision ophthalmic lenses for correction of myopia in a wearer, wherein the single vision ophthalmic lens devices are configured with a base prescription to correct the myopia of the individual and are purposefully further configured with non-refractive features, wherein the non-refractive features facilitate an increase in the retinal ganglion cell activity for the wearer, which may serve as an optical stop signal to decelerate, ameliorate, control, inhibit, or reduce, the rate of myopia progression of the wearer.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="74.59mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230004026A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to ophthalmic lenses, particularly to contact lenses and spectacle lenses, for use with eyes experiencing eye-length related disorders, like myopia.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The human retina has three primary layers: the photoreceptor layer, the outer plexiform layer, and the inner plexiform layer. Cones and rods are the photoreceptors that respond to light in the retina of a human eye by transforming incoming light into electrical signals. The transduced electrical signal propagates from the photoreceptors, through the bipolar cells, further to the retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve, carrying visual information from the retinal cells to the brain allowing visual perception of the world. The photoreceptors respond with graded membrane potentials and release neurotransmitter glutamate proportional to the level of their polarisation state. For example, in absence of a light stimulus, the photoreceptors depolarise and release more glutamate relative to its baseline state. In the presence of light, the photoreceptors hyperpolarise, which happens due to the breakdown of opsins in the photoreceptors, causing it to release less glutamate relative to its baseline state. There are two types of bipolar cells in the retina, on- and off-centre bipolar cells, which separately encode positive and negative spatiotemporal contrast from incoming light by comparing the photoreceptor signals to spatiotemporal averages computed by the laterally connected layer of horizontal cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The horizontal cells are interconnected by conductive gap junctions and are connected to bipolar cells and photoreceptors in a complex triad synapse. The on- and off-centre bipolar cells have different responses to glutamate, which are based on the type and number of glutamate receptors located on each of these bipolar cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The off-centre bipolar cells have ionotropic receptors, which are excitatory to glutamate. These off-centre bipolar cells depolarise in response to glutamate and preserve the sign of the photoreceptors' signal. In presence of light, off-centre bipolar cells receive less glutamate from the photoreceptors, causing hyperpolarisation and release less glutamate to the corresponding ganglion cells downstream. In absence of light, the off-centre bipolar cells receive more glutamate from the photoreceptors, causing depolarisation and release more glutamate to the corresponding ganglion cells downstream.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The on-centre bipolar cells have metabotropic receptors, which are inhibitory to glutamate. These on-centre bipolar cells hyperpolarise in response to glutamate and reverse the sign of the photoreceptors' signal. In the presence of light, the on-centre bipolar cells receive less glutamate from the photoreceptors, causing depolarisation and release more glutamate to the corresponding ganglion cells downstream. In the absence of light, the on-centre bipolar cells receive more glutamate from the photoreceptors, causing hyperpolarisation and release less glutamate to the corresponding ganglion cells downstream. The more glutamate the on- or off-centre bipolar cells release onto the corresponding ganglion cells downstream, the greater is the action firing potential of the ganglion cells. The opposite responses to light between the on-centre bipolar and off-centre bipolar cells are the key to the differential response to light and dark states. In addition, the depolarising signal activity of the on- and off-centre bipolar cells may be amplified or suppressed by the horizontal cells that connect the surrounding photoreceptors in the corresponding receptive fields.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The horizontal cells receive excitatory input from the photoreceptors and send out inhibitory feedback in return to the photoreceptors connected in the surrounding neighbourhood. Receptive fields are groups of photoreceptors that send inputs downstream to bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The retinal receptive field can be described using concentric circular zones with a small circular central field and a broader circular field around the central field called the surround field. The receptive fields fall into two categories, namely, the off-centre with on-surround type receptive field and the on-centre with off-surround type receptive field. On- and off-centre receptive fields have different responses to light based on differences in bipolar cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Human eyes are hyperopic at birth, where the length of the eyeball is too short for the total optical power of the eye. As the person ages from childhood to adulthood, the eyeball continues to grow until the eye's refractive state stabilises. The growth of the eye is understood to be controlled by a feedback mechanism and regulated predominantly by the visual experience, to match the eye's optics with the eye length and maintain homeostasis. This process is referred to as emmetropisation. The signals that guide the emmetropisation process are initiated by the modulation of light energy received by the retina. The retinal image characteristics are monitored by a biological process that modulates the signal to start or stop, accelerate, or slow eye growth. This process coordinates between the optics and the eyeball length to achieve or maintain emmetropia. Derailing from this emmetropisation process results in refractive disorders like myopia. It is hypothesised that diminished retinal activity encourages eye growth, and contrarily increase in retinal activity inhibits eye growth.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The prevalence of myopia is increasing at alarming rates in many regions of the world, particularly in East Asia. In myopic individuals, the axial length of the eye is mismatched to the overall power of the eye, leading to distant objects being focussed in front of the retina.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A simple pair of negative single vision lenses can correct myopia. While such devices can optically correct the refractive error associated with eye length, they do not address the underlying cause of the excessive eye growth in myopia progression. Excessive eye length in high degrees of myopia is associated with significant vision threatening conditions like cataract, glaucoma, myopic maculopathy, and retinal detachment. Thus, there remains a need for specific optical devices for such individuals, that not only correct the underlying refractive error, but also prevent excessive eye lengthening or progression of myopia.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Terms, as used herein, are generally used by a person skilled in the art, unless otherwise defined in the following.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;myopic eye&#x201d; means an eye that is either already experiencing myopia, is in the stage of pre-myopia, is at risk of becoming myopic, is diagnosed to have a refractive condition that is progressing towards myopia with or without astigmatism.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;progressing myopic eye&#x201d; means an eye with established myopia that is diagnosed to be progressing, as gauged by either the change in refractive error of at least &#x2212;0.25 D/year or the change in axial length of at least 0.1 mm/year.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;an eye at risk of becoming myopic&#x201d; means an eye, which could be emmetropic or is low hyperopic at the time but has been identified to have an increased risk of becoming myopic based on genetic factors (e.g. both parents are myopic) and/or age (e.g. being low hyperopic at a young age) and/or environmental factors (e.g. time spent outdoors) and/or behavioural factors (e.g. time spent performing near tasks).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;optical stop signal&#x201d; or &#x201c;stop signal&#x201d; means an optical signal or directional cue that may facilitate slowing, reversing, arresting, retarding, inhibiting, or controlling the growth of an eye and/or refractive condition of the eye.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terms &#x201c;spatially and temporally varying optical stop signal&#x201d; or &#x201c;spatially and temporally variant optical stop signal&#x201d; mean an optical stop signal, provided at the retina, which changes with time and spatially across the retina of the eye.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;contact lens&#x201d; means a finished contact lens, suitable to be fit on the cornea of a wearer to affect the optical performance of the eye.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;spectacle lens&#x201d; may mean a finished or semi-finished blank lens.

The artificial edge patterns, or artificial luminous contrast profiles, imposed on the retina, offer a spatial contrast profile across the on- and off-centre retinal fields across the retina. The artificially induced edges provide an increase in the retinal spiking activity, or ganglion cell firing activity, which is a surrogate measure of overall retinal activity. The current disclosure postulates that increased retinal ganglion cell activity may in turn provide an optical stop signal to a progressing myopic eye.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some other embodiments of the present disclosure, the non-refractive features of the contact lens are configured such that the artificial edge patterns, or artificial spatial luminous contrast profiles, imposed on the retina are further configured to offer a temporal variation in the overall retinal ganglion cell activity.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure involve one or more variations of the structural characteristics of the non-refractive features, used in conjunction with single vision ophthalmic lenses, both contact lenses and spectacle lenses, as disclosed herein. For example, the structural characteristics of the non-refractive features include one or more of the following: their opaqueness, their size, width, and shape, their method of application, their location of application, their distribution, their arrangement pattern and spanning area, on the ophthalmic lens.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The contemplated variations of the numerous structural characteristics of the non-refractive features provide a desired on-eye functional visual performance, while maintaining the potency of the ophthalmic lens embodiments to slow the progression of myopia, as disclosed herein.

For example, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the one or more characteristics of the non-refractive features are configured on an otherwise single vision ophthalmic lens with a base prescription to correct the refractive error of the eye, wherein the embodiment ophthalmic lens when tested on a model eye, presented with a number of common visual scenes that may include scenes typical of environments and or behaviours thought to be associated with myopia development and/or progression, provides an increase in the retinal ganglion cell activity by about at least 1.25 times, at least 1.5 times, at least 1.75 times, at least 2 times, at least 2.5 times or at least 3 times the retinal ganglion cell activity of a single vision ophthalmic lens without the non-refractive features; wherein the retinal ganglion cell activity may include on-type cells, off-type cells or both on-type and off-type cells within the receptive fields. In some examples. the retinal ganglion cell activity may be within a local region, a plurality of local regions, or averaged across the desired retinal field. In some other embodiments, the ophthalmic lens tested on a model additionally provides a temporal variation in the retinal ganglion cell activity. In some examples, the retinal ganglion cell activity may be gauged by the retinal spike train analysis, while in some other examples, it may be gauged by the average retinal spike rate as a function of time. In certain other embodiments of the disclosure, the embodiment ophthalmic lens when tested on a model eye provides increased temporal variations, or fluctuations or oscillations to the retinal ganglion cell activity; wherein the temporal variations of the retinal ganglion cell activity may be represented as one or more of the following: non-monotonic fluctuations, quasi-sinusoidal variations, sinusoidal variations, periodic variations, aperiodic variations, aperiodic quasi-rectangular variations, rectangular variations, square-wave variations, or random variations in the retinal ganglion cell activity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, specific types of visual stimuli may be used to elicit the retinal ganglion cell activity, for example, white-noise electrical stimulation, a sinusoidal variation in the visual stimuli, a checkerboard pattern, full-field flash stimuli, semi-field flash stimuli, full-field Gaussian noise, semi-field Gaussian noise, regional flash stimuli, regional Gaussian noise, etc. In some examples only coarse characterisation of neural response to the stimuli may be desirable; while in other examples, much finer characterisation of neural response to stimuli may be desirable.

Given the influence of compliance of lens wear on the efficacy of such lenses, significant reduction of visual performance may promote poor compliance thus resulting in poorer efficacy.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Accordingly, what is needed are designs for the correction of myopia and retardation of progression, which do not cause the visual disturbances associated with manipulation of optical power within the ophthalmic lens. The current disclosure proposes an alternative non-refractive method to retard the progression of myopia that does not utilise optical defocus as a stop signal. Embodiments of the present disclosure proposes an alternative method to retard the progression of myopia by artificially introducing edges, or luminous contrast profiles to the retinal image. Some embodiments further introduce spatio-temporal variations of the luminous contrast profiles into the imagery that is projected onto the retina through the lenses of the current disclosure, and thereby increasing the overall retinal activity which in turn may inhibit further eye growth. One or more of the embodiments of the present disclosure rely on the centre-surround architecture of the retinal ganglion cells producing preferential responses to spatial and/or temporal changes in the luminous profile incident on the retina.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In this section, the present disclosure is described in detail with reference to one or more contact lens, or one or more spectacle embodiments, some of the contemplated embodiments are illustrated and supported by accompanying figures. Some contact lens and spectacle lens embodiments are provided by way of explanation and are not to be construed as limiting to the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The following description is provided in relation to several contact lens and spectacle lens embodiments that may share common characteristics and features of the disclosure. It is to be understood that one or more features of one embodiment may be combined with one or more features of any other embodiments which may constitute additional embodiments.

The sub-titles and relevant subject headings should not be used in construing the scope of the claims or the claim limitations.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Some of the techniques that have been reported to be usable to identify individuals with a risk of developing myopia or progressive myopia include inquiries on one or more of the following factors: genetics, ethnicity, lifestyle, environmental, excessive near work, etc. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards a person identified as at risk of developing myopia or progressive myopia. To date, numerous optical designs have been proposed to control the rate of eye growth or to retard the progression of myopia. Some of these designs are characterised by the use of some degree of relative positive power related to the base prescription. Designs based on such optical principles invite significant compromise of the quality of vision. Given the influence of compliance of lens wear on the efficacy, a significant reduction of visual performance may promote poor compliance thus resulting in poorer efficacy.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical designs that utilise the effects of purposefully configured non-refractive features within the optic zone of an otherwise single vision ophthalmic lens designed to increase the retinal ganglion cell activity which in turn aids to inhibit or decelerate the rate of myopia progression.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The human visual system is organised into on- and off-retinal channels or pathways. The retinal ganglion cells have circular receptive fields that are organised into on-centre/off-surround bipolar cells or vice versa; whose workings are succinctly described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">The complex retinal ganglion cell circuitry aids in the conversion of the spatiotemporal information contained within the incident light of the visual input scene into spike trains and patterns of activity conveyed to the visual cortex by the axons of the retinal ganglion cells which form the fibres of the optic nerve.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Two groups of retinal ganglion cells, magno and parvo cells, aid in the different types of responses to the incoming light signal captured on the retina. The information carried by magno and parvo cells are parallel and independent to each other.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The magnocellular or transient pathway captures the temporal features of the incoming light signal, for example, motion, changes and onsets within the input scene; while the parvocellular or sustained pathway captures spatial features of the incoming light signal, for example, patterns and shapes within the input scene.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The magnocellular pathway has large receptive fields, short latencies, and responds in a transient way utilising rapidly conducting axons. The parvocellular pathway, on the other hand, has smaller receptive fields, long latencies and responds in a sustained way by utilising slow conducting axons. The relative change events captured by the magnocellular pathway and the grey-level sustained image frames captured by the parvocellular pathway are two highly orthogonal representations of the visual scene.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Given the regulation of eye growth is locally and not globally mediated, the magnocellular pathway may be involved in the regulation of the eye growth, or mediation of the homeostasis of eye growth, for at least some individuals. In other words, the magnocellular retinal ganglion cells, which contain the information on local relative changes, offer the ability to encode the dynamic or temporal contrast within the visual scene which can be transcribed into growth on- or growth off-signals.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Increase in spatiotemporal contrast of a visual scene has a potential to introduce a spike, or a short-duration increase, in the retinal ganglion cell activity; and the greater the retinal ganglion cell activity, the higher the growth inhibition signal for the eye. Due to the construct of the retinal receptive field circuitry, the following two conditions fail to excite the retinal ganglion cells: (a) a homogeneously illuminated retinal scene without distinct edges (i.e. absence of spatial contrast in the visual scenery); or (b) a lack of change in the scenery for too long (i.e. absence of temporal contrast). The lower the excitation of the retinal ganglion cells the lower the firing activity which in turn signifies overall lower retinal activity; and the greater the inactivity of the retina the lower the growth inhibition signal resulting in further eye growth. The relative difference in the temporal integration of on- and off-receptive field activity determines further eye growth.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The present disclosure postulates that an inactive retina triggers eye growth and an active retina inhibits the growth or triggers a stop signal. The present disclosure further contemplates that standard single vision contact lenses or spectacle lenses of the prior art and/or a spatially homogenous visual imagery contributes to a homogeneous and substantially edge-less visual imagery leaving the retina in a baseline state (i.e. baseline or constant firing pattern of the retinal ganglion cells) and thus promoting further eye growth leading to more myopia.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the workings of the on-centre with off-surround, and the off-centre with on-surround types of retinal receptive fields, used to describe one or more of the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The first and third columns of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> highlight four instances of theoretical stimulus presentation: (a) no light across the retinal receptive field (<b>101</b> &#x26; <b>111</b>); (b) no light in the central region of the retinal receptive field, while the surround is fully lit (<b>102</b> &#x26; <b>112</b>); (c) no light in the surround region of the retinal receptive field, while the central region is fully lit (<b>103</b> &#x26; <b>113</b>); and (d) both the central and surround regions of the retinal receptive field are fully lit (<b>104</b> &#x26; <b>114</b>).

For example, when the entire receptive field lies in the dark part of the edge (<b>201</b>), the firing rate of the ganglion cells is at a basal rate, shown as the double black solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. When a part of the off-surround region is in the bright side of the edge, while the on-centre is still in the dark side of the edge (<b>202</b>), the firing rate of the ganglion cells is suppressed below the basal rate. When a part of the off-surround and the on-centre region moves towards the bright side of the edge (<b>203</b>), the firing rate is back to the basal rate. When the entire central region is in the bright side of the edge with some of the surround on the dark side (<b>204</b>), the firing rate achieves its peak.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Finally, when the entire receptive field is in the bright side of the edge (<b>205</b>), the firing rate drops close towards the basal rate but slightly on the higher range. The surround of the receptive field also influences the amount of glutamate released by the photoreceptors. If the surround field is dark, then the photoreceptors in this region will depolarise causing release of more glutamate.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">When light falls on the on-centre region, while at least some portion of the off-surround experiences relative darkness, the horizontal cells connected to the photoreceptors in the surround field will depolarise in response to the glutamate and release their own inhibitory neurotransmitter, which will further inhibit the centre photoreceptors to make them release even less glutamate. This situation will create the highest response in the firing action potential of the retinal ganglion cells. Exactly the opposite happens when the surround is in presence of light. The photoreceptor will hyperpolarise in the surround causing it to release less glutamate.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">The horizontal cells connected to the photoreceptors in the surround field will hyperpolarise in response and release less of their own inhibitory neurotransmitters, which produces less inhibitory response allowing the central photoreceptor not to be inhibited and release even more glutamate. This is a situation that will create the highest response in an off-centre ganglion receptive field.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Virtual Retinal Models</heading><p id="p-0180" num="0179">It can be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are theoretical scenarios of the working models of diverse on- and off-channel retinal fields and they may not be reflective of typical real-life scenarios experienced by individual eyes.

The incoming retinal signal has a luminosity profile of L (x, y, t); wherein the luminance is defined for every spatially separated point or pixel (x, y) of the retina at a time point (t). For all simulations used to describe the embodiments of the present disclosure, the input visual scenes were digitised to have intensities between 0 and 255 representing an 8-bit grey level. However, use of input images with intensities between 0 and 1023, or 0 and 4095, or 0 and 65535, representing a 10-bit, or a 12-bit, or a 16-bit grey levels may also be used to demonstrate the utility of other embodiments of the present disclosure. The subsequent layers of the virtual retinal cells are modelled as spatial continuums driven by a set of mathematical equations described herein.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">As noted from the chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first stage of virtual retinal model involves processing of the input signal in the outer plexiform layer which involves photoreceptors and horizontal cells. In the first stage, a simple spatiotemporal linear filter based on the teachings of Wohrer and Kornprobst referenced herein is used to decompose the input sequence L (x, y, t) into the photoreceptor centre response C (x, y, t) and response of the horizontal surround cells S (x, y, t). Further, the responses C (x, y, t) and S (x, y, t) are utilised in the outer plexiform layer filter to define a band-pass excitatory current I<sub>OPL </sub>(x, y, t) which is then fed to the bipolar cells in the second stage of the model. An instantaneous non-linear contrast gain control is applied to the bipolar layer V<sub>BP </sub>(x, y, t) using variable feedback gate shunt conductance g<sub>A </sub>(x, y, t) resulting in the excitatory current I<sub>GANG </sub>(x, y, t). In the third stage, a discrete set of equations governing the noisy integrate-and-fire cell models aids in the conversion of I<sub>GANG </sub>(X, y, t) into spike trains used to gauge the retinal ganglion cell activity. The spikes can be modelled using one-to-one connections or alternatively using synaptic pooling of the excitatory current received.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">To approximate the signal transformations that occur in the layers of the retina, multiple linear filters are used in different stages of the model.

The present disclosure postulates that an inactive retina triggers eye growth and an active retina inhibits the growth or triggers a stop signal.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0216">The present disclosure further contemplates that standard single vision ophthalmic lenses of the prior art and/or a spatially homogenous visual imagery contributes to a homogeneous and substantially spatially edge-less visual imagery leaving the retina in a baseline state (i.e. baseline or constant firing pattern of the retinal ganglion cells) and thus promoting further eye growth leading to more myopia.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0217">One or more of the following advantages are found in one or more of the disclosed optical devices, and/or methods of ophthalmic lens designs disclosed herein. An ophthalmic lens or method providing a stop-signal to retard the rate of eye growth or stop the rate of eye growth, or increase in the state of refractive error, of the wearer's eye based on an increase in retinal activity by employing a plurality of nonrefractive features and artificially introducing edges or enhanced luminous spatial contrast profiles or enhanced temporal contrast profiles into the retinal imagery produced through configuration of contemplated design features on the ophthalmic lens.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0218">The on-eye movement of the contact lens can further augment the strength of the treatment effect by providing a spatially and temporally varying stop signal for increasing the effectivity of managing progressive myopia.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0219">Certain other embodiments are directed to a contact lens device or method that is not solely based on optical manipulation of defocus, astigmatism, or positive spherical aberration, all of which may suffer from the potential visual performance degradation for the wearer. The following exemplary embodiment is directed to methods of modifying the incoming light through an ophthalmic lens that can utilise the selective effects of on and off-visual pathways on eye growth and myopia progression.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0220">The following exemplary embodiment is directed towards methods of modifying the incoming light through an ophthalmic lens that offers increased retinal ganglion activity by stimulation of the on-pathways on the retina by artificially introducing inhomogeneity into the visual imagery and by creating, or increasing, the luminous contrast profiles (i.e. artificial edges) at the retinal plane of the corrected eye. This may be achieved by using substantially opaque borders of a plurality of apertures, zones, segments, or regions within an otherwise single vision optical zone of the ophthalmic lens.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0221">In short, the use of the contemplated multiple apertures, non-refractive regions or non-refractive zones within the optical zone of an otherwise single vision contact lens or spectacle lens, may provide an increase of the activity of the retinal ganglion cells by stimulating the on- and/or off-pathways that are excited by the artificially introduced spatial edge profiles, when the light passes through the contact lens or spectacle lens.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0222">Further, this use of excitatory zones, non-refractive regions, or a plurality of apertures within a single vision contact lens or spectacle lens may offer a variation in temporal contrast supplemented by eye movements and/or blink action of the lids using contact lens and spectacle lens embodiments disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Schematic Eyes &#x26; Simulated Retinal Images</heading><p id="p-0231" num="0223">Advanced schematic model eyes may be used for computing wide-field simulated retinal images and wide-field optical performance of one or more of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0224">The generic prescription of the schematic model eye used for obtaining the retinal images serving as input to the virtual retinal platform used to simulate the workings for embodiments of the present disclosure is provided in the following Table 1.
