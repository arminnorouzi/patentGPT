In particular, the increase of the friction coefficient can bring some advantages that can be exploited in different sectors. In greater detail, increased grip can make a support more resistant to slipping. This characteristic, therefore, is useful in the field of anti slip surfaces. Furthermore, the increase of the friction coefficient of materials is directly related to a modification of the roughness of the same. This causes light to be reflected by the support in a different manner, modifying its optical properties. This characteristic is extremely important when it comes to change the appearance of the support as it happens, for example, in the glass frosting process. Thus, the modification of the surface properties of materials has several fields of application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Anti slip systems are known in which the surface, preferably a walking surface, has friction coefficients that are such as to prevent slipping.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By way of example, the case of plane surfaces is considered.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first known solution, to obtain an anti slip flooring plastic strips are used which contain rigid granules in a polymeric material or quartz capable of increasing the friction coefficient on the walking area, and which are glued onto the flooring. The problems of this solution are related to the need to position these strips at a distance of maximum 5 cm from one another, as required by the safety regulations in force. There are also problems related to the measurement of the friction coefficient on such a narrow strip according to the B.C.R.A. standard applied in Italy or the DIN and ASTM standards used in Europe and the United States. The life cycle of these strips is very short and depends only on the adhesion of the same to the floor, that is, only on the resistance of the used glue to delamination. Furthermore, the granules embedded in the polymeric matrix of the strips can gradually sink into the polymeric matrix due to wear. This causes the friction coefficient to lower slowly and gradually over time.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another solution of the known type consists in the cold hammering of the surface, carried out by means of a violent jet of spherical micro balls or cylinders. The machines that carry out this treatment project the jet towards the surfaces to be processed through one or more centrifugal impellers rotating rapidly or through compressed air. The materials used for the shots can be cast iron, steel, glass.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This type of processing results in the mechanical removal of the first layer of material of the support. The processed surface achieves a high degree of roughness which leads to an increase in the friction coefficient but also to great difficulty in cleaning. Furthermore, the actual removal of a layer of material may cause structural damages to the support and make it more easily chipped.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further solution of the known type is represented by bushhammering, which is performed using a special hammer called bushhammer having a hardened steel head with small and thick pyramidal (or even conical) points. Stone cutters used to hit the support repeatedly with this tool to obtain an irregular surface with the typical &#x201c;rough&#x201d; and natural appearance, which changed according to the size of the points. Nowadays the bushhammer has been replaced by pneumatic hammers whose end is provided with special interchangeable diamond plates. This type of processing leads to a mechanical modification of the outermost layer of the support, increasing its roughness and consequently its friction coefficient. The increase of this value, however, involves a proportional increase in cleaning difficulty. The removal of a layer of material, as in the case of micro shot peening, increases the risk of the material chipping or suffering structural damage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another solution, anti slip mats are used which consist of a mat provided with a button-patterned surface. These types of products have stability problems over time. They are laid on the ground by embedding them in the floor. These products, however, being made of a plastic material, tend to become deformed over time and to create an unstable support due to the vibrations and treading to which they are subjected. Furthermore, being difficult to clean, they become a receptacle for bacteria.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A different kind of solution concerns the application of substances to the surface to be treated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A first known solution is constituted by surface resin coating, according to which epoxy or polyurethane resins with quartz or polymer-based granules dispersed therein are directly applied to the surface.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The main defect of this solution lies in that the granules have low resistance to treading. The granules penetrate in the resin matrix over time, thus losing their anti slip effect. Furthermore, the resin itself can slowly wear out or lose grip, in particular in &#x201c;high traffic&#x201d; areas.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another known solution is constituted by the use of swelling chemical compounds. These products offer a solution constituted by dendrimers or nanosponges capable of penetrating in the surface pores and swell out of the cavity at the moment when they come into contact with a precursor. The asperities formed on the surface become rigid, thus producing an anti slip effect. These products need to be activated through contact with a &#x201c;precursor&#x201d; solution having the correct temperature, concentration or pH. In some cases, the swelling takes place in the absence of special conditions but it can be activated in the presence of the correct solvent. The problem linked to the use of these products is represented by their low resistance over time when subjected to prolonged treading. The air volumes projecting from the pores tend to wear out or to become round, thus losing their anti slip effect. Furthermore, these solutions need a specific disposal system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further known solution is constituted by surface etching, in which an acid solution is applied which is capable of interacting with the material creating cusps that increase the friction coefficient on the surface. These types of systems have defects related to the fact that the solutions are very acid and cannot be directly disposed of but require a specific recovery, neutralization and successive disposal treatment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, this solution poses the drawback of the extremely high concentrations of residuum, which remains active and deposited on the treated surface. In order to remove the exhausted product from the surface, a washing cycle with water is usually carried out to dilute the residuum. After the washing cycle, the quantity of acid present in the solution decreases, but in any case remains sufficiently high to be dangerous owing to its high corrosiveness. In the case where the treatment is carried out on outdoor floors, the solution can reach the ground around the installation area. This results in contamination of the water-bearing strata, aggression against the flora or danger for animals. For this reason, it is necessary to carry out a special process to recover these mixtures and then neutralize and dispose of them. The washing solutions need to be conveniently recovered even when the treatment is performed indoors. These warnings are not heeded, very often due to the operators' negligence or to their desire to avoid possible additional costs, and the washing waters are disposed of directly in the domestic or industrial sewage systems or into the ground.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to modifying the mechanical properties of the material, the techniques listed above modify also the aesthetic appearance of the support. There are also other methods not listed herein which allow this type of modification, for example the sandblasting or mechanical engraving of the surface. The sandblasting technique is a mechanical processing method thanks to which it is possible to make decorations, engravings, glazing effects or simply to matt the surface of the material (increased grip). The support can be masked to protect the sensitive areas that must not be treated and can be subjected, by means of a sandblasting machine, to an air jet containing corundum (aluminium oxide), which abrades the contact area. This system can be effective but becomes difficult to use with certain materials and on vertical supports. Similarly, it is possible to engrave the support mechanically by means of the micro milling technique. This method is implemented using micro millers in carborundum (silicon carbide) or tungsten carbide grinders to engrave the support. Said technique, however, is difficult to apply and to replicate, since the result depends on the &#x201c;steady hand&#x201d; of the operator, and furthermore requires long execution times.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In general, all the solutions of the known type pose a first type of problem related to the cleaning difficulty and to the resistance of the anti slip effect or of the aesthetic result over time. Furthermore, some techniques require the use of very corrosive materials and/or materials which are very difficult to dispose of. The main object of the present invention is thus to solve or at least partially overcome the problems that characterize the solutions known in the art.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is a first object of the present invention to propose a solution that makes it possible to treat surfaces so as increase their friction coefficient and to reduce or eliminate the environmental impact of the treatment itself, making it more &#x201c;biocompatible&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is another object of the present invention to propose a surface treatment which makes it possible to reduce the required processing times.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is a further object of the present invention to propose a surface treatment which makes it possible to reduce costs compared to the surface treatments of the known type.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention is based on the general consideration according to which the problems observed in the state of the art can be at least partially overcome using a system for modifying the surface properties of a surface of a material by means of an electrochemical process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, according to a main aspect of the present invention the subject of the same is a method for modifying the surface properties of a material, wherein said method comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0026">preparing a first layer comprising an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of a cathode, a second layer comprising an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of an anode and an intermediate layer suited to become impregnated with an electrolyte in the liquid phase or to regulate its flow between said cathode and said anode;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0027">associating an electrolyte in the liquid phase with one or more of said layers;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0028">positioning said anode or said cathode on said surface to be treated;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0029">supplying power to said cathode and said anode in order to activate the electrochemical process of said electrolyte in the liquid phase for a predetermined time interval.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">Preferably, said step of positioning said anode or said cathode on said surface to be treated comprises the positioning of said anode or said cathode in direct contact with said surface to be treated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment, said step of associating an electrolyte in the liquid phase with one or more of the layers comprises first the step of associating an electrolyte in the solid phase with one or more of the layers and successively the step of adding a liquid to form the electrolyte in the liquid phase.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">According to another aspect of the present invention, the same concerns a device for modifying the surface properties of a material, wherein said device comprises:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0033">a first layer comprising an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of a cathode;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0034">a second layer comprising an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of an anode;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0035">an intermediate layer suited to become impregnated with an electrolyte in the liquid phase or to regulate its flow between said cathode and said anode;

It should, however, be pointed out that the present invention is not limited to walking surfaces. On the contrary, the present invention may be applied in all those cases in which it is necessary to treat surfaces in general, therefore not only walking surfaces such as floors, and in which a specific value of the friction coefficient is required.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0082">The application of the invention is especially convenient in all those cases in which floors situated outdoors must be treated, possibly already existing floors.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a floor whose walking surface F is preferably treated according to the invention by means of a device <b>1</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0084">In said preferred embodiment, the treatment consists in modifying the friction coefficient of the surface F in a pre-existing floor on site, advantageously increasing said coefficient.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0085">By way of example, the floor may be constituted by a floor made of stone or ceramic or glass, for example a footpath outside a house.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0086">In preferred variant embodiments, the treatment is carried out directly on tiles designed to be successively laid according to the intended use, as explained also further on in the description.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0087">The device <b>1</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the invention preferably comprises a first layer <b>12</b>, or upper layer, a second layer <b>14</b>, or lower layer, and an intermediate layer <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0088">The first layer <b>12</b> preferably comprises an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of a cathode.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0089">The second layer <b>14</b> preferably comprises an electrically conductive material suited to serve the function of an anode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0090">The intermediate layer <b>16</b> preferably comprises a porous layer which, thanks to its characteristics, allows the gradual passage of a solution containing an electrolyte designated also as electrolyte in the liquid phase. The intermediate layer <b>16</b> thus comprises a layer suited to become impregnated with an electrolyte in the liquid phase or to regulate its flow.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0091">The three layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> actually define an electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0092">The device <b>1</b> according to the invention, as described in greater detail below, makes it possible to treat the surface F of the floor by means of an electrochemical process.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0093">For this purpose, at least one among said layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> is suited to receive an electrolyte in the liquid phase or in the solid phase.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0094">In the case where the electrolyte is already incorporated in the device <b>1</b> in the liquid phase, meaning that the device <b>1</b> is pre-impregnated, the device <b>1</b> is ready for the treatment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0095">In the case where the electrolyte is incorporated in the device <b>1</b> in the solid phase, a liquid, for example water, is added to the device <b>1</b> before the treatment in order to obtain the electrolyte solution (electrolyte in the liquid phase).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0096">In a further situation, the device <b>1</b> may contain no electrolyte at all. In this case, the electrolyte in the liquid phase is added to the device <b>1</b> before the treatment.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0097">Preferably, the three layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are kept in a mutually fixed position through a peripheral edge <b>20</b> that surrounds the layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> themselves.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0098">In variant embodiments, the three layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can be preferably kept in a mutually fixed position through different and/or equivalent locking methods such as, for example, gluing, electric welding, heat welding, sewing etc.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0099">The first and/or the second layer <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, cathode and anode, comprise any electrode that is useful to obtain water electrolysis or more generally any electrically conductive material, preferably a metallic material, carbon and its derivatives, or biomaterials. For example, the first and/or the second layer <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> comprise/s graphite cloth, consisting of thin cloth with narrow-mesh warp and weft, or graphite felt, meaning a non-woven fabric needled with graphite fibres.

In this configuration, during the process positive ions which allow the surface F to be treated are brought to the anode <b>14</b>. In variant embodiments, not shown herein, the device can be positioned on the surface to be treated in such a way that the layer serving as a cathode rests on the surface itself. In this configuration, during the process negative ions which allow the surface F to be treated are brought to the cathode.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0102">When the electrolyte, be it in the liquid or in the solid phase, is incorporated in advance in the device <b>1</b>, it can be positioned in any of the three main components (<b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>), provided that they have the required characteristics, so that it serves as an immobilization layer.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0103">The intermediate layer <b>16</b>, as already explained above, has a certain degree of porosity that is suited to allow the gradual passage of a solution containing an electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0104">The intermediate layer <b>16</b> preferably comprises one or more of the following materials:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0105">paper and cellulose pulp-based or lignin-based systems;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0106">paper and cellulose pulp-based or lignin-based systems loaded with polymeric fibres;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0107">fabrics;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0108">knit fabrics made of any material, having a mesh size that is such as to allow the passage of a liquid, for example jersey;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0109">non-woven fabrics;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0110">porous and/or filtering polymeric materials;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0111">porous and/or filtering natural and synthetic rubbers;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0112">inorganic materials, for example mica;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0009" num="0113">porous and/or filtering vitrified or ceramic materials.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0092" num="0114">The electrolytes suited to be used for the treatment preferably comprise any salt or chemical compound soluble in water and/or another suitable polar solvent.

For example, in the case of use of ammonium fluoride it is preferably included between 0.001% and 0.20% in weight.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0116">Electrolytes that can be used for the treatment are specified in the tables below. The preferred concentration intervals are also indicated for each electrolyte. This treatment can work with any suitable electrolyte, but it is also possible to exploit the electrolysis of water to bring H+ ions to the anode or OH&#x2014; ions to the cathode. The electrolytic process can work also with pure water, distilled water and deionized water but these are not good conductors and most of the current would thus be dissipated without obtaining an effective result of the surface modification treatment.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0117">Furthermore, with this technology it is possible to speed up the traditional treatments and make them more effective, even if in any case they need a specific disposal process.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0118">Table 1 specifies acid compounds/ions, or solutions containing such compounds/ions, suited to be used as electrolytes in the treatment according to the invention. These electrolytes can be used when the electrode that is in contact with the surface to be treated is the anode.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0119">Table 2 specifies acid compounds/ions, or solutions containing such compounds/ions, suited to be used as electrolytes in the treatment according to the invention. These electrolytes can be used when the electrode that is in contact with the surface to be treated is the cathode.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0120">Table 3 specifies salts, or solutions containing such salts, suited to be used as electrolytes in the treatment according to the invention. Said electrolytes can be used placing either the cathode or the anode in contact with the surface to be treated.

The formation of acid or base takes place at the level of the anode or cathode, meaning in proximity to the surface to be treated F. The deposition on the anode or cathode thus makes it possible to modify the morphology of the surface F to increase its friction coefficient. The modification treatment continues as long as the current flows between cathode and anode. Once the current flow has been interrupted, the reaction and the formation of acid or base end in a short time, according to the quantity of oxygen available.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0126">The treatment can produce different surface modifications, based on its duration, the nature of the layers, in particular the nature of the intermediate layer <b>16</b>, the intensity of the current and the concentration of the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0127">Thanks to the activation effect through electrolysis, the quantity of surface chemical residue at the end of the treatment is lower if compared to the known techniques and will probably have a concentration below the limit allowed for domestic sewage systems. At the end of the treatment it will be sufficient to rinse the treated surface F to remove any possible trace of residuum from the surface F. The washing water can be directly and advantageously discharged in the sewage system without causing any environmental damage or consequence.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0128">If it were necessary to treat a ceramic surface, enameled or vitrified, it would be advantageous, for example, to use a system with the anode positioned in the lower layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), applying an electrolyte solution containing fluorides (for example, NH4F). The use of said salts makes it possible to avoid the direct application of acids (for example, HF) with high concentrations and in high quantities on the surface to be treated. This technology exploits the electrochemical process to promote the formation of acid on site, starting from low concentrations of electrolyte dispersed in solution. For example, ammonium fluoride is much less aggressive than hydrofluoric acid or other fluorides such as ammonium bifluoride, with a further advantage in terms of residue removal and the consequent environmental impact. Thanks to the electrochemical treatment, furthermore, treatment times are considerably reduced compared to the known technique. This can take place effectively both with other electrolytes that create traces of acid on the anode and with electrolytes that create traces of base on the cathode.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0129">Still to advantage, application precision is considerably increased, and the treatment area is clearly identified by the geometric shape of the device <b>1</b>. The figures show a substantially square device, however it is evident that this shape must not be considered limitative in any way and, on the contrary, in variant embodiments the device can assume any other desired shape such as, for example, rectangular shapes or shapes requiring a specific pattern of the anti slip areas to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0130">Considering again, by way of example, a surface modification treatment carried out with fluorides (for example, NH4F), it is possible to implement an application method different from the one described above. In the case previously considered by way of example, the device <b>1</b> incorporates the electrolyte in the solid phase. Preferably, the electrolyte in the solid phase is incorporated in the first layer <b>12</b> (cathode) or in the intermediate layer <b>16</b> if the anode is positioned against the surface. If, instead, the system has the cathode against the surface, the electrolyte in the solid phase is preferably positioned in the anode <b>14</b> or in the intermediate layer <b>16</b>. The device <b>1</b> is made adhere to the walking surface F with the anode facing the surface F. Successively, a suitable quantity of water is applied to the device <b>1</b> in order to create the electrolyte solution, for example the quantity necessary to preferably obtain, for example, an aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride at 1.6% in weight. The application of water on the device is preferably carried out as homogeneously as possible, for example using a sprayer, a nebulizer or an atomizer.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0131">Once the desired electrolyte solution has been obtained, the cathode and the anode can be powered electrically to start the electrolytic process and carry out the treatment on the surface F, analogously to what has been described above.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0132">According to another treatment method, different from the previously described one, the device <b>1</b> does not incorporate the electrolyte in any layer, neither in the solid nor in the liquid phase.

A preferred embodiment makes use of a DC power supply or an AC power supply with suitable transformer and rectifier. The power supply preferably comprises power supply batteries. In variant embodiments, the power supply can be connected to the electric network through a cable.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0143">In a preferred embodiment, the device that is the subject of the invention comprises means for signalling that the treatment has been completed, for example a LED or an acoustic warning device.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0144">The signalling means are connected to an electronic/computerized system in which the operator can input the process parameters. The treatment depends on the application time of the electrochemical system. More specifically, it is possible to evaluate the time necessary to reach a given friction coefficient based on the current intensity used, the charge density and the concentration of the electrolyte used. Preferably, it is also possible to get an idea of the involved times through the electronic/computerized system. Once the treatment has been started and the established time has elapsed, the LED or acoustic warning device is activated, meaning that the desired surface modification has been obtained. This is advantageously followed by the rinsing operations intended to remove any possible trace of residuum from the treated surface.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0145">In a further preferred embodiment, the device comprises a sensor suited to measure the degree of surface modification.
