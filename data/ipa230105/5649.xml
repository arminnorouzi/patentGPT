Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments described herein are related to generating magnetic fields, and more particularly to the generation of magnetic fields with multiple polarities.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnets of all kinds, e.g., permanent, electromagnetic, and superconducting magnets generate two magnetic poles of opposite polarity at opposite sides. This can be illustrated by reference to the bar magnet <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, bar magnet <b>100</b> has two magnetic poles: south pole <b>102</b> and north pole <b>104</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows magnetic field <b>106</b> generated by bar magnet <b>100</b> which has a direction going from the north pole <b>104</b> to south pole <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These magnetic poles have the ability to repel and attract. For example, if the north pole of a second bar magnet is to be brought near, e.g., the south pole <b>102</b> of magnet <b>100</b>, then magnet <b>100</b> would attract the second magnet. Conversely, if the south pole of the second magnet is to be brought near the south pole <b>102</b> of magnet <b>100</b>, then magnet <b>100</b> would repel the second magnet. The north pole <b>104</b> of magnet <b>100</b> will operate in a converse fashion, i.e., repelling the north pole and attracting the south pole of the second magnet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the above described property of magnets can be used to create devices, it can also limit their uses or at least limit their efficiency. This can be illustrated by a stator/rotator combination of an electric motor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> presents a block diagram illustrating multiple magnets <b>202</b> forming a stator ring, and a rotator magnet <b>204</b> positioned in the middle of the stator ring. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the magnets <b>202</b> (i.e., <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>d</i>) has the south and north magnetic poles arranged as indicated, and the rotator magnet <b>204</b> has its poles arranged as shown. During operation, the south poles of stator magnets <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>d </i>will repel the south pole of rotator magnet <b>204</b>, while the north poles of stator magnets <b>202</b><i>b </i>and <b>202</b><i>c </i>will attract the south pole of rotator magnet <b>204</b>. At the same time, the north poles of stator magnets <b>202</b><i>b </i>and <b>202</b><i>c </i>will repel the north pole of rotator magnet <b>204</b> while the south poles of stator magnets <b>202</b><i>d </i>and <b>202</b><i>a </i>will attract the north pole of rotator magnet <b>204</b>. The cumulative effect causes rotator magnet <b>204</b> to rotate clockwise around a shaft <b>205</b>. Unfortunately, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of stator magnets <b>202</b> generates a second pole on the outside of the stator ring that is not used.

that comprise a plurality of magnets positioned to form a parabolic shape. The magnets can be permanent magnets, electromagnetic magnets, superconducting magnets, or some combination of the above. When the magnets are positioned in the parabolic shape as described herein, they can generate two primary fields of magnetic force of the same polarity extending outward from the apparatus in opposite directions and a third magnetic field substantially in the center of the apparatus of an opposite polarity.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary device <b>300</b> which can be used to form a proposed magnetic device for producing a desired magnetic field pattern in accordance with some embodiments described herein. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, device <b>300</b> comprises a base <b>302</b> that has a ring geometry that includes at least two openings. More specifically, base <b>302</b> has an upper surface <b>307</b>, a lower surface <b>305</b>, and an inner wall <b>311</b> and an outer wall <b>313</b> sandwiched between the surfaces <b>305</b> and <b>307</b>. Upper surface <b>307</b> further includes an opening <b>308</b>, in this case having a circular shape, while lower surface <b>305</b> includes an opening <b>310</b> which also has a circular shape in the illustrated example. Notably, opening <b>308</b> in upper surface <b>307</b> has a larger diameter than opening <b>310</b> in lower surface <b>305</b>. As a result, inner wall <b>311</b> can have a parabolic shape or an angled shape. Although base <b>302</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is shown to have a ring/circular shape, other embodiments of device <b>300</b> can have a base that has other closed shapes with a non-circular opening, for example, including but are not limited square, pentagon, hexagon, or other polygon shaped opening. Hence, embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to using ring-shaped bases shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Base <b>302</b> further includes a plurality of magnet placement locations <b>304</b> that can each accommodate a magnet. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the plurality of magnet placement locations <b>304</b> are located between inner wall <b>311</b> and outer wall <b>313</b>, and spaced substantially evenly around the ring-shaped base <b>302</b>. For example, the distance between a pair of adjacent magnet placement locations can be denoted as &#x201c;d.&#x201d; However, in some other embodiments, the plurality of magnet placement locations <b>304</b> can be positioned around the ring-shaped base <b>302</b> with uneven spacings. Note that each magnet placement location <b>304</b> includes an opening on the inner wall <b>311</b> to receive a magnet. As such, the opening of each magnet placement location <b>304</b> can also have a parabolic shape or an angled shape if the inner wall <b>311</b> has a parabolic shape or an angled shape. In such embodiments, due to the parabolic or angled shape of inner wall <b>311</b>, each of the magnet placement locations <b>304</b> can have an upper portion <b>312</b> that is thinner than a lower portion <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the back wall of each magnet placement location <b>304</b>, which is embedded inside the solid portion of base <b>302</b>, can be set at an angle with respect to the outer wall <b>313</b> of base <b>302</b>. In these embodiments, the surface of the magnets to be installed into the magnet placement locations <b>304</b> can also have a parabolic or angled shape. In some embodiments, instead of using magnet placement locations configured as recesses into the inner wall, a base of the proposed magnetic device uses a set of magnet placement locations around the inner wall. These magnet placement locations can be used to accommodate surface mounting magnets, as is described in more detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, base <b>302</b> also includes a gap <b>306</b> formed into the solid ring structure of base <b>302</b> which connects the center of base <b>302</b> to the space outside base <b>302</b>. The function and use of such a gap <b>306</b> is described in more detail below. Although not explicitly shown, each magnet placement location <b>304</b> can accommodate a magnet. A proposed magnetic device <b>300</b> is formed when magnets are properly installed into the magnet placement location <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a magnetic device <b>400</b> with a set of magnets <b>402</b> (i.e., <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>) installed in the magnet placement locations <b>304</b> of base <b>302</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and field patterns that would be expected to be produced given the field patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Notably, in the exemplary device <b>400</b>, the north pole of each magnet <b>402</b> faces the center of base <b>302</b> and is positioned closer to the upper surface of the base <b>302</b>, while the south pole of each magnet <b>402</b> faces away from the center based <b>302</b> and is positioned closer to the lower surface of base <b>302</b>. As such, each of the magnets <b>402</b> is placed such that an axis of the magnet (shown as the dotted straight lines passing through the magnets <b>402</b>) connecting the north pole and the south pole of the magnet forms an angle with respect to the upper and lower surfaces. In various embodiments, the angle formed between the axis of the magnet connecting the north pole and the south pole and the upper and lower surfaces is between 0 and 90 degrees. In various embodiments, the set of magnets can include two, three, or more individual permanent magnets. In some embodiments, the set of magnets forms a continuous magnetic structure around the inner wall.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the device configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, it would be expected that the magnets would generate magnetic fields <b>404</b> with poles as shown, i.e., a combined north pole formed in the middle of device <b>400</b> and two south poles formed at the opposite ends of device <b>400</b>. However, the field pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is not what is actually produced by device <b>400</b> based on the described configuration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates exemplary field patterns actually generated by the magnet configuration of device <b>400</b>. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> represents a cross-sectional view of device <b>400</b>, such that the right vertical edge of device <b>400</b> corresponds to the upper surface <b>307</b> of base <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, while the left vertical edge of device <b>400</b> corresponds to the lower surface <b>305</b> of base <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, three primary magnetic fields, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, and <b>410</b> are produced. More specifically, the first primary field <b>410</b> having a polarity of magnetic south, instead of magnetic north, is formed substantially in the middle of base <b>302</b>. In the example shown, field <b>410</b> is located substantially within the open space surrounded by the upper opening in the upper surface, the lower opening in the lower surface, and the inner wall of based <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a second primary field <b>408</b> having a polarity of magnetic north is formed outward from the upper, i.e., the larger opening of the base <b>302</b>, and a third primary field <b>406</b> having a polarity also of magnetic north is formed outward from the lower or the smaller opening of the base <b>302</b> and on the opposite side of the primary field <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a boundary between the first primary field <b>410</b> and the second primary field <b>408</b> is in the vicinity of the larger opening of the base <b>302</b> (shown as the dark vertical line on the right), and a boundary between the first primary field <b>410</b> and the third primary field <b>406</b> is in the vicinity of the smaller opening of the ring-shaped base <b>302</b> (shown as the dark vertical line on the left). Also note that, because opening <b>308</b> is greater in size than opening <b>310</b> (also indicated by the two dark lines <b>416</b> and <b>418</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), the region of magnetic influence of the second magnetic field <b>408</b> may be significantly larger than the region of magnetic influence of the third magnetic field <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, the openings <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> of base <b>302</b> can be configured to desired sizes and geometries for controlling the region of magnetic influence of each of the second magnetic field <b>408</b> and the third magnetic field <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the exemplary device <b>400</b> is configured to form one magnetic south pole between two magnetic north poles, alternative designs of device <b>400</b> can install the magnets in reverse of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In such designs, three primary magnetic fields, <b>406</b>&#x2032;, <b>408</b>&#x2032;, and <b>410</b>&#x2032; are produced such that the first primary field <b>410</b>&#x2032; of magnetic north is formed substantially in the middle of the base <b>302</b> while the second primary field <b>408</b>&#x2032; and the third primary field <b>406</b> of magnetic south are formed on either side of the first primary field <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, there can be some additional field effects <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> in additional to the three primary fields <b>406</b>-<b>410</b>. However, for purposes of the discussion herein, the fields generated by device <b>400</b> can be approximated by the three primary fields described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an approximated field pattern <b>500</b> of the magnetic device <b>400</b> comprising the three primary fields <b>406</b>-<b>410</b> in accordance with some embodiments described herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the field pattern <b>500</b> generated by device <b>400</b> includes two north poles located on both sides and one south pole located in between the two north poles. The field characteristics of the disclosed device <b>400</b> can be used in various applications to achieve various benefits, e.g., when used in an electric motor, to improve the efficiency of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, base <b>302</b> of devices <b>300</b> or <b>400</b> can also include a gap <b>306</b> within the base <b>302</b>. Such a gap can be used in exemplary applications to accelerate another magnet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary process of accelerating a device <b>600</b> comprising a magnet <b>602</b> attached to a rod <b>604</b> or other stabilizing apparatus through a magnetic field <b>606</b> formed by multiple field patterns <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in accordance with some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, magnetic field <b>606</b> comprises an array of field patterns <b>500</b><i>a </i>and <b>500</b><i>b</i>, each of which is generated by an instance of the device <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> comprising a based <b>302</b> and a set of magnets <b>402</b>. Note that, the array of devices <b>400</b> that generates magnetic field <b>606</b> can be placed in series, or linked with one another. While only two field patterns <b>500</b><i>a </i>and <b>500</b><i>b </i>are shown, much more than two instances of device <b>400</b> can be put together to form a longer array of device <b>400</b> generating a corresponding longer array of field patterns <b>500</b> to accelerate magnet <b>600</b> over a longer distance. For example, this longer array of device <b>400</b> can be configured in a circular pattern as shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which includes seven instances of field pattern <b>500</b>. In this example, the magnet <b>602</b> can be accelerated/propelled in a circular motion around the circular path <b>608</b>. In another example, multiple field patterns <b>500</b> can be configured in a linear fashion to accelerate/propel the magnet <b>602</b> in a straight line path (not shown). In all these examples, when the magnet <b>602</b> travels through the array of field patterns <b>500</b>, the relatively narrow rod <b>604</b> can pass through each gap <b>306</b> of each base <b>302</b> of each instance of device <b>400</b>, while the wider magnet <b>602</b> passes through the opening of each base <b>302</b> in the middle of base <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">We now look at how the magnet <b>602</b> accelerates through field <b>606</b> in more detail. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the magnet <b>602</b> is initially positioned on the left of field pattern <b>500</b><i>a</i>, the south pole of magnet <b>602</b> will be attracted to the north pole of field <b>506</b><i>a </i>of field pattern <b>500</b><i>a</i>. This interaction can cause device <b>600</b> to accelerate to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As magnet <b>602</b> enters field <b>506</b><i>a</i>, field <b>506</b><i>a </i>begins to repel the north pole of magnet <b>602</b>, causing further acceleration of magnet <b>602</b> to the right. If the magnet <b>602</b> is initially accelerated enough to overcome the repelling effect of the south pole, i.e., field <b>510</b><i>a </i>of field pattern <b>500</b><i>a </i>on the south pole of magnet <b>602</b>, then field <b>510</b><i>a </i>will start to repel the south pole of magnet <b>602</b> while continues to attract the north pole of magnet <b>602</b>. Meanwhile, the second north pole, i.e., field <b>508</b><i>a </i>of field pattern <b>500</b><i>a </i>begins to attract the south pole of magnet <b>602</b>. Once magnet <b>602</b> enters field <b>508</b><i>a</i>, field <b>508</b><i>a </i>will start to repel the north pole of magnet <b>602</b> so that magnet <b>602</b> continues to accelerate to the right to exit field pattern <b>500</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, the interaction between the three primary fields in field pattern <b>500</b><i>a </i>and the poles of magnet <b>602</b> can cause device <b>600</b> to move from left to right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As described above, the gap <b>306</b> in base <b>302</b> can be configured to accommodate rod <b>604</b> allowing device <b>600</b> to move without obstruction through the first instance of device <b>400</b> that generates field pattern <b>500</b><i>a</i>. Next, a second instance of device <b>400</b>, represented by field pattern <b>500</b><i>b </i>that is placed in series with, or linked with the first instant of device <b>400</b>, continues the process. Multiple instances of device <b>400</b> can be linked in various configurations including, but are not limited to, a circle or a linear array as described below.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a magnetic rotor-stator device <b>710</b> that includes a circular array of magnetic field generating devices <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>l </i>configured as stators to drive a rotor wheel <b>704</b> around a shaft <b>702</b> that includes a circular array of magnets <b>700</b><i>a</i>-<b>700</b><i>l </i>attached to the rotor wheel <b>704</b> through a set of rods <b>706</b><i>a</i>-<b>706</b><i>l </i>in accordance with some embodiments described herein.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, instead of switching, the magnetism of electromagnetic device <b>800</b> may be briefly turned off to allow the momentum to carry electromagnetic device <b>800</b> into south pole field <b>510</b><i>a</i>. After the electromagnetic device has completely entered the south pole, the magnetism can then to turned back on to active the attraction force between the south pole of electromagnetic device <b>800</b> and the north pole field <b>508</b><i>a </i>and the repel force between the south pole of electromagnetic device <b>800</b> and the south pole field <b>510</b><i>a </i>so that electromagnetic device <b>800</b> moves into the second north pole field <b>508</b><i>a </i>efficiently. In some other embodiments, switching of polarities and turning on and off the magnetism can be combined into the same operation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should also be noted that in certain embodiments, the magnet-rod devices can actually be in a fixed position and magnetic field generating devices can be configured to allow them to move right to left under the same principles of interaction between the fields.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a device <b>900</b>A which is an exemplary embodiment of device <b>300</b> or device <b>400</b> that includes a base having a parabolic shaped or an angled inner wall and a set of magnets installed inside a corresponding set of magnet placement locations within the inner wall.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates an alternative magnetic field generating device <b>900</b>B which uses surface mounting magnets in accordance with some embodiments described herein. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, device <b>900</b>B includes a base substantially identical to the base of device <b>900</b>B. However, instead of using magnets which are installed into the recesses as in device <b>900</b>A, device <b>900</b>B uses a set of surface mount magnets <b>902</b> attached directly to the surface of the inner wall of device <b>900</b>B. Notably, each of these magnets takes on the parabolic shape of the inner wall. In some embodiments, each of the magnets <b>902</b> has a trapezoid geometry to facilitate achieving a maximum coverage of the inner wall. This increased coverage of the inner wall enables generating a desired three-field magnetic field pattern having a stronger intensity.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, another important aspect or property of device <b>400</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is related to the interface of the north poles <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> with south pole <b>410</b>. Note that these two interfaces, located approximately at the two openings indicated by the two dark lines <b>416</b> and <b>418</b>, are the locations where the magnetic field changes polarities. As a result of the device <b>400</b> having these openings, these interfaces or transition boundaries between north poles and south pole become accessible to objects. In contrast, these locations are not accessible in permanent magnets such as bar magnet <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> because they are located inside the magnet itself.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The configuration of device <b>400</b> is such that, if another magnet is inserted between north pole <b>406</b> and south pole <b>410</b>, or between north pole <b>408</b> and south pole <b>410</b> that is smaller than openings <b>416</b> and <b>418</b> respectively, then the magnet will &#x201c;register&#x201d; right at the interface of the poles and hover over or &#x201c;be suspended at&#x201d; the opening <b>416</b> or <b>418</b>. Notably, this property is not affected by the orientation of device <b>400</b>, whether device <b>400</b> is placed vertically or horizontally. If a pressure is applied to the hovering magnet and then released, the magnet will incline to return to substantially the same location. Thus, the combination of such a magnet and the device <b>400</b> can be used to create a force measuring transducer. Moreover, this combination device can also be used to create other types of transducers, valves, speakers, microphones, pumps, among others. Also note that, when the polarities of this combination device are suddenly reserved, the registered magnet will flip inside the space where it suspends at. This additional property can be utilized to make motors, fans, flow devices, and other devices which can take advantage of this property.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of another example of the proposed magnetic device <b>1000</b> which includes two openings and the associated field pattern with three poles in accordance with some embodiments described herein. In this figure, the two transition boundaries are indicated as &#x201c;position <b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;position <b>2</b>,&#x201d; respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1013</b></figref> shows a perspective view of magnetic device <b>1000</b> having the two transition boundaries at the two openings in accordance with some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> shows magnetic suspension using the magnetic device <b>1000</b> where two permanent magnets <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are suspended at the two transition boundaries&#x2014;position <b>1</b> and position <b>2</b> with perfect fidelity in accordance with some embodiments described herein. Notably, while magnetic device <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1013</b></figref> shows a gap, other embodiments of magnetic device <b>1000</b> do not need to have a gap when the device is used to suspend a permanent magnet as described above.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to the exemplary devices and systems described above, numerous other devices and machines can be designed that take advantage of the field properties of the proposed magnetic device such as device <b>400</b>. For example, an efficient fly wheel can be designed for storing kinetic energy or device <b>400</b> can also be used as a fan blade to cool electromagnetic components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, certain embodiments described herein provide propulsion to, e.g., aircraft, drones and other flying devices that use electrical current as the source of power. Conventionally, electric motors that drive propellers or fan blades sit either behind or in front of the propeller or fan blades. As such, the electric motor itself actually blocks air flow into the propeller or fan blades. In addition, the thrust to weight ratio and lack of redundancy are issues with conventional designs.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">But by integrating the electric motor with the fan blades, as described below, there is no blockage of air flow, the electric motors can be designed to be redundant, and there is no central shaft, gears or belts driving the fan blades further reducing weight and improving thrust to weight ratios. Further, such configurations allows for multiple motors to be connected in serial and run at different revolutions per minute to achieve the desired efficiency and thrust.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As stated above, the embodiments described herein can provide propulsion to aircraft, drones, or other flying devices that use electrical current as the source of power. As a result, these embodiments can address several problems associated with electric powered aircraft, drones, or other flying devices including among others, redundancy, weight, efficiency, thrust, manufacturing cost, maintenance and size. By integrating the electrical motor and the fan blades into a single component, efficiencies are gained over conventional electrical aircraft motor designs including weight to thrust ratios, ease of maintenance, redundancy, and cost of manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Using electrical current produced by a generator, battery, solar panel, fuel cell or any combination of the previous mentioned sources of electrical current, the electric aircraft motor described herein converts this energy into mechanical thrust that is used by the aircraft, drone, or other flying device to achieve flight. Similar embodiments can provide propulsion for water craft, either submersible or non-submersible.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">By integrating the electric motor with the fan blades, there is no blockage of air flow, the electric motors can be designed to be redundant, and there is no shaft, gears, or belts driving the fan blades thereby reducing weight.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Certain Embodiments Discussed Here Include the following components: 1.

The Fan Blade Housing <b>1101</b> is inserted into the Fan Blade Housing Bearings <b>1103</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>C</figref> and D, which allows the Fan Blades <b>1102</b> to spin freely inside the bearings.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Permanent Magnet Mounts <b>1105</b> are then attached to the Fan Blade Housing <b>1101</b>, Permanent Magnets <b>1108</b> are attached to the Permanent Magnet Mounts <b>1105</b>, and the magnetic devices <b>1106</b> are attached to the Fan Blade Housing Bearings <b>1103</b>.

As housing <b>1101</b> spins the Fan Blades <b>1102</b> located inside the Fan Blade Housing <b>1101</b> cause air to be drawn in and pushed out the back generating thrust for the craft. To alter thrust or efficiency, multiple Fan Blade Housings <b>1101</b> can be connected together to create serially connected Fan Blade Housings as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>.
