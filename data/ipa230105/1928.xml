There is a connection between the steering wheel and the steered wheels via electrical signals. The driver's steering demand is picked up by a steering angle sensor, and the position of the steered wheels is controlled by means of a steering actuator in a manner dependent on the driver's steering demand. No mechanical connection to the wheels is provided.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the normal mode, the controller operates the steer-by-wire steering system and constantly checks that the system components of the steering system are functioning properly. If a fault occurs, the function of the steer-by-wire steering system is deactivated. A mechanical fallback level may be provided, which allows an emergency steering mode. However, such mechanical fallback levels are expensive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to specify a method for controlling a steer-by-wire steering system for a motor vehicle that allows an emergency steering mode without a mechanical fallback level.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object is achieved by a method for controlling a steer-by-wire steering system having the features of claim <b>1</b>, and by a steer-by-wire steering system that is configured to carry out such a method. Further advantageous embodiments of the invention can be found in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a method for controlling a steer-by-wire steering system for a motor vehicle in an emergency steering mode is provided, wherein the motor vehicle comprises two axles each with two wheels, which are connected to one another via a steering tie rod of a steering system, wherein the front two wheels are steerable by means of a front-wheel steering system, and the motor vehicle comprises a single wheel drive which is assigned to one of the two axles and which drives the two wheels of the corresponding axle via a differential, wherein the wheel drive comprises a single actuator, and wherein the motor vehicle comprises a brake system, and the method comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">checking the steering system for the presence of a fault state,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">implementing the emergency steering mode in the event that a fault state has been detected,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">wherein the following steps are carried out in the emergency steering mode:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">determining a setpoint position of the steering tie rod using a setpoint wheel steering angle,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">determining a front wheel to be braked and a brake pressure to attain the setpoint position by means of a control unit,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0012">transmitting the front wheel to be braked, and the brake pressure, to the brake system, and braking the front wheel to be braked,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0013">increasing a torque provided by the wheel drive in order to compensate for a loss of speed of the motor vehicle caused by the braking of the front wheel to be braked.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0014">The brake-based torque vectoring allows the motor vehicle to be steered even in a fault state, in particular in the event of failure of the steering system, without the need for a mechanical fallback level.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0015">The differential is a controllable differential. It is in particular an open or partially open differential.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0016">A setpoint wheel steering angle is preferably determined for each of the vehicle wheels; the setpoint wheel steering angle of the left-hand and right-hand vehicle wheels may be identical or may form different angles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">The control unit for determining the front wheel to be braked and the brake pressure preferably comprises software for arbitration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0018">It is preferable if the chassis geometry, the properties of the brake system and the sign of the setpoint toothed rack position are input into the software in order to determine the front wheel to be braked and the brake pressure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">In one embodiment, the wheel drive is a rear-wheel drive which, in the emergency steering mode, provides the same additional torque for both rear wheels, such that the sum of the two additional torques compensates for the loss of speed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">Provision may also be made for the wheel drive to be a front-wheel drive with an open differential which, in the emergency steering mode, drives the unbraked front wheel, specifically with the sum of the torques of the two front wheels and with the additional torque for compensating for the loss of speed. The following relationship preferably applies for a right-hand bend: T<sub>FL</sub>+T<sub>FR</sub>=2*T<sub>FL</sub>+T<sub>ped,br</sub>, where T<sub>FL </sub>and T<sub>FR </sub>are the torque of the left-hand and right-hand front wheels and T<sub>ped,br </sub>is the braking torque introduced into the right-hand front wheel that is to be braked.

The wheel drive motors <b>220</b>,<b>221</b> are each connected via drive shafts <b>5</b> to the steerable front wheels FL,FR. The wheel drive motors <b>220</b>,<b>221</b> are electric motors. The front wheels FL,FR of the front-wheel steering system are connected to one another via a toothed rack <b>3</b> of a rack-and-pinion steering gear <b>4</b>. The rack-and-pinion steering gear <b>4</b> is controlled as in the case of the steer-by-wire steering system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, but the drive control is implemented such that a differential torque &#x394;T between the front wheels FL,FR is generated which is proportional to the setpoint wheel steering angle &#x3b1;<sub>RW,ref </sub>of the steerable front wheels FL,FR or to the driver's steering demand. In other words, the setpoint wheel steering angle &#x3b1;<sub>RW,ref </sub>of the steerable front wheels FL,FR is incorporated into the control of the front-wheel drive. When driving through a right-hand bend as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the traction force for the left-hand front wheel is xN (for example 100N)+&#x25a1;&#x394;T/2 and the traction force for the right-hand front wheel is xN-&#x394;T/2. The differential torque leads to a displacement of the toothed rack and thus to a steering operation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The motor vehicle <b>1</b> has a front-wheel steering system and a rear-wheel drive.

The rear-wheel drive has a single actuator <b>2</b>, in particular an electric motor, which drives the rear wheels via a differential. In the event that the steer-by-wire steering system fails, that is to say the front-wheel steering system is no longer available, the motor vehicle switches to an emergency steering mode. In this emergency steering mode, the steering torque is provided by braking one of the front wheels FL,FR. A setpoint toothed rack position S<sub>R,ref </sub>is calculated in a manner dependent on the setpoint wheel steering angle &#x3b1;<sub>RW,ref</sub>. The toothed rack position is controlled by means of a controller that comprises software for arbitration. The chassis geometry, the properties of the brake system and the sign of the setpoint toothed rack position S<sub>R,ref </sub>are input into this software in order to determine a front wheel FR,FL to be braked and the brake pressure required for the braking operation. In order that the motor vehicle <b>1</b> does not lose speed as a result of the braking operation, the rear-wheel drive provides an additional torque at the rear wheels RR,RL, which additional torque corresponds to the traction force F<sub>ped,br </sub>and compensates for the loss of speed.
