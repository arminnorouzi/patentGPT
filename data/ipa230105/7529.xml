These wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources with those users (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or other resources). Multiple-access technologies can rely on any of code division, time division, frequency division orthogonal frequency division, single-carrier frequency division, or time division synchronous code division, to name a few. These and other multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although wireless communication systems have made great technological advancements over many years, challenges still exist. For example, complex and dynamic environments can still attenuate or block signals between wireless transmitters and wireless receivers, undermining various established wireless channel measuring and reporting mechanisms, which are used to manage and optimize the use of finite wireless channel resources.

In next-generation wireless technologies, wireless nodes perform various measurements and report these measurements (e.g., provide measurement feedback) to facilitate efficient configuration of wireless communications. These feedback signals may consume a large amount of overhead, resulting in communication inefficiencies. Neural networks may be used to compress feedback signaling, reducing the overhead. The feedback signaling that is compressed may be based on measurements made over various bands. Having different neural networks for different bands may be inefficient.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to techniques for implementing the same neural network model that can be implemented for compression of measurements performed on different bands. In some aspects, overhead may be further reduced by implementing differential encoding of compressed measurement data. For example, measurements performed across different frequencies, time intervals, or both, may be encoded using a differential encoding technique. The technique to be used for the encoding may be configured by a base station, in some aspects. The aspects described herein allow for reducing signaling overhead for reporting measurements across different bands using a common neural network model (also referred to as a &#x201c;basic neural network block&#x201d;).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Introduction to Wireless Communication Networks</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of a wireless communications network <b>100</b>, in which aspects described herein may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, wireless communications network <b>100</b> includes base stations (BSs) <b>102</b>, user equipments (UEs) <b>104</b>, one or more core networks, such as an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>160</b> and fifth generation core (5GC) network <b>190</b>, which interoperate to provide wireless communications services.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Base stations <b>102</b> may provide an access point to the EPC <b>160</b> and/or 5GC <b>190</b> for a user equipment <b>104</b>, and may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, delivery of warning messages, among other functions. Base stations may include and/or be referred to as a NodeB, next generation NodeB (gNodeB or gNB), evolved Node B (eNB), next generation eNB (ng-eNB) (e.g., an eNB that has been enhanced to provide connection to both EPC <b>160</b> and 5GC <b>190</b>), an access point, a base transceiver station, a radio base station, a radio transceiver, a transceiver function, or a transmission reception point in various contexts.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Base stations <b>102</b> wirelessly communicate with UEs <b>104</b> via communications links <b>120</b>.

Generally, a node (or neuron) is where computation happens. For example, a node may combine input data with a set of weights (or coefficients) that either amplifies or dampens the input data. The amplification or dampening of the input signals may thus be considered an assignment of relative significances to various inputs with regard to a task the network is trying to learn. Generally, input-weight products are summed (or accumulated), and then the sum is passed through a node's activation function to determine whether and to what extent that signal should progress further through the network.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a most basic implementation, a neural network may have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. &#x201c;Deep&#x201d; neural networks generally have more than one hidden layer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Deep learning is a method of training deep neural networks. Generally, deep learning maps inputs to the network to outputs from the network and is thus sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;universal approximator&#x201d; because the network can learn to approximate an unknown function &#x192; (x)=y between any input x and any output y. In other words, deep learning finds the right &#x192; to transform x into y.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">More particularly, deep learning trains each layer of nodes based on a distinct set of features, which is the output from the previous layer. Thus, with each successive layer of a deep neural network, features become more complex. Deep learning is thus powerful because the network can progressively extract higher-level features from input data and perform complex tasks, such as object recognition, by learning to represent inputs at successively higher levels of abstraction in each layer, thereby building up a useful feature representation of the input data.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Aspects Related to Encoding and Decoding</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next-generation user equipments (UEs) (e.g., 5G UEs) perform various signal measurements and provide measurement reporting (e.g., feedback), allowing a base station (BS) to configure wireless communications. These measurements generate significant amounts of data to be transmitted to the BS. Some examples of the types of measurements that may be performed include per-antenna port measurements of channel and interference (e.g., for channel state feedback (CSF)), power measurements from serving and neighboring cells, inter-radio access technology (RAT) measurements such as measurements of signals from WiFi networks, and sensor measurements. Neural network models may be used to compress such measurements to reduce the overhead associated with feedback of measurements. For example, an autoencoder may be trained to allow for compression of measurements. The autoencoder may include an encoder for measurement compression, and a decoder for measurement decompression.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some measurements may be performed over varying bandwidths. For example, a channel state information (CSI) report may be generated for a 20 MHz band in some cases, and for a 100 MHz band in some other cases. Having different neural networks for measurement compression for the 20 MHz band and the 100 MHz band may be inefficient. Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to an implementation for measurement compression using small bandwidth neural networks (also referred to as &#x201c;basic neural network blocks&#x201d;) to compress measurements for a larger bandwidth. Wireless channels have a certain coherence bandwidth, due to which adjacent band channels may be correlated. Some aspects take advantage of this correlation between adjacent bands to create an architecture for measurement compression that can be applied for different bandwidths.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Certain aspects are directed to a generalization of measurement compression design. For instance, CSF compression may be implemented with a neural network for a small (e.g., or most common) bandwidth. The neural network may be reused for larger bandwidths that share the same numerology, such as the same carrier spacing. After performing iterative calls to the neural network to compress measurements over multiple bandwidths, the neural network outputs may be post-processed through an additional set of layers (e.g., a post-processing neural network) to harvest any correlation between the outputs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates an example autoencoder design, in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure.

Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. Modulation symbols may be sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers may be dependent on the system bandwidth. The minimum resource allocation, called a resource block (RB), may be 12 consecutive subcarriers in some examples. The system bandwidth may also be partitioned into subbands. For example, a subband may cover multiple RBs. NR may support a base subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15 kHz, and other SCS may be defined with respect to the base SCS (e.g., 30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHz, 240 kHz, and others).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">As above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> depict various example aspects of data structures for a wireless communication network, such as wireless communication network <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">In various aspects, the 5G frame structure may be frequency division duplex (FDD), in which for a particular set of subcarriers (carrier system bandwidth), subframes within the set of subcarriers are dedicated for either DL or UL. 5G frame structures may also be time division duplex (TDD), in which for a particular set of subcarriers (carrier system bandwidth), subframes within the set of subcarriers are dedicated for both DL and UL. In the examples provided by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>C</figref>, the 5G frame structure is assumed to be TDD, with subframe 4 being configured with slot format 28 (with mostly DL), where D is DL, U is UL, and X is flexible for use between DL/UL, and with subframe 3 being configured with slot format 34 (with mostly UL). While subframes 3, 4 are shown with slot formats 34, 28, respectively, any particular subframe may be configured with any of the various available slot formats 0-61. Slot formats 0, 1 are all DL, UL, respectively. Other slot formats 2-61 include a mix of DL, UL, and flexible symbols. UEs are configured with the slot format (dynamically through DL control information (DCI), or semi-statically/statically through radio resource control (RRC) signaling) through a received slot format indicator (SFI). Note that the description below applies also to a 5G frame structure that is TDD.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">Other wireless communication technologies may have a different frame structure and/or different channels. A frame (10 ms) may be divided into 10 equally sized subframes (1 ms). Each subframe may include one or more time slots. Subframes may also include mini-slots, which may include 7, 4, or 2 symbols. In some examples, each slot may include 7 or 14 symbols, depending on the slot configuration.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">For example, for slot configuration 0, each slot may include 14 symbols, and for slot configuration 1, each slot may include 7 symbols. The symbols on DL may be cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM (CP-OFDM) symbols. The symbols on UL may be CP-OFDM symbols (for high throughput scenarios) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) symbols (also referred to as single carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) symbols) (for power limited scenarios; limited to a single stream transmission).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">The number of slots within a subframe is based on the slot configuration and the numerology. For slot configuration 0, different numerologies 0 to 5 allow for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 slots, respectively, per subframe. For slot configuration 1, different numerologies 0 to 2 allow for 2, 4, and 8 slots, respectively, per subframe. Accordingly, for slot configuration 0 and numerology &#x3bc;, there are 14 symbols/slot and 2&#x3bc; slots/subframe. The subcarrier spacing and symbol length/duration are a function of the numerology. The subcarrier spacing may be equal to 2<sup>&#x3bc;</sup>&#xd7;15 kHz, where &#x3bc; is the numerology 0 to 5. As such, the numerology &#x3bc;=0 has a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, and the numerology &#x3bc;=5 has a subcarrier spacing of 480 kHz. The symbol length/duration is inversely related to the subcarrier spacing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> provide an example of slot configuration 0 with 14 symbols per slot and numerology &#x3bc;=2 with 4 slots per subframe.

Each time slot includes a resource block (RB) (also referred to as physical RBs (PRBs)) that extends 12 consecutive subcarriers. The resource grid is divided into multiple resource elements (REs). The number of bits carried by each RE depends on the modulation scheme.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, some of the REs carry reference (pilot) signals (RS) for a UE (e.g., UE <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>).
