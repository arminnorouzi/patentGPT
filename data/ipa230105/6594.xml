Such induction motors exhibit uncontrolled acceleration during startup. Further, at low load conditions, such induction motors operate less efficiently. Alternatively, an induction motor may be driven with a variable speed motor controller to adapt motor speed to a load level. Such configurations are generally limited by power factor, electromagnetic interference, and electrical losses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Providing a drive circuit for induction motors enables efficient operation at both high and low load conditions. For example, an induction motor operating a compressor in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system may experience high load conditions during peak temperatures and low load conditions during milder temperatures. The drive circuit operates the induction motor using an inverter in a low-speed mode under low load conditions and operates the induction motor using line frequency power in a high-speed mode under high load conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Drive circuits generally include a number of electrical components, some of which may be arranged in a board configuration, for example, disposed a printed circuit board (PCB).

In some cases, certain components of the drive circuit, such as those used only during energization of the motor via the inverter, may require a lower power or current rating than other components of the drive circuit, such as those used during energization of the motor using direct line frequency power.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a motor controller for an electric motor is provided.

In such embodiments, the components having lower power requirements, for example, those of the filter, the rectifier, and the inverter, may be disposed on a board separately from components requiring a higher power rating. The lower power components are protected by the voltage limiting circuit or by decoupling the inverter from the electric motor when the electric motor is energized directly from the line.

Drive circuit <b>100</b> includes an inverter <b>104</b>, an AC source <b>106</b>, an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter <b>108</b>, a rectifier <b>110</b>, a DC link capacitor <b>112</b>, a line contactor <b>114</b>, and a run capacitor <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Drive circuit <b>100</b> energizes a main winding <b>118</b> and a start winding <b>120</b> of electric motor <b>102</b> through inverter <b>104</b>, enabling variable speed operation, or directly with line frequency power from AC source <b>106</b>. The main path through inverter <b>104</b> includes EMI filter <b>108</b>, rectifier <b>110</b>, DC link capacitor <b>112</b>, and inverter <b>104</b>. A bypass path includes line contactor <b>114</b> that couples line frequency power directly from AC source <b>106</b> to main winding <b>118</b> and to start winding <b>120</b> via run capacitor <b>116</b> and a start winding switch <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the bypass path may include one or more switches, such as a solid state switch, in parallel with line contactor <b>114</b> that are capable of closing prior to line contactor <b>114</b> when transitioning from energizing electric motor <b>102</b> through inverter <b>104</b> to directly from AC source <b>106</b> through line contactor <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Line frequency power provided by AC source <b>106</b> is supplied from a first line conductor <b>124</b> and a second line conductor <b>126</b> to the main path of drive circuit <b>100</b> first through EMI filter <b>108</b>, which may include one or more stages of inductive and capacitive filtering. Filtered line frequency power is then supplied to rectifier <b>110</b> that rectifies the filtered line frequency power to a direct current (DC) signal that is passed through DC link capacitor <b>112</b>. The DC signal is then supplied to inverter <b>104</b>. Inverter <b>104</b> generates an AC signal for energizing main winding <b>118</b> and start winding <b>120</b> of electric motor <b>102</b>, where the AC signal is of a desired amplitude, frequency, and phase, for example, based on control signals received at inverter <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, active components of drive circuit <b>100</b>, such as, for example, inverter <b>104</b>, line contactor <b>114</b>, and start winding switch <b>122</b> are controlled by a microcontroller (not shown) or other suitable programmable processing device. For example, the microcontroller controls inverter <b>104</b> to produce the AC signal having the desired amplitude, frequency, and phase based on a target speed, torque, frequency, or power output for electric motor <b>102</b>. Further, the microcontroller operates line contactor <b>114</b> to transition between energizing electric motor <b>102</b> using inverter <b>104</b> and energizing electric motor <b>102</b> by coupling line frequency power from AC source <b>106</b> directly to the stator windings of electric motor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, drive circuit <b>100</b> further includes a voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> coupled at the input node of EMI filter <b>108</b> between first line conductor <b>124</b> and second line conductor <b>126</b>. Voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> is configured to protect drive circuit <b>100</b> from over-voltage conditions, for example, by providing a conductive path between first line conductor <b>124</b> and second line conductor <b>126</b> when a voltage at the input node of EMI filter <b>108</b> exceeds a breakdown voltage. In some embodiments, voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> includes a metal oxide varistor (MOV). Additionally or alternatively, voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> may include a spark gap or another device capable of providing over-voltage protection. Voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> may further include capacitors to store the excess energy during transients.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, drive circuit <b>100</b> further includes a current sensor <b>130</b>. Current sensor <b>130</b> is electrically coupled between one of first line conductor <b>124</b> or second line conductor <b>126</b> of AC source <b>106</b> and line contactor <b>114</b> and is configured to detect and measure a current at line contactor <b>114</b>. Current sensor <b>130</b> is further coupled in communication with the microcontroller controlling inverter <b>104</b> and line contactor <b>114</b>, so that the microcontroller may control inverter <b>104</b> and line contactor <b>114</b> based on current measurement data received from current sensor <b>130</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the microcontroller may deactivate drive circuit <b>100</b>, or at least some components thereof, if a current measured by current sensor <b>130</b> exceeds a safe threshold.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, drive circuit <b>100</b> further includes an inrush limiter <b>132</b>. Inrush limiter <b>132</b> is configured to limit a current at the output node of AC source <b>106</b>, for example, at first line conductor <b>124</b>, to protect drive circuit <b>100</b> from potentially damaging inrush currents. Inrush limiter <b>132</b> may include, for example, a switch element coupled in parallel with one or more resistors, wherein the switch element is configured to close when the inrush current falls below a threshold.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, components of drive circuit <b>100</b> have a current or power rating under which the components may be safely operated. Because components having a higher current or power rating are generally physically larger and more expensive, in such embodiments, components may be selected to have a current or power rating that reduces size and cost while still meeting the current or power demands for operation of drive circuit <b>100</b>. For example, components used specifically for energizing the stator windings of electric motor <b>102</b> via inverter <b>104</b>, such as inverter <b>104</b>, EMI filter <b>108</b>, rectifier <b>110</b>, and DC link capacitor <b>112</b>, may have a relatively low power rating, such as 2.5 kilowatts. In contrast, components exposed to higher power levels, as line contactor <b>114</b> or voltage limiting circuit <b>128</b> when the stator windings of electric motor <b>102</b> are energized directly by AC source <b>106</b>, may have a relatively high power rating, such as 6 kilowatts. Because components of EMI filter <b>108</b> may vary greatly with respect to physical size and cost when selected for a specific current or power rating, by coupling line contactor <b>114</b> upstream of EMI filter <b>108</b> rather than, for example, at the output node of EMI filter <b>108</b>, the components of EMI filter <b>108</b> may not be exposed to the relatively high power levels of operating electric motor <b>102</b> directly from AC source <b>106</b>. Accordingly, this configuration allows for selecting components for EMI filter having a reduced power rating, such as 2.5 kilowatts, which may decrease the physical size and cost of EMI filter <b>108</b> and drive circuit <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, one or more components of drive circuit <b>100</b> are disposed on a board such as a printed circuit board (PCB). In such configurations, lower power components, which may be relatively small and operate at lesser temperatures, may be disposed on the board, while higher power components may be disposed external to the board. In such embodiments, one or more connectors may facilitate a coupling of components disposed on the board and components disposed external to the board. For example, in some such embodiments, the board may include a three pin connector. A first pin <b>134</b> of the three pins may be connected between first line conductor <b>124</b> of AC source <b>106</b> and inrush limiter <b>132</b>, a second pin <b>136</b> of the three pin may be connected between second line conductor <b>126</b> of AC source <b>106</b> and a node between EMI filter <b>108</b> and current sensor <b>130</b>, and a third pin <b>138</b> of the three pins may be connected between current sensor <b>130</b> and line contactor <b>114</b>. Alternatively, a connector having another number of pins or a combination of multiple connectors may be used. In general, configurations including fewer pins, such as the three pin connector, may require less physical space and be less costly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> depict a schematic diagram of drive circuit <b>100</b>. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, EMI filter <b>108</b> includes various capacitive and inductive filter stages for suppressing transient electrical events that occur on the AC line.

EMI filter <b>108</b> further includes capacitive filter stages <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b>, each including line-to-line capacitors, or X capacitors, <b>212</b> and line-to-ground capacitors, or Y capacitors, <b>214</b>. In addition to EMI filter <b>108</b>, drive circuit <b>100</b> includes a spark gap <b>216</b> coupled to each AC line through metal oxide varistors (MOVs) <b>218</b> to provide further protection against transient electrical events.
