The methods, computer programs and systems according to the present invention specifically may be used for designing a shaped body, such as for example catalyst geometries or geometries of catalyst shaping tools. However, further and/or other applications are feasible.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The designing of components and parts is a central aspect of development processes performed in small and large scale manufacturing and/or producing industry. Specifically, in chemical industry, the designing of a shape of steam reforming catalysts is a conventionally performed procedure, typically aiming at improving catalyst performance. Thus, in general, a complex and elaborate designing of the shape of steam reforming catalysts is performed. Thus, in &#x201c;Optimum dimensions of shaped steam reforming catalysts&#x201d; by Kagyrmanova et al. published in the chemical Engineering Journal 134 (2007) 228-234 a theoretical optimization of shaped catalyst dimensions with technologically imposed constraints for operating conditions of a typical methanol reformer is described. Further, in &#x201c;Catalyst shape as a design parameter&#x2014;optimum shape for methane-steam reforming catalyst&#x201d; by Soltan Mohammadzadeh and Zamaniyan published by the Institution of Chemical Engineers Trans IChemE, Vol 80, Part A in May 2002, a mathematical model for simulation of a catalytic terrace wall methane-steam reformer has been developed. Further, in &#x201c;Multi-objective shape optimization of a heat exchanger using parallel genetic algorithms&#x201d; by Hilbert R et al. published in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 49 (2006) 2567-1577 a design optimization concerning the blade shape of a heat exchanger using a genetic algorithm is disclosed. Therein, a procedure to find the geometry most favorable to simultaneously maximize heat exchange while obtaining a minimum pressure loss is described. Further, in &#x201c;Multi-objective optimization of microchannel reactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using computational fluid dynamics and genetic algorithm&#x201d; by Na Jonggeol et al. published in the Chemical Engineering Journal 313 (2017) 1521-1534 a multi-objective optimization methodology for simultaneously maximizing C<sub>5+</sub> productivity and minimizing the temperature rise of a Fischer-Tropsch microchannel reactor. The methodology is applied to the catalyst packing zone division, which is divided and packed with a different dilution ratio to distribute the heat of reaction evenly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, in general, shape optimization is performed in multiple development processes. As an example, US 2016/0004793 A1 describes a method for analysis of shape optimization including: setting, as a design space, a portion to be optimized in a movable portion; generating, in the set design space, an optimization block model formed of three-dimensional elements and is to be subjected to analysis processing of optimization; connecting the generated optimization block model with a structural body model; setting a material property for the optimization block model; setting an optimization analysis condition for finding an optimum shape of the optimization block model; setting a multi-body dynamics analysis condition for performing multi-body dynamics analysis on the structural body model with which the optimization block model has been connected; and executing, based on the set optimization analysis condition, the multi-body dynamics analysis on the optimization block model and finding the optimum shape of the optimization block model.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">US 2007/0050068 A1 describes an optimization method for optimizing a shape of a component including the steps of setting information including a shape of each part in the component to plural parameters, extracting a relationship between the plural parameters and a deformation of the component, changing a value of at least one of the plural parameters so as to reduce a deformation of the component, and adjusting a volume of the component.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In US 2003/0083763 A1 a method and a device enabling any operator even without skill to efficiently, constantly determine an optimum packaging specification of vehicle parts, or the like, is described. Therein, various factors possibly damaging articles are presets as protective properties, and at least one of the protective properties is determined for a particular article based on its surface materials, longest size of its dimensions and its weight. Based on the protective property determined, at least one of packaging materials classified in property is determined for packaging the article, then a packaging form is determined from the determined packaging material and the article property, and a packaging order of the determined packaging form is determined according to packaging priorities preset for such packaging forms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, U.S. Pat. No. 7,477,955 B2 describes an object, enabling provision of an optimum shape design method in which an optimum shape of a cushioning material used in cushioning packaging can easily and adequately be designed, and an optimum shape design system in which the optimum shape design method is used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 8,938,974 B1 describes a method for determining the optimum inlet geometry of a liquid rocket engine swirl injector including obtaining a throttleable level phase value, volume flow rate, chamber pressure, liquid propellant density, inlet injector pressure, desired target spray angle and desired target optimum delta pressure value between an inlet and a chamber for a plurality of engine stages. The method calculates the tangential inlet area for each throttleable stage. The method also uses correlation between the tangential inlet areas and delta pressure values to calculate the spring displacement and variable inlet geometry of a liquid rocket engine swirl injector.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, in DE 103 42 147 B4 a process for automatically calculating a deformation compensating geometry for a forming tool is described. The process comprises determining the starting geometry and altering it according to the deviation from a threshold value. The starting geometry is approximated by surface elements, and junction points are determined for each element. The difference vector for each starting point is calculated, along with an average vector, and the junction point is moved about the average vector. The surface elements are triangles.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, constantly evolving manufacturing possibilities require alterations in the developing process of manufacturing processes. Thus, in designing components and manufacturing processes several technical challenges exist. Typically, in every phase of the developing process, specifically when designing and creating geometries of components and parts, input from technical experts is required, such as in the field of mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, material sciences or physics, e.g. for constructing and interpreting models, simulations and calculations. In particular, designing methods and systems require the performance of complex calculations and intensive computing. Generally, designing methods and systems comprise iterative processes, wherein it is required to iteratively adapt calculations, models and simulations. Thus, generally, the performing of such methods is very time-consuming, costly and complex.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problem to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore desirable to provide means and methods which address the above mentioned technical challenges of designing components and parts, such as shaped bodies and dies, or manufacturing processes for manufacturing such components. Specifically, methods computer programs and systems shall be proposed for improving the process of designing at least one shaped body or shaping tool, e.g. a die, and their respective manufacturing processes, compared to methods, computer programs and systems known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This problem is addressed by the methods, computer programs and systems of the independent claims.
