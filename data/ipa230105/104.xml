Human milk provides several bioactive factors that benefit the relatively immature immune system and the intestinal health of neonates early in life. However, it is not always possible or desirable to breastfeed an infant. In such cases infant formulae are a good alternative. These formulae should have an optimal composition in order to mimic the beneficial effects of human milk as close as possible.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, parents wish to have options for sustainable products without negative impact on animal welfare and related issues. In particular sustainable protein sources are needed in infant formula. As alternative for dairy proteins, vegetable protein sources can be used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dairy animals filter a lot of contaminants out of their diets and thus prevent these contaminants to be present in the milk. This is important for the new-born since many of the natural defenses against such contaminants (e.g. liver function and other enzyme systems) are not fully operational yet as is the case in adults.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2018/178271 relates to a method for the preparation of a vegetable protein hydrolysate having characteristics suitable for use in human food and more particularly in children's food, the hydrolysate as such and use thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US 2017/208853 relates to a nutrient delivery system comprising a pod and a nutritional powder. The nutritional powder includes at least one hydrolyzed protein and at least one masking agent to reduce any bitterness associated with the resulting nutritional formula.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">US 2005/079259 relates generally to the processing of soy-derived materials for use in various products. More particularly, it relates to a process producing highly functional soy protein using ultrafiltration followed by an enzymatic treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US 2004/161512 is about soy-containing dough-based and baked product containing deflavored soy protein material are provided. Soy-containing baked products such as pizza crusts, cookies, crackers, and cereals are especially preferred.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Infant formulas are comprising soy protein as sole protein source have been on the market for many years. Most of these formulas are designed for babies suffering from cows milk allergy. These formulations, however, contain significant levels of chlorate. Since most infant formulas are powders to be reconstituted with drinking water that in most countries also contains relevant amounts of chlorate, it is highly desirable to provide infant formula powders with as low a chlorate level as possible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore very important to ensure that incorporation of non-dairy proteins in e.g. infant formula does not increase chlorate content. Chlorate (ClO<sub>3</sub>) originates from chlorine disinfectants widely and legally used in water treatment and food processing, water being by far the main contributor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Increasingly, vegetable protein is regarded as an attractive alternative to dairy protein in infant formula. Not only vegans, but also parents concerned about the environmental impact of animal farming, prefer infant formulas in which dairy protein has been replaced by vegetable protein. Nowadays, there is a general opinion that we should use natural ingredients as much as possible, to keep ingredient processing to a minimum, and to reduce our &#x2018;footprint&#x2019; on the planet. Pea, rice and potato rank among the most popular vegetable protein sources. Algae also are a suitable alternative source of non-dairy protein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, a challenge exists to provide non-dairy protein with low chlorate level in order to make the protein source suitable for use in preparing infant and young child milk formula.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventors have found that it is possible to effectively reduce the chlorate levels in vegetable proteins and algal proteins by using membrane filtration, e.g. ultrafiltration and/or nanofiltration, and by employing water that is essentially free of chlorate. The non-dairy proteins so obtained have a chlorate content of less than about 700 microgram per kg of the non-dairy protein and are perfectly suited for application in, for instance, infant formulas.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the present invention provides an edible composition comprising at least about 1 wt. %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, said composition having between about 0 and 700 microgram chlorate per kg of the non-dairy protein. Related therewith, the invention provides an edible composition comprising protein, lipids and digestible carbohydrates wherein the protein providing 6.5 to 16% of the total calories, and wherein the composition comprises at least about 2 wt %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, said composition having between 0 and 10 microgram chlorate per 100 g dry weight. The gist of reduced chlorate content according to the invention can be characterized in terms of protein or dry matter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention also provides a method of preparing the aforementioned edible composition, said method comprising combining a non-dairy protein component with one or more other edible ingredients, said non-dairy protein component containing at least about 60 wt. %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, and said non-dairy protein component having a chlorate level of between about 0 and 700 microgram per kg of the non-dairy protein protein. This way, the skilled person can arrive at a composition which is characterized in terms of between about 0 and 700 microgram chlorate per kg of the non-dairy protein, and/or between 0 and 10 microgram chlorate per 100 g dry weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention further provides a process of purifying non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, said process comprising the step of filtering an aqueous solution of the dairy protein over a membrane filter having a molecular weight cut-off of 1-20 kDa, said process comprising the addition of low chlorate water prior to the filtration step, said low chlorate water having a chlorate content of between about 0 and 100 microgram per liter. Low chlorate water may be obtained, for instance, by means of reverse osmosis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention also relates to the use of a non-dairy protein component for preparing a nutritional composition selected from an infant formula and a young child formula, said non-dairy protein component containing at least about 60 wt. %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, and said non-dairy protein component having a chlorate level of less than about 700 microgram per kg protein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION:</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention relates to an edible composition comprising at least about 1 wt. %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, said composition having between about 0 and 700 microgram chlorate per kg of the non-dairy protein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Related therewith, the invention pertains to an edible composition comprising protein, lipids and digestible carbohydrates wherein the protein providing 6.5 to 16% of the total calories, and wherein the composition comprises at least about 2 wt %, preferably between 2 and 20 wt %, calculated by weight of dry matter, of non-dairy protein selected from vegetable protein, algal protein and combinations thereof, said composition having between 0 and 10 microgram chlorate per 100 g dry weight.
