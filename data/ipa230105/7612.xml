Control <b>114</b> and data <b>116</b> messages are exchanged between the base station <b>120</b> and the small cell <b>110</b>. Currently, multiple LAA Stand-Alone approaches are defined, typically using the 5 GHz ISM band (or any other suitable unlicensed band or shared bands such as the 3.5 GHz US band) only&#x2014;without combination with a dedicated licensed band. This makes LTE available for operator-independent users, such as private users deploying a private home network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may thus be desirable to provide a new technique for efficiently using radio resources including licensed and unlicensed frequency bands.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of aspects and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

Such a second frequency carrier typically relates to a dedicated licensed frequency band, such as an LTE dedicated licensed frequency band. Also note that the stand-alone system typically relates to LAA but the approach is generic and can be applied to any communication protocol (possibly after suitable modifications, including mechanisms for protection of an incumbent system for example). Also note that the stand-alone system may be part of a hierarchy, for example in the case of LAA in 3.5 GHz shared spectrum, the highest priority is typically given to the incumbent, the second highest priority to a PAL User (Priority Access License User)&#x2014;if available in the target band&#x2014;and the third highest priority to a GAA User (General Authorized Access user) which is typically governed under the license-by-rule framework of the FCC (in other regions similar or slightly different schemes may exist which allow quasi-unlicensed operation while protecting a higher priority user).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is understood that the basic principles are applicable to any suitable frequency band and any suitable radio access technology. In particular, it is suitable for systems operating in unlicensed bands (such as 2.4 GHz ISM band and 5 GHz ISM bands), license-by-rule bands (such as 3.5 GHz GAA operation in the US under FCC's license-by-rule framework), shared bands (such as TVWS bands, e.g. in Europe from 470-790 MHz, where systems such as IEEE802.11af may operate) and any other type of bands. The proposed schemes are in particular optimized for TDD operation, however, they may be adapted to any other type of operation, including FDD. Alternatively, non-TDD systems, such as FDD systems or others, may be adapted in order to operate under the conditions detailed in this disclosure; this may for example be achieved by adding a (optional or non-optional) TDD mode or any other suitable mode to the currently existing stand.

It is understood that comments made in connection with a described method may also hold true for a corresponding device configured to perform the method and vice versa. For example, if a specific method step is described, a corresponding device may include a unit to perform the described method step, even if such a unit is not explicitly described or illustrated in the figures. Further, it is understood that the features of the various exemplary aspects described herein may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0049">The methods and devices described herein may be implemented in wireless communication networks, in particular communication networks based on mobile communication standards such as LTE, in particular LTE-A and/or OFDM. The methods and devices described below may further be implemented in a base station (NodeB, eNodeB) or a mobile device (or mobile station or User Equipment (UE)). The described devices may include integrated circuits and/or passives and may be manufactured according to various technologies. For example, the circuits may be designed as logic integrated circuits, analog integrated circuits, mixed signal integrated circuits, optical circuits, memory circuits and/or integrated passives.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0050">The methods and devices described herein may be configured to transmit and/or receive radio signals. Radio signals may be or may include radio frequency signals radiated by a radio transmitting device (or radio transmitter or sender) with a radio frequency lying in a range of about 3 Hz to 300 GHz. The frequency range may correspond to frequencies of alternating current electrical signals used to produce and detect radio waves.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0051">The methods and devices described herein after may be designed in accordance to mobile communication standards such as e.g. the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard or the advanced version LTE-A thereof. LTE (Long Term Evolution), marketed as 4G, 5G LTE and beyond, is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in OFDM systems. OFDM is a scheme for encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals may be used to carry data. Due to the orthogonality of the sub-carriers crosstalk between sub-carriers may be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0052">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in SAS systems. The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) released a Report and Order outlining the rules for operating wireless devices in the 3.5 GHz band that spans from 3550-3700 MHz. FCC released this spectrum for sharing with the incumbents, which means that the incumbents get priority in that band and it can be used by broadband devices when (and where) incumbents are not using the spectrum. The incumbents in this band include DoD radars. There are two additional tiers of spectrum users in addition to the incumbents namely the Priority Access (PA) and General Authorized Access (GAA). The Priority Access Licenses (PAL) users get protection from GAA users which is similar to unlicensed spectrum.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0053">The FCC also mandates a Spectrum Access System (SAS) that will coordinate the spectrum use between the incumbents, PA and GAA. The SAS is central to this band, and no tier 2 or tier 3 device can operate unless it is in constant communication with the SAS and receives information of when and where to use the 3.5 GHz channels. The SAS has to be approved by the FCC before it can be deployed. Since the SAS is the central coordinator for this spectrum, it needs to have a lot of information about the network and devices. In fact, FCC mandates most of this information to be contained in the SAS. FCC's Report and Order outlines a sample system with SAS(s) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. If there are multiple SASs, they are supposed to be synchronized with each other. However, the FCC does not specify details of how the SAS have to be implemented and what information has to be synchronized.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0054">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in LSA (Licensed Shared Access) systems, ASA (Authorized Shared Access) systems and CSS (Cloud Spectrum Services) systems. The LSA (Licensed Shared Access) concept, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, was recently developed by RSPG (Radio Spectrum Policy Group) on a European level. The objective is to propose a new way for answering to the operators' needs for more spectrum. It is expected that no more dedicated spectrum will be available for cellular operators for mobile communications in the future. LSA thus proposes mechanisms for introducing shared spectrum based solutions, i.e. mobile cellular operators will have access to additional licensed spectrum from other licensees (like public safety, government. etc.) which they normally would not get access to. LSA is based on a similar solution as ASA (Authorized Shared Access). ASA, however, is limited to IMT spectrum while LSA is also addressing non-IMT bands. Both exist on a rather conceptual level for the time being.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0055">A related technology is CSS (Cloud Spectrum Services) which addresses the same framework as LSA and ASA, but introduces more detailed implementation solutions. On a regulatory level, there is massive interest for LSA/ASA/CSS, in particular in Europe. CEPT WG FM has agreed to launch a corresponding project team. ETSI RRS has finalized the set-up of a so-called SRDoc (System Reference Document) which targets in particular the 2.3-2.4 GHz Band which is expected to be one of the most straightforward candidates for shared spectrum usage. This is also acknowledged by CEPT WG FM. CEPT has taken the inputs into account in its CEPT WG FM project teams PT52 and PT53. While current activities focus on the 2.3-2.4 GHz band in Europe, it should be noted that the usage of the LSA concept is not limited to any specific frequency band. In fact, it is expected that the 2.3-2.4 GHz represents a first exercise and in the future LSA usage will be extended to other bands.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0056">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in WiFi and Bluetooth systems or any near field communication (NFC) technology. WiFi is a local area wireless computer networking technology that allows electronic devices to connect to the network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands. The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any &#x201c;wireless local area network&#x201d; (WLAN) product based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. However, the term &#x201c;Wi-Fi&#x201d; is used in general English as a synonym for WLAN since most modern WLANs are based on these standards. Many devices can use WiFi, e.g. personal computers, video-game consoles, smartphones, digital cameras, tablet computers and digital audio players. These can connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters indoors and a greater range outdoors.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0057">Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANS). It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0058">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in LTE FDD mode systems, e.g. LTE mode systems having a type 1 LTE frame structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The type 1 LTE frame <b>200</b> includes 10 sub-frames <b>204</b> each having two slots <b>206</b>. A basic type 1 LTE frame has an overall length of 10 milliseconds.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0059">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in LTE TDD mode systems, e.g. LTE mode systems having a type 2 LTE frame structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The type 2 LTE frame <b>300</b> has an overall length <b>202</b> of 10 milliseconds. The 10 ms frame <b>300</b> comprises two half frames <b>208</b>, each 5 ms long. The LTE half-frames <b>208</b> are further split into five subframes <b>204</b>, each 1 millisecond long <b>206</b>. The subframes <b>204</b> may be divided into standard subframes <b>302</b> and special subframes. The special subframes consist of three fields: DwPTS&#x2014;Downlink Pilot Time Slot <b>304</b>; GP&#x2014;Guard Period <b>306</b>; and UpPTS&#x2014;Uplink Pilot Time Stot <b>308</b>. These three fields are individually configurable in terms of length, although the total length of all three together must be 1 ms.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0060">One of the advantages of using LTE TDD is that to apply a dynamically changing of the up and downlink balance and characteristics to meet the load conditions. In order to achieve this in an ordered fashion, a number of standard configurations have been set within the LTE standards. A total of seven up/downlink configurations have been set, and these use either 5 ms or 10 ms switch periodicities. In the case of the 5 ms switch point periodicity, a special subframe exists in both half frames. In the case of the 10 ms periodicity, the special subframe exists in the first half frame only. The subframes 0 and 5 as well as DwPTS are always reserved for the downlink. UpPTS and the subframe immediately following the special subframe are always reserved for the uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0061">The methods and devices described hereinafter may be applied in MIMO systems. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems employ multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver to increase system capacity and to achieve better quality of service. In spatial multiplexing mode, MIMO systems may reach higher peak data rates without increasing the bandwidth of the system by transmitting multiple data streams in parallel in the same frequency band.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a mobile communication system <b>400</b> including a mobile network operator (MNO) network <b>410</b>, a base station (BS) circuitry <b>420</b> and a user equipment (UE) <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0063">The BS circuitry <b>420</b> is configured to adapt operation of a UE <b>430</b> between a stand-alone operation mode and a mobile network operator (MNO) assisted operation mode.

The basic principles are as follows:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0095">Carrier Sense: before a transmission is executed, the concerned device first listens to the resource (i.e., the target frequency band) in order to find out whether another device in on the air.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0096">Collision Avoidance: In case that another device is detected, wait for a pre-defined period of time prior to another listening operation. This step may lead to a high level of inefficiency, since long waiting times may be enforced while the channel is empty in the immediate future</p><p id="p-0073" num="0097">Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS): in order to reduce the hidden node problem, first a &#x201c;Request to Send&#x201d; is transmitted and only when a &#x201c;Clear to Send&#x201d; is received, the actual transmission is started.

The transmitting device waits for an acknowledgement packet indicating that the packet was received and decoded without error. In case that the correct reception cannot be identified, some error event is assumed to have happened (hidden node based interference, etc.), forcing the device to apply a period of binary exponential backoff before the re-transmission can be initiated again.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0099">The disclosed efficient resource access mechanism as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b></figref> guarantees that no interference occurs and thus no (inefficient) increase of the waiting time is required.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0100">There is coordination between 3GPP LAA Base Stations/Small Cells or stand-alone LAA Base Stations/Small Cells. This is the typical approach for LTE, where Base Stations/Small Cells are connected through the Backbone network. In case of a full stand-alone solution, several implementations for coordination between Small Cells/BS are presented in the following:</p><p id="p-0078" num="0101">There is a centralized service that can be accessed through internet for coordination. For example, the concerned LAA stand-alone Small Cells/BS are contacting the centralized service (through the cabled network access, dedicated licensed LTE, etc.) and provide parameters such as their geographic location, parameterization (bandwidth, carrier frequency, etc.). The centralized service determines the neighboring Small Cells/BS and provides the corresponding triggers as indicated in the sequel.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0102">One of the stand-alone LAA Small Cell/BS may be declared to be the coordinating entity. This can be achieved through negotiation by concerned Small Cells/BS with a centralized service that can be accessed through internet for coordination or similar. The designated Small Cell/BS provides the corresponding triggers as indicated in the sequel.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0103">The coordinating entity (in a hierarchical approach, this entity is higher in the hierarchy compared to (other) Base Stations/Small Cells) will allocate resources for stand-alone LAA (LTE being operated on an unlicensed, license-by-rule or shared basis or similar) in such a way that one transmission is following right after the previous one. I.e., Small Cells need to exactly schedule the transmission following the triggers of the coordinating entity. Also User Devices will need to exactly schedule their transmissions following the triggers <b>1008</b>, These triggers can schedule the transmissions ahead of time such that the entities (Small Cells/BS/UEs) have enough time to do the required (signal) processing and they will be ready immediately when their slot is available. Due to the concatenated transmissions, the contention based WiFi protocol will always detect that the channel is occupied and will not transmit. In case that a RTS sequence of WiFi is received, no answer is sent in order to be sure that there will be no transmission initiated by WiFi.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0104">When WiFi access should be permitted, the central control entity may enforce a pause sequence after a given stand-alone LAA transmission. During this empty period, the WiFi nodes (or other contention based access protocols) detect the availability of the medium. Then, they can start their transmissions.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0105">The transition from the transmissions of WiFi nodes (or other contention based access protocols) is then taken over again after a predetermined period of time and when the WiFi transmissions are terminated. This can typically be achieved through application of a contention based protocol similar to the one of WiFi (or other contention based access protocols).

In particular for UL this is critical since when the UL part is minimized, a quite long silence period is added in the LTE (such as stand-alone LAA) transmission in order to address propagation delays. This silence period may be identified by WiFi systems (or any other contention based protocol) and they may take back the channel unintentionally (i.e., the central control entity actually targets to maintain the channel for stand-alone LAA systems). In the following, a mechanism is presented in which corresponding silence periods are filled up by &#x201c;dummy&#x201d; transmissions, such as packets containing random data. These dummy transmissions may be performed for UL and DL parts (and UL/DL pause intervals) either by the concerned infrastructure (i.e., Small Cells, Base Stations) and/or selected/all User Devices.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0122">This is a substantial paradigm shift&#x2014;even Base Stations may transmit in the UL portion (and UL/DL pause intervals) and/or User Devices may transmit in the DL portion (and UL/DL pause intervals).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0123">The simultaneous transmissions of dummy signals by both the infrastructure (i.e., Small Cells, Base Stations) and selected/all User Devices may further alleviate the hidden node problem (or other problems) making sure that the WiFi (or any other contention based protocol) continues to detect the channel to be occupied. Instead of dummy transmissions, any other type of (useful/unuseful) transmission may occur, for example those periods may be filled up with broadcast sequences, etc. The basic principle is illustrated below.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0124">If suitable, the stand-alone LAA system may dynamically change the allocation sequence of UL and DL, i.e. in some (selected) transmissions first UL and then DL is used and in the other transmissions first DL and then UL is used. The best allocation strategy may be identified such that, for example, the maximum system capacity is reached, the probability is minimized that other contention based access systems (such as WiFi) or any other systems operating in (part of) the same band may take the channel (or perform any other unintended action) while the central control entity has it still allocated to the stand-alone LAA (such as LTE being operated on an unlicensed, license-by-rule or shared basis, etc.) or any other suitable system.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0125">In another implementation multiple central control entities exist and coordinate stand-alone LAA systems. In this case, the following two sub cases are considered: There is a cooperation between the central control entities, e.g. they are exchanging data through a backbone (or any other cabled/over-the-air) link or there is even a higher priority controller above those controllers (i.e., higher in the hierarchy) coordinating the concerned controller. Then, the two controllers are negotiating access slots with respect to each other. Also, they are negotiating access slots to be given to any other contention based access system (such as WiFi, etc.). This exchange of information may be triggered by one of the central controllers, requesting the initiation of a negotiation procedure. The target central controller answers to the request acknowledging its availability for negotiating a strategy for sharing the resource. Then, all concerned central controllers may exchange data on their expected needs for the resource occupancy and also the needs of other unlicensed systems (such as WiFi, etc.) may be determined (e.g. through estimation and/or observation of their channel occupancy level in the past).
