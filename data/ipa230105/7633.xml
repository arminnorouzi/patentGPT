Accordingly, embodiments may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Furthermore, embodiments may take the form of a program product embodied in one or more computer readable storage devices storing machine readable code, computer readable code, and/or program code, referred hereafter as code. The storage devices may be tangible, non-transitory, and/or non-transmission. The storage devices may not embody signals. In a certain embodiment, the storage devices only employ signals for accessing code.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Modules may also be implemented in code and/or software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of executable code which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Indeed, a module of code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different computer readable storage devices. Where a module or portions of a module are implemented in software, the software portions are stored on one or more computer readable storage devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Any combination of one or more computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium may be a storage device storing the code. The storage device may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, holographic, micromechanical, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the storage device would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Code for carrying out operations for embodiments may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages including an object oriented programming language such as Python, Ruby, Java, Smalltalk, C++, or the like, and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language, or the like, and/or machine languages such as assembly languages. The code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment, but mean &#x201c;one or more but not all embodiments&#x201d; unless expressly specified otherwise. The terms &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; and variations thereof mean &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; unless expressly specified otherwise. An enumerated listing of items does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise. The terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; also refer to &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; unless expressly specified otherwise.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics of the embodiments may be combined in any suitable manner. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, hardware modules, hardware circuits, hardware chips, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that embodiments may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth.

The sTTI operation is referred to as sTTI-O for Long Term Evolution (LTE) with sTTI. For URLLC, a smaller DCI size (URLLC DCI in an sTTI is referred herein to as u-sDCI) than sDCI can be used to be able to support lower coding rates, and hence improve the reliability of the control channel which in turn would increase the reliability of packet transmission. In such a case, there could be at least two different DCI sizes (i.e., a sDCI size and a u-sDCI size) to be monitored in an sTTI, and therefore, the number of blind decodes should be shared between the two DCI sizes, which in turn would reduce the number of blind decodes for each type of service: e.g., sTTI-O, and URLLC.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One solution for splitting the blind decodes among sTTI-O and URLCC services is to configure the number of candidates for each AL? corresponding to the URLLC service, and also the number of normal sTTI candidates for each Aggregation Level (AL) corresponding to the sTTI service</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another solution is not to split the blind decodes, but use all blind decodes for both sTTI-O and URLLC services. This is generally achieved when the sDCI size and u-sDCI seizes are aligned, and sDCI and u-sDCI are differentiated e.g., via one or more bit(s) more than one bit may be needed e.g., if different reliability targets are intended for URLLC service in sDCI/u-sDCI. However, if the payloads (i.e., information bits) of sDCI and u-sDCI are very different, padding of zeros to u-sDCI is not efficient. One solution is to virtually align the sDCI and u-sDCI sizes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of u-sDCI <b>111</b> and sDCI <b>113</b> size alignment.

A processor may determine <b>121</b> if the u-sDCI <b>111</b> is size A, the size of the sDCI <b>113</b>. If sDCI <b>113</b> is not size A, instead of applying &#x201c;L-K&#x201d; zeros to u-sDCI <b>111</b> to make u-sDCI <b>111</b> equal in size with sDCI <b>113</b>, the processor may apply <b>123</b> an inner channel coding scheme (K&#x2192;L) to u-sDCI <b>111</b>, in which the number of output bits is equal to the number of bits in an sDCI <b>113</b> (i.e., &#x201c;L&#x201d;). The processor may further add <b>125</b> a one-bit differentiator that is not inner channel coded. In one example, one of the unused states of an DCI type field present in the sDCI <b>113</b> may be used, e.g., unused state &#x2018;11&#x2019; of 2-bit DCI type field may be used to indicate u-sDCI <b>111</b>. In another example, the one-bit differentiator may be an unused or padding bit in the sDCI <b>113</b> or a bit that is repurposed for the DCI type differentiation. In another example, the sTTI-O sDCI <b>113</b> may be modified and extended by one-bit differentiator. The User Equipment (UE) distinguishes sDCI <b>113</b> and u-sDCI <b>111</b>.

Different coding techniques can be used to extend &#x201c;K&#x201d; bits to &#x201c;L&#x201d; bits such as Reed-Muller, repetition code, block coding, polar coding, convolutional code, simplex code etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example, a polar code is used and the &#x201c;L-K&#x201d; bits are mapped to frozen bit positions of the polar kernel encoder.

The steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are shown. However, instead of aligning sDCI and u-sDCI size after additional coding of u-sDCI <b>111</b> and before CRC attachment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the size of encoded u-sDCI <b>111</b> is increased <b>135</b> via additional channel coding to &#x201c;A-w&#x201d; bits where A&#x2212;w&#x3e;&#xc3;, and after additional (partial) CRC attachment, the encoded and partial CRC attached u-sDCI becomes &#x201c;A&#x201d; bits. In this example, w is the additional CRC bits (e.g., 2 bits for a total of 18 CRC bits) for u-sDCI <b>111</b> compared to sDCI <b>113</b> (with a CRC of 16 bits). The size of sDCI <b>113</b> and u-sDCI <b>111</b> after channel coding <b>129</b> (variable D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is the same.

To achieve low latency in URLLC, retransmissions may be allowed/configured/scheduled/Medium Access Control (MAC)-Control Element (CE) activated before reception of acknowledge/no acknowledge (ACK/NACK) in uplink or in downlink. The reliability requirement such as a target Block Error Rate (BLER) for retransmissions may be more relaxed e.g., compared to the initial transmission of a transport block (TB). In one example, a TB retransmission may be scheduled with u-sDCI <b>111</b> or sDCI <b>113</b> or even regular DCI. A retransmission of a TB may be scheduled via a sDCI <b>113</b>, a field in the sDCI <b>113</b> may indicate that the DL scheduling assignment/UL grant is intended for URLLC.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">If SPS is enabled (or configured) for URLLC, the u-sDCI <b>111</b> for URLLC-Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) (e.g., SPS activation, or SPS release) maybe scrambled by SPS-Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) and the u-sDCI <b>111</b> may contain a differentiator field <b>116</b> distinguishing the u-sDCI <b>111</b> from sTTI-O SPS (if different sDCI and u-sDCI sizes are used, no distinguishing field is needed for SPS activation/release). The URLLC-SPS may contain periodic locations in time (sTTIs), and each instance maybe repeated &#x201c;N&#x201d; times in time (e.g., in consecutive sTTIs), where &#x201c;N&#x201d; can be configured (e.g., via URLLC-SPS configuration), alternatively, &#x201c;N&#x201d; may be signaled in a DCI/sDCI/u-sDCI such as the SPS activation command. Each repetition may be acknowledged separately or an acknowledgement may be sent once the TB is correctly decoded (e.g., after a fraction of repetitions). In one example, Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)-ACK transmission and timing is based on only the last sTTI in the bundle (where a bundle composed of initial and retransmissions of a TB corresponding to one SPS occasion).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In case of collision of one repetition (DL or UL) with a dynamically grant/assignment for the same HARQ process if the dynamic grant was a u-sDCI <b>111</b>, that instance of repetition is dropped. If more than a certain number/fraction (called &#x201c;N_drop&#x201d; in this document) of repetitions corresponding to a transport block (TB) are dropped, the UE may not transmit the remaining repetitions in UL, or may not attempt to decode the remaining retransmissions. &#x201c;N_drop&#x201d; may be fixed in specifications/data target BLER dependent (e.g., N_drop for lower target BLER may be lower than that of higher target BLER both for URLLC services with different BLER targets).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, URLLC-SPS is (re)activated/released via &#x201c;N&#x201d; u-sDCIs <b>111</b>/control signals sent in a plurality of sTTIs.
