Objects designed for a dog to recreationally chew, which may be referred to as a &#x201c;chew,&#x201d; can be made from synthetic or natural materials. For example, a synthetic chew may be made of plastic or rubber. However, pets such as dogs may express a preference for chews made of natural materials, such as a rawhide chew, bully sticks, or chews made from other animal parts such as tendons. In addition, synthetic chews may not be designed for ingestion by the pet and may not be digestible, and if the pet consumes a synthetic chew then digestive complications may result. Thus, chews made of natural materials may be preferable to synthetic materials. A pet, such as a dog, may consume a natural chew over time, reducing the size of the chew over time.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a pet toy for securely holding a chew.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an off-center bottom view of the components of the pet toy shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates an off-center top view of the components of the pet toy shown in</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cut-out side view of the assembled pet toy shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a pet toy with a chew holder.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a pet toy for securely holding a chew, such as a bully stick. The pet toy of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> includes a ball <b>150</b> that forms the main body of the toy. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, ball <b>150</b> includes a top opening <b>160</b> and a bottom opening <b>170</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, ball <b>150</b> may include cutout shapes <b>155</b> on the surface of ball <b>150</b>. In particular embodiments, cutout shapes <b>155</b> may permit treats placed in the interior of ball <b>150</b> to exit the ball as, for example, a pet plays with the ball. Thus, in particular embodiments, ball <b>150</b> may include an outer shell that is substantially or entirely hollow, permitting pet treats to be placed within the interior of ball <b>150</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, cutout shapes <b>155</b> may take different forms, such as a triangle, an ellipse, a circle, or any other suitable shape. This disclosure contemplates that cutout shapes may or may not be included on a pet toy, or may be included on only a portion of a body of the toy. Moreover, while the example toy of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a ball, this disclosure contemplates that the pet toys described herein may take any suitable shape. For example, in particular embodiments, a pet toy may take the shape of a bone, a cylinder, etc. This disclosure also contemplates that the pet toy may have various sizes. For example, the diameter of ball <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> may be, e.g., 4.5 inches, or may be larger or smaller.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the example pet toy includes chew holder <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, chew holder <b>100</b> includes a bottom portion <b>120</b> and a top portion <b>110</b>, described more fully herein. As described below, chew holder <b>100</b> is removable from ball <b>150</b> and can be inserted and securely fixed to ball <b>150</b> to safely and securely attach a chew to ball <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an off-center, bottom view of the components of the pet toy shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an off-center, bottom view of chew holder <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> may include a section that has threads on a portion of the outer surface of chew holder <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the bottom portion of ball <b>150</b> may include bottom opening <b>170</b>. Similarly, the surface of ball <b>150</b> that is formed by bottom opening <b>170</b> may include threads for receiving the threads on bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> for attaching chew holder <b>100</b> to ball <b>150</b>. Thus, in the embodiment show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, chew holder <b>100</b> attaches to ball <b>150</b> by inserting top portion <b>110</b> into bottom opening <b>170</b> of ball <b>150</b>, pushing chew holder <b>100</b> into ball <b>150</b>, and turning chew holder <b>100</b> so that the threads of bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> screw into the threads of bottom opening <b>170</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the bottom of chew holder <b>100</b> may include prongs <b>125</b>, which form part of the bottom surface of chew holder <b>100</b> or may be slightly recessed into the interior of chew holder <b>100</b>. Bottom opening <b>170</b> and bottom portion <b>120</b> may have various sizes, provided that, in this example, bottom portion <b>120</b> threads snugly into the threads on the outer surface of bottom opening <b>170</b>. For example, the diameter of bottom opening <b>170</b> and of bottom portion <b>120</b> may be approximately 1.5 to 3 inches, or any other suitable size.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, prongs <b>125</b> permit a user to grasp (e.g., using a thumb and two fingers) and turn chew holder <b>100</b> into and out of ball <b>150</b>, because the space between prongs <b>125</b> is hollow. For example, in particular embodiments, when chew holder <b>100</b> is affixed to ball <b>150</b>, the bottom surface of chew holder <b>100</b> may be flush with or slightly recessed into ball <b>150</b>, i.e., such that the bottom of chew holder <b>100</b> forms the part of the surface of ball <b>150</b> that is absent from ball <b>150</b> as a result of bottom opening <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Chew holder <b>100</b> may be difficult or impossible for a pet to remove from ball <b>150</b> once chew holder <b>100</b> is affixed to ball <b>150</b>. Because the bottom surface of chew holder <b>100</b> sits below or level with the surface of ball <b>150</b>, there is no protrusion of chew holder <b>100</b> which a pet could grasp and pull with, e.g., its teeth. In addition, prongs <b>125</b> permit fingers to insert into chew holder <b>100</b> and push against prongs <b>125</b> to create a rotational force to unscrew chew holder <b>100</b> from ball <b>150</b>, but the size of the holes between chew holders <b>125</b> and the lack of digits in pets make it difficult for pets to create the necessary rotational force on chew holder <b>100</b> relative to ball <b>150</b> to remove chew holder <b>100</b> from ball <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular embodiments, chew holder <b>100</b> may be substantially hollow between top portion <b>110</b> and bottom portion <b>120</b>. In particular embodiments, chew holder <b>100</b> may be partially or fully filled. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates three prongs <b>125</b> having a particular shape and level with the bottom surface of chew holder <b>100</b>, this disclosure contemplates that chew holder <b>100</b> may have any suitable number of prongs or other components for grasping or manipulating chew holder <b>100</b>, and further that those prongs may take any suitable shape. For example, chew holder <b>100</b> may include a knob (e.g., a rounded handle, a gear-shaped knob, etc.) that extends from or is part of the end of chew holder <b>100</b> for inserting and removing chew holder <b>100</b> from ball <b>150</b>, and that knob may be permanently affixed or removable from chew holder <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate chew holder <b>100</b> having a taper in its body such that bottom portion <b>120</b> is larger than at least some of the rest of the body of chew holder <b>100</b>. For example, bottom portion <b>120</b> may be approximately 2.5 inches in diameter, while the body of chew holder <b>100</b> may be approximately 1 and 1/16 inches in diameter after the taper. As another example, the body of chew holder <b>100</b> may be approximately &#xbe; inches in diameter after the taper. In particular embodiments, this taper helps chew holder <b>100</b> to easily insert into bottom opening <b>170</b> of ball <b>150</b>, but this disclosure contemplates that chew holder <b>100</b> may have any suitable shape with or without taper. Moreover, as described more fully in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this disclosure contemplates that a chew holder (e.g., chew holder <b>100</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>) may take any suitable shape and may not be entirely or partially removable from at least part of the pet toy. In addition, while the discussion of the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref> above describes affixing chew holder <b>100</b> to ball <b>150</b> using threads, this disclosure contemplates any suitable mechanism for securing chew holder <b>100</b> to ball <b>150</b>. For example, a chew holder may attach to a ball by a clipping or locking mechanism, such as a push-activated mechanism, that locks and unlocks by pushing the chew holder into the ball through a hole. As another example, the ball may include a cap (which may be attached to the ball) that the user can pry open, insert the chew holder, and then close to secure the chew holder to the ball. This disclosure contemplates any suitable mechanism for affixing the chew holder to the pet toy. Moreover, while the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref> show bottom opening <b>170</b> as being circular and chew holder <b>100</b> as being cylindrical, this disclosure contemplates that bottom opening <b>170</b> and chew holder <b>100</b> may take any suitable shape (which may not necessarily be the same shape as long as chew holder <b>100</b> fits into the pet toy). In addition, the shape and size of bottom opening <b>170</b> and chew holder <b>100</b> may vary based on the shape of the pet toy.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates an off-center top view of chew holder <b>100</b> and ball <b>150</b>. As shown on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, ball <b>150</b> includes a top opening <b>160</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>, top opening <b>160</b> is opposite bottom opening <b>170</b> along the diameter of ball <b>150</b>. As shown on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, chew holder <b>100</b> includes a top portion <b>110</b>. Top portion <b>110</b> of example chew holder <b>100</b> includes a rim <b>112</b> connected by walls to a base <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, base <b>114</b> and rim <b>112</b> (as well as the walls leading from base <b>114</b> to rim <b>112</b>) form an opening in top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>. As explained more fully below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>, this opening holds the base of the chew within the pet toy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Chew holder <b>100</b> may be partially, fully, or substantially hollow throughout its length, or may be primarily solid. The opening in top portion <b>110</b> formed by base <b>114</b> and rim <b>112</b> may be approximately 1 inch in diameter, and the hole illustrated in base <b>114</b> may be approximately &#xbc; inch in diameter. The body of chew holder <b>100</b> may be 1 and 1/16 inches in diameter and may be hollow, such that chew holder is hollow below base <b>114</b> (i.e., moving from top portion <b>110</b> to bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>). In particular embodiments, the walls leading from base <b>114</b> to rim <b>112</b> may be approximately &#xbd; inch in length, creating a cylindrical opening that is, e.g., 1 inch in diameter by &#xbd; inches in length. Rim <b>112</b> may take any suitable thickness, such as for example a thickness of &#x215b; inch. When chew holder <b>100</b> is hollow throughout its length, &#x215b; inch may also be the thickness of the materials forming the body of the chew holder. However, this disclosure contemplates that the thickness of the chew holder may vary along its length and may be more or less hollow along its length, e.g., to balance the toy so that the center of mass of the pet toy when the chew holder is inserted into the ball runs approximately through the center of the ball.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cut-out side view of an example pet toy. The pet toy of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> holds chew <b>190</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, chew <b>190</b> includes a chew base <b>195</b> that sits within the opening of top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the majority of chew <b>190</b> extends outside of ball <b>150</b> and is accessible to be chewed by a pet. A portion <b>192</b>, which includes base <b>195</b>, of chew <b>190</b> sits within ball <b>150</b>, and therefore is not accessible by the pet. That is, a pet can chew <b>190</b> until chew <b>190</b> is substantially flush with the upper surface of ball <b>150</b>. Thus, while the pet can reduce chew <b>190</b> while chew <b>190</b> extends from ball <b>150</b>, the pet cannot put the entirety of chew <b>190</b> in its mouth when chew <b>190</b> is reduced to a size that represents a choking hazard to the pet (which, as explained below, may be the size of portion <b>192</b>, which includes base <b>195</b>), because chew <b>190</b> is affixed to the inner portion of ball <b>150</b>. The pet cannot consume ball <b>150</b>, and therefore when the pet reduces chew <b>190</b> to a size at which the pet may choke, the pet cannot choke on chew <b>190</b> because it is affixed to ball <b>150</b>. As shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, and <b>2</b></figref>, top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> sits below top opening <b>160</b> of ball <b>150</b> when chew holder <b>100</b> is affixed to ball <b>150</b>, i.e., the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> is in the plane parallel to top opening <b>160</b> but is offset from top opening <b>160</b> in a direction below (given the orientation of the pet toy in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and perpendicular to the plane of top opening <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular embodiments, the size of chew portion <b>192</b> that the pet cannot access (as portion <b>192</b> extends from the upper surface of ball <b>150</b> to the bottom of base <b>195</b> within the interior of the ball) is smaller than the size at which a pet typically risks choking. Thus, after a pet chews chew <b>190</b> flush with ball <b>150</b>, the pet owner can remove unchewed portion <b>192</b> (which includes base <b>195</b>) from the pet toy and give that portion to the pet, both reducing choking risk and the typical waste associated with having to throw away a portion of a chew once it is reduced to a size that the pet could choke on. In the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the height of portion <b>192</b> is approximately equal to the height of the chew holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> and the thickness of the surface of ball <b>150</b> (or substantially equal to those dimensions, as, e.g., there may be a small gap between rim <b>112</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> and the interior surface of ball <b>150</b> when chew holder <b>100</b> is affixed to ball <b>150</b>). For example, as described above, the chew holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> may have a height of &#xbd; inch, and the thickness of ball <b>150</b> may be &#x215b; inch, so that the height of portion <b>192</b> may be &#x215d; inch. In this example, the height of base <b>195</b> may be &#xbd; inch. This disclosure contemplates, however, larger and smaller sizes for portion <b>192</b>, base <b>195</b>, the height of the chew holder opening in top portion <b>110</b>, and the thickness of ball <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> may be a cylinder having a 1-inch diameter and a &#xbd;-inch length, and base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> may have substantially similar dimensions. In particular embodiments, the width of base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> may be sized slightly larger than the diameter of the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> so that base <b>195</b> snuggly squeezes into that opening. In particular embodiments, the width of base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> may be sized the same as or slightly smaller than the diameter of the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When chew <b>190</b> is secured to the pet toy as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the size of chew base <b>195</b> (and therefore the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>) and the size of rim <b>112</b> in the dimensions parallel to the plane of top opening <b>160</b> are larger than the diameter of top opening <b>160</b>. For example, the diameter of the chew-holder opening in top portion <b>110</b> may be 1 inch, and base <b>195</b> may have a substantially similar diameter, while the diameter of top opening <b>160</b> may be &#xbe; inches, or less. This configuration ensures that chew <b>190</b> is not removable from ball <b>150</b> through top opening <b>160</b>. In other words, as discussed more fully below, a force parallel to the body of chew holder <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> will not pull chew <b>190</b> through top opening <b>160</b> of ball <b>150</b> because that force would cause base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> or rim <b>112</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> (or both) to contact and press against the interior, rigid upper surface of ball <b>150</b> near top opening <b>160</b>. Thus, while the majority of the body of chew <b>190</b> is small enough, relative to the size of top opening <b>160</b>, to extend through top opening <b>160</b>, the width of base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> is larger than the diameter of top opening <b>160</b>, ensuring that the entire chew <b>190</b> cannot be removed from ball <b>150</b> when chew holder <b>100</b> is affixed to ball <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As explained above, in the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. a force parallel to the body of chew holder <b>100</b> is insufficient to pull chew <b>190</b> through top opening <b>160</b> of ball <b>150</b> when chew holder <b>100</b> is secured to ball <b>150</b>, as the width of base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> is larger than the diameter of top opening <b>160</b> of ball <b>150</b>. As shown in the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> may be secured within a chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>, formed at least in part by the walls leading to rim <b>112</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>. In particular embodiments, base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> fits snuggly within the chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>, such that there is some frictional force between base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> and the walls that lead to rim <b>112</b>. In particular embodiments, the chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b> may be sized so that base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> simply rests within the opening, without being squeezed by the walls of top portion <b>110</b> that form the opening.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b></figref>, when chew <b>190</b> is secured to ball <b>150</b> by chew holder <b>100</b>, chew <b>190</b> cannot be pushed out of ball <b>150</b> through bottom opening <b>170</b> by a downward force parallel to the body of chew <b>190</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b></figref>, a force on chew <b>190</b> in that direction would result in a force by base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> on base <b>114</b> of top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this would ultimately result in a force between bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> and ball <b>150</b>. For example, when chew holder <b>100</b> is threaded into bottom opening <b>170</b> of ball <b>150</b> as discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the threadings between bottom portion <b>120</b> and the interior surface of bottom opening <b>170</b> prevent chew holder <b>100</b>, and thus chew <b>190</b> when affixed to ball <b>150</b>, from being pushed out of ball <b>150</b>. Moreover, when a pet attempts to pull or push chew <b>190</b> out of the pet toy, the force preventing the pet from doing so is distributed along the surface of ball <b>150</b> near top opening <b>160</b> and bottom opening <b>170</b>, respectively. And if a pet were to exert a force on chew <b>190</b> perpendicular to the body of chew <b>190</b> (i.e., parallel to the plane of opening <b>160</b>), then chew <b>190</b> is held in place by the rigidity of ball <b>150</b> near top opening <b>150</b>, by the contact between chew <b>190</b> and the inner surface of ball <b>150</b> and/or between top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> and the inner surface of ball <b>150</b>, or both.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrate chew holder <b>100</b> as having an opening that receives chew base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b>. However, this disclosure contemplates any suitable form for securing chew base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> to ball <b>150</b>. For example, rather than having an opening in the top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>, a chew holder may have a surface flush with rim <b>112</b> on which chew base rests. That surface may be rim <b>112</b> itself, or may be a surface that extends partially or entirely along the top portion of chew holder <b>100</b> (e.g., a surface in the plane of rim <b>112</b> extending over what is illustrated as the chew holder opening in top portion <b>110</b>). In such embodiments, chew base <b>195</b> is still larger than top opening <b>160</b>, and therefore chew <b>190</b> is secured to ball <b>150</b> and cannot be pulled through top opening <b>160</b>. In particular embodiments, a chew holder such as chew holder <b>100</b> may be partially or entirely hollow along its length.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> show top opening <b>160</b>, chew <b>190</b>, chew base <b>195</b>, chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b>, and rim <b>112</b> as all having a circular shape, in some embodiments all or some of those components (when present) may not have a circular shape. In particular embodiments, some of those components may have a different shape than other of those components. For example, rim <b>112</b> may be circular, while chew base <b>195</b> and the chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b> may have a rectangular shape. As another example, chew base <b>195</b> may have a rectangular shape while the body of chew <b>190</b> has a circular shape. As another example, the body of chew <b>190</b> and top opening <b>160</b> of ball <b>150</b> may have a rectangular, triangular, or star-like shape. However, in other embodiments top opening <b>160</b> and the body of chew <b>190</b> may have a different shape, as long as chew body <b>190</b> fits through top opening <b>160</b>. As explained above, in each of these embodiments base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b> is larger than top opening <b>160</b>, preventing chew <b>190</b> from being pulled out of ball <b>150</b> through top opening <b>160</b>. For example, base <b>195</b> (and, the chew holder opening of top portion <b>110</b>), may have a diameter of 1-2 inches, while the diameter of top opening <b>160</b> and the diameter of the body of chew <b>190</b> above base <b>195</b> may be approximately &#xbe; inch.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> as being larger than (and indeed, holding within it) base <b>195</b> of chew <b>190</b>, this disclosure contemplates that base <b>195</b> may be larger than top portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>. For example, at least part of the bottom of base <b>195</b> may contact the top surface of chew holder <b>100</b>, which may press at least part of the top of base <b>195</b> against the interior surface of ball <b>150</b>. In particular embodiments, a chew holder may not have a top portion with a base such as base <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, even if the chew holder has an opening in the top portion of the chew holder, as illustrated by that figure. Instead, for example, the chew may contact the top surface of the chew holder (e.g., rest on rim <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) or may squeeze into the body of the chew holder, which, in particular embodiments may be tapered along its length. For example, an upper portion of the chew holder may be tapered such that chews of different shapes may be pushed into the body and securely fastened by the chew holder.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate bottom opening <b>170</b> and the bottom portion <b>120</b> as being circular, this disclosure contemplates that bottom opening <b>170</b> (if present, as explained below) and the bottom portion of a chew holder may not have a circular shape, and may take different shapes. For example, while the bottom hole and the bottom portion of a chew holder would have a circular shape if the chew holder fastened to the ball using threads, other shapes (e.g., rectangular, triangular, etc.) may be used with other fastening mechanisms. Moreover, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> and <b>2</b> illustrate chew holder <b>100</b> as having a circular shape throughout its length (i.e., chew holder <b>100</b> as being cylindrical), this disclosure contemplates that a chew holder may have any suitable shape, and that its shape may vary along its length, as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a user assembles the example pet toy by inserting a base of a chew into the chew holder opening formed by upper portion <b>110</b> of chew holder <b>100</b>. The user then inserts the chew, followed by chew holder <b>100</b>, through bottom opening <b>170</b> in ball <b>150</b> so that the body of the chew extends outside of ball <b>150</b> through top opening <b>160</b> (e.g., as shown by chew <b>190</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The user then attaches chew holder <b>100</b> to ball <b>150</b>, e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> by turning the threads of bottom portion <b>120</b> of chew holder <b>100</b> into the threads of bottom opening <b>170</b>. Disassembly is performed by the opposite sequence of steps. This disclosure contemplates that, for other embodiments, some of the steps may be different than those described above. For example, when an upper portion of a chew holder is a platform for supporting a base of a chew, a user may first insert the chew through the bottom and top openings of a ball, and then insert the chew holder through the bottom opening to support the base of the chew and, in some embodiments, compress the base of the chew against the inner surface of the ball.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrate a pet toy as having a single chew holder for holding a single chew, this disclosure contemplates that a pet toy may have more than one chew and/or may have more than one chew holder. For example, a bone-shaped pet toy may have multiple chew holders, each holding a chew, arranged perpendicular to the length of the bone. As another example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, chew holder <b>320</b> may be a y-shaped chew holder, capable of supporting a chew at each end of the &#x201c;y,&#x201d; and instead of a single top hole <b>310</b> the toy may have a hole associated with each chew in the outer surface of the ball. This disclosure contemplates that a pet toy may not be limited to a single chew holder and a single chew.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a pet toy with a chew holder. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a pet toy includes a ball <b>300</b> that includes an upper portion <b>302</b> and a lower portion <b>304</b>. Unlike the ball illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in which ball <b>150</b> is a single component (e.g., is molded into a single piece), the ball of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes two subcomponents that can be disassembled and reassembled along seams <b>306</b>. For example, seams <b>306</b> may include threads that allow a user to screw and unscrew upper portion <b>302</b> and lower portion <b>304</b> from each other. Similarly, seams <b>306</b> may include components for snapping and unsnapping upper portion <b>302</b> from lower portion <b>304</b>. This disclosure contemplates that any suitable mechanisms may be used for separating a pet toy, such as the ball of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, into separate components. Moreover, while the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates each of upper portion <b>302</b> and lower portion <b>304</b> as a half-sphere, this disclosure contemplates that subcomponents of a pet toy may take other shapes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, pet toy <b>300</b> includes a chew holder <b>320</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, chew holder <b>320</b> is affixed to lower portion <b>304</b> of ball <b>300</b>. Thus, unlike ball <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the ball of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> does not have a bottom opening.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a user may remove upper portion <b>302</b> from lower portion <b>304</b> to reveal a permanently affixed chew holder <b>320</b>, insert the chew into or onto the holder, feed the chew through top opening <b>310</b>, and reassemble upper portion <b>302</b> to lower portion <b>304</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a chew would extend from top opening <b>310</b> of ball <b>300</b>. As explained above, the base of the chew is large enough relative to the diameter of top opening <b>310</b> so that it cannot be pulled out of top opening <b>310</b>. Likewise, the chew is secured to pet toy <b>300</b> by chew holder <b>320</b>. For example, chew holder <b>320</b> may include a surface on which the base of the chew rests when inserted into pet toy <b>300</b>, or chew holder <b>320</b> may include an opening (e.g., similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), for holding the base of a chew. As explained above, assembled pet toy <b>300</b> ensures that a chew cannot be removed from pet toy <b>300</b> and that a pet cannot access a small portion of a chew that presents a choking hazard. For example, a pet reducing a chew used in connection with pet toy <b>300</b> can only reduce the chew to flush with the upper surface of upper portion <b>302</b> formed by top opening <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As explained above, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates pet toy <b>300</b> as being a ball, this disclosure contemplates a pet toy may take any suitable shape. Likewise, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates chew holder <b>320</b> as being permanently affixed to pet toy <b>300</b>, this disclosure contemplates that chew holder <b>320</b> may be a removable component from a pet toy, e.g., a chew holder that removably slides over a post affixed with ball <b>300</b>. As explained above, this disclosure contemplates that top opening <b>310</b>, a chew, and a chew holder <b>320</b> may take any suitable shape, provided that the base of the chew is larger than top opening <b>310</b> so that the base of the chew cannot be pulled from the pet toy through top opening <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates upper portion <b>302</b> and lower portion <b>304</b> of ball <b>300</b> as attaching via seams <b>306</b>, this disclosure contemplates that upper portion <b>302</b> and lower portion <b>304</b> may additionally or alternatively attach via threads on the upper portion of the outer surface of chew holder <b>320</b> and threads on the inner surface of top opening <b>310</b> of upper portion <b>302</b>. In these embodiments, the base of the chew would sit below the upper portion of chew holder <b>320</b>.
