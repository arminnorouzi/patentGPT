In particular, drive-through systems for optimizing time, space and service of drive-through operations of quick-service restaurants and methods of using the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Quick service restaurant (QSR) establishments are designed to offer an alternative to home cooking and fine dining at restaurants. QSRs have limited menus and rarely provide table service by a waitstaff at a diner's table. The four core service elements of a QSR are convenience, affordability, predictability and speed. The element of speed was exponentially expanded when customers could order and receive their menu selections without ever leaving their cars and could select, order and pick up their food items in the drive-through lane of a QSR. Today, the greatest portion of a QSR business comes from its drive-through lane and QSRs have become commonly known as fast-food restaurants. The speed of service measured between the moment cars enter the drive-through lane and the moment they exit, (referred to herein in some examples and figures as the Origin-Destination Vector or O-D Vector) became the major platform on which QSR brands competed with each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The three core business elements of a QSR are profitability, volume and customer satisfaction. A typical QSR runs on thin profit margins; therefore, to be profitable high volume sales are needed, which are largely driven by repeat customers. Customer satisfaction is thus of utmost importance. Today, customers judge QSR brands based on their overall experience, no longer just speed. Finding a formula that squares all the four core elements of service with the three core business elements in a satisfactory manner and for all stakeholders has proven to be elusive. Customers are increasingly feeling entitled to better-quality food and thus have added a fifth element for QSRs to meet&#x2014;customer satisfaction. In addition, this demand for higher-quality food has put pressure on the profitability of QSR establishments. This in turn resulted in ever-changing, more unpredictable menu items as QSRs are continuing to seek a balance between profitability for themselves and affordability for their customers. At the same time, higher-quality food items often require longer preparation times resulting in increased wait times for customers, including drive-through wait times which has negatively impacted the perception of convenience, the core attraction of a QSR.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one implementation, the present disclosure is directed to a quick service restaurant (QSR). The QSR includes a building, a point of sale (POS) apparatus, a pickup window, and a drive through for routing customer vehicles from the POS apparatus to the pickup window; and a carwash system that includes at least one automatic carwash apparatus; wherein the drive through includes an optional carwash portion that routes at least a portion of the customer vehicles to the automatic carwash apparatus to provide an optional carwash service to the customer vehicles while the customer vehicles are in the drive through and en route to the pickup window; wherein the POS apparatus includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays a plurality of QSR menu items, a plurality of carwash menu items, and at least one time prediction display portion, wherein the at least one time prediction display portion displays a predicted impact on a drive through wait time due to the addition of one of the carwash menu items to a selection of one or more of the QSR menu items.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another implementation, the present disclosure is directed to a method of providing a quick service restaurant (QSR) food item and a carwash service at a facility that includes a drive through. The method includes displaying, on a point of sale (POS) graphical user interface (GUI), a plurality of QSR menu items and a plurality of carwash menu items; in response to a customer selection of one of the carwash menu items and one of the QSR menu items, directing a customer vehicle to an automatic carwash apparatus for receipt of a carwash service and upon completion of the carwash service, directing the customer vehicle to a pickup window for receipt of the QSR menu item; and in response to a customer selection of only one or more of the QSR menu items, directing a customer vehicle to bypass the automatic carwash apparatus and go directly to the pickup window.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the purpose of illustrating the disclosure, the drawings show aspects of one or more embodiments of the disclosure.

id="p-0046" num="0045">Aspects of the present disclosure include methods for utilizing the wait time and space of a brick-and-mortar QSR to incorporate car wash (CW) services to the presentation of options to a customer at a drive through QSR establishment. In some examples, a wait time includes, but is not limited to, the time period between ordering a product at a point of sale (POS) terminal, device, or application, and receiving the product at a pick-up window (PUW). Systems of the present disclosure include systems for the control of drive-through operations of a QSR establishment that, in some examples, also includes a CW service, in some examples, a CW system is configured to wash a vehicle within the wait time for a food order and in the available space of a QSR, for example a drive-through lane of a QSR. In some examples, traffic management and routing systems at the QSR facility facilitate routing of customer vehicles in a variety of manners including separating customers that have elected to order only food from customers that have ordered food and a carwash, and facilitating the flow of customer vehicles, including the efficient flow of a plurality of customer vehicles that have chosen a car wash to ensure each customer's carwash is complete and each customer has received his or her food order in a minimum amount of time, and in some examples, in the same amount of time as if the customer had not obtained a carwash. In some examples, systems, apparatuses and methods are provided for optimizing the prime real estate and customer experiences of QSR establishment.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of an example system <b>100</b> made in accordance with the present disclosure that includes both a QSR <b>102</b> and a CW system <b>104</b> and that is designed and configured to efficiently provide both food and carwash services in an efficient manner and with an efficient use of commercial real-estate space to thereby provide a combination of services that are superior to prior art QSR and CW systems. In the illustrated example, system <b>100</b> includes a POS <b>106</b> that may include a user interface <b>108</b> for displaying a plurality of options to a customer including QSR food options, CW options, and combinations thereof, and receiving customer order information. System <b>100</b> may also include a traffic management system <b>110</b> for managing vehicle traffic. In some examples, system <b>100</b> may be configured to communicate with one or more user devices <b>112</b>, for example to provide functions similar to POS <b>106</b>, such as to display QSR and CW options and receive customer orders via a user interface <b>114</b>. Implementations include receipt of customer orders via user device <b>112</b> through the execution of a POS mobile application <b>116</b> stored on and executed by the user device, and/or via a web application executed by the user device <b>112</b>. System <b>100</b> may also include at least one server device <b>118</b> which may be a computing device configured to provide one or more control functions for any of the components of system <b>100</b>. In some examples, server device <b>118</b> includes a QSR-CW integration module <b>120</b> which may include instructions for receiving data and providing instructions to other components of system <b>100</b> for coordinating the efficient provision of food and carwash services. Server device <b>118</b> may also include a time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> with instructions for receiving data, such as real time data from QSR <b>102</b>, carwash system <b>104</b>, and traffic management system <b>110</b>, as well as historical data <b>124</b> stored in a database <b>126</b> for dynamically determining an estimated amount of time it will take QSR <b>102</b> to prepare one or more food items, an estimated amount of time it will take carwash system <b>104</b> to perform a carwash service, and displaying time predictions to a customer, for example via user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The components of system <b>100</b> may be configured to communicate with other components of the system via a network <b>130</b> which may have any configuration and topology known in the art. For example, network <b>130</b> can include direct device to device communication as well as any suitable public and/or private communications network such as a private local area network (LAN) operatively coupled to a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet. In some cases, network <b>130</b> may include one or more second-generation (2G), third-generation (3G), and/or fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication technologies. In some cases, network <b>130</b> may include a wireless local area network (WLAN) (e.g., Wi-Fi wireless data communication technologies). In some instances, network <b>130</b> may include Bluetooth wireless data communication technologies. In some cases, network <b>130</b> may include supporting infrastructure and/or functionalities, such as a server and a service provider. The components of system <b>100</b> may include communication modules for wired and wireless communication and be configured for communication with other components, for example through across network <b>130</b>, utilizing any wired and/or wireless communications protocols known in the art, including, for example, a Wi-Fi protocol, a Bluetooth protocol, RFID technology and protocols, near field communication (NFC) technology and protocols, and/or a ZigBee protocol, etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">POS <b>106</b> may have a variety of configurations known in the art of POS systems and in one implementation may be a computing device located proximate the entrance of a drive through lane and user interface <b>108</b> may include a graphical display for displaying QSR menu items and CW menu items. In some examples, POS <b>106</b> may receive real-time data from other components of system <b>100</b> and be configured to display time information associated with various menu items. In some examples, POS <b>106</b> may be configured to display or otherwise identify one or more CW services that can be received without delaying the time to receive a food item, and/or display an additional amount of time to receive a CW service relative to the amount of time it would take to just receive a given food item without the CW service. Similarly, POS <b>106</b> may be configured to display or otherwise identify one or more food items that can be received without delaying the time to complete a CW service and/or display an additional amount of time to receive a CW service relative to the amount of time it would take to just receive a given food item.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, substantially the same user selections and functionality provided by POS <b>106</b> may be provided via user device <b>112</b>. For example, a user may make a series of selections via user interface <b>114</b> while en-route to the QSR <b>102</b> and CW system <b>104</b>, where user interface <b>114</b> may include a display of user control elements and information associated with QSR <b>102</b> and CW system <b>104</b>, such as QSR and CW menu items and time information to assist a user in his or her selection of items. User device <b>112</b> may be configured to display POS menu items via a web browser and/or via a mobile app downloaded to the user device as is known in the art. User device <b>112</b> may be any type of computing device known in the art, such as a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, smartwatch, etc. User interface <b>108</b> and user interface <b>112</b> may have any feature of user interfaces known in the art, including a display screen for providing a graphical user interface including a touch and pressure-sensitive display for displaying graphical user control elements, receiving user control inputs and measuring a pressure of a user's touch on the display, and one or more hard control elements, such as buttons, switches, dials, etc. for receiving user controls.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, after making a selection via a user device <b>112</b> while en-route to a QSR <b>102</b>, a user may provide an arrival indication to system <b>100</b> when the user has arrived at the drive through lane so that the user's food items can be prepared by the QSR <b>102</b> and, if applicable, traffic management system <b>110</b> can route the user to CW system <b>104</b> and otherwise track a status of the user as his or her vehicle progresses through a drive through lane. System <b>100</b> may be configured to receive an arrival signal that the customer has arrived at the drive though in any of a variety of ways. For example, by receiving a user selection via user interface <b>114</b>, such as a user selection of an &#x201c;I'm here!&#x201d; user control element displayed on a touch screen display of user interface <b>114</b>. In other examples, after completing an order, the user may receive a unique machine readable symbol, such as a QR code or bar code that is associated with the user's order that the user may display at POS <b>106</b> when he arrives. For example, a user may be instructed to hold his phone up to a camera of the POS <b>106</b> so a QR code displayed on user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b> can be imaged and read by the POS. In yet other examples, the customer may provide a license plate number and a vehicle identification sensor (one of vehicle sensors <b>134</b>) located at a drive though entrance may be configured to capture images of vehicle license plates, process the images with a machine vision algorithm and recognize when a vehicle with the user-provided license plate number has arrived.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Traffic management system <b>110</b> may be configured to route car traffic through one or more drive through lanes and provide real-time data to other components of system <b>100</b>, such as data on a current location of vehicles in the drive though lanes. In one example, traffic management system includes moveable gates <b>132</b>, vehicle sensors <b>134</b>, and directional signals <b>136</b> which may be controlled by one or more computing devices operably coupled to traffic management system <b>110</b>. In one example, one or more of gates <b>132</b> and directional signals <b>136</b> are configured to instruct vehicles to move or stop and to direct vehicles to one or more drive through lanes. Vehicle sensors <b>134</b> may be located at a plurality of locations throughout a drive though lane and be configured to detect the presence of a vehicle at a particular location. Vehicle sensors <b>134</b> may include any of a variety of sensor types known in the art, including any type of proximity or presence sensor such as one or more of light sensors, acoustic sensors, photo-resistor and temperature sensors, proximity and infrared (IR) transceivers, ultrasonic and infrared distance sensors, laser range sensors, encoders, stereo cameras, and pressure sensors for detecting the presence of a vehicle. Vehicle sensors <b>134</b> may also include identification sensors for determining identification information for a particular vehicle or customer associated with the vehicle. In some examples, a vehicle identification sensor may be located at the entrance of a drive though lane for checking each vehicle for identification information and comparing detected information to customer data <b>138</b> stored in database <b>126</b>, for example, for identifying user preferences and modifying a display of items on POS <b>106</b>. In some examples, customers may be provided with a unique identification number that can be detected by vehicle sensors <b>134</b> as the vehicle progresses through a drive though lane. Any of a variety of techniques may be used to facilitate user ID tracking as the user progresses through a drive through lane. For example, user device <b>112</b> may be configured to continuously transmit a unique identification number via a wireless communication protocol, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, NFC, or ZigBee, etc. while the user progresses through a drive through lane and vehicle sensors <b>134</b> located along the drive through lane may be configured to detect the unique customer signals and transmit the detected signals to, e.g., server device <b>118</b> for tracking a status of customers in the drive through lane. In other examples, customers may be given disposable RFID or NFC tags when they are at POS <b>106</b> that include a securing element for temporarily securing the tag to the vehicle, such as by a clip, magnet, or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">CW system <b>104</b> may include one or more CW modules <b>140</b> configured to wash one or more cars. CW module(s) <b>140</b> may be permanently or temporarily installed, may be configured to connect to local utilities, such as electrical, water, and sewer, or may be self-supporting for one or more of electrical, water, and sewer. CW modules <b>140</b> may include any type of CW system known in the art, such as in-bay, tunnel, contact, and/or touchless carwash system. In some implementations, CW modules <b>140</b> may include one or more mobile CW modules configured to move along a drive through lane of a QSR and/or configured to be transported to and from QSR locations. In some implementations, CW modules <b>140</b> include transportable standalone systems that can be quickly and easily installed at a QSR and operate without requiring hookup to one or more utilities typically needed by a CW system, such as water supply, electrical supply, and/or water disposal. CW system <b>104</b> may be configured to transmit status information to other components of system <b>100</b>, including server device <b>118</b> for providing status information, such as whether each CW module <b>140</b> is idle, loading a new vehicle, car wash in progress, or unloading a vehicle and details on a wash cycle being performed, such as type of wash, percent complete, and time remaining.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">QSR <b>102</b> may be any type of QSR known in the art and in the illustrated example includes a kitchen management system <b>142</b> configured to receive orders from POS <b>106</b> and/or user device <b>112</b> and track the status of preparation of each order via inputs from QSR staff. QSR <b>102</b> also includes an inventory management system <b>144</b> that is operably coupled to kitchen management system <b>142</b> and provides a current status of inventory for each ingredient of each QSR menu item. QSR <b>102</b> may also include any other component typically found at a QSR, such as any type of kitchen equipment for storing and cooking food, including ovens, fryers, prep stations, refrigerators and freezers, etc. (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Server device <b>118</b> may be configured to send and receive data from one or more components of system <b>100</b> and provide control signals to one or more components of the system. For example, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may be configured to calculate a time duration for preparation of any combination of items on a QSR menu and may be configured to calculate a time duration for the execution of any carwash service made available by CW system <b>104</b>. In one example, time prediction calculations may be based on historical data <b>124</b> as well as real time information from the components of system <b>100</b>. Historical data <b>124</b> may include historical time duration data from prior instances of preparing each QSR menu item and for executing each CW service. In addition to time durations, the historical data <b>124</b> may also include additional data that is associated with each time duration value, such as time of day, day of the year, weather conditions, staffing level, etc. when the prior QSR meu item was prepared or CW service performed and that is associated with the time duration data and that can be used to predict future time durations. Historical data <b>124</b> may also include nominal or baseline expected time durations for each QSR and CW menu item. Real time data may include any real time data provided by the components of system, such as, time of day, day of the year, current weather conditions, current staffing level. Real time data may also include real time food order que information for QSR <b>102</b> and CW system <b>104</b> which may include a number of orders in que and a status of each order, (for example, not yet started, in progress, complete and at pickup window, delivered). Time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may also be configured to compare que information to inventory information from inventory management system <b>144</b> to predict inventory shortages and compare status information from kitchen management system <b>142</b> to que information to predict preparation time. For example, if a particular piece of kitchen equipment, such as a deep fryer or oven is currently being used and will be required for a number of items in the que, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may use that information to calculate an increased time duration for a subsequent order that also requires the same kitchen equipment and a shorter time duration for an item that only requires a piece of kitchen equipment that is idle or further from full capacity. Time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may also be configured to receive real time data from CW system <b>104</b> and que information to calculate a time duration prediction for CW services. For example, as the number of vehicles in que and the anticipated time duration of each service increases, the predicted time duration for the next customer to receive a particular CW service may be increased, according to a capacity of the CW system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may be configured with one or more artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms for learning from historical data <b>124</b> to determine a predicted time duration. In some examples, machine learning algorithms include one or more models that may utilize training instances to provide a time prediction. Machine learning broadly refers to utilizing algorithms to learn from data and identify and compare patterns in data. A variety of different types of machine learning techniques may be employed in embodiments of the present disclosure. Non-limiting examples of machine learning techniques that may be employed include decision tree and association rule learning, supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised learning, and classification, regression, and clustering techniques, among others. One example implementation utilizes supervised classifier machine learning models and algorithms. In some examples, supervised learning models utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) may be used. As will be appreciated, these models are merely provided by way of example and other machine learning techniques may also be utilized to provide a digital impairment assessment in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may be configured to learn from historical data <b>124</b> to train one or more classifiers and learn from the data and provide a time prediction based on the machine learning classifiers that, in some examples, are continuously updated with information as new data is received. In some examples, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may be configured to leverage both supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence and classification and clustering methods to calculate time predictions. Artificial intelligence, classification, and clustering methods may include but are not limited to: logistic regression, decision trees, and neural network models in which previously captured/collected or existing historical data and also aggregate or larger scale time performance data from other locations is utilized in the time prediction analysis.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, an order and fulfillment process within an O-D Vector may include, when a vehicle arrives at a QSR premises, the guest vehicle is recognized, for example, by a vehicle sensor <b>134</b>, and the information compared to customer data <b>138</b> in database <b>126</b>, where customer name and/or preferences have been recorded and which could be displayed upon approach to the POS <b>106</b> on user interface <b>108</b>. The vehicle recognition process may also include checking database <b>126</b> to determine if an order has already been remotely ordered, for example, via POS application <b>116</b> and user device <b>112</b>, where vehicle registration may be part of the order and payment transaction. The order can be automatically displayed on the POS screen of POS <b>106</b> and QSR <b>102</b> may begin the food preparation sequence. In one example, throughout the day, the wait time (also referred to herein as the dwell time) of cars can be monitored and recorded by a series of vehicle identification sensors (SVI), vehicle recognition sensors (SVR) and vehicle detections sensors (SVD). In one example, one or more sensors and methods of use described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,488,723, titled &#x201c;Method and system of controlling a Drive-through operation of a quick-service restaurant,&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, may be used. POS <b>106</b> may be configured to display a customer's order together with projected wait time, but also together with a projected wait time for the same food item in combination with a carwash. The customer's selections, including choice of carwash from the carwash menu and/or choice of food item from the food menu is communicated to other components of the system, including CW system <b>104</b>, QSR <b>102</b>, server device <b>118</b>. In response to receipt of the user selections, server device <b>118</b> may send control signals to traffic management system <b>110</b> to direct and monitor the customer vehicle through the drive through so the guests arrive at the food pickup location with or without a car wash when their food is fully prepared and ready for pick up.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart for one example method <b>200</b> of using a system, such as system <b>100</b> that includes both QSR and CW components. In the illustrated example, at block <b>201</b>, a vehicle enters the QSR environment and at block <b>203</b> the vehicle proceeds to an ordering point such as a window or standalone POS kiosk (e.g., POS <b>106</b>), where orders and choices are made. In examples where a user had previously placed an order, for example via user device <b>112</b>, the user can indicate his or her arrival when he or she has arrived at the ordering point. At the ordering station, in some examples, a vehicle recognition system using, e.g., vehicle sensors <b>134</b>, may recognize the customer's preferences which become part of the overall order. At block <b>205</b>, the user considers the options presented to him at POS <b>106</b>, including time duration information, which may be determined by server device <b>118</b>, and in the illustrated example, decides whether to only order food or to also order a carwash. At block <b>207</b>, the customer has elected to proceed into the drive-through lane and simply wait for the QSR food items and the vehicle enters a dedicated food pickup lane before arriving, at block <b>209</b>, at a QSR food pick-up window and then at block <b>211</b>, exiting the facility. On the other hand, if at block <b>205</b> the customer elected to utilize the dwell time while waiting for her food items to be prepared, at block <b>213</b> the vehicle first enters into a carwash lane and at block <b>215</b> proceeds into the vehicle carwash, e.g., one of CW modules <b>140</b>, before arriving at the QSR pick-up window at block <b>209</b> and exiting at block <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of another example method <b>300</b> of using a system, such as system <b>100</b>, that includes both QSR and CW components. In the illustrated example, at block <b>301</b>, a vehicle enters a QSR environment and at block <b>303</b>, a plurality of sensors, such as vehicle identification (SVI) sensors, vehicle recognition (SVR) sensors, and/or vehicle detection (SVD) sensors are deployed. In one example, SVI, SVR, and SVD sensors are examples of vehicle sensors <b>134</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In one implementation, a SVI sensor may include a license plate recognition sensor will first enter the vehicle into a database, e.g., in customer data <b>138</b> of database <b>126</b>, with a time and date stamp and determine whether the vehicle information is already stored in customer data <b>138</b> and if the customer data includes customer preferences, and if so, display the previously stored customer preferences on a POS display, e.g., user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). At block <b>305</b> the vehicle moves forward and at block <b>307</b> arrives at a menu display offering both QSR menu items and carwash options and at block <b>309</b>, the customer makes one or more selections. In one implementation, all along the physical path of the drive-through lane, as the vehicle proceeds forward, vehicle detection sensors monitor the vehicle's progress with the aid of a plurality of SVD sensors, which may include, for example, one or more of light sensors, acoustic sensors, photo-resistor and temperature sensors, proximity and infrared (IR) transceivers, ultrasonic and infrared distance sensors, laser range sensors, encoders, stereo cameras, and pressure sensors. Each sensor may be configured to transmit sensor data by wired and/or wireless communication to a computing device, such as server device <b>118</b> and/or a computing device of traffic management system <b>110</b>. As traffic moves through the O-D Vector, the server device <b>118</b> and/or traffic management system <b>110</b> may receive information of the progress of both the food preparation and carwash service in real time and in real time together with the vehicle progress in the drive-through lane and convert the information into vehicle guidance paradigms. This may include directional lights and traffic lights and directional voice commands and in some examples, a physical barrier such as a movable gate for directing traffic.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At block <b>307</b> an ordering window may be presented where customers place their orders and payments are made to a QSR employee operating a POS device such as POS device <b>106</b>, or customers may directly place orders on the POS ordering device with automated payment, e.g., credit card payment capabilities. The POS device may include a screen on which the QSR menu items are displayed, together with the carwash options, and may include the estimated time of completing the O-D Vector of each selection. A car recognition device (SVR), through contact with a server, e.g. server device <b>118</b>, may be configured to verify if an order and payment have been made through an app or via the internet or LAN. Upon completion of the order transaction, at block <b>311</b> customers can be directed via a directional traffic light, possibly combined, at block <b>313</b> with a voice command to the appropriate lane corresponding to their orders. At block <b>315</b>, a physical barrier, such as an automatic gate, may help prevent the vehicle going in the wrong lane, while opening the appropriate available lane. In one example, the physical barrier has a design and construction similar to physical barriers used for toll booths and parking garages.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At block <b>317</b>, for QSR food orders only, where the customer chooses to not purchase a carwash, the customer proceeds to a food only traffic lane. At blocks <b>319</b>-<b>325</b>, recognized by SVRs, that the car is proceeding toward the food pick-up window and a directional lights can help assist the driver and traffic flow to arrive, at block <b>327</b>, at the pick-up window. Returning to block <b>315</b>, for customers who elected to utilize their anticipated dwell time by having their car washed, they proceed after ordering, at blocks <b>329</b>-<b>337</b> to a carwash lane assisted by recognition devices, directional lights and gates before being allowed to enter a vehicle carwash at block <b>339</b>. In some examples, at block <b>341</b>, while moving automatically through the carwash, the customers will be able to see the progress of their carwash, and in some examples, communication screens will also display the status of the chosen QSR menu item that will be waiting for the QSR guests once they clear the carwash, helping to increase the food anticipation. For example, a progress screen may be displayed in user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>. At blocks <b>343</b> and <b>345</b>, recognition devices, gates, and directional lights may be configured to confirm the car has exited the carwash and guide the freshly cleaned cars to a pick-up window at <b>327</b>. In one example, both types of customers exit the QSR facility, their overall dwell times monitored by the system until they exit at block <b>347</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one example implementation of system <b>100</b> in the form of a facility <b>400</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, a single drive through lane (DTL) surrounds a QSR which has a POS a payment window (Q<b>1</b>) and an order pick-up window Q<b>2</b>. Facility <b>400</b> also includes an in-bay carwash (IBW) which includes a space (also referred to as a bay) that is configured to receive a vehicle, and the vehicle remains stationary in the bay during the wash; wash apparatuses circle the car in a friction, and/or frictionless manner. The DTL includes a primary drive through lane <b>402</b> and a secondary drive through lane <b>404</b>, wherein the secondary drive through lane extends from a lane divergence location <b>406</b> of the primary drive through lane, through the at least one automatic carwash apparatus (IBW), to a lane merge location <b>408</b> of the primary drive through lane. The secondary drive through lane <b>404</b> is an example of an optional carwash portion that routes at least a portion of the customer vehicles to the automatic carwash apparatus (IBW) to provide an optional carwash service to the customer vehicles while the customer vehicles are in the drive through and en route to the pickup window Q<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, both vehicle A and B have crossed the edge of the QSR establishment (ENT) and arrived at the POS. Both vehicles may have been advised on the POS screen of the anticipated dwell time associated with a decision. Upon learning the information, vehicle B only orders food items at the POS from the QSR menu, while vehicle A chooses to order both a food item as well as a carwash. An SVI identifies the different cars. SVDs monitor the progress of the vehicles through the DTL. After the POS station, both cars arrive at a SVR that directs vehicles through a directional signal (LD) to either go left around the QSR to pick up the food items at Q<b>2</b> via payment at Q<b>1</b>, or go further to enter the carwash (IBW). An SVI in front of the carwash has identified the car and the carwash options chosen, checked the availability of the carwash, and coordinates with the automatic doors (aD) of the IBW. Vehicle type A is then directed out of the carwash (IBW) and instructed to merge with vehicle B traffic in the food pick up drive-through lane through the use of traffic lights (LT) controlled by a traffic management system (e.g., traffic management system <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Facility <b>400</b> is configured to coordinate the preparation of food items for both vehicle types A and B, with the food preparation time and the carwash timing. Vehicle B may provide payment for the carwash either at POS and payment option (PA) or at a separate POS/PA located in or proximate IBW. In examples where ordering and payment is made at the drive through entrance, SVI may be configured to recognize the vehicle and associate each vehicle with its CW order.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another example, instead of ordering at the POS and paying soon after, customers can push a button at the POS where they receive a small mobile ordering device (MOD) which functions as a wireless POS. While proceeding in the DTL, customers can place their orders. Each MOD may be configured for wireless communication with a server device such as server device <b>118</b> and/or position sensors located along DTL to receive customer orders and track a position of a customer vehicle along the DTL. Orders may be made until a certain point in the DTL where vehicles are either directed to make their orders and proceed or are instructed to take an off-ramp. Payment can be made by credit card or at the food pick up window. To keep a constant supply of MODs available, the POS is constantly fed with sufficient MOD devices by way of a delivery system, for example, using pneumatic tubing. In another example, customers return the MOD at the pickup window and a QSR employee physically places the MOD device in a receptacle of the POS device located inside the QSR. In another example customers may also by-pass the POS ordering station, without picking up a MOD, if they are already part of QSR membership program allowed to make their orders using their mobile devices (e.g., user device <b>112</b>) while in the DTL. In yet another example, a customer can make an order via an app on their mobile phone while waiting in the DTL or carwash.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>500</b> configured to be displayed on user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>. In the illustrated example, GUI <b>500</b> is configured to display a plurality of QSR menu items <b>502</b><i>a</i>-<b>502</b><i>g </i>and each menu item includes a user control element <b>504</b> for selecting a number of each item, an item type display portion <b>506</b> for displaying the type of item, a price display portions <b>508</b><i>a </i>and <b>508</b><i>b </i>for dynamically updating total cost according to the number of items selected. GUI <b>500</b> also includes a predicted time display portion <b>510</b> that includes a plurality of time prediction display portions <b>510</b><i>a</i>-<b>510</b><i>g </i>for displaying a predicted time duration for preparation of the QSR menu item as well as a total time display portion <b>512</b> that displays a total predicted preparation time to prepare all food items. GUI <b>500</b> may be configured to communicate in real time with server device <b>118</b> and display continuously updated time predictions in time display portion <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> according to, for example, calculations performed by time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the illustrated example, a customer has selected seven different menu items and GUI <b>500</b> is configured to display in predicted time display portion <b>510</b> a predicted duration of time to prepare each item. In the illustrated example, server device <b>118</b> and/or POS <b>106</b> is also configured to utilize information from QSR <b>102</b> and historical data <b>124</b> to account for concurrent preparation of multiple items <b>502</b>. For example, the total predicted time displayed in total time display portion <b>512</b> in the illustrated example is only six minutes (360 seconds) even though the cumulative time to individually prepare each of the seven items is approximately 18 minutes. Thus, in the illustrated example, POS <b>106</b> may consider concurrent order fulfilment methods. Server device <b>118</b> may, for example, take into consideration that some items may be prepared at the same time, while other items of the order may need to be added to the workflow. In the illustrated example, display portion <b>510</b><i>a </i>indicates it will take 280 seconds for a single hamburger to be completed, however, if another menu item is selected that could be prepared concurrently with the hamburger, for example, using the same kitchen equipment, such as another hamburger or a chicken sandwich, total time display portion <b>512</b> may remain the same or only slightly increase even though 280-285 seconds may also be required to prepare the second hamburger or chicken sandwich. GUI <b>500</b> may be configured to dynamically update the time predictions displayed in display portions <b>510</b> and <b>512</b> as the user increases or decreases a number of food items <b>502</b> and as conditions at the QSR change.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, POS <b>106</b> and server device <b>118</b> may utilize real time data including que information regarding previously received orders that are in progress, and the status of kitchen equipment and inventory received from kitchen management system <b>142</b> and inventory management system <b>144</b> to modify a predicted preparation time displayed on GUI <b>500</b>. For example, an additional order of french fries <b>502</b><i>d </i>may normally have increased the time prediction displayed in display portion <b>510</b><i>d </i>by only the predicted amount of time to load french fries into a second container if data from kitchen management system <b>142</b> and/or inventory management system <b>144</b> indicates there is a sufficient quantity of cooked french fries available. However, if kitchen management system <b>142</b> and/or inventory management system <b>144</b> indicates additional french fries will need to be freshly made to fulfill a second order because, for example, a comparison of preceding orders in que to a current inventory of cooked french fries indicates more will need to be cooked. In this instance, a small additional french fries order may result in a greater amount of time added to time display portions <b>510</b><i>d </i>and <b>512</b> thereby forewarning the customer when he or she is ordering at POS <b>106</b>, which may help adjust service expectations and reduce possible disappointment at the final pick up window when the total wait time in the drive-through lane is longer than average.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>600</b> configured to be displayed on user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>. In the illustrated example, GUI <b>600</b> is configured to display a plurality of QSR menu items QM<b>01</b>-QM<b>07</b> and a plurality of CW menu items CW<b>01</b>-CW<b>07</b>. Each of the QSR menu items and CW menu items are graphically displayed soft user control elements and configured to be selectable by a user pressing the touch-sensitive display where the corresponding user control element is displayed. GUI <b>600</b> also includes a total QSR time prediction display portion TD<b>1</b> and a total QSR and CW time prediction display portion TTD<b>2</b> for conveying to the customer how a total wait time may be impacted by adding or removing QSR items and by adding or removing CW menu items. The time predictions may be determined using any of the techniques and methodologies disclosed herein, including by calculations performed by time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As in other examples described herein, the time predictions displayed in display portions TD<b>1</b> and TTD<b>2</b> may be dynamically updated according to user selections and real time data from the system. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, GUI <b>600</b> may include additional display portions and user control elements as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for allowing the user to select a number of each item and for displaying a price of each item. GUI <b>600</b> also includes a first confirm or order button CF<b>1</b> for ordering just food and a second confirm or order button CF<b>2</b> for ordering both food and a carwash. Thus, GUI <b>600</b> is designed and configured to communicate whether adding a carwash to a food order will increase a total wait time utilizing, in some examples, advanced time prediction techniques disclosed herein to provide an intelligent and real time prediction of an estimated wait time. In the illustrated example, GUI <b>600</b> indicates a total predicted wait time will be 234 seconds to receive a food order and only an additional 21 seconds to also obtain a car wash, which may encourage the customer to add a car wash to his or her order.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates another example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>700</b> configured to be displayed on user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>.

In the illustrated example, each of the CW menu items, equal time indicators ELS and additional time displays TAS are configured to dynamically adjust display information according to a user selection of QSR menu items to convey which CW menu items will not increase a wait time. For the CW menu items where a wait time would be longer, the additional amount of time may also be displayed. In the illustrated example, a user has selected a hamburger and in response user control element QM<b>01</b> becomes highlighted and a plurality of CW control elements also become highlighted to indicate which CW options if selected would not increase the user's wait time to receive the hamburger. In the illustrated example, CW options CW<b>01</b>, CW<b>02</b>, and CW<b>03</b> are highlighted, indicating they will not add time. Equal time indicators ELS<b>1</b>-ELS<b>3</b> are also highlighted to convey CW options CW<b>01</b>-CW<b>03</b> will not add to the total wait time. Additional time displays TAS<b>4</b>-TAS<b>7</b> display a calculated time duration indicating how much each option would add to the total wait time as compared to just ordering QSR item QM<b>01</b>. A user may vary his or her selection of food items by pressing user control elements QM<b>01</b>-QM<b>07</b> and as the user adds or subtracts food items from his order, GUI <b>700</b> dynamically adjusts the display of CW menu items CW<b>01</b>-CW<b>07</b>, equal time indicators ELS<b>1</b>-ELS<b>7</b> and additional time displays TAS<b>1</b>-TAS<b>7</b> to convey how changing the food order may change the available CW items that the customer may be able to get without increasing the total wait time. GUI <b>700</b> also includes a messaging and instruction screen <b>702</b> for adding a user annotation such as special food preparation instructions and allergy information. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a user has selected user control element QM<b>01</b> (hamburger) and user control element CW<b>04</b> (deluxe carwash), time display TTD<b>1</b> indicates a predicted total wait time to receive a hamburger is 234 seconds and the predicted time to also receive a deluxe carwash is 254 seconds, or an additional 20 seconds relative to just a hamburger order or just a hamburger order combined with one or CW options CW<b>01</b>-CW<b>03</b>. The user can confirm his selection by pressing confirm button CF<b>1</b> (for just a food order) or CF<b>2</b> for hamburger and deluxe carwash.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates another example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>720</b> configured to be displayed on user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>. GUI <b>720</b> is similar to GUI <b>700</b> and includes a plurality of QSR menu items QM<b>01</b>-QM<b>07</b>, a plurality of CW menu items CW<b>01</b>-CW<b>07</b>, and a plurality additional time displays TAS<b>1</b>-TAS<b>7</b>. In the illustrated example, GUI <b>720</b> is configured to automatically suggest a type of carwash option that would result in no time penalty for a corresponding food order by highlighting only one carwash option. For example, if a customer orders only coffee, the quickest carwash type is recommended. When a customer orders a complex meal, an involved carwash that takes longer to complete is recommended. In another example, the driver of vehicle A may select a chicken sandwich (QMO<b>3</b>) from the QSR menu. A time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> may perform a time prediction calculation using any of the data and calculation techniques disclosed herein and determine that carwash treatment CW<b>02</b>, an express carwash, is the best possible carwash that will not increase the customer's wait time in a drive through lane or time to receipt of his food order. The recommendation is communicated via highlighting or flashing user control element CW<b>02</b> and the corresponding additional time display indicator TAS<b>2</b>, communicating the recommended carwash option will require zero seconds of additional wait time. Total time display TTD<b>1</b> for QSR order without a carwash and total time display with a carwash TTD<b>2</b> show the same total time. The calculated additional required time for longer duration carwash treatments CW<b>03</b>-CW<b>06</b> is displayed in the corresponding TAS indicators and the customer may choose to order one of carwash treatments CW<b>03</b>-CW<b>06</b> instead of the recommended CW<b>02</b> if, for example, he or she has enough time and/or determines the improved wash is worth the additional wait.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrates another example graphical user interface (GUI) <b>730</b> configured to be displayed on user interface <b>108</b> of POS <b>106</b> and/or user interface <b>114</b> of user device <b>112</b>.

In response to inputting a maximum time value, here 360 seconds, time prediction and time management module <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be configured to execute any of the calculation methodologies disclosed herein to calculate a predicted time duration for each of a plurality QSR menu items. In the illustrated example, GUI <b>750</b> includes a dynamic QSR menu display portion <b>758</b> that is configured to only display items from the QSR menu that can be prepared and delivered within the time specified by the customer. Thus, GUI <b>750</b> provides a simplified and user-friendly configuration showing only a subset of QSR menu items for selection by a user.

The recommendations in display portion <b>758</b> may be communicated to consumers by way of an interactive communication screen and the recommendations may be accompanied by pictures, illustrations, and details of ingredients. Some recommendations may be supported by voice recordings, personal advice from a customer service person within the establishment, and other advertising and promotional materials. Factors other than time may also be taken into account when determining the recommended combinations of menu items to display in display portion <b>758</b>. For example, customer preferences, customer order history, and customer information (such as proximity to a special even such as a birthday or anniversary) may be utilized as well as day of the year, current weather conditions, time of day.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition to or instead of QSR menu display portion <b>758</b>, GUI <b>750</b> may include a scrollable display <b>760</b> that allows a user to scroll through combinations of menu items according to a predicted time duration to prepare the menu item.

In the illustrated example, a QSR is serviced by 2 drive-through lanes (DTL<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>). Vehicle A has chosen both a carwash and a QSR item at the POS station and optional payment station (Pa). The order and payment are communicated from the POS to other components of the facility including one or more of a server device, kitchen management system and CW system (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A traffic management system directs the vehicle to proceed by way of directional light (LD) and traffic light (LT) into a second drive-through lane D<b>2</b>, when other sensors confirm that the lane is safe to enter. Vehicle detection sensors (SVD), for example, inductive and capacitive sensors and/or radar sensors, are configured to detect vehicles that are both stationary and in motion. A vehicle recognition sensor (SVR) confirms the arrival of the vehicle at the gate G and that payment has been made for the carwash and allows gate G to open the dedicated carwash lane so that the car can proceed to the in-bay automatic carwash (IBW). Vehicle detection sensor SVD coordinates with a detection sensor in the carwash to allow the car to proceed. For example, a wireless ultrasonic sensor uses sound waves mounted directly onto the ceiling of the IBW. The automatic doors aD open when the IBW is available and allows car A to enter. Meanwhile car B has chosen only to purchase a QSR item and proceeds in drive-through Lane DTL<b>1</b>. When Car A is exiting the IBW carwash, sensor C<b>1</b> for example optical sensors with an opposed mode sensor that uses the interruption of a light beam between an emitter and a receiver, communicates that the car is exiting the IBW. Traffic in DTL<b>1</b> and DTL<b>2</b> is coordinated by way of vehicle detections sensors SVD, traffic lights LT and gates G so that both vehicles A and B approach their destination within an optimum O-D vector.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>900</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>900</b> includes a plurality of carwash modules, here, three in-bay carwash modules IBW<b>1</b>-IBW<b>3</b> to maximize the number of customers that can receive a carwash without negatively impacting total wait time for any customer. Similar to other example facilities disclosed herein, the vehicle traffic pattern may be coordinated by taking into account the QSR food preparation and presentation times so that getting a car washed does not delay a QSR visit. The ability to coordinate QSR items in combination with a plurality of in-bay carwashes, allows the QSR to scale up within its own real estate as demand for its carwash services grows and traditional QSR customers can experience the same dwell time in the drive-through lanes as before any carwash services were added. In the illustrated example, after POS, vehicle B (without CW) is directed to go directly to pay and pick up the QSR orders and windows Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, and vehicle A (having ordered both QSR+CW) is directed through directional light LD<b>1</b>, sensor S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, in coordination with in-bay carwash status sensors (CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, CS<b>3</b>) to enter into drive-through lane DTL <b>2</b> and vehicle type A is directed by directional light DL<b>2</b> towards the first available in-bay carwash.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1000</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system.

In the illustrated example, a single carwash module in the form of a tunnel carwash is provided that includes a conveyor belt and is configured to concurrently wash a plurality of cars. Vehicle A (ordering QSR item+CW) and vehicle B (ordering QSR item only) are coordinated and directed by a traffic management system utilizing an extended lane. Both A and B types of vehicles place their orders at the POS and make payment, either at the credit card option Pa or payment window Q<b>1</b>. During and upon successful payment vehicles are identified as either type A or type B and provided a unique identification number, for example by any of the techniques described herein (e.g., machine vision recognition of license plate or wireless communication with a device located in the vehicle, such as a mobile phone, a temporarily loaned device or a disposable RFID tag) so that each vehicle may be guided and monitored. All vehicles proceed forward after payment and traffic is directed with the aid of sensors, directional lights and gates using any of the implementations of traffic management systems and server devices disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1200</b> that is substantially the same as facility <b>1100</b> except the QSR has 2 lanes and vehicle type A (a combination of QSR+CW) and vehicle type B (strictly QSR) are directed into separate lanes immediately after ordering which may eliminate the need to provide and track a unique vehicle identification number and provide a simplified traffic management and routing process.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1300</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system and is substantially the same in many respect to other facilities disclosed herein. In the illustrated example, facility <b>1300</b> includes a plurality of types of carwash modules, in the illustrated example, two IBWs IBW<b>2</b>) and one tunnel carwash (TCW). Vehicles are driven completely into the IBW structure and remain stationary and subsequently a carwash apparatus moves around the vehicle in the structure. In a TCW the driver gives up control of the car and the vehicle is moved through the carwash on a conveyor belt, or a chain device that moves or pulls the vehicle through the wash structure where different stationary apparatuses each with a different function come in contact with the moving vehicle. In one example, a first component may spray soap chemicals on the car, a second component may include rollers that clean with friction, a third component may contain high-pressure water hoses that spray any remaining chemicals off the vehicle and a fourth component may include high velocity blowers to dry the vehicle. The TWC requires a larger footprint than an IBW, however, it may provide a higher quality wash, and/or faster wash, and/or the capacity to wash a higher number of vehicles per unit of time as compared to a single IBW.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">By having a variety of carwash module types, facility <b>1300</b> provides greater choice to customers and also provides more flexibility for a control system of the facility to maximize the ability to provide a carwash to each customer while not exceeding the dwell time associated with a food-only order. For example an IBW may be &#x2018;touchless system&#x2019; by default, where the car is washed without physical contact by rollers simply by water, chemical, solutions, sprays and dryers. Another IBW may be dedicated to very rigorous washing desired by off-road vehicles, for example, while the TWC may offer yet other variables.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">One or more of carwash modules IBW<b>1</b>, IBW<b>2</b>, and TCW, may be housed in permanent structures, or one or more may be housed in modular transportable structures. In some examples, facilities made in accordance with the present disclosure may include transportable CW modules that can me moved according to a traffic volume of the QSR establishment. A transportable modular CW structures may provide a variety of benefits, for example, a majority, e.g., two thirds, of the investment in the carwash module can be relocated, reduced, or upgraded, leaving the permanent site work, such as drainage, in place. The type of carwash can also be more easily changed, for example, an IBW may be replaced by a tunnel as customer demand for carwash services increases. Modular transportable carwash structures may, therefore, give greater flexibility for the QSR to respond to changing market conditions.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some examples, a transportable modular CW apparatus may include a closed-loop self-contained water system that is designed to address two of the largest costs of any carwash operation, namely water and sewer costs while also meeting legal and environmental requirements regarding water usage and water discharge. In some examples, a transportable modular CW apparatus may be a self-contained system and may be designed to remove used chemical particles and suspended solids such as sand and dust from water in a water recycling system. In some examples, a transportable modular CW apparatus may be configured for biodegradable chemicals and may include a reverse osmosis and aeration system configured to process collected water to turn the water from anaerobic to aerobic thus reducing unwanted odors.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, a transportable modular CW apparatus may be configured with filters and ozone to remove odor and suspended solids and may include a system that applies cyclonic separation and bacteria to clean and recycle water. A self-contained purifying and recycling system and process allows for a fixed volume of water to be continuously re-used with minimal discharge and minimal water requirements. Such environmentally responsible business practices of conserving water and reducing waste may reduce any need for special permitting, while in addition would help to eliminate the need for an extensive utility infrastructure footprint, because the self-contained carwash system would draw water from one or more water reservoirs connected to the transportable modular CW apparatus and deliver recycled and processed water back to the reservoir for re-use. Such a system also reduces the burden on any existing municipal and regional sewage systems. Moreover such a self-contained water recycling system reduces any reliance on the water quality provided by a municipality, which may not be clean or inert enough for an optimal carwash. Such a system would also support environmentally friendly marketing and communication efforts to draw in consumers. Also, a transportable modular CW apparatus has the extra benefit that a carwash can be erected in less space, such as a QSR real estate footprint, and less time, and may be more independent of any governmental rate changes and importantly can be built without the need to special access to a substantial sanitary sewer systems on small wash sites.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A transportable modular CW apparatus may be housed in on-site erected permanent structures, in prefabricated buildings, or may be constructed in a versatile modular fashion, a method which would permit efficient erecting and, if needed, relocating a fully operational CW from one QSR to the another. Flexibility is introduced by adopting modular transportable structures, because both capacity and range of services by different types of carwashes can be upgraded or adjusted more easily such as an IBW may be replaced by a tunnel system, or a touchless system may be easily installed to replace existing roller type IBW. Moreover, two thirds of the investment in the modular carwash may be relocated, leaving only the permanent site work, such as drainage, behind.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A transportable modular carwash may be shipped to a QSR site with the equipment pre-installed within each modular section, or a fully modular equipment room may be supplied that may connect with modular sections that have the required connections such as wiring and piping so that the CW may instantly operate once connected. Modular CW structures may allow for greater quality consistency and construction and may be commenced as soon as zoning boards approve the drawings. Such off-site modular construction may begin concurrently while sites are being prepared. As zoning requirements are often regionally similar a faster roll out may be accomplished to develop a territory and the speed of staking a competitive advantage would only be limited by the availability and capability of transport vehicles capable of moving the large modular sections.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>B and <b>13</b>C</figref> illustrate one example of a transportable modular CW apparatus <b>1302</b> that is self-propelled under its own power so that it may be quickly and easily driven to a location as needed, for example at a QSR or convenience store. Such a self-propelled mobile carwash may combine the benefits of a closed water system <b>1310</b> with a fully equipped mobile section <b>1312</b>, so that the CW operations can commence, without site preparations, as soon as zoning requirements are met and as fast as the mobile unit can arrive. In some examples, a mobile carwash may be solar powered, for example with solar roof panels <b>1314</b>, and self-propelled or pulled in a truck-trailer configuration <b>1316</b> similar to a container shipment. The mobile unit may have on and off ramps <b>1318</b> or may be constructed so that the unit can be lowered to the ground for easy access of cars, with both an entrance and exit similar to an IBW or tunnel carwash (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>). In some examples, a mobile carwash may have a modular configuration, where a number of mobile units are connected to each other to expand the capacity of the carwash, or be connected to a separate equipment unit <b>1320</b>, a separate closed-loop water containment system <b>1322</b>, or for example a water tanker truck, the individual parts connected for example by way of hoses, pipes and cables <b>1324</b>, on or underground. A mobile carwash unit may also be connected or become part of existing permanent carwashes to represent an instant capacity expansion and expansion of type of services.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1400</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, vehicle A has ordered QSR items plus a carwash and vehicle B has only ordered QSR items. Here at, or near, the POS, both vehicles move onto conveyor belts C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that may have a similar construction to TCW conveyor system. A traffic management system, with the aid of a car identification sensor S<b>1</b> determines whether to convey each vehicle along conveyor C<b>1</b> or C<b>2</b> and in the illustrated example the traffic management system includes a turntable TT<b>1</b> for controlling the conveyance of a vehicle to conveyor C<b>1</b> or C<b>2</b>. In some examples a second turntable TT<b>2</b> may be used to direct a vehicle after a car wash, for example at the exit of the illustrated TCW to a common conveyor C<b>3</b> for conveying both vehicle types to payment window Q<b>1</b> and food pickup window Q<b>2</b>. The traffic management system may be configured to operate TT<b>2</b> to automatically convey vehicle A back to the common drive-through lane on conveyor C<b>3</b>, taking into account vehicle type B on conveyor C<b>1</b> (DTL<b>1</b>) for example, by way of a sensor S<b>3</b> and a gate G. The presence and number of vehicles on the conveys may be monitored by sensors which interface with the traffic management system, the traffic management system may be configured to controls a speed of conveyors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> in order to efficiently merge the two streams of traffic.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1500</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>1500</b> includes a plurality of mobile carwash pods (POD<b>1</b>, POD<b>2</b>, POD<b>3</b> and POD<b>4</b> labeled) that are configured to receive a vehicle after ordering at POS and simultaneously transport the vehicle and wash the vehicle as the vehicle is advanced along the drive through lane. In the illustrated example, each carwash pod (e.g. POD<b>1</b>-POD<b>4</b>) includes a self-contained capsule <b>1502</b> with self-supporting onboard systems <b>1504</b> for washing a vehicle. In one example, onboard systems <b>1504</b> may include one or more of water tanks, chemical and soap solution containers, and batteries. In another example, each POD may have connections to water, soap, power, etc., that allow for the POD to move while still remaining in fluid and electrical communication with the corresponding source. In one example, each POD may be continuously coupled to a drainage, for example, an open or closed ditch that extends along a path of the mobile PODs, or for example, by vacuum tubes that suck the fluids from the pod. In another example, each POD may have a waste storage tank with valves that periodically connect to a waste system, for example, after completion of a wash and prior to the commencement of a new wash. In one example, each POD may include docking valves and electric plugs. Once in position to commence a carwash, the docking valves connect with complementary valves that are connected to hoses that supply the carwash POD with water, chemical and other solutions and the plugs are automatically connected to electric sockets to supply the carwash apparatuses, lights and communication screens with power, or for example in a similar fashion as electric trams or buses, by a connecting rod to a life-wire circuit.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the illustrated example, vehicle A having ordered both a QSR item and CW service at the POS is directed into POD<b>1</b> (with carwash services inside). Vehicle A enters POD<b>1</b> and after entry a first door <b>1508</b><i>a </i>closes to secure the capsule <b>1502</b> and POD<b>1</b> begins to move. The PODs including POD<b>1</b> may be mobile by way of a conveyor belt system or via wheels operatively attached to each POD that support the POD and allow it to roll along the DTL, which may include rolling along a track the wheels are captured in. By the time the POD reaches an end point <b>1506</b> the carwash cycle is complete, a second door <b>1508</b><i>b </i>opens allowing the vehicle to exit. Vehicle B, having only ordered from the QSR menu may either drive or be conveyed along without entry into a POD where the next POD remains stationary at a location adjacent POS until a vehicle orders a CW service, or vehicle B may be instructed to enter a POD but no carwash service is activated. By providing a plurality of mobile carwash modules (PODs) facility <b>1500</b> may have a relatively high carwash capacity in a relatively small footprint, which may be particularly advantageous for locations where real estate is limited. Facility enables a high carwash capacity for a larger volume of customers while minimizing wait time to enable the provision of CW services within the time frame required to prepare QSR menu items.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> illustrates another example of a facility <b>1520</b> that includes mobile carwash pods <b>1510</b><i>a</i>-<b>15101</b> (only four labeled) wherein the pods are configured for vertical movement via an elevator mechanism, which may be especially useful for urban settings where space is limited. In one example, a choice of type of carwash is arranged in different elevators where, for example, elevator pod <b>1</b> (ELVP <b>1</b>) contains a touch free carwash, while ELVP <b>2</b> contains a friction carwash type and ELVP <b>3</b> specializes in a wax treatment and ELVP <b>4</b> is specially configured to treat vehicles with dirt, etc. After a customer makes a selection, the ELVP of choice comes into position. In another example of an ELVP arrangement vehicles ride the elevator cycle as is exemplified in ELVP <b>6</b> where vehicle V has entered the O-D vector in position ELVP<b>1</b> and rides the cycle until it is back in the same position. The O-D vector moves in a circular motion (first up, then sideways, then down again) whereby the elevator pods are fed with hoses and drainage pipes in a similar fashion as cables follow the elevator, at all times reducing the weight of the elevator carwash pod.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1600</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>1600</b> is an exemplary environment configured to optimize the O-D vector whereby the QSR and CW drive-through operations are completely separated without a confluence at a pick-up window. Carwash services are integrated into a new structural design optimizing the utilization of the QSR real-estate. In this embodiment the drive-through with carwash services becomes the center of the structure optimizing premium real-estate and offering two types of impulse purchases at once, carwash and fast-food, with equal perceived importance. Vehicle type B (ordering strictly from the QSR menu, having paid either at the POS and payment option Pa or at payment window Q<b>1</b> is directed, for example, by directional lights LD to follow the QSR traditional route, prevented by a gate G from entering the building, and directed to pick-up window Q<b>2</b><i>b </i>to pick up the food order. Vehicles A, which have ordered from the QSR menu as well as the CW menu are directed to proceed into a tunnel carwash Tn. Upon completion the QSR food items are available at pick up window Q<b>2</b><i>a</i>. The illustrated configuration makes it very apparent for vehicle A and B that they exit the QSR premises at the same, or nearly the same time, thereby encouraging the vehicle B customers to also order a carwash next time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates another example of a facility <b>1700</b> that is substantially the same as facility <b>1600</b> except for the location of the payment window Q<b>1</b> (located within the QSR structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) or outside (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1800</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, both drive-through operations are embedded inside the QSR facility. The proximity of the QSR lane DTL<b>1</b> and the QSR+carwash lane DTL<b>2</b> inside the structure further facilitates the synergism gained from combining the QSR and CW services. As 70% or more of QSR orders are typically drive-through orders, the drive-through service is the most critical and most appreciated. Moreover since the two lanes DTL<b>1</b>, DTL<b>2</b> are in closer proximity to each other, the traditional QSR customers in DTL <b>1</b> will be able to directly compare and observe that their dwell time is identical to that of customers in DTL <b>2</b> that have ordered both from the QSR menu and the carwash services. This observation may stimulate demand for additional carwash services in the future. Both types of customers can observe the inner operations of the QSR which may also stimulate demand for additional QSR items in their next visit. Drivers and passengers may chose to leave their vehicles, and allow the vehicles to proceed independently through the carwash. Upon completion of the carwash and, if applicable, having picked up their QSR orders, the drivers and passengers rejoin their vehicles.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>1900</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>1900</b> includes an underground carwash UCW which is beneficial in urban areas where a QSR may not have sufficient real estate to accommodate an above-ground carwash. The entrance to DTL<b>1</b> and DTL <b>2</b> may be essentially the same as the entrance to a parking garage that includes a ground level parking lot and an underground parking lot. A POS located upstream of DTL <b>1</b> and DTL <b>2</b> may receive the customer's orders and a traffic management system may be configured to direct the customers to the underground DTL<b>2</b> for a carwash before emerging again at ground level to merge with DTL <b>1</b> and proceed to the QSR order pickup window Q<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>2000</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>2000</b> provides various methods for paid QSR orders to be picked up in advance of a carwash and illustrates an alternate configuration where QSR food items are picked up prior to receiving a carwash. In the illustrated example, prepaid vehicle C enters the QSR premises in a traditional Drive-through lane (DTL<b>1</b>) and is identified by the vehicle recognition sensor (SVR). At the time of ordering, vehicle type C has also supplied the QSR with an expected time of arrival (ETA) and QSR has processed the order for the food to be timely ready for pick-up. Vehicle C is then directed to leave DTL<b>1</b> and enter a separate prepaid drive-through lane DTLP. In another example, a QSR with a dedicated DTLP can invite prepaid vehicles type C to directly enter this DTLP by way of a directional signage SD at the point of origin of the O-D Vector, at the edge of the premises where a SVR identifies the vehicle. Upon registering the presence of vehicle C on the premises, the QSR kitchen management system may be configured to add vehicle C's order to a que of orders of vehicles on the premises according to the specific DTL and the order of the vehicles in each the DTL so that vehicle C's order is ready for pickup when it arrives at pickup window Q<b>2</b>. In the illustrated example, facility <b>2000</b> includes satellite pickup stations <b>2002</b><i>a</i>, <b>2002</b><i>b </i>that may be supplied by way of QSR staff transporting food orders from the main building of the QSR, who may reach the satellite pick-up stations for example by way of an underground connection. In another example, the satellite pick-up stations <b>2002</b> may be supplied by way of a pneumatic tube-order delivery system PTPU supplied from order pick-up window Q<b>2</b> <b>2004</b>. Another vehicle type vehicle A, which has paid for a carwash and a QSR order at payment window Q<b>1</b>, may proceed to food pick-up window Q<b>2</b> <b>2004</b> and, recognized by an SVR, is directed by LD and G to a DTL<b>2</b> that includes an IBW<b>1</b> CW module whereas vehicle B is directed by LD and G to DTL<b>1</b> and allowed to proceed to an exit without receiving a carwash. Vehicle A proceeds to the IBW<b>1</b> carwash with their QSR order, similar to prepaid vehicle C, which is directed to IBW<b>2</b>, so that customers may optimize their personal time by consuming their QSR orders while their cars are being washed. If vehicle C, or other type of vehicles in DTLP <b>1</b> have to exit before the carwash, they may use off-ramp OR to leave the QSR premises and vehicle type C may be recognized by an SVR on the OR so that it receives credit for a future carwash.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>2100</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>2100</b> includes one default drive-through lane for carwash customers and another drive through lane DTL<b>1</b> for QSR only customers. Customers entering facility <b>2100</b> may thus make their decision to opt for a carwash before arriving at the facility and choose the corresponding default lane or DTL<b>1</b>. For customers who have pre-ordered and pre-paid via, for example, a mobile app, the traffic management system may be configured to identify those customers, for example, by license plate number, which may be entered by the customer during initial registration in the mobile application, and a directional traffic light directs those customers to the correct default lane. Similarly, other customers who have registered a preferred choice may be guided by the traffic management system to the correct lane. In some examples, the POS for the CW lane may only be configured to present CW menu options and/or may allow the user to only select CW menu options. After paying for w CW service and driving up to the IBW, the customer may be presented with QSR menu items, for example, via the user's user device <b>112</b>. The user may then make a QSR order while his car is being washed in the IBW and be directed by the directional lights LT and gate G<b>2</b> to the QSR pickup window Q<b>2</b> if the customer made a food purchase and directed through an alternate exit route if he/she did not make a food purchase.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>2200</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>2200</b> includes a single drive through lane for all customers that includes a tunnel carwash TCW. In the illustrated example, vehicle type A has ordered a carwash and vehicle type B has not. The vehicles are identified and recognized by SVI, SVR, and or SVD, for example, by merely recognizing the presence of the vehicle at the entrance to the TCW and an order in which the vehicles entered the drive though lane. TCW is activated when vehicle A enters and washes the vehicle according to the CW service that was selected while vehicle B is merely conveyed along TCW without activating the cleaning systems of the TCW. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary facility <b>2300</b> that is similar to facility <b>2200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>) where a carwash, here an IBW, is a default configuration for the QSR. If a customer chooses to opt-out of the paid carwash, vehicle B, for example, can take one of a series of off-ramps OR<b>1</b>,OR<b>2</b>,OR<b>3</b> to exit the premises altogether and terminate the O-D vector voluntarily. Traffic management system can be configured to recognize vehicle B's premature departure and register a credit for the vehicle B customer for the unused carwash. Vehicle B after exiting may also rejoin the traffic flow at point C<b>1</b> to complete the O-D vector and pick up their food order.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>2400</b> that includes a QSR, CW system, and traffic management system. In the illustrated example, facility <b>2400</b> includes a plurality of CW module types and is configured to direct vehicles according to their food order to a type of carwash module, or preferred other option, at all times optimizing the O-D vector for the customer. For example, vehicle A which may have been recommended, and subsequently confirmed an express carwash that offers zero additional wait time in the DTL is directed by a traffic management system to the appropriate type of carwash, for example an express carwash, and for example specifically a TCW given the properties of speed of a tunnel carwash. In another example, while at all times the aim is to optimize the O-D vector, the method provides for a balanced option which in some instances speeds up food preparations, or the order of food orders, together with a less speedy carwash option, for example by directing a vehicle to a slower IBA<b>1</b> or IBA<b>2</b> instead of the faster tunnel TCW in order to ensure that the food items are properly prepared to meet the overarching health and safety standards within the aim to ensure that all vehicles, with or without a carwash travel the O-D vector at the same time. In another example the method also provides for the traffic management system to adjust the speed of the individual carwash apparatuses, or control the traffic speed in the DTLs <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> by way of gates and traffic signals, or the speed of the conveyor on which the vehicles may be transported, or for example select faster or slower activating carwash solutions to maximize the customers' overall experience in the O-D vector.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> illustrates another example implementation of system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the form of a facility <b>2500</b> that is substantially the same as facility <b>2400</b> but with the addition of an automatic vehicle carwash diagnostic (AVCD) system <b>2502</b> configured to perform a rapid diagnostic test and provide a recommendation for one or more CW services according to the results of the diagnostic analysis. In the illustrated example, after vehicle D crosses the entrance line ENT of the QSR, it immediately enters a diagnostic tunnel of system <b>2502</b>. As the car moves through the diagnostic tunnel the state of cleanliness of the outside of the car is scanned and determined. In one example, the cleanliness of the car is determined with one or more cameras operably connected to a computing device, e.g., the server device <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), that are configured to execute a machine vision algorithm with instructions for determining a cleanliness of a vehicle. In one example, the machine vision algorithm may employ one or more of a periodic pattern detection filter, edge detection, and noise filtering to detect and segment out dirt areas on the vehicle. The extent of dirt areas can be used in conjunction with other variables, such as the customer's food order, to recommend one or more car washing options to provide a carwash menu option recommendation.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B</figref> illustrate one example implementation of an automatic vehicle carwash diagnostic (AVCD) system <b>2502</b>. Carwash diagnostics take place when the vehicle <b>2602</b> is moving and/or stationary. In one example, vehicle <b>2602</b> drives into a diagnostic tunnel <b>2604</b> and stops. A diagnostic scanner (DS) <b>2606</b> subsequently moves around the vehicle <b>2602</b> to determine the state of cleanliness of the outside of the vehicle.

Sensors <b>2608</b> may also include capacitive and acoustic sensors, for identifying dirt areas. In other examples, one or more of sensors <b>2608</b> and/or scanner <b>2606</b> may be located within a carwash system and/or may be located outside, for example adjacent or proximate a POS <b>106</b> or ordering window.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one example sensors <b>2608</b> include a plurality of sensors lining interior walls <b>2610</b> of tunnel <b>2604</b>, which may include sensors located in a ceiling and/or floor of the tunnel and positioned in a plurality of locations for evaluating the outer surface of a vehicle <b>2602</b> from top to bottom and from all angles. In some examples, AVCD <b>2502</b> may also include a sample collection system <b>2612</b>, for example as part of the moving diagnostic scanner <b>2606</b> for collecting samples of material on an outer surface of a car, such as dirt, grime and debris including one or more of solid, liquid, or gaseous samples. The collection system <b>2612</b> may include one or more of a vacuum or collection wipe.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some examples diagnostic analyses performed by AVCD <b>2502</b> include one or more of ultraviolet, infrared or visible light spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, mass spectrophotometry, and/or X-ray spectroscopy, which may be automatically compared against a database (e.g., database <b>126</b>) of known spectra to determine the type of debris on the vehicle, gas or other types of chromatography and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Sensors <b>2608</b> and/or scanner <b>2606</b> may further include one or more optical devices, e.g., a laser measurement device, for determining a thickness and composition of an existing wax coating on a surface of the vehicle. Diagnostics may also include analysis of an underside of each vehicle to detect excess oil and extent of debris and dirt as well as a tire analysis which may include contact and non-contact sensors for determining a flexibility of the rubber and tread life remaining. In some examples, diagnostics may also include molecular analyses and sensors <b>2608</b> and/or scanner <b>2606</b> may include scanning electron microscopes with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to allow the identification of very small amounts of particles of dirt and debris and the subsequent analysis of the composition of individual particles with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Sensors <b>2608</b> and/or scanner <b>2606</b> may include a spectrometer configured to determine the composition of dirt and debris based on photon energy and the activity based on photon flux. In one example, the spectrometer is configured to detect and analyze radio nuclides from various types of environmental debris such as dust from rocks, minerals, sludge, slag, soil, plant, sediment and particulate matter found in, e.g., water droplets on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The results from the diagnostics analyses may be transmitted to other components of the system, e.g., system <b>100</b>, including one or more of server device <b>118</b>, carwash system <b>104</b> and POS <b>106</b> for determining a level of cleanliness of the exterior of the vehicle and identify and display recommended CW services according to the level of cleanliness. Carwash system <b>104</b> may also be configured to control a cleaning process according to the results of the analysis, for example, directing cleaning agents and water to areas of the car in greater need of cleaning. In some examples a user may be provided in an option for a rapid spot treatment rather than a full wash to obtain a carwash of short duration that cleans the areas in greatest need of cleaning prior to picking up the customer's food order.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates an example GUI <b>2700</b> that may be displayed on display <b>2609</b> of AVCD <b>2502</b> for communicating the progress of a diagnostic analysis being performed by the AVCD and also illustrates example parameters D<b>1</b>-D<b>20</b> that the AVCD may be determined to search for and analyze. In the illustrated example, the example parameters include baseline parameters <b>2702</b> such as make and model of vehicle and customer preferences. For example, particular carwash treatments may be recommended for certain makes and models according to material types and known issues such as known areas underneath the vehicle that are prone to collecting debris or rusting. In one example, sensors <b>2608</b> and/or scanner <b>2606</b> may include cameras and image processors determined to identify make and model from any identifying characteristics, such as VIN number, registration sticker, make logo, model name, etc. Parameters may also include cleanliness parameters <b>2704</b>, structural parameters <b>2706</b>, protective layer parameters <b>2708</b>, and weather and travel parameters <b>2710</b>. In some examples, drivers may be prompted, e.g. via display <b>2609</b> or a GUI displayed on user interface <b>114</b> user device <b>112</b>, to add additional information to their custom carwash.

The AVCD may also be configured to take customer preferences and the duration since the last carwash if such customer information is available, e.g., in customer data <b>138</b> of database <b>126</b>. The AVCD may also be configured to take into account the time of year, and immediate weather forecast, to determine a best carwash treatment plan. Treatment recommendations may be based on a variation of the amount, length of time and sequence of the existing chemical solutions and carwash apparatuses, or a custom car treatment plan is recommended from a plurality of options for each particular carwash application. For example, input data suggesting wintery conditions may add a recommendation for preventive rust protector for the under-carriage, or an additional UV treatment in the wax coating may be recommended for sunny days, and a special hydrophobic rinse could be suggested for imminent inclement rainy weather. In another example, for a very dusty vehicle that is covered with thick layers of road debris, recommendations displayed on GUI <b>2800</b> may include a recommendation for a specifically designed treatment to addresses road debris that may include a custom-timed, extended pre-wash rinse to first remove the thick layers of debris. In another example, in response to detection of a grimy film on a vehicle, recommendations displayed on GUI <b>2800</b> may include an a la carte treatment available from a plurality of soap options T<b>4</b> where, for example, a special de-greasing chemical solution is recommended to address the particular type of grime on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the illustrated example, next to each of the recommendations <b>2802</b>, an urgency level <b>2804</b> indicating the urgency of the treatment is displayed to the customer. For example, a diagnosis of an existing wax coating of the vehicle may conclude that the vehicle still has a reasonably sufficient wax coating. Here T<b>6</b> would recommend a very light wax coating and the light R<b>2</b>/T<b>6</b> (denoting &#x2018;optional treatment&#x2019;) would turn green, while the adjacent lights remain unlit. In another example, an analysis of the undercoating may show that no treatment is required at all; in this case light R<b>1</b>/T<b>3</b> will turn green suggesting that the customer can wait until next time. The recommendations <b>2802</b> may take into account the time interval, or average time interval, when vehicles were last washed to help ensure that a very custom-wash package is presented to give the best care to the vehicle.
