It finds particular application in connection with a filament extension atomizer for forming an ionomer-containing layer.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is generally a layered structure in which a freestanding polymer electrolyte membrane, formed from an ion-permeable ionomer, is sandwiched between catalyst layers. The catalyst layers may also include some ionomer for continuity of ion transport. This triple-layered assembly is sandwiched between two porous gas transport layers, formed, for example, from carbon or titania.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To provide bonding between the layers of the MEA, the layers may be hot pressed together. The conventional hot pressing method does not achieve a good interfacial contact and is prone to various problems. For example, delamination tends to occur. Additionally, unevenness due to catalyst particle agglomeration can puncture the membrane. To remedy this problem, membranes thicker than required are used. Besides, this conventional assembly process limits the MEA design to layered structure which limits the design space.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing methods for constructing the catalyst layers include a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) method and a catalyst coated membrane (CCM) method. In the GDE method, a catalyst layer (CL) is formed on a preformed gas diffusion layer (GDL), by spraying or screen printing, to form a GDE. A polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is then sandwiched between two GDEs and the assembly is hot-pressed to form a MEA. The GDL is electrically conductive and serves as part of an electrode. One problem with the GDE method is that the interface between the CL and the PEM can be weak, resulting in delamination and reduced durability of the MEA. The poor interfacial contact can lead to lower charge transport and a lower electrochemical performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the CCM method, CLs are formed on both sides of a PEM by directly spray coating the membrane or using a decal transfer method with the catalyst ink, to form a CCM. This method provides good interfacial contact, in comparison to the GDE method. One problem with the CCM method is that conventional sprayers can only spray low ionomer content solutions, due to the strain hardening nature and high viscosity of ionomer solutions. Spraying particles using conventional nozzles is limited due to possible clogging issues. The direct spray coating methods are limited to low viscosities (generally less than 40 mPa&#xb7;s-check) and low particle loading (generally less than 2 wt. %).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The exemplary system and method employ a filament extension atomizer (FEA) spray, which allows spraying solutions with high polymer concentrations, and also allows spraying of molten polymers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following references, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, are mentioned:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat.

Spraying molten polymers avoids the need for dispersing the polymer in a suitable solvent and for handling such solvents.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The exemplary FEA method is able to spray a wide range of high viscosity/strain hardening fluids, which enables fabrication of one or more layers of a multilayer membrane assembly, such as a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) layer, and/or one or more catalyst layers. Fabricating the membrane with conventional sprayer to fabricate the membrane generally requires multiple passes, and thereby more time and resources. The FEA spray allows a simplified fabrication method and provides design flexibility as compared to conventional methods. The FEA spray method also allows a high loading of other deposited materials, such as catalyst particles in the catalyst layer(s). This capability provides a potential design space also enabling graded ionomer/catalyst structures. The gradient design with higher catalyst loading and/or ionomer content near a polymer electrolyte membrane increases the contact area with an electrolyte and shortens the proton transport path.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary electrochemical device <b>10</b> in the form of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is shown in cross-sectional view.

A conductive path <b>30</b> electrically connects the first and second electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, permitting a flow of electrons between the first and second electrodes. In a typical fuel cell system, multiple MEA, devices such as MEA <b>10</b>, are electrically connected in a series or parallel configuration, referred to as a fuel cell stack, to generate electrical power at a predetermined current and voltage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first chamber <b>32</b> is defined by channels between the first bipolar plate <b>14</b> and the first gas diffusion layer <b>18</b>.

In another embodiment, the electrodes may be interdigitated.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As previously noted, one or more of the layers <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the assembly <b>60</b> may be formed by filament extension atomization FEA. An exemplary filament extension atomization apparatus <b>200</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The apparatus <b>200</b> is configured for performing the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, although it is to be appreciated that a similar apparatus could be configured for performing the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A supply station <b>202</b> supplies substrates, such as preformed membrane layers <b>12</b>, to a transport system <b>204</b> (in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the supply station <b>202</b> may supply preformed gas diffusion layers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>). The transport system <b>204</b> conveys the substrate layers <b>12</b> (manually or automatically) to a first catalyst layer applying station <b>206</b>. A first filament extension atomizer <b>208</b> generates an aerosol, or droplets, of a heated first catalyst material <b>62</b> in fluid form, by stretching the fluid material <b>62</b> in a nip <b>210</b> (a small gap) defined between two rotating rollers <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. The rollers <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> stretch the first catalyst material <b>62</b> between the two diverging surfaces of the rollers <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> as the rollers rotate away from each other. The fluid <b>62</b> pools on an upstream side of the nip <b>210</b> and is drawn into the nip as the rollers counter-rotate. On a downstream side, the fluid <b>62</b> is stretched into a filament between diverging surfaces of the rollers, to which a portion of the fluid still adheres. As the filament is stretched, the filament grows longer and thinner. When the filament reaches a point of instability, known as the capillary break-up point of the filament, the filament breaks into several droplets <b>216</b>. As the rollers counter-rotate, continuous formation and break-up of filaments across the surface of the rollers <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> generates the aerosol of fluid droplets <b>216</b>. The aerosol of fluid <b>62</b> is then directed along a passage <b>218</b> to a chamber <b>220</b> of the catalyst layer applying station <b>206</b>, where the droplets are deposited through outlets <b>224</b> (such as funnels) on to the passing substrate <b>12</b>. The funnels may be assisted by a shaping air flow to direct the aerosol stream better. In one embodiment, the same catalyst layer material <b>62</b> is applied to both sides of the membrane layer <b>12</b> (i.e., also serves as the second material <b>64</b>), although in other embodiments, different materials <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be applied by respective catalyst layer applying stations. In the case where the catalyst layer material is applied to the gas diffusion layers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, different pathways <b>204</b> with respective stations <b>206</b> may be provided, with the first gas diffusion layer <b>18</b> being coated, on one side only, with the first catalyst layer material <b>62</b>, and the second gas diffusion layer <b>20</b> being coated, on one side only, with the second catalyst layer material <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The catalyst layer material(s) <b>64</b> may be formed from an ionomer in the form of granules, pellets, powder, or other suitable form. In one embodiment, the ionomer is composed mainly of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone with side chains containing ether groups and a sulfonic acid unit at its end, such as Nafion&#xae; polymer, which is heated in an autoclave before or after addition of the catalyst particles.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is to be appreciated that alternative forms of a filament extension atomizer <b>208</b> can be used, other apparatuses utilize alternate means of creating diverging surfaces, including co-rotating rollers, a single roller and a belt or other linear surface, a system of one or two pistons which stretch a filament between a piston and another piston or other surface and other alternative apparatuses capable of stretching a fluid filament between one or more diverging surface.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment, the droplets <b>216</b> are directed by a flow of cooling gas, such as a pressurized air stream, which may be introduced to the passage <b>218</b> at <b>226</b>. The air stream cools the aerosol, preparing the formed aerosol droplets for deposition onto the substrate <b>12</b> and inhibiting agglomeration of the droplets by solidifying an outer surface of the droplets. As the aerosol passes through the passage <b>216</b>, and/or upon entering the chamber <b>220</b>, the droplets can be electrostatically charged. The charged droplets are attracted to the electrically grounded, or oppositely charged, substrate <b>12</b> due to the electrostatic potential between the droplets of the aerosol and the substrate. The electrostatic potential between the charged aerosol and the substrate <b>12</b> attracts a thin layer of the fluid <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to the substrate surface. As the electrostatically charged fluid <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> is deposited onto the substrate <b>12</b>, the magnitude of the electrostatic potential between the two materials is reduced. The thickness of the coating can be varied and adjusted as desired by varying the magnitude of the electrostatic potential between the droplets and substrate. The greater the electrostatic potential, the more deposited fluid <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> is required to reduce electrostatic potential.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, the apparatus <b>200</b> may provide for teflonization of microporous layers, such as the gas diffusion layers, e.g., by spraying a PTFE solution at a desired polymer concentration. The PTFE solution may be introduced to the atomizer <b>208</b> from a suitable supply vessel (not shown), e.g., prior to introduction of the catalyst layer forming material <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The thus-formed coated substrate <b>228</b> may be transported to a first curing station <b>230</b> that at least partially cures the catalyst layer or layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Curing the substrate <b>12</b> and deposited coating material <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can include a thermal curing process, a photo-curing process, a chemical curing process, other curing processes, and combinations thereof. Curing can cause the deposited coating material <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to polymerize and cross-link into the final catalyst layer or sub-layer. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>12</b> and deposited coating material <b>62</b> are heated, causing the (partially) solidified droplets to melt across the surface of the substrate <b>12</b>, thus coating the surface of the substrate with the coating material.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment, the curing station <b>230</b> only partially, but not fully, cures the ionomer in the catalyst layer material <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, the coated substrate <b>228</b> may be transported to a second (and optionally a third, or more) catalyst layer applying station(s) <b>232</b>.

The second catalyst material <b>234</b> may have a different catalyst concentration from the first catalyst material <b>62</b>. This allows sub-layers of the catalyst layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to be progressively applied on the membrane <b>12</b> (or on gas diffusion layers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>), at different catalyst concentrations, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A second curing station <b>236</b>, downstream of the second catalyst layer applying station <b>232</b>, may be similarly configured to the curing station <b>230</b>.

When used as an electrolyzer, the exemplary MEA <b>10</b> finds particular use when coupled to an intermittent power source such as a wind turbine or solar power array. The MEA electrolyzes hydrogen using excess electricity provided by the power source <b>50</b> when the power source is operational. The MEA device <b>10</b> consumes the hydrogen to produce electrical power when the intermittent power source is inoperative.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The exemplary MEA assembly <b>60</b> is thus formed, at least in part, using a Filament Extension Atomizer spray device that generates an aerosol of droplets by introducing a heated polymer and, in the case of catalyst layers, catalyst particles, at much higher solids concentration (polymer plus any catalyst), by weight, than can be achieved by conventional methods of forming layers <b>12</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. This provides advantages in increasing design latitude for creating membranes and catalyst layers which are bonded firmly together. The higher solids concentrations possible in the layer-forming materials also allows greater control over layer thickness.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The fabrication of a complete MEA <b>60</b>, or fabrication of parts of the MEA can be achieved using a single FEA spray coating device, e.g., by controlling the catalyst to polymer ratio supplied to the atomizer <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The apparatus and methods described herein enable fast, inexpensive large scale manufacturing of MEAs with better electrochemical performance than the conventionally produced ones due to the improved triple phase boundary.
