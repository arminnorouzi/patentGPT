Configuration Examples of Inhaler Device</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An inhaler device generates a substance to be inhaled by a user. The following description assumes that the substance to be generated by the inhaler device is an aerosol. Alternatively, the substance to be generated by the inhaler device may be a gas. In the following description, user's inhalation of a substance generated by the inhaler device will be also referred to simply as &#x201c;inhalation&#x201d; or &#x201c;puff&#x201d;. Reference is now made to various configuration examples of the inhaler device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An inhaler device according to the present configuration example generates an aerosol by heating an aerosol source that is a liquid, and heating a substrate containing the aerosol source. Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to describe the configuration example.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram schematically illustrating a configuration example of an inhaler device according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an inhaler device <b>100</b> according to the present configuration example includes a power supply <b>111</b>, a sensor <b>112</b>, a notifier <b>113</b>, a memory <b>114</b>, a communicator <b>115</b>, a controller <b>116</b>, a liquid guide <b>122</b>, a liquid storage <b>123</b>, a heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>, a heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>, a holder <b>140</b>, and a heat insulator <b>144</b>. The inhaler device <b>100</b> has an airflow path <b>180</b> defined therein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>, the liquid guide <b>122</b>, and the liquid storage <b>123</b> are contained in a cartridge <b>120</b>. The cartridge <b>120</b> is removable from the inhaler device <b>100</b>. With the cartridge <b>120</b> attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b>, and with a stick substrate <b>150</b> held by the holder <b>140</b>, the user performs inhalation. Individual components are now described in sequence below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The power supply <b>111</b> stores electric power. The power supply <b>111</b> supplies power to various components of the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The power supply <b>111</b> may be a rechargeable battery such as a lithium ion secondary battery. The power supply <b>111</b> may be charged by connection to an external power supply via, for example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable. The power supply <b>111</b> may be charged by wireless power transmission technology without being connected to a device at the transmitting side. In another example, the power supply <b>111</b> alone may be removable from the inhaler device <b>100</b>, or may be replaceable with new one.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensor <b>112</b> detects various information related to the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> outputs the detected information to the controller <b>116</b>. In one example, the sensor <b>112</b> may be a pressure sensor such as a condenser microphone, a flow sensor, or a temperature sensor. In response to detecting a value associated with user's inhalation, the sensor <b>112</b> outputs information indicating that the user has performed inhalation to the controller <b>116</b>. In another example, the sensor <b>112</b> is an input device that receives information input by the user, such as a button or a switch. In particular, the sensor <b>112</b> may include a button for indicating that aerosol generation be started/stopped. The sensor <b>112</b> outputs, to the controller <b>116</b>, information input by the user. In another example, the sensor <b>112</b> is a temperature sensor that detects the temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the temperature sensor detects the temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> based on the electrical resistance of the conductive track of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> may, based on the temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>, detect the temperature of the stick substrate <b>150</b> held by the holder <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The notifier <b>113</b> provides the user with notification of information. In one example, the notifier <b>113</b> is a light-emitting device such as a light emitting diode (LED). In that case, the notifier <b>113</b> emits light in different light emission patterns for different situations, such as when the power supply <b>111</b> is in need of charging, when the power supply <b>111</b> is being charged, and when an abnormality has occurred in the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The term light emission pattern as used herein conceptually includes, for example, color and light-on/light-off timing. Examples of the notifier <b>113</b> may include, in addition to or instead of a light-emitting device, a display device that displays an image, a sound output device that outputs sound, and a vibration device that vibrates. In another example, the notifier <b>113</b> may provide information notifying that it has become possible for the user to inhale. The information notifying that it has become possible for the user to inhale is provided when the stick substrate <b>150</b> heated by the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> has reached a predetermined temperature.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The memory <b>114</b> stores various information for operation of the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The memory <b>114</b> is, for example, a non-volatile storage medium such as flash memory. An example of information stored in the memory <b>114</b> is information related to the operating system (OS) of the inhaler device <b>100</b>, such as information representing how the controller <b>116</b> controls various components. Another example of information stored in the memory <b>114</b> is information related to user's inhalation, such as the number of inhalations, the time of inhalation, and the cumulative duration of inhalation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The communicator <b>115</b> is a communication interface for transmission and reception of information between the inhaler device <b>100</b> and another device. The communicator <b>115</b> is capable of communication in conformity with any wired or wireless communication standard. A suitable example of such communication standard may be wireless local area network (LAN), wired LAN, Wi-Fi (registered trademark), or Bluetooth (registered trademark). In one example, the communicator <b>115</b> transmits information related to user's inhalation to a smartphone to display, on the smartphone, the information related to user's inhalation. In another example, the communicator <b>115</b> receives new OS information from a server to update the OS information stored in the memory <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The controller <b>116</b> functions as an arithmetic processing unit and a control unit, and controls the overall internal operation of the inhaler device <b>100</b> in accordance with various programs. The controller <b>116</b> is implemented by, for example, an electronic circuit such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a microprocessor.

For example, together with or instead of this control, the controller <b>116</b> may perform control such that the amount of power supplied to the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> increases with increasing number of puffs. More specifically, the controller <b>116</b> may perform control such that the amount of power supplied to the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> per puff increases with increasing number of puffs. This configuration allows the amount of the cartridge-side aerosol generated per puff to increase with increasing number of puffs. As the number of puffs increases, the amount of the flavor source contained in the stick substrate <b>150</b> decreases. The decrease in the amount of the flavor source causes a decrease in the amount of the flavor component imparted per unit amount of the cartridge-side aerosol. In this regard, according to the above-mentioned configuration, the decrease in the amount of the flavor component contained per unit amount of aerosol can be offset by the increase in the total amount of aerosol to thereby prevent or reduce a decrease in the amount of the flavor component that reaches the inside of the user's mouth in each puff. This allows the user to sufficiently taste the flavor even after taking a large number of puffs.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The series of processes to be executed by individual devices described herein may be implemented by any one of software, hardware, and a combination of software and hardware.
