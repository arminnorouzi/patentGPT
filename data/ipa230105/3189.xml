The following embodiments are only used for illustrating the present invention, not used for limiting the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the wind generator of the present invention comprises a revolving platform <b>2</b> rotationally connected with a base <b>1</b>; a tower body <b>3</b>, wherein the bottom end of the tower body <b>3</b> is connected to the revolving platform <b>2</b>, the top end of the tower body <b>3</b> is fixedly provided with a generator room <b>4</b>, and a plurality of blades <b>6</b> are rotationally connected to the generator room <b>4</b> through a wheel hub <b>5</b>; and the tower body <b>3</b> is provided with at least one windward side <b>301</b> in the circumferential direction of the tower body <b>3</b>, and the bending stiffness of the windward side <b>301</b> is not less than that of the remaining sides (rather than the windward side <b>301</b>) of the tower body <b>3</b>; and a power source <b>7</b>, which is used for changing the windward direction of the blades <b>6</b>, wherein the power source <b>7</b> is started when airflow is to the sides rather than the windward side <b>301</b> to enable the airflow to flow to the windward side <b>301</b> while the windward direction of the blades <b>6</b> coincides with the airflow.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For a traditional wind generator, the generator room <b>4</b> and the tower body <b>3</b> are rotationally connected, so the connection structure is complex and is poor in tightness, which affects the life of the generator and other electrical components in the generator room <b>4</b>. The generator room <b>4</b> of the present invention is fixedly connected to the upper end of the tower body <b>3</b> so that the connection structure between the generator room <b>4</b> and the tower body <b>3</b> is simpler and better in airtightness and the service life of the generator and other electrical components in the generator room <b>4</b> is longer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It can be understood that the bending stiffness of the windward side <b>301</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) of the tower body <b>3</b> is larger than that of the remaining sides of the tower body <b>3</b> and the tower body <b>3</b> can rotate relative to the base so that after the airflow direction changes, the tower body <b>3</b> is turned so that the airflow always flows towards the windward side <b>301</b> of the tower body <b>3</b>. Therefore, the stiffness of the other sides of the tower body <b>3</b> can be reduced appropriately according to the actual usage so as to reduce the sizes of the other sides of the tower body <b>3</b> to achieve the purpose of reducing the weight and reduce the manufacturing cost of the tower body <b>3</b> with the reduction of the weight of the tower body <b>3</b>. It should be explained that the windward side <b>301</b> can be a plane of the tower body <b>3</b> or a hypothetical plane of the tower body <b>3</b> having a certain included angle with the plane in the airflow direction so long as the windward side <b>301</b> is a plane with larger bending stiffness on the tower body <b>3</b>, and the windward side <b>301</b> is not limited here.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The revolving platform <b>2</b> is used for supporting the tower body <b>3</b> and fixedly connected with the tower body <b>3</b>, the revolving platform <b>2</b> is rotationally connected with the base <b>1</b>, and the base <b>1</b> is a structure limiting and supporting the revolving platform <b>2</b>, which supports the rotation of the revolving platform <b>2</b> and limits the rotating range thereof. When the wind generator works, the blades <b>6</b> are required to face the wind direction. In the present invention, the generator room <b>4</b> and the tower body <b>3</b> are fixedly connected, and the rotary connection arrangement between the revolving platform <b>2</b> and the base <b>1</b> enables the blades <b>6</b> to face different directions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The yaw of the blades <b>6</b> is driven by the power source <b>7</b>. It can be understood that the power source <b>7</b> is turned on or off according to the airflow direction to make the blades <b>6</b> face the airflow direction so that the windward side <b>301</b> of the tower body <b>3</b> also faces the airflow direction when the blades <b>6</b> coincides with the airflow direction (in the position where the power coefficient is optimum). At this time, the windward side <b>301</b> faces the airflow direction, the bending property of the tower body <b>3</b> is optimum, and the blades <b>6</b> are located in the direction where the power coefficient is optimum, which can make full use of the bending property of the tower body <b>3</b> while fully transforming wind energy. The power source <b>7</b> can be a mechanical device, an electrical device or wind. When wind blows the blades <b>6</b>, the blades <b>6</b> move under force, and due to rotary connection between the tower body <b>3</b> and the base <b>1</b>, the blades <b>6</b> will drive the generator room <b>4</b> and the tower body <b>3</b> to rotate so as to achieve the purpose of yaw.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the cross sectional shape of the tower body <b>3</b> can be defined according to the actual usage so long as the bending stiffness of the windward side <b>301</b> of the tower body <b>3</b> is larger than that of the remaining sides of the tower body <b>3</b>.
