The entire content of the above-referenced application is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of vehicle power supply technologies, and more specifically, to a vehicle power supply device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A liftable power supply device is usually used for power supply in new energy vehicles in the related art. Ascending or descending of the power supply device is implemented by a scissor-fork lifting mechanism. A drive device of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism performs driving by forms such as hydraulic pressure. The drive device swings in a drive process accordingly, resulting in poor stability. In addition, space occupied by the drive device is relatively large, which is not conducive to the overall structural arrangement of the power supply device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure aims to resolve at least one of the technical problems existing in the related art. Accordingly, an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle power supply device. The vehicle power supply device can have advantages such as high stability, high space utilization, and favorable overall structural arrangement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a vehicle power supply device is provided.

Therefore, due to a change of a transmission path of a driving force, forms of the drive unit can be more diverse. In addition, because the drive unit is not directly connected with the scissor-fork lifting mechanism, when the drive device drives the scissor-fork lifting mechanism to ascend or descend, the drive unit does not swing accordingly, and the stability is improved, thereby improving the smoothness of the movement of the power supply head, and facilitating the alignment during charging. In addition, because the drive device integrates the transmission unit, and based on a change of the drive force path by the transmission unit, the drive unit and the transmission unit can be stacked along a lifting direction of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism. In this way, horizontal space occupied by the drive device can be reduced without affecting an overall height of the vehicle power supply device in a height direction. Therefore, the utilization of space is improved, and the arrangement of an overall structure of the vehicle power supply device is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some specific embodiments of the present disclosure, the drive device is mounted on the fixed base, and the transmission unit is arranged between the fixed base and the drive unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the drive device further includes: a housing.

To satisfy the ascending and descending of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b>, sufficient space needs to be reserved along a lifting direction of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b>, and the drive unit <b>700</b> and the transmission unit <b>800</b> are stacked along the direction, so that space along the lifting direction of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b> may be fully utilized, and horizontal space occupied by the drive device <b>400</b> may be reduced, thereby improving the utilization of space, which is beneficial to the arrangement of an overall structure of the vehicle power supply device <b>1</b>. In addition, when the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b> is in a folded state, specific space is still required along the lifting direction to accommodate the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b> in the folded state. Provided that it is ensured that an overall height of the drive unit <b>700</b> and the transmission unit <b>800</b> after being stacked is less than a height of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b> in the folded state, the folding of the scissor-fork lifting mechanism <b>200</b> may not be affected.
