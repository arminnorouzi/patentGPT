The dreadlock interlocking tool can comprise four principal elements, including: lock clamp, anti-snag guard; guide rod; and anti-scratch guard. The dreadlock interlocking tool is designed to have a principally linear shape, in order to grasp the tip of the dreadlock such that the body of the dreadlock is in-line with the tool. Thus, the tool can provide ease of use when pulling the body of the dreadlock through the root of the dreadlock during interlocking. The linear structure of the tool, and the provided safety features, such as the anti-snag guard and anti-scratch guard, allow for interlocking without unintentional twisting, snagging and/or damaging the scalp.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="227.58mm" wi="132.25mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="229.62mm" wi="134.28mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="259.33mm" wi="108.54mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="244.86mm" wi="151.21mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="176.53mm" wi="154.77mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="174.33mm" wi="125.81mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="172.04mm" wi="144.70mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="229.36mm" wi="140.38mm" file="US20230000228A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to an apparatus and method of hair care, particularly interlocking hair for locks of hair, Afrikan dreadlocks, locs, twists, braids and the like.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Afrikan dreadlocks is a hairstyle in which the hair is naturally, manually and/or mechanically matted and/or twisted, often while wet, into tight locs, braids and/or ringlets. As the hair grows, various maintenance and styling methods may be used to manage the new hair growth (e.g., near the scalp) in a manner that maintains the appearance of the dreadlocks. Interlocking dreadlocks is one such maintenance method. In particular, interlocking dreadlocks is a maintenance method that includes twisting and pulling the body of the dreadlock&#x2014;tip first&#x2014;entirely through it's root base from one side to the other. Thus, interlocking can tighten each dreadlock by looping or knotting the hair at the base of the dreadlock, which is also referred to as &#x201c;root flipping&#x201d; or &#x201c;latch hooking&#x201d; of dreads. It may be desirable to have a tool that is distinctly designed for interlocking dreadlocks efficiently and easily.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Both the foregoing brief overview and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only.

Moreover, while many aspects and features relate to, and are described in, the context of the Dredlock interlocking tool, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to use only in this context. The present disclosure can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the disclosure and the Examples included therein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Before the present articles, systems, apparatuses, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific manufacturing methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular materials unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, example methods and materials are now described.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">A. Definitions</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the specification and in the claims, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can include the aspects &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of.&#x201d; Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. In this specification and in the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;an opening&#x201d; can include two or more openings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Ranges can be expressed herein as from one particular value, and/or to another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x2018;about,&#x2019; it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as &#x201c;about&#x201d; that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value &#x201c;10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; mean that the amount or value in question can be the value designated some other value approximately or about the same. It is generally understood, as used herein, that it is the nominal value indicated &#xb1;10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. The term is intended to convey that similar values promote equivalent results or effects recited in the claims. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but can be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. In general, an amount, size, formulation, parameter or other quantity or characteristic is &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximate&#x201d; whether or not expressly stated to be such. It is understood that where &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used before a quantitative value, the parameter also includes the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; &#x201c;first part,&#x201d; &#x201c;second part,&#x201d; and the like, where used herein, do not denote any order, quantity, or importance, and are used to distinguish one element from another, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase &#x201c;optionally affixed to the surface&#x201d; means that it can or cannot be fixed to a surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, it is to be understood that unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including: matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow; plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation; and the number or type of aspects described in the specification.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Disclosed are the components to be used to manufacture the disclosed apparatuses, systems, and articles of the disclosure as well as the apparatuses themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these materials cannot be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For example, if a particular material is disclosed and discussed and a number of modifications that can be made to the materials are discussed, specifically contemplated is each and every combination and permutation of the material and the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Thus, if a class of materials A, B, and C are disclosed as well as a class of materials D, E, and F and an example of a combination material, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited each is individually and collectively contemplated meaning combinations, A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are considered disclosed. Likewise, any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C-E would be considered disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the articles and apparatuses of the disclosure. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific aspect or combination of aspects of the methods of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is understood that the apparatuses and systems disclosed herein have certain functions. Disclosed herein are certain structural requirements for performing the disclosed functions, and it is understood that there are a variety of structures that can perform the same function that are related to the disclosed structures, and that these structures will typically achieve the same result.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> thereof, examples of the dreadlock interlocking tool and the principles and concepts thereof will be described.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a perspective view of an example of an apparatus, namely a dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>. As seen, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> can comprise four principal elements, including: dreadlock clamp <b>105</b>, anti-snag guard <b>110</b>; guide rod <b>115</b>; and anti-scratch guard <b>120</b>. The dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> is designed to have a principally linear shape, geometrically. That is, the elements <b>105</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, and <b>120</b> are coupled to each other in a manner that forms a linear structure. Thus, in use, the tool <b>100</b> is designed to grasp a dreadlock by the tip such that it is in line with the linear shape of the tool <b>100</b>. In other words, when the tool <b>100</b> is grasping the tip of the dreadlock, the lock of hair is in line with the shape of the tool <b>100</b> (e.g., lengthwise). Furthermore, when interlocking, tool <b>100</b> can be arranged approximately parallel to the person's scalp, thereby enabling ease of use with respect to moving the tool <b>100</b> scratch guard <b>120</b> end first along a horizontal axis when pulling the dreadlock (which is in-line with the tool <b>100</b>) through the root of the dreadlock near the scalp of the person's head.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Unlike tools currently available, the structure of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> is distinct as it is not structured to grasp the dreadlock such that they are substantially perpendicular (e.g., approximately 90&#xb0;) which may damage the lock or even break the lock. Consequently, when using the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>, there is no difficulty associated with the dreadlock being cross aligned with the lock root as it is pulled and/or pushed through to the other side. Thus the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> is less likely to snag in the dreadlock root which can damage hair and cause discomfort and/or pain. In addition, the interlocking procedure is faster and easier than traditional interlocking tools due to the interlocking tool <b>100</b>'s unique design making it an ideal choice for professionals and consumers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lock clamp <b>105</b> may be considered a body member of the tool <b>100</b>, comprised by portions generally described as flat panels, such as a top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b>. The tool <b>100</b> is configured such that the top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> are connected to each other at one end, for instance at a hinged joint <b>108</b>, while remaining disconnected at the opposing end, referred to as the clip end <b>106</b>. The hinged joint <b>108</b> is a mechanism that allows a &#x201c;clamping&#x201d; movement of the tool <b>100</b> in a manner that allows the top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> to move away from each other (e.g., in a clamp open position) and to move towards each other and firmly press against each other as their surfaces touch (e.g., in a clamp closed position). Thus, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> can be designed having its body, namely the lock clamp <b>105</b>, described as a &#x201c;clip&#x201d; or &#x201c;clamp&#x201d; structure, as the top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> can pivot from the attached end, at the hinged joint <b>108</b>. As previously described, the top portion <b>101</b> and the bottom portion <b>102</b> can move away from each other forming an open angle between the portions <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. Conversely, the top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> can collapse together from the hinged joint <b>102</b>, thereby closing the &#x201c;jaws&#x201d; of the clip. As another example, the internal geometry of the lock clamp <b>105</b> may form a V or otherwise have a tapered geometry such that locks of hair, such as dreadlocks of a range of thicknesses, can be accepted and held in place by the tool <b>100</b>. The lock clamp <b>105</b> can be implemented as any clamping means including but not limited to: alligator clip, fasteners, single prong clips, double prong clips, pins, retainers, and various types of mechanisms for closing and securing an object in place.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> in a closed position where the internal surfaces of the top portion <b>101</b> and the bottom portion <b>102</b> are touching each other, thereby closing the clamp. As seen, the connecting edge <b>107</b> includes a contour, or &#x201c;teeth&#x201d;, which allows the regressed ridges (e.g., female) of the bottom portion <b>102</b> to receive the extended ridges (e.g., male) of the top portion <b>101</b> (and vice versa) such that the portions <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> mate tool to firmly grip the tip of a lock of hair inside of the tool <b>100</b> when the lock clamp <b>105</b> is closed. Thus, in use, the lock clamp <b>105</b> can securely grip the tip of the dreadlock such that the tool <b>100</b> can be pulled by hand at its distal end (e.g., anti-scratching guard <b>120</b>), and in-turn, pulling the dreadlock through hair at the root without the dreadlock falling out of the tool lock clamp <b>105</b> or undesirably coming a loose during interlocking. Conversely, the top portion <b>101</b> and the bottom portion <b>101</b> of the lock clamp <b>105</b> can move away from each other to open, such that the tip of the dreadlock can be placed inside of the opening (before closing the lock clamp <b>105</b> to grip the dreadlock).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the top potion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> lay relatively parallel, or restated, lay on top of each other such that their respective internal surfaces come into contact. Accordingly, as the dreadlock lock clamp <b>105</b> opens, for example, by applying pressure (e.g., squeezing) to an opening and closing mechanism in order to open the lock clamp <b>105</b>, the lock clamp <b>105</b> can receive the tip of a lock of hair, such as a dreadlock.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lock clamp <b>105</b> may be constructed using a rigid material, such as a carbon steel, brass, metal, metal with nickel electroplating, silver, plastic, and the like, and at varying dimensions and/or sizes, for instance having a length between 1.5 inches-4 inches. In at least one instance, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be less than 1 inch long or greater than 4 inches. In other instances, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be adapted to other reasonable sizes. The size of the lock clamp or clamping means can be adjusted in proportion to the size of the dredlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>. The dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be constructed such that the total tool has various dimensions, sizes, and thicknesses, for instance having a thickness between 1 and 4 millimeters. In at least one instance, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be less than 3 millimeters thick or greater than 5 millimeters in thickness. In other instances, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be adapted to other reasonable thicknesses.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the illustrated example, the lock clamp <b>105</b> can include an open and closing mechanism (not shown) that may be used to effectuate the opening and/or closing of the lock clamp <b>105</b>, that is arranged inside of the anti-snag guard <b>110</b> at the rear end of the lock clamp <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, the open and closing mechanism of the lock clamp <b>105</b> is a clip grip. As an example, a clip grip functions similar to a lever. In an initial, or resting, position the lock clamp <b>105</b> is configured to be closed, as the top portion <b>101</b> and bottom portion <b>102</b> lay parallel, pressing firmly against each other. When force is applied to the clip grip of the lock clamp <b>105</b>, for instance pressure from squeezing the grips, both the top and bottom portions <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> of the lock clamp <b>105</b> can pivot from a fulcrum, which can be the hinged joint <b>108</b> near the rear of the lock clamp <b>105</b>. This pivoting motion causes the top portion <b>101</b> of the lock clamp <b>105</b> to swing upward, or vertically from the hinged joint <b>108</b> (e.g., along the positive y-axis). Alternatively, the bottom portion <b>102</b> of the lock clamp <b>105</b> pivots vertically downward from the hinged joint <b>108</b> (e.g., along the negative y-axis). The open and closing mechanism of the lock clamp <b>105</b> can be implemented by a plurality of tightening mechanisms including, but not limited to: a clip grip; a slide tightening grip; a cam tightening grip; and the like. Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the clamp end <b>106</b> may have a &#x201c;tooth&#x201d; with a curved shape, which may increase firmness and &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the dreadlock's tip fixedly into position at the end of the tool <b>100</b>, as curved surfaces come into contact while the lock clamp <b>105</b> is clamped shut (in comparison to the contact that may be experienced by relatively flat surfaces).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To ensure that any portions of the lock clamp <b>105</b> that are extending out (e.g., away from the linear structure of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>), for instance clip grips, do not cause any undesirable snagging of hair while pulling the tool <b>100</b> through the loose hair at the root of the dreadlock, the tool <b>100</b> includes an anti-snag guard <b>110</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the anti-snag guard <b>110</b> is at an end of the lock clamp <b>105</b> opposing the clamp end <b>106</b>. That is, the anti-snag guard <b>110</b> can be a coating of generally smooth material, such as rubber or plastic, that covers the open and closing mechanism of the lock clamp <b>105</b>, for instance the clip grips. The anti-snag guard <b>110</b> acts a protective shield, covering elements that may stick out from the linear body of the tool <b>100</b> from catching onto strands of hair. Accordingly, by having the anti-snag guard <b>110</b>, any protruding parts that would otherwise snag against loose hair while the tool <b>100</b> is in use, are covered in a manner that allows the lock clamp <b>105</b> (and the rest of the tool <b>100</b>) to move more easily through the dreadlock root near the scalp of the person's head. It should be appreciated that the anti-snag guard <b>110</b> may be constructed as one monolithic piece, or as an assembly of multiple pieces in an alternate embodiment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> can include the guide rod <b>115</b>. As a general description, the guide rod <b>115</b> facilitates guiding and pulling the tool <b>100</b> through the root of the dreadlock. The guide rod <b>115</b> can be described as a rigid, narrow, and linearly elongated member extending from the body member of the tool <b>100</b>, namely the lock clamp <b>105</b>. The guide rod <b>115</b> may be formed as a thin straight bar constructed from a rigid material, such as metal, carbon steel, brass, plastic, and the like. The guide rod <b>115</b> can be designed at varying dimensions and lengths, for instance having a length ranging from 1.5 inches-3.0 inches. By being a substantial portion of the tool's <b>100</b> length and having a substantially small width, the guide rod <b>115</b> is designed to slide easily through hair while guiding the bulkier portions of the tool <b>100</b>, such as the lock clamp <b>105</b>, through the root during interlocking the dreadlock. In at least one instance, the interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be less than 1 inch long or greater than 4 inches. In other instances, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be adapted to other reasonable sizes. The size of the guide rod can be adjusted in proportion to the size of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>. The guide rod <b>115</b> may be constructed at various reasonable sizes proportional to the relative size of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> and its principal elements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> includes an anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> arranged at the distal end of the tool <b>100</b>. The anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> can be constructed as a primarily circular coating of a soft material, such as rubber, that covers the blunted end of the guide rod <b>115</b>. Thus, the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> acts as a shield over a blunt and/or sharp edge of the rod <b>115</b> that may otherwise scratch, poke, or even cut the scalp (or eye, ear, and other body parts) of the person while the tool <b>100</b> is in use in close proximity to their head. The anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> is yet another feature of the distinct design of the tool <b>100</b> that increases safety and comfort for the user. In at least one instance, since the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> is at the distal end of the tool <b>100</b>, it can be the held in the hand of the user. For example, the user can place their hand around the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b>, which has a soft and non-slip surface, while the tool <b>100</b> is pulling the tip of the dreadlock, secured by the lock clamp <b>105</b> at the opposing end of the tool <b>100</b>, through the hair at the root during interlocking. In at least one instance, there is not anti-scratch guard or there is a blunted/rounded terminal end of the guide rod <b>115</b> with a coating or plastic or resin that would functionally be equivalent to the anti-scratch guard.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As alluded to above, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be constructed at varying sizes and dimensions, as deemed appropriate, for example to accommodate the user's discretion or preference and comfort. In at least one instance, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be less than 1 inch long or greater than 4 inches. In other instances, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> may be adapted to other reasonable sizes. The size of the guide rod can be adjusted in proportion to the size of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b>. The guide rod <b>115</b> may be constructed at various reasonable sizes proportional to the relative size of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> and its principal elements. The dimensions of the tool <b>100</b> can be determined based on several factors related to the environment and the user, such as child, adult, short dreadlocks, long dreadlocks, and the like.

Although the function of the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> is described in reference to a dreadlock <b>150</b>, it should be understood that the tool <b>100</b> can be used on other types and/or styles of hair, such as braids, twists, coils, curls, synthetic hair, and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the tool <b>100</b> is shown in the closed position, securely holding the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b>. Before being closed, the tool <b>10</b> may be placed in the open position, in order to receive dreadlock <b>150</b>. As described in detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tool <b>10</b> may be opened by applying pressure to the opening and closing mechanism inside of the anti-snag guard <b>110</b>. In accordance with the grip clip embodiment, a user can squeeze together the ends of the grip, thereby moving the top portion and the bottom portion of the lock clamp <b>105</b> away from each other. Subsequently, the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b> can be inserted inside of the lock clamp <b>105</b>, and the clamp <b>105</b> closed &#x201c;locking&#x201d; the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b> into position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b> while being gripped by tool <b>100</b>.

As seen, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> is designed to be held in line with dreadlock <b>150</b> while grasping the tip. That is, the tool <b>100</b> is positioned such that the portion of the dreadlock <b>150</b> between the user's fingers and the tool <b>100</b> is in-line with (e.g., horizontally aligned) the linear body of the tool <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the tool <b>100</b> can be held parallel (e.g., horizontally aligned) with respect to the user's head, allowing for an ease of use when moving the tool though the hair at the root of the dreadlock <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, shown the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> in another position while in use. In some embodiments, the guide rod <b>115</b> can be used to guide the tool <b>100</b>. However, in some embodiments, such as the example described below, the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> may be used as an alternate method or other way of guiding the tool <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the lock clamp <b>105</b> is grasping the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b>, as the user pulls the tool <b>100</b> by the guide rod <b>115</b> through root of the dreadlock <b>150</b> to tighten it. As alluded to above, the dreadlock interlocking tool <b>100</b> can include an anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> at the distal end that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> as being held in the user's hand. For example, the user can initially push the distal end of the tool <b>100</b>, anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> first, through the root of dreadlock <b>150</b> from one side to the other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows this initial position, as the tip of deadlock <b>150</b> is still in the lock clamp <b>100</b>, and has not been pulled through to the other side of the root. In at least one instance, a user may prefer to grasp and guide the tool <b>100</b> by pulling the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b>. Being constructed using a rubber-like material, the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> can improve the user's hold of the tool <b>100</b> as the soft rubber covering the end of the guide rod <b>115</b> causes slight friction when coming into contact when the skin of the user's hand. This friction from the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b>, which can be rubber in this case, may increase the gripping effect of the user's hand allowing the tool <b>100</b> not to slip out of the user's hand while being forcibly pulled through the root of the dreadlock <b>150</b>. In at least one instance, a user may prefer to grasp and guide tool using the guide rod <b>115</b>. In this instance, the anti-scratch guard <b>120</b> can reduce the risk of hazards associated with pulling the hard and/or protruding portions of the tool <b>100</b> through the user's hair.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Thus, by positioning the tool <b>100</b> substantially parallel to the head, the user can pull the tool <b>100</b> through to the opposite side (e.g., opposite to the side of interior) of the root of the dreadlock <b>150</b>. By pulling the entire dreadlock <b>150</b> through the root to the other side, a &#x201c;loop&#x201d; is formed at the root, similar to tying a knot, tightening and interlocking dreadlock <b>150</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, as the lock clamp <b>105</b> has been pulled completely through the root of the dreadlock <b>150</b>, and exiting the hair on the opposite side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> also shows that the lock clamp <b>105</b> continues to securely hold the tip of the dreadlock <b>150</b> throughout the interlocking motion, allowing the entire dreadlock <b>150</b> to move in-line with the tool <b>100</b> (as opposed to perpendicular), making it much easier to pull the dreadlock <b>150</b> through the root of the dreadlock <b>150</b> to the other side.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and example method <b>800</b> for using the dreadlock interlocking tool is depicted. The method <b>800</b> may begin at operation <b>805</b>. At operation <b>805</b>, a user may place a lock clamp of a dreadlock interlocking tool in an open position to receive a dreadlock. The user can insert a tip of the dreadlock directly between the &#x201c;jaws&#x201d; of the lock clamp. Next, at operation <b>810</b>, a user may place the lock clamp of the dreadlock interlocking tool in a closed position. With the tip of the dreadlock being arranged between the &#x201c;jaws&#x201d; of the lock clamp, closing the lock clamp secures the tip of dreadlock in the lock clamp, allowing the dreadlock to be held in position by the tool.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Subsequently, at operation <b>815</b>, the dreadlock interlocking tool, being held in at least one hand of the user, can be positioned such that the dreadlock is horizontally aligned with the dreadlock interlocking tool. Also, the dreadlock interlocking tool can be held by the user, being positioned parallel to the user's head, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Thereafter, at operation <b>820</b>, the user can guide the dreadlock interlocking tool through the root of the dreadlock to tighten the dreadlock. For example, guiding the dreadlock interlocking tool can involve the user pushing a distal end of dreadlock interlocking tool into a first side of the root of the dreadlock, which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as described in detail above. The user can use the guide rod, for example, to pull the dreadlock interlocking tool through the hair. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which is described in detail above. By pulling the dreadlock interlocking tool, the tool is moved with the scratch guard end leading, along a horizontal axis through the root of the dreadlock. Thus, the scratch guard helps to ensure that the tool does not scratch or cut the user's head, while moving so closely to the scalp. Ultimately, the tool is pulled to exit a second side of the root of the dreadlock in a manner that pulls the entire dreadlock through the root of the dreadlock, tightening the dreadlock with ease and without damaging or breaking the deadlock.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">While the specification includes examples, the disclosure's scope is indicated by the following claims.
