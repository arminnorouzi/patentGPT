More particularly, the invention relates to a specific method for initiation of host cell infection resulting in increased virus yield from host cells in a fixed-bed bioreactor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Robust technologies that allow reproducible and robust production of viruses and virus vectors to meet the ever-increasing demand for vaccines and other therapeutics are essential. In addition, for the development of versatile host cell technology platforms such as Vero cells and other mammalian cell platforms, avian cell platforms, and insect cell technology platforms, technologies that improve the virus yield from the host cells also play an important part in accelerating the development of the vaccine process and production. The present invention fulfills a need to improve methods of virus generation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the subject invention provide systems and methods for utilization of the air flow and O<sub>2 </sub>flow parameters to determine the optimal time of infection for host cells expanding in fixed-bed and other bioreactor systems in which cell count sampling is difficult, impractical, or impossible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known methods for using metabolite data to determine the optimal time of infection in fixed-bed reactors with respect to the cell density require sampling and a broad infection window. Through observations of process air parameters, including comparing overall air flow to O<sub>2 </sub>flow within a reactor, the inventors have identified factors, parameters, and trends of interest, including a trend where the volume of air flow into a fixed-bed reactor reduces and crosses an increasing trend of the O<sub>2 </sub>flow volume into the reactor. The invention provides a reproducible and robust process of determining and controlling the optimal time of infection of host cells using a correlation of process air parameters including Air flow, O<sub>2 </sub>flow, and respective trends thereof resulting in increased virus yield.

In certain embodiments, the bioreactor may be a fixed-bed bioreactor. In certain embodiments the step of observing the bioreactor process air parameters comprises measuring a rate of total air flow into the bioreactor and measuring a rate of O<sub>2 </sub>flow into the bioreactor at a plurality of time points, to create a current measurement set at each respective time point. In certain embodiments the step of identifying a first time-marker comprises determining a time at which the rate of total air flow into the bioreactor reduces and crosses an increasing trend of the rate of O<sub>2 </sub>flow into the bioreactor. In certain embodiments the step of identifying a first time-marker comprises calculating one or more values from one or more current measurement sets to predict a future time at which the rate of total air flow into the bioreactor is expected to reduce and cross an expected increasing trend of the rate of O<sub>2 </sub>flow into the bioreactor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, once an infection window is established for a specific cell line and virus, the established infection window can be applied and utilized with other viruses.

In some embodiments, the optimal time of infection window is the convergence of air flow and O<sub>2 </sub>flow.

The iCELLis technology may be used at small-scale such as in the iCELLis Nano, where the growing area is between 0.5 to 4 m<sup>2 </sup>and manufacturing scale, such as in iCELLis 500 where the growing area ranges from 66 to 500 m<sup>2</sup>. Processes developed in the small-scale system may be scaled up to that of the manufacturing scale.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The scale-X&#x2122; bioreactor system of Univercells oilers a range of growth surfaces: scale-X &#x201c;hydro&#x201d; (&#x3c;3 m<sup>2</sup>) &#x201c;carbo&#x201d; (10-30 m<sup>2</sup>) and &#x201c;nitro&#x201d; (200-600 m<sup>2</sup>). This range offers a scalable process and the capability for clinical lot production. Within the Univercells product line, the bioreactor height increases, while the diameter is held constant. For example, the carbo 10 m<sup>2 </sup>bioreactor is &#x2153; the height of a 30 m<sup>2 </sup>bioreactor, However, scale-up among the different lines is achieved by keeping the height of the fixed-bed constant and increasing the diameter,</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000">similar to scale-up in chromatography systems. For instance, a 200 m<sup>2 </sup>bioreactor is the same height as a 10 m<sup>2 </sup>bioreactor, but the diameter is different. The scale-X carbo system is a single-use bioreactor coupled with in-line product concentration operated by a bench-scale automated<br/>process controller (pH, DO, T, agitation, liquid flow rates), which enables the production and simultaneous concentration of viral products; a feature that is novel and differentiates this type</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">of fixed-bed bioreactor from others in the market. The fixed-bed in the scale-X carbo bioreactor offers surface areas for cell growth between 10 m<sup>2 </sup>and 30 m<sup>2 </sup>in a total vessel volume of 1.6-3.2 L, dependent on the surface area. This results in the capacity for a high cell density per unit volume and a compact footprint allowing integration in a standard biosafety cabinet. Many commercially available fixed-bed bioreactors use randomly packed disks or fabric strips as the substrate for cell attachment; however, the scale-X bioreactor utilizes a fixed-bed that is organized with a mesh layer which provides uniformity and vessel-to-vessel consistency for cell growth. A fixed-bed bioreactor may have sensors that measure and monitor the pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and the biomass, which indicates adherent cell density. A fixed-bed bioreactor may also have different ports that enable the addition of oxygen or nitrogen, a media exchange port, ports for the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and/or CO<sup>2 </sup>to adjust the pH. The dO<sub>2 </sub>of the media may be modified by addition of O<sup>2 </sup>or N<sup>2</sup>. Preferably the dO<sub>2 </sub>levels may be depleted in a controlled manner by injecting N<sub>2 </sub>in the headspace of the bioreactor, simultaneously stirring and monitoring the dO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The host cell used in the invention may be an anchorage-dependent cell or adapted to be an anchorage-dependent cell line.

Over the cultivation period of the Vero cells, the biomass sensor was used to monitor cell growth, and the cells were infected at 80 mS/cm conductivity (approximately highest conductivity), i.e., the Vero cells were infected when maximum cell growth was reached. Approximately 12 hours before infection the dO<sub>2 </sub>level was lowered to 45-50% and kept constant at this decreased level throughout infection and through harvest. The temperature was maintained at 37&#xb0; C., and pH was maintained at 7.4. The virus was harvested approximately 2 days after infection. Decreasing the dO<sub>2 </sub>12 hours prior to infection, infecting Vero cells VSV after the Vero cells achieved maximum cell growth, resulted in a VSV titer increase of over 2 logs when compared to VSV titer from flat-stock (Table 2) and a 5.9&#xd7; increase in viral titer when compared to that of Example 1 (no dO<sub>2 </sub>decrease). rVSV-LASV was provided by NIAID under Material Transfer Agreement LAB-18-P_LV-22.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3.
