More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an online multi-tenant shipping management system for providing a unified view operator interface.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many carriers provide online systems to allow shippers to schedule shipments and to provide shippers or intended recipients with in-transit tracking data that identifies when goods have passed through various designated tracking locations along the route. For smaller shippers that use multiple carriers, the shipper must independently interact with multiple carrier systems to schedule shipments and assess the status of shipments across carriers. To provide in-transit tracking data to intended recipients, such shippers may have to link to or otherwise direct intended recipients to the carrier-specific online systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Organizations that do a large amount of shipping may implement a shipping management system that integrates with the carrier systems to facilitate shipping and shipment tracking. However, such shipping management systems can suffer shortcomings with respect to tracking information and exception management. Shipping management systems do not typically identify exceptions across multiple carriers because there is a lack of consistency across carriers and modes as to what constitutes an exception. In addition to the lack of consistency, shippers rely on the carriers to flag exceptions, but in many cases, the carriers do not flag all actual exceptions (issues that lead to late delivery). In addition, carriers do not always update exception information in a timely manner. Accordingly, exceptions are often not exposed to shippers or intended recipients in a timely fashion that would allow the shipper or recipient to resolve the exception or take action in light of the exception.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, prior online carrier systems and shipping management systems may provide an incomplete view of shipments to a shipper. In particular, some carriers track shipments using multiple mechanisms. Some shipments or relevant shipment related data may not be available via the carrier's online site or to a shipping management system. Moreover, to compare shipment data across carriers using prior systems, a user typically has to manually put shipment data from one carrier side-by-side with shipment data from the other carrier and use industry and data knowledge provided by the person to subjectively summarize the meaning of the carrier-specific shipment data. Only once a person with industry and data knowledge has manually reviewed each element of the shipment data can the full context of a shipment be meaningfully understood. This process has to be repeated for each carrier and shipment in a non-systematic way, which removes any ability to compare data across carriers with meaningful context.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prior systems also suffered limitations when integrated in the broader context of an enterprise system. Some organizations, for example, integrate shipping management data into business process management (&#x201c;BPM&#x201d;) systems&#x2014;BPM systems are computer systems that automate business processes through software defined business processes and rules. With prior systems, it is not possible to express a single BPM rule, or metric, across an entire network of carriers because a BPM rule using shipment data from one carrier cannot typically be executed against shipment data from another carrier. Consequently, duplicative rules would have to written and stored for each carrier-specific data format.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment is directed to a shipping management system that comprises a memory configured with a set of carrier-specific mapping rules for a plurality of carriers, each mapping rule comprising an input status code or a status description in a carrier-specific format, a matching rule, and a resulting normalized status code. The memory is further configured with carrier credential information associated with a user account. The system further includes a processor coupled to the memory. The system further comprises a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising a set of computer executable instructions, the computer executable instructions executable by the processor to: connect to carrier systems of each of the plurality of carriers, provide respective carrier credentials from the user account to each carrier system, receive, from each carrier system, carrier-specific shipment records based on the provided respective carrier credentials, apply respective carrier-specific mapping rules from the set of carrier-specific mapping rules to the carrier-specific records received from the respective carrier to map status codes or descriptions in the carrier-specific records from the respective carrier to generate normalized shipping information for shipments across the carriers, the normalized shipping information comprising normalized status codes, store the normalized shipping information in association with the user account, receive, via a user interface, a request for shipments associated with the user account; and generate an unified view user interface to present a unified view of shipments associated with the user account, the unified view comprising normalized statuses or descriptions for shipments across the plurality of carriers and controls to allow a user to request additional data on individual shipments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment includes a computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a set of computer executable instructions.

Topology <b>100</b> comprises a data processing system <b>120</b> (referred to as shipping management system <b>120</b>) bi-directionally coupled to shipper computing systems <b>110</b>, recipient computer systems <b>112</b> and carrier computer systems (&#x201c;carrier systems&#x201d;) <b>150</b> through network <b>105</b>. Shipping management system <b>120</b> may also connect to various other external systems <b>180</b>, such as e-commerce servers, ERP systems, TMS systems, ESP/SMS systems, CSR/CRM systems. According to one embodiment, shipping management system <b>120</b> may provide a cloud-based system or other network accessible system that multiple shippers can use to manage and track shipments across multiple carriers. Network <b>105</b> may be for example, a wireless or wireline communication network such as the Internet or wide area network (WAN), publicly switched telephone network (PTSN) or any other type of electronic communication link.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Shipping management system <b>120</b> may comprise one or more computer systems with central processing units executing instructions embodied on one or more computer readable media where the instructions are configured to perform at least some of the functionality associated with embodiments of the present invention. These applications may include a shipping management application <b>130</b> comprising one or more applications (instructions embodied on a computer readable media) configured to implement interfaces <b>132</b>, data ingest modules <b>134</b>, a normalization module <b>135</b>, prediction module <b>136</b> and an exception management module <b>138</b> utilized by the shipping management system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, shipping management system <b>120</b> may include data store <b>122</b> operable to store obtained data <b>124</b> collected from carrier systems <b>150</b>, shipping records <b>126</b>, shipping event records <b>127</b>, user account data <b>129</b> and other data. User account data <b>129</b> can include account information for holders of accounts with shipping management system <b>120</b> (e.g., profile data for account holders). The account holder may an individual, shipper or an entity, such as a retailer, that uses drop shippers, where the drop shippers may or may not be account holders.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The user account data <b>129</b> may include carrier credentials where the carrier credentials include information necessary to retrieve shipment data for the account holder from one or more carrier systems <b>150</b>. The carrier credentials for an account holder/carrier pair (e.g., a shipper/carrier pair) may include a customer number, username and password, secret key, token or other information so that management system <b>120</b> may request shipment data. For example, the account information for Shipper X may include information to log in and request shipment data for Shipper X from Carrier A's system <b>150</b>, information to log in and request shipment data for Shipper X from Carrier B's system <b>150</b>, and information to log in and request shipment data for Shipper X from Carrier C's system <b>150</b>. The carrier credentials may also include information so that shipping management system <b>120</b> can log into a carrier system <b>150</b> on behalf of the account holders to schedule a pick up or perform other operations. The carrier credential information may be provided as part of onboarding a shipper or other account holder.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Shipping management system <b>120</b> utilizes interfaces <b>132</b> configured to, for example, receive and respond to queries from users at shipper computer systems <b>110</b> or recipient computer systems <b>112</b>, interface with carrier computer systems <b>150</b>, and interface with other external systems <b>180</b>, obtain data from or provide data obtained, or determined, by shipping management system <b>120</b> to any of shipper computer systems <b>110</b>, recipient computer systems <b>112</b>, carrier computer systems <b>150</b> and other external system <b>180</b>. It will be understood that the particular interface <b>132</b> utilized in a given context may depend on the functionality being implemented by shipping management system <b>120</b>, the type of network <b>105</b> utilized to communicate with any particular entity, the type of data to be obtained or presented, the time interval at which data is obtained from the entities, the types of systems utilized at the various entities, etc. In some embodiments, these interfaces may include, for example web pages, web services or application programming interfaces (APIs). In particular, in some embodiments, shipping management system <b>120</b> can provide an API so that online ordering systems may be integrated with shipping management system <b>120</b>. Shipping management system <b>120</b> may select a carrier and schedule pick up of a shipment as part of a customer checkout process on an online ordering system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment, shipping management system <b>120</b> may provide a user interface (UI) <b>133</b> to provide shippers with unified views of shipment data related to the shippers. The UI <b>133</b> may comprise web pages, mobile application pages or other pages or data to provide a unified view.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment, shipping management system <b>120</b> may provide an interface <b>132</b> through which a user can define a shipment. An ingest module <b>134</b> may be configured to receive and process order-level information from shippers in the form of data files exchange or Web Service API integration and relevant shipment data. The shipment data may include an account holder if different than the shipper (e.g., a drop shipper can indicate (or it may be implicit) that the shipment is on behalf of a particular retailer), recipient, from address (shipper), to address (consignee), weight, product class and dimensions and other information. Shipping management system <b>120</b> may provide carrier selections to the user so that the user may select a final shipper or shipping management system <b>120</b> may automatically select the carrier. According to one embodiment, shipping management system <b>120</b> may apply rules to a combination of signals (e.g., transportation signals, historical signals, business signals) to determine the carriers from which a user may select or to automatically select a carrier as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/836,374, filed Dec. 8, 2017, entitled &#x201c;SHIPPING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH MULTI-CARRIER SUPPORT&#x201d;, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Shipping management system <b>120</b> may then interact with the carrier system <b>150</b> for the selected carrier to execute the shipment. In some cases, a carrier systems <b>150</b> may provide public APIs <b>151</b> that allow external systems to execute shipments and access tracking data and shipping management system <b>120</b> may use the API to execute the shipment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other cases, a shipper can initiate a shipment directly with a carrier and provide the shipment data to the carrier without going through shipping management system <b>120</b>. The shipper can provide a tracking number or other shipment identifier to shipping management system <b>120</b> and other shipment information (e.g., whether an intended recipient should receive notifications and the contact information for the intended recipient) via interface <b>133</b> so that shipping management system <b>120</b> can request the appropriate shipment information from the carrier system <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, shipping management system <b>120</b> can discover shipments associated with an account holder from information provided by a carrier system <b>150</b> and obtain shipment information from the carrier system <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">During shipment, carrier systems <b>150</b> provide shipment tracking data that indicates the status shipments (e.g., when a shipment was ready for pickup, when the shipment was picked up, check in/check out at various tracking locations, when the shipment was actually delivered and other information). Each tracking update can contain one or more of status (status code or other description), location and time information for a shipment. In some cases, a tracking update may indicate an exception (event that delays or otherwise adversely affect a shipment). Exception data may include for example, data that indicates that a pickup was missed, a shipment was delivered late, a shipment was damaged, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Carrier systems <b>150</b> may provide shipment-specific data, including shipment tracking data through a variety of mechanisms. Data sources for shipment specific data include, but are not limited to, shipment record files (e.g., spreadsheets, comma-separated files, other structured files, etc.), public APIs provided the carriers, data scraped from web sites, data manually received from carriers, data pushed from a carrier, etc. For a given carrier, data may be acquired in multiple ways and integrated together to provide a combined view of the data compared to getting data from a single source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When integrating shipping management system <b>120</b> with a carrier system <b>150</b>, a &#x201c;discovery process&#x201d; occur to make a determination of what combination of data sources will give the best overall information. This discovery process could take the form of research, manually consulting with the carrier, etc. Ingest modules <b>134</b> can then be configured to gather shipment specific data from that carrier. For a given carrier, data may be acquired from multiple sources and integrated together.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some carrier systems <b>150</b> implement a document interchange mechanism that allows users to register to receive shipment report files <b>152</b> formatted according to a defined specification. According to one embodiment, the document interchange may be performed using a standardized electronic data interchange (EDI) format or proprietary format. In another embodiment, the document interchange may involve a carrier system <b>150</b> sending shipment report files <b>152</b> as email attachments to an email address accessible by shipping management system <b>120</b> or uploading to an FTP site or other network location accessible by shipping management system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shipment report files <b>152</b> provided by a carrier system <b>150</b> can be formatted according a specification known to both the carrier and the implementer of shipping management system <b>120</b>. For example, the shipping report files <b>152</b> may be a comma-separated value file or spreadsheet in which the columns adhere to a defined specification. An ingest module <b>134</b> may be configured to request, receive and or access shipment report files from a carrier and process the shipment report files according to the defined format to extract shipment data.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Shipment report files have a variety of degrees of information, depending on the carrier. For some carriers, the shipment report files merely indicate the existence of shipments (e.g., simply provide a list of shipment numbers for shipper). In other cases, the shipment report files include additional shipment information including, in some cases, shipment status information.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some carrier systems <b>150</b> provide public APIs <b>151</b> that allow external systems to access tracking data. For systems with an API, an ingest module <b>134</b> may be programmed to make calls to the API <b>151</b> to collect tracking data related to shipments by that carrier. As a more particular example, an ingest module <b>134</b> can be configured to integrate with a Web Service API using a service client to perform a request with shipment data, such as a tracking number or reference number, to the web service and process the response from the service.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some carriers provide shipment-specific information using both shipment report files and API-based shipment data such that the information from periodic shipment report files can be augmented using tracking updates collected via the API <b>151</b>. A carrier system <b>150</b>, for example, may be configured to provide periodic shipment report files (e.g., every few minutes, every several hours or other period) on a per-shipper basis and provide additional shipment-specific information via an API <b>151</b>. For example, Carrier A's system <b>150</b> may periodically provide a shipment report file for Shipper X, a shipment report file for Shipper Y and a shipment report file for Shipper Z and also provide shipment status updates via the respective API <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Shipping management system <b>120</b> may thus include an ingest module <b>134</b> configured to receive shipping report files from a carrier system <b>150</b> and an ingest module <b>134</b> configured to poll the carrier system's API <b>151</b> for updates. For example, shipping management system <b>120</b> may include a first ingest module <b>134</b> configured to process shipping report files from Carrier A to extract shipments associated with a shipper and a second ingest module <b>134</b> to poll the API <b>151</b> provided by Carrier A to update shipment status information.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Other carrier systems <b>150</b> may provide tracking data through a web page interface, such as web page <b>154</b>. However, since the structure of a web page can be understood through observation, an ingest module <b>134</b> may be programmed to provide shipment information to a web site, download the HTML content from the carrier tracking web page and extract the relevant tracking information using rules to identify the tracking data on the page. Ingest modules <b>134</b> may also be programmed to collect tracking data through other mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It can be noted that shipping management system <b>120</b> may receive, via interaction with carrier systems <b>150</b>, shipment data on shipments regardless of whether the shipments were executed through shipping management system <b>120</b>. Thus, shipping management system <b>120</b> can discover shipments not initiated through shipping management system <b>120</b> and unify shipment-specific data for shipments initiated through various channels and across carriers.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Ingest modules <b>134</b> may use a set of scheduling rules to schedule how often tracking data is requested from the different sources, unless the update frequency is controlled by the carrier as may be the case when receiving shipment reports via email attachments. The scheduling rules can take into consideration the current status of the shipment, the type of shipment, the expected delivery date, the carrier and whether a person or system is subscribed for updates (e.g., SMS text notifications of updates).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the scheduling rules are hard-coded. In another embodiment, the scheduling rules are user configurable and shipping management system <b>120</b> can provide an interface to allow a user with appropriate privileges to compose or edit scheduling rules.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some examples of scheduling rules include, but are not limited to:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0042">1) If the shipment is scheduled but not yet in transit then i) update once a day if the shipment is 2 or more days away from shipping; ii) else update once per 6 hours;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0043">2) If the shipment is in transit then update once per hour;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0044">3) If the shipment is out for delivery then update once per 15 minutes;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0045">4) If the shipment is delivered then do not update.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">Thus, in some embodiments, shipping management system <b>120</b> collects information about a shipment based on the last known status of the shipment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">The collected data may include, among other information, both temporal (&#x201c;when&#x201d;) and location (&#x201c;where&#x201d;) information that is used to build a full context of each tracking update. Each tracking update can contain one or more of status (status code or description), exception, location and time information for a shipment. The exception information will either be extracted as-is (if the carrier provides such information) or will be computed through status mapping using carrier-specific rules. In some embodiments, the system can intelligently fill in gaps in the collected information by leveraging known information about the shipment, such as origin and destination information. For example, if the location information for a &#x201c;delivered&#x201d; tracking update is not available, the shipment destination information can be used to fill in that information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">When processing shipment-specific information for a shipper, shipping management system can identify if the shipment is a new shipment (a shipment for which there is no shipping record <b>126</b>) or an existing shipment. If the shipment is a new a shipment, shipping management system <b>130</b> can create a shipping record <b>126</b>. In general, shipments can be identified as new or existing shipments because carriers assign each shipment a unique shipment or tracking number. On example of a set of shipping records is illustrated in Table 3, below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">Normalization module <b>135</b> is configured to map between the carrier specific formats used by each carrier system <b>150</b> and normalized data. In accordance with one embodiment, normalization module <b>135</b> includes normalization rules (e.g., carrier-specific status mappings <b>157</b>) to map the carrier tracking codes in the received carrier data to (internal) normalized tracking codes <b>155</b>, examples of which are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">According to one embodiment, normalization module <b>135</b> processes carrier-specific status mappings <b>157</b> that map specific status code values or status description values or both to one of a number normalized statuses along with an exception category when appropriate. In general, the statuses correspond to various stages of a shipment (e.g., pickup scheduled, picked up, in-transit, available for pick up, out for delivery, delivered).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">In one embodiment, shipping management system <b>120</b> defines a status mapping document (e.g., in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format or other format) which defines:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0052">An input status code and/or status description.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0053">A matching rule, which is either &#x201c;matches exactly&#x201d;, &#x201c;starts with&#x201d;, &#x201c;ends with&#x201d; or regular-expression based, that is applied to the input status code or status description.

Next, a matching rule determines if the status pattern matches a status code value. In some examples, the status pattern could match a status code exactly. In other examples, the status pattern does not match exactly, but the status pattern &#x201c;starts with&#x201d;, &#x201c;ends with&#x201d;, etc. a value. If the rules do not match a status code, the system can map a fallback value, such as &#x201c;in transit&#x201d;.

The shipping record for SHIPMENT_ID:1000 may also be updated to reflect the predicted exception as the most recent exception.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">For example, a rule may specify that if a shipment is marked as &#x201c;pickup scheduled&#x201d;, but no action has occurred on a shipment for &#x201c;x&#x201d; number of hours, the shipment can be flagged as having a potential exception (also referred to as a &#x201c;predicted exception&#x201d; herein). For example a rule can specify that if a shipment is scheduled but is not in transit within 12 hours of the ship date, then a missed pickup exception can be set (e.g., an event with &#x201c;convey_missed_pickup&#x201d; from Table 1 can be added to the event records for the shipment and the shipping record updated). In another example, if a shipment is not delivered and the estimated delivery date has passed then, then a missed estimated delivery date can be set (e.g., &#x201c;convey_missed_estimated_delivery_date&#x201d; from Table 6). According to one embodiment, predictive exceptions may be determined as described in U.S. patent application Ser.

One example embodiment of an exception management module <b>138</b> is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/836,354, incorporated by reference above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">A user at a shipper computer system <b>110</b> may access the shipping management system <b>120</b> through the provided interfaces <b>132</b> using account holder credentials and specify certain parameters, such as a carrier, mode, shipment status information, a tracking number and other information. Shipping management system <b>120</b> can generate user interfaces using data determined from the processing and present these interfaces to the user at the user's computing device <b>110</b>. More specifically, in one embodiment interfaces <b>132</b> may visually present shipment information, including predicted exceptions to the user.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080">As described above, data can be acquired from carriers from one or more sources. The shipping management system <b>120</b> can become aware of shipments from several sources. If a user uses the shipping management system to schedule a shipment, then the shipping management system will be aware of the shipment and can create a shipping record and corresponding initial event record when the shipment is executed by the shipping management system. In another example, a carrier will make the shipping management system <b>120</b> aware of an account holder's shipments via shipment report files, notifications, responses to requests, or other mechanism. In another example, users will make the shipping management system aware of shipments by entering, through a user dashboard, tracking numbers or other information corresponding to shipments executed through carrier systems <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">If the shipping management system is configured to become aware of a shipment from multiple sources (via notifications from a carrier and from a user, for example) the system can determine that the information relates to an existing shipping record (for example, due to the use of a unique reference number and destination postal code), and will integrate the information, rather than create separate records for the same shipment.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0082">Embodiments described herein can implemented in a variety of manners. According to one embodiment, for example, normalization module <b>135</b> may be implemented in an ingestion engine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of one example of a data ingestion engine. It can be noted that shipping management system may request shipment information on behalf of an account holder (e.g., shipper), using the credentials for that account holder to retrieve information from a carrier system. Thus, shipping management system may receive information on shipments for that account holder regardless of whether the shipments were executed through the shipping management system. The data ingestion engine <b>200</b> may also receive shipment information from other sources, as described above.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows data ingestion engine <b>200</b> that receives shipment information from a plurality of carriers according to a plurality of integration paths. In particular, the shipping management system is configured to receive shipping report files for account holders and to query respective APIs for additional shipment data. Thus, ingestion engine <b>200</b> may receive Carrier A shipping report files <b>210</b>, Carrier B shipping report files <b>214</b> and Carrier C shipping report files <b>216</b> and Carrier A API shipment data <b>212</b>, Carrier B API shipment data <b>215</b>, Carrier C API shipment data <b>217</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">At extract step <b>218</b>, ingestion engine <b>200</b> extracts carrier shipment records from received shipping record files or API shipment data. According to one embodiment, each shipping report file <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> provided by a carrier contains shipment information for a particular shipper (or other account holder) and is formatted according to a defined format, which may be carrier specific. Ingestion engine <b>200</b> can be configured to extract carrier shipment records for a shipper from the shipping report files. In some cases, the carrier shipment record from a shipping report file is simply unique shipment identifier (such as a tracking number or other unique, carrier-assigned shipment identifier) to indicate the existence of a particular shipment. In other cases, a shipment record may include status information.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">Further, data <b>212</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>217</b> returned based on API calls may include shipment information formatted according to the respective public API <b>151</b>. Ingestion engine <b>200</b> can be configured to extract carrier shipment records from the data returned via the APIs. In some embodiments, ingestion engine <b>200</b> may be configured to extract shipment identifiers from shipping report files and make API calls to collect additional information about the identified shipments.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086">Ingestion engine <b>200</b> may further implement a transform step <b>220</b>, that may include several processes. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, transform step <b>220</b> includes processes to verify <b>230</b>, clean <b>240</b>, normalize <b>250</b> and enrich <b>260</b>. At the verify <b>230</b> step, ingestion engine <b>200</b> applies verification rules <b>232</b> to verify the accuracy or validity of the data. The verification rules may depend on carrier, shipper or other parameters. For example, for a particular shipper, the verification rules may specify that an order number has to have a known number of characters, or start or end with a known sequence of characters. If the data does not match the expected data pattern, ingestion engine <b>200</b> can make a determination of whether to discard or ignore the data. Such rules may be specific to certain carriers and/or certain account holders (e.g., shippers). If the verification step identifies an issue, ingestion engine <b>200</b> may also attempt to correct errors, or search for data from another data source.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">At clean <b>240</b> step, ingestion engine <b>200</b> applies data cleaning rules <b>242</b> to clean the input data carrier shipment records or to make data fields consistent. Examples of cleaning steps may include deleting leading or trailing spaces in a data field, standardizing zip code or state field formats.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">At normalize step <b>250</b>, ingestion engine accesses carrier-specific rules <b>252</b>, which may be an example of rules <b>157</b>, to map carrier-specific status codes, descriptions and exception flags to normalized status codes, descriptions and exception flags. As described above, data from a plurality of carriers or data sources is normalized, resulting in data that has common status codes across multiple carriers and other data sources. Another aspect of data normalization relates to information received that is not in the form of a status code. For example, some carriers may generate status or tracking information in the form of messages that may not be even internally standardized, for example, in the form of free-form text, text chosen from a list, etc. Ingest engine <b>200</b> can be configured to analyze free-form text or similar messages and attempt to determine a normalized status. In one example, ingest engine <b>200</b> uses word matching algorithms to match words in a message with key words that may indicate a particular status. In another example, machine learning or trained computers can be used to analyze and interpret the text in messages.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">For a carrier shipment record associated with a shipper (or other account holder), ingestion engine <b>200</b> can traverse a rules document to determine the rules applicable to the carrier. In applying a rule, ingestion engine <b>200</b> determines if an input status code and/or status description matches a condition based on the specified matching rule (e.g., &#x201c;matches exactly&#x201d;, &#x201c;starts with&#x201d;, &#x201c;ends with&#x201d; or regular-expression based matching rule, that is applied to the input status code or status description). In some embodiments, applying matching rules may include parsing carrier provided transit data for specific codes or descriptive words (e.g., &#x201c;arrived&#x201d;). If the status pattern or status description pattern matches the condition according to the matching rule, then the normalized shipment status and exception flag, if appropriate, are set for the shipment, thus generating normalized shipping information.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">The enrich <b>260</b> or enhance step can be used to enrich or enhance data according to enrich rules <b>262</b>. In some examples, properties can be implied based on the data. For example, package tracking data typically includes a timestamp. The timestamp may or may not be universal, so viewing the timestamp, without knowing the context, may present a problem. In the context of tracking data, for example, the shipping management system can see from the data the time zone in which a status event occurred. The timestamp can then be enhanced to include the actual time zone, or the enrich step can convert the timestamp to a local or universal time, as desired. This can help prevent tracking data from being listed out of order, due to differing time zones.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">In another example of data enrichment, if the origin or destination location (e.g., postal code) is missing, but that information is available on either the first tracking event (e.g., pickup) or the last tracking event (e.g., delivery), for example, then the shipment record location information can be inferred.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">In another example of data enrichment, if a shipment has been executed on the shipping management system platform, when the shipping management system collects the original shipment weight and cost, those values can be stored onto the shipment record as original weight and original cost. As the same shipment is being ingested and processed into the shipping management system, the system will detect changes of weight and cost compared to the original shipment record then the system can persist those as actual weight and cost and can notify users of changes (or create alerts).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0093">In another example of data enrichment, when ingesting a large number of shipments, which could be assigned to the wrong carrier in the data feed, the system can run a number of rules over the provided tracking number to verify whether its format or pattern is compatible with the provided carrier. If it is not, the system can attempt to correct the carrier by gathering carriers which match the format or pattern of the provided tracking number, and use rules to pick a winner if it can be safely done (e.g., only a single carrier is returned as a candidate).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">Once the extracted data is transformed, ingestion engine <b>200</b> determines if the transformed data corresponds to an existing shipping record. To determine if the data refers to a new or existing shipping record, the shipping management system can look to fields such as a carrier SCAC (a 4 letter code), a carrier's unique tacking number, or other fields, for example. The shipping management system may also determine if an event for a shipment is duplicative of an event in an event record. For example, shipping management system can compare the normalized event code, time stamp and other fields to event records for a shipment to determine if the event record is duplicative.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">The new transformed data is then loaded (step <b>270</b>) into the data store <b>280</b>, which may be one example of data store <b>122</b>. If the data does not correspond to an existing shipping record, ingestion engine <b>200</b> creates a new shipping record for the data. If the data corresponds to an existing shipping record and is not duplicative, the shipping management system appends or updates an existing shipping record with the new data. Updating a shipping record may include updating the event records associated with the shipping record. When updating an existing record with a new event, the shipping management system can determine if the new event is out of order by comparing the new event's timestamp to the timestamp of the timestamp of the latest event record associated with the shipment. If the time stamp of the new event is later than the timestamp of the latest event record, shipping management system can add an event record (e.g., Table 6) and update the status in the shipping record (e.g., Table 5) with the new status and, in some cases, exception. If, however, the time stamp of a new event for a shipment is prior to the timestamp of the latest event record for a shipment, the shipping management system may add an event record for the shipment without updating the status of the shipping record.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0096">As discussed above, a carrier may provide data through multiple sources, such as through an API and shipment report files. In some cases, the API and shipment report files may provide different events for the same shipment. By ingesting shipment information from multiple sources, the shipping management system can provide a unified view that provides a more complete and accurate view of a shipment than would be provided by either source alone. Moreover, by ingesting data from multiple carriers for a shipper (or other account holder), the shipping management system can provide a unified view of shipments across carriers.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows a user interface (UI) <b>285</b>. In one example, the UI <b>285</b> is a web-based user interface comprising one or more web pages. As shipment data is extracted, transformed, and stored, a search index <b>290</b> is updated to reflect the new or updated data. In some embodiments, the search index <b>290</b> is updated in real-time, or close to read-time, as new events, shipments, etc. are entered into the system. The search index <b>290</b> enables a user, via the UI <b>285</b> to search the data store <b>280</b>, as desired. In some embodiments, a separate report data store <b>295</b> is used to store data that is appropriate for reporting.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0098">According to one embodiment, the shipping management system may receive a request from a client computer (e.g., a shipper computer system <b>110</b>) for an interface containing data associated with a user account and substantially simultaneously initiate generation of a responsive interface <b>285</b>. In particular, the shipping management system uses index <b>290</b> to determine a first set of results that represent the shipping records associated with the account and provides a responsive web page to display results from the first set of results. The web page may include normalized tracking data. Because the tracking data returned is, in some embodiments, determined prior to receiving the request and stored in a normalized format across carriers, the shipping management system can quickly retrieve the tracking data for shipments related to an account and generate an interface that presents a unified view containing tracking data for shipments determined from multiple data sources and from multiple carriers. Thus, the shipping management system can respond to a request for an interface in the times expected by users of the Internet and without a web browser timing out.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0099">UI <b>285</b> provides controls to allow a user to filter the results. In addition, or in the alternative, UI <b>285</b> can allow a to request shipment data for a specific shipment. Responsive to a shipment-specific request, shipping management system can access the event records for the shipment and update UI <b>285</b> with additional data specific to the shipment. UI <b>285</b> may also include one or more web pages that display performance indicators to allow a user to directly compare carriers.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagrammatic representation of one embodiment of an operator interface comprising a web page <b>300</b> displaying a unified view of shipments across carriers. Web page <b>300</b> may be generated for a user associated with an account holder (e.g., a user at &#x201c;Shipper X&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0101">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, information from shipping records and/or other data structures is presented for individual shipments. The interface can include UI elements <b>302</b> to allow the user to filter the records based on attributes of the shipments contained in the shipping records or associated records, such as, for example status, mode, created date or other attributes. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the user has selected to view the shipments that have a normalized status of &#x201c;IN_TRANSIT&#x201d;. The user may also select to view all shipments (e.g., all shipments associated with the account holder); shipments for the account holder that are associated with the normalized statuses of &#x201c;SCHEDULED&#x201d;, &#x201c;IN_TRANSIT&#x201d;, &#x201c;APPOINTMENT&#x201d;, &#x201c;OUT_FOR_DELIVERY&#x201d;, &#x201c;DELIVERED&#x201d;, &#x201c;CANCELED&#x201d;; shipments for the account holder that are associated with normalized exception types; shipments for the account holder associated with predicted exception types; or other set of shipments as configured.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0102">A wide variety of information can be displayed for each shipment.

The user can select a particular shipment by clicking on the shipment to drill down into the details of the shipment.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a web page <b>400</b> displaying shipment specific information. Web page <b>400</b> includes a number of UI elements, such as widgets, to display or receive various information about the shipment. Web page portion <b>402</b> is configured to obtain and present the origin and recipient information, including recipient contact information associated with the shipment. Web page portion <b>404</b> is configured to display any notifications/alerts associated with a shipment. The alerts may be system generated alerts (e.g., exception notifications that were automatically sent based on an exception) and user generated alerts. By clicking on tool <b>406</b>, the user can be provided with an interface that allows the user to compose and send a notification to the recipient. The shipping management system can store the user-generated alert in association with the shipment.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0104">Web page portion <b>408</b> is configured to display subscription information. A subscription indicates an intended recipient or other party has subscribed for notifications related to the shipment. The subscription information can be specific to a communications channel to which the subscription corresponds. For example, web page portion <b>408</b> indicates a subscription for email notifications and includes an email to which to send the notifications. For an SMS notification subscription, on the other hand, the subscription information can include a mobile phone number.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0105">Web page portion <b>410</b> is configured to display the current status for the shipment. Web page portion can display various visual indicators <b>412</b> (icons, colors, etc.) to indicate the status of the shipment (e.g., orange with triangle indicates a predicted exception, red with warning triangle indicates a carrier reported exception, red with calendar indicates that the shipment requires an appointment, green with a checkmark indicates that a shipment has been delivered. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user selected to view information about a delivered shipment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0106">Web page portion <b>414</b> is configured to display the history of statuses associated with the shipment. That is, web page portion displays a representation of the series of event records for the shipment in time order. In some embodiments, web page portion <b>414</b> includes representation of exceptions in the time ordered series. Web page portion <b>416</b> is configured to display a summary of information associated with the shipment.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0107">Web page may include other widgets or portions. For example, web page <b>400</b> may include portions to allow the user to start a customer support case related to the shipment, add notes to the shipment or provide other functionality related to a shipment.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0108">The shipping management system may also provide interface pages that represent performance across carriers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, is diagrammatic representation of one embodiment of a carrier performance page <b>450</b>. Carrier performance page <b>450</b> includes a UI element <b>452</b> and other UI elements to allow a user to select a performance indicator and other performance parameters for determining performance (e.g., date range UI element <b>454</b>, carrier UI element <b>456</b>). Example performance indicators include, but are not limited to, on-time delivery percentage, damage rates, exception volume, volume of returned shipments, volume of refused shipments and other performance indicators. Based on the selection of performance parameters, the browser can send a request to the shipping management system and the shipping management system can aggregate data from records associated with the respective account holder to determine the values for the selected metric.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0109">In the illustrated embodiment, the user has selected &#x201c;exception volume&#x201d; as the metric, a date range and all carriers represented in the records for the date range.

At step <b>502</b>, a shipping management system can access user account data for an account holder (e.g., access a user profile for an account holder) and load that account holder's carrier credentials for a carrier. The shipping management system can connect to a carrier system and generate a request to the carrier system using the account holder's carrier credentials (step <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>). For example, the shipping management system may provide the account holder's carrier credentials to the carrier system in conjunction with sending and API call or requesting a shipping report file from the carrier system. At step <b>510</b>, the shipping management system receives shipping information corresponding to the provided carrier credentials, where the shipping information is formatted according to a known format used by the carrier. At step <b>512</b>, extracts a shipment records. Each carrier-specific shipment record may uniquely identify a shipment by a unique identifier, such as a tracking number or other shipment number or some combination of information.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0112">At step <b>516</b>, the shipping management system selects a shipment record from the input data for processing. At step <b>518</b>, the shipping management system loads j carrier-specific mapping rules for the carrier from which the shipment record was received. At step <b>524</b>, the shipping management system parses the selected shipment record to determine a status code or description contained in the shipment record. At step <b>528</b>, the shipping management system applies a selected carrier specific rule. If the selected shipment record matches the selected carrier-specific rule, control passes to step <b>534</b>, where the shipping management system transforms the record by setting the status code and, in some cases, exception flag for the shipment record based on the selected rule, thus generating normalized shipping data. Otherwise, the shipping management system repeats step <b>528</b> for each of the carrier-specific rules until a match is found or the rules are exhausted.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0113">At step <b>536</b>, the shipping management system determines if the transformed shipment record matches a shipment for which a record already exists in shipping management system.

Shipping management system can create a new shipping record for the shipment and create an association between the shipping record and the account holder. The shipment represented by the shipment record may be assigned an internal id in shipping management system. If the transformed shipment record indicates an event (e.g., includes shipping status information), shipping management system can also create a shipping event record and associate the event record with the shipping record.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0114">If the transformed shipment record does match an existing shipment in shipping management system, shipping management system can determine if the transformed shipment record contains a duplicative event for a pre-existing shipment in shipping management system (step <b>540</b>). If not, the shipping management system creates a new event record and associates the new event record with the shipment (step <b>542</b>). If the transformed shipment record is duplicative of an existing event record for a shipment, the transformed event record can be discarded (step <b>546</b>).

Network <b>714</b> may represent a combination of wired and wireless networks that network computing environment <b>700</b> may utilize for various types of network communications known to those skilled in the art. Shipping management system <b>702</b> can be bi-directionally coupled to a data store <b>703</b> storing a searchable collection of normalized shipping records <b>705</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0117">For the purpose of illustration, a single system is shown for shipping management system <b>702</b>. However, shipping management system <b>702</b> may comprise a plurality of computers (not shown) interconnected to each other over network <b>714</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0118">Shipping management system <b>702</b> can include a processor <b>720</b> (e.g., a CPU or other processor), read-only memory (&#x201c;ROM&#x201d;) <b>722</b>, random access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;) <b>724</b>, hard drive (&#x201c;HD&#x201d;) or storage memory <b>726</b>, and input/output device(s) (&#x201c;I/O&#x201d;) <b>728</b>. The I/O devices can include a keyboard, monitor, printer, electronic pointing device (such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, etc.), or the like. In various embodiments, the computer has access to at least one database over the network. Shipper computer systems <b>704</b> and a carrier computer systems <b>706</b> may each also include processors, memories, I/O and other computer components. Each search system <b>702</b>, shipper computer system <b>704</b> and carrier computer system <b>706</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may have more than one processor, ROM, RAM, HD, I/O, or other hardware components. For the sake of brevity, shipping management computer system <b>702</b> is illustrated as having one of each of the hardware components, even if more than one is used.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0119">Portions of the methods described herein may be implemented in suitable software code that may reside within ROM; RAM; HD or other computer-readable memory. Shipping management system <b>702</b>, for example, may include software components to implement a shipping management application <b>130</b>. Shipping management system <b>702</b>, for example, may include software components to implement data ingestion engine <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0120">Embodiments may thus provide a unified view operator interface for shipping management data from multiple sources. The systems, methods, and products include one or more dashboards (for example, a web-based dashboard generated by an interface module) accessible by a user that is associated with an account holder. From the dashboard, the user can view various metrics and access functions of a shipping system, such as scheduling shipments. In some embodiments, a user can click on exceptions and/or tracking menu items to see information for all shipments associated with the account holder or information for all shipments that have exceptions or tracking information. Numerous other embodiments are also possible.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0121">As described above, carriers have different ways to describe shipping status (e.g., tracking) information and shipment problem (e.g., exception) information. The system described provides a model for shipping status and shipping exceptions that considers many modes (parcel, LTL, white glove, etc.) and scenarios across the shipping landscapes. The system described also provides mechanisms to collect data from carriers &#x201c;as is&#x201d; and bring that into the system. The system includes mechanisms to map and transform the &#x201c;as is&#x201d; carrier data into a normalized model. The system provides a user interface to view and search data in the model to get shipment status, to gain insight, and to take action on problematic shipments.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0122">There are many advantages to a normalized representation of shipping data that are enabled by the system described in this disclosure. For example, with a normalized representation, the user and system can notify a recipient that their shipment is in a particular status, or has recently changed status, across different carriers. Moreover, the system simplies integration with BPM solutions as a single BPM rule may be applied across multiple carriers. Thus, embodiments described herein facilitate integration with a variety of software rules-based processes, such as BPM processes, to trigger processes when a shipment achieves a particular status or milestone. For example, the system can trigger processes to send messages (text, email, etc.) to recipients when shipments are delivered, pay a carrier for a shipment when the shipment is delivered, or to electronically file a claim when a shipment is damaged.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0123">Embodiments can also compare key performance indicators across carriers. For example, the system can determine and report information relating to the on-time delivery percentage of Carrier A vs. Carrier B. In another example, the system can compare the damage rates between Carrier A and Carrier B. In yet another example, the system can compare exception volumes. The system can also enable a user to easily compare the expected delivery date (typically provided by a carrier) and a retailer's promised delivery date (typically provided by a shipper or retailer) with the actual delivery data. The system can enable user to analyze other metrics in a similar manner. For example, the system enables user to easily compare the performance of different carriers with respect to damaged shipments, returned shipments, refused shipments, late deliveries, etc. The system also enables user to analyze shipments relating to special circumstances, such as returned shipments, shipments identified by customers as gifts, etc. Numerous other advantages and examples are also possible with the system.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0124">Another advantage of the shipping management system described above relates to sending notifications to users. Since the shipment data from multiple carriers is normalized, the system can easily send notifications to user regarding shipping events/shipping statuses of all of their shipments, even with multiple carriers involved. Without the system described above, a system would have to manage and send notifications to users separately for each carrier.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0125">Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the invention can be implemented or practiced with other computer system configurations including, without limitation, multi-processor systems, network devices, mini-computers, mainframe computers, data processors, and the like.
