These concerning events can stem from several different types of systems including: engine issues, leaking pump valves, unstable engine revolutions, and transmission issues. Furthermore, multiple concerning events can occur at the same time within a particular system. Moreover, all of these events can last for long durations of time, overlap temporally with each other, and have different levels of severity or contradicting methods of mitigation. Also, business priorities may not be known or easily found by an operator or crew such as those related to costs, history with a customer, and historical use of units. The business priorities may also differ between the crew, the customer, and management, which may also change based on real-time market conditions or job location. This myriad of issues distracts the operator and crew and can lead to costly, improper decisions being made during real-time operations.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to describe the manner in which the features and advantages of this disclosure can be obtained, a more particular description is provided with reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The following sections describe various additional features and examples with reference to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like elements, and directional descriptions are used to describe the illustrative aspects but, like the illustrative aspects, should not be used to limit the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example fracturing system <b>10</b> is shown. The example fracturing system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be implemented using the systems, methods, and techniques described herein. In particular, the disclosed system, methods, and techniques may directly or indirectly affect one or more components or pieces of equipment associated with the example fracturing system <b>10</b>, according to one or more embodiments. The fracturing system <b>10</b> includes a fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b>, a fluid source <b>30</b>, a solid source <b>40</b>, and a pump and blender system <b>50</b>. All or an applicable combination of these components of the fracturing system <b>10</b> can reside at the surface at a well site/fracturing pad where a well <b>60</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">During a fracturing job, the fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b> can access the fluid source <b>30</b> for introducing/controlling flow of a fluid, e.g. a fracturing fluid, in the fracturing system <b>10</b>. While only a single fluid source <b>30</b> is shown, the fluid source <b>30</b> can include a plurality of separate fluid sources. Further, the fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b> can be omitted from the fracturing system <b>10</b>. In turn, the fracturing fluid can be sourced directly from the fluid source <b>30</b> during a fracturing job instead of through the intermediary fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fracturing fluid can be an applicable fluid for forming fractures during a fracture stimulation treatment of the well <b>60</b>. For example, the fracturing fluid can include water, a hydrocarbon fluid, a polymer gel, foam, air, wet gases, and/or other applicable fluids. In various embodiments, the fracturing fluid can include a concentrate to which additional fluid is added prior to use in a fracture stimulation of the well <b>60</b>. In certain embodiments, the fracturing fluid can include a gel pre-cursor with fluid, e.g. liquid or substantially liquid, from fluid source <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the gel pre-cursor with fluid can be mixed by the fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b> to produce a hydrated fracturing fluid for forming fractures.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The solid source <b>40</b> can include a volume of one or more solids for mixture with a fluid, e.g. the fracturing fluid, to form a solid-laden fluid. The solid-laden fluid can be pumped into the well <b>60</b> as part of a solids-laden fluid stream that is used to form and stabilize fractures in the well <b>60</b> during a fracturing job. The one or more solids within the solid source <b>40</b> can include applicable solids that can be added to the fracturing fluid of the fluid source <b>30</b>. Specifically, the solid source <b>40</b> can contain one or more proppants for stabilizing fractures after they are formed during a fracturing job, e.g. after the fracturing fluid flows out of the formed fractures. For example, the solid source <b>40</b> can contain sand.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fracturing system <b>10</b> can also include additive source <b>70</b>. The additive source <b>70</b> can contain/provide one or more applicable additives that can be mixed into fluid, e.g. the fracturing fluid, during a fracturing job. For example, the additive source <b>70</b> can include solid-suspension-assistance agents, gelling agents, weighting agents, and/or other optional additives to alter the properties of the fracturing fluid. The additives can be included in the fracturing fluid to reduce pumping friction, to reduce or eliminate the fluid's reaction to the geological formation in which the well is formed, to operate as surfactants, and/or to serve other applicable functions during a fracturing job. The additives can function to maintain solid particle suspension in a mixture of solid particles and fracturing fluid as the mixture is pumped down the well <b>60</b> to one or more perforations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pump and blender system <b>50</b> functions to pump fracture fluid into the well <b>60</b>. Specifically, the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can pump fracture fluid from the fluid source <b>30</b>, e.g. fracture fluid that is received through the fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b>, into the well <b>60</b> for forming and potentially stabilizing fractures as part of a fracture job. The pump and blender system <b>50</b> can include one or more pumps. Specifically, the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can include a plurality of pumps that operate together, e.g. concurrently, to form fractures in a subterranean formation as part of a fracturing job. The one or more pumps included in the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can be an applicable type of fluid pump. For example, the pumps in the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can include electric pumps and/or hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon mixture powered pumps. Specifically, the pumps in the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can include diesel powered pumps, natural gas powered pumps, and diesel combined with natural gas powered pumps.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pump and blender system <b>50</b> can also function to receive the fracturing fluid and combine it with other components and solids. Specifically, the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can combine the fracturing fluid with volumes of solid particles, e.g. proppant, from the solid source <b>40</b> and/or additional fluid and solids from the additive source <b>70</b>. In turn, the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can pump the resulting mixture down the well <b>60</b> at a sufficient pumping rate to create or enhance one or more fractures in a subterranean zone, for example, to stimulate production of fluids from the zone. While the pump and blender system <b>50</b> is described to perform both pumping and mixing of fluids and/or solid particles, in various embodiments, the pump and blender system <b>50</b> can function to just pump a fluid stream, e.g. a fracture fluid stream, down the well <b>60</b> to create or enhance one or more fractures in a subterranean zone.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fracturing fluid producing apparatus <b>20</b>, fluid source <b>30</b>, and/or solid source <b>40</b> may be equipped with one or more monitoring devices (not shown). The monitoring devices can be used to control the flow of fluids, solids, and/or other compositions to the pumping and blender system <b>50</b>. Such monitoring devices can effectively allow the pumping and blender system <b>50</b> to source from one, some or all of the different sources at a given time. In turn, the pumping and blender system <b>50</b> can provide just fracturing fluid into the well at some times, just solids or solid slurries at other times, and combinations of those components at yet other times.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the well <b>60</b> during a fracturing operation in a portion of a subterranean formation of interest <b>102</b> surrounding a wellbore <b>104</b>. The fracturing operation can be performed using one or an applicable combination of the components in the example fracturing system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The wellbore <b>104</b> extends from the surface <b>106</b>, and the fracturing fluid <b>108</b> is applied to a portion of the subterranean formation <b>102</b> surrounding the horizontal portion of the wellbore. Although shown as vertical deviating to horizontal, the wellbore <b>104</b> may include horizontal, vertical, slant, curved, and other types of wellbore geometries and orientations, and the fracturing treatment may be applied to a subterranean zone surrounding any portion of the wellbore <b>104</b>. The wellbore <b>104</b> can include a casing <b>110</b> that is cemented or otherwise secured to the wellbore wall. The wellbore <b>104</b> can be uncased or otherwise include uncased sections.

For example, machine-learning classification schemes can utilize one or more of the following, alone or in combination: hidden Markov models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs); Deep Learning networks, Bayesian symbolic methods, general adversarial networks (GANs), support vector machines, image registration methods, and/or applicable rule-based systems. Where regression algorithms are used, they can include but are not limited to: a Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressors, and/or Passive Aggressive Regressors, etc.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Machine learning classification models can also be based on clustering algorithms (e.g., a Mini-batch K-means clustering algorithm), a recommendation algorithm (e.g., a Miniwise Hashing algorithm, or Euclidean Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm), and/or an anomaly detection algorithm, such as a Local outlier factor. Additionally, machine-learning models can employ a dimensionality reduction approach, such as, one or more of: a Mini-batch Dictionary Learning algorithm, an Incremental Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm, and/or a Mini-batch K-means algorithm, etc.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Multiphase production profiling can be an essential component of a production management program. A production management program can incorporate multidisciplinary technologies. For example, each production management program can be unique and be designed exclusively for a reservoir of interest. One of the elements of production management can include production optimization. Production optimization can include early identification of inefficiencies when they occur. However, there are factors that can be challenging and hinder efforts to obtain desired results of the production management program. For example, insufficient surveillance data, in a timely manner, can be one of the factors that leads to a less effective production management program.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Production Logging Tools (PLT) can be utilized to address well surveillance in terms of multiphase production profiling. PLT may have limitations that can inhibit their use in some types of wells. Well completion types are an example of such a limitation. In some types of wells, PLT may be unable to be performed due to the complexity of the completion. Another limitation is the well intervention itself, which can pose a health, safety, and environment (HSE) risk. Moreover, the PLT can provide a snapshot of the well condition, as continuous monitoring of the dynamic nature of a well flow regime is not possible, which can introduce a fair degree of uncertainty in the reservoir surveillance data.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The disclosed technology can include continuous production monitoring that can provide several optimization opportunities such as minimizing water production through downhole or surface choking; improving oil/gas recovery through the adjustment of a choke size; identifying inefficient areas that may require improvement (e.g., workover/well intervention); reducing of reservoir water disposal when less water is produced; and reducing the cost associated with periodical PLT runs.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">While PLT can deliver useful information relating to production data, the PLT may not be left in the well for a long period of time. In addition, PLT may not continuously measure entire producing intervals as PLT is a point sensor. For example, PLT may not be able to track entire reservoir production sensitivities to different flow regimes that are adjusted at a surface choke or at Interval Control Valves (ICV). Though smart wells are becoming more popular, they are still unable to provide fast manipulation of ICV's that result in production optimization.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As provided above, during hydraulic fracturing operations, a multi-unit pumping system, such as a fracturing spread including multiple pumps and blenders, may experience many events that can lead to safety concerns, damage to the equipment, performance failure of a job, and cost-inefficient processes to complete the job. These concerning events can stem from several different types of systems including: CAT engine issues, leaking pump valves, unstable engine revolutions, and transmission issues. Furthermore, multiple concerning events can occur at the same time within a particular system. Moreover, all of these events can last for long durations of time, overlap temporally with each other, and have different levels of severity or methods of mitigation. Also, business priorities may not be known or easily found by an operator or crew such as those related to costs, history with a customer, and historical use of units. The business priorities may also differ between the crew, the customer, and management, which may also change based on real-time market conditions or job geography. This myriad of issues distract the operator and crew and can lead to costly, improper decisions being made during real-time operations.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As such, a need exists for optimizing multi-unit pumping operations during hydraulic fracturing operations.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example diagram of a control system for hydraulic fracturing operations <b>600</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

Data obtained from the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and the blender <b>640</b> can then be provided to corresponding event diagnostics <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, <b>626</b>, <b>628</b> of the diagnostic modules <b>620</b> to perform diagnostic processes such as those related to flow rate, pressure, temperature, engine RPM, fluid levels, leakage rates, solids concentration, gas-oil ratio, viscosity, friction reducer concentration, fluid type, solids type, hours of equipment use, and equipment data.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, the equipment system <b>630</b> (e.g., Equipment System 1) can include the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and blenders <b>640</b> that have a current physical and status state of the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and blenders <b>640</b> at any given instance of time.

At set times, when requested or triggered by an external event, the full state of the equipment system <b>630</b> can be provided to the diagnostic modules <b>620</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, the event diagnostics <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, <b>626</b>, <b>628</b> can generate event flags <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b> based on the data from the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and the blender <b>640</b> of the equipment system <b>630</b>. The event flags <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b> of the diagnostic modules <b>620</b> can include data and information indicating that the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> or the blender <b>640</b> of the equipment system <b>630</b> are not performing at an optical or desired level, anonymous engine deviation when engine RPM varies more than an expected amount, low level of engine fluid indicating a leak, engines overheating, low pressure, and low solids rate. The diagnostic modules <b>620</b> can then provide the event flags <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b> to the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some implementations, the diagnostic modules <b>620</b> can determine if an event of note occurred in the equipment system <b>630</b>. For example, the events of note can include dynamic changes to the whole control system <b>600</b> (e.g., an engine experiencing RPM amplitude changes, ten times more extreme than normal) and static events such as an error code being present for more than 10 minutes. These events can be related to physical properties of the equipment (e.g., systems <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>630</b>), such as engine RPM, an amount of fluid in the pump <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b>, status of the equipment (e.g., a transmission condition monitoring code), and user activity (e.g., a valve being closed). Both of the current and past system states or portions of the past system state can be used to examine the event of note by the control system <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In other implementations, when an event occurs (e.g., as noted by a flag <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b>), the diagnostic modules <b>620</b> can provide information relating to the event to the diagnostic manager <b>604</b>. The diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can then correlate the event flag <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b> with a list of undesired operations that have occurred at the equipment system 1 <b>630</b>. For example, a particular volume of fluid in a pump tank can correspond to a cavitation event. Another example can include a sudden voltage drop at a sensor in the engine that corresponds to a corroded spark plug. Yet another example can include operations from distinct units with the control system <b>600</b> that when examined, individually, appear within acceptable operating limits. However, when combined, the operations from the distinct units may be outside operating limits. For example, two pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> can be providing the same flow rate as one another. However, one pump may be pumping produced water while the other pump may be pumping fresh water. This example can provide an unacceptable ratio of fresh water to produced water (assuming only 10% produced water was desired). In response, the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can issue a notification to the equipment manager <b>602</b> indicating that the triggered event has occurred.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As multiple events can be triggered concurrently or approximately concurrently, the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can notify the equipment manager <b>602</b> of all these events simultaneously, batched together in a time-gated process, or upon request from the equipment manager <b>602</b>. The diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can further provide the equipment manager <b>602</b> with meta-data related to the event, such as a recommended action, a duration of the event, unit(s) the event is tied to, and selected statuses or physical values of the physical systems related to the event.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can receive the list of events along with corresponding meta-data that may be related to the events. The equipment manager <b>602</b> can also determine if, when, and how to change physical operations (e.g., flow rate, pressure, RPM settings) of the equipment (e.g., the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and the blender <b>640</b>) of the equipment system 1 <b>630</b> to stop triggering the unwanted event. In addition to the list of events for the equipment system 1 <b>630</b>, information from other equipment systems <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, controllers <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>, and operational objectives from businesses <b>650</b> can be utilized in consideration of changing physical operations of the equipment of the equipment system 1 <b>630</b>. A rating system can be used to prioritize the event to be dealt with or prioritize any recommendations.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other implementations, the control system <b>600</b> can include a rating system that can be provided by a user on site, a remote operator, or an algorithm (e.g., techniques such as clustering, neural networks, and other machine learning and deep learning approaches including using feedback, severity/probability/cost ranking, or other approaches suitable for the intended purpose and understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art). Upon determining if and when a change to the physical operation may occur, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can determine the best method and time to undergo such an operation. For example, a total flow rate may be increased by 20%, but the equipment manager <b>602</b> may determine that it is more cost effective (e.g., implementing a final physical action) to increase the flow rate of a first pump by 30%, a second pump by 20%, and all other pumps by 10%. The equipment manager <b>602</b> may then provide the final physical action to the operator <b>660</b> or an operator's device by automatically undertaking the final physical action or as a recommendation that the operator <b>660</b> may approve.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, events, recommendations, and final actions, as described herein, can be recorded and displayed both locally and remotely for use in real-time operational and logistical decision making by the control system <b>600</b>. For example, if a valve appears to be close to failing, not only can a notification be sent to an operator <b>602</b> and a regional manager, but a purchase request for a new valve may also be automatically placed for delivery either to the job site, a work camp, or a repair yard/center.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other examples, the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can receive the event flags <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>674</b>, <b>676</b> from the diagnostic modules <b>620</b> and determine whether there is an issue with one of the corresponding pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and blender <b>640</b> of the equipment system <b>630</b>. For example, the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can determine the severity of the issue with one of the corresponding pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and blender <b>640</b> of the equipment system <b>630</b>, pump failure, and improper clean/dirty flow ratio. If the flow rate of the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> is too high or low, or if the blender <b>640</b> is providing incorrect amounts of liquid, the issues determined by the diagnostic manager <b>604</b> can be provided to the equipment manager <b>602</b> for further action.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some implementations, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can further receive data or information from the external controllers <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> and the systems <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, as also described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. For example, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can receive requested physical actions from the external controller 1 <b>606</b> and the system 3 <b>610</b>. The equipment manager <b>602</b> can further receive and provide controller requests and recommended actions with the external controller 2 <b>608</b> and the system 2 <b>612</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other implementations, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can further receive instructions or information relating to business action rankings <b>650</b>. For example, the equipment manager <b>602</b> can be configured to provide priority to certain actions based on the business action rankings <b>650</b>. The equipment manager <b>602</b> can be preconfigured with a priority list or provided with instructions along with the business action rankings <b>650</b> when the business action rankings <b>650</b> is received. A hierarchy listing of the business action rankings <b>650</b> can provide priority of particular actions to be performed before other actions listed in the hierarchical order. For example, the business action rankings <b>650</b> can include rankings based on a level of authority such as a county manager versus a regional manager. In such an example, if the instructions provided by the county manager conflicts with the instructions provided by the regional manager, the instructions of the county manager will be accepted and procured by the equipment manager <b>602</b> if the county manager has a higher priority than the regional manager. The business action rankings <b>650</b> can further include utilizing information and data relating to: pumps with greater hours of use that can have reduced pressures and flow rates to ease use, additives that are less expensive that can be used instead of additives that are more effective, and priorities that can be switched if the client decides to augment a contract.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, the control system <b>600</b> can also evaluate an operational status of equipment (e.g., the equipment system <b>630</b>) and take actions (e.g., alerting an operator <b>660</b>, adjusting a flow rate distribution among a fleet of pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b>, and automatically taking a pump <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> offline). For example, the control system <b>600</b> can take certain actions based on a contemporaneous state of an entire pumping system (e.g., equipment system <b>630</b>) and ranking of business priorities <b>650</b>. Additionally, during hydraulic fracturing operations, the ranking of business priorities <b>650</b> can be adjusted in real-time and by an authorized manager (e.g., the equipment manager <b>602</b>) from a secure remote location.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The control system <b>600</b> can evaluate an entire multi-unit pumping system (e.g., equipment system <b>630</b>) simultaneously to determine actions that can be taken on individual components of the control system <b>600</b> including incorporating business-derived concerns in view of physical automation actions to be taken by the control system <b>600</b>. Some of the benefits of the control system <b>600</b> can include protecting crew members, equipment, and the job site automatically. The control system <b>600</b> can also adjust operations as new real-time physical (e.g., from the external controllers <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>) and business knowledge (e.g., from the business action ranking <b>650</b>) becomes available to the control system <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some implementations, the diagnostic modules <b>604</b> can be a part of the diagnostic manager <b>604</b>. The diagnostic modules <b>6020</b> can further be a part of each piece of equipment (e.g., the pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and the blender <b>640</b>) in the equipment system <b>630</b>. As described herein, any components of the control system <b>600</b> can be deployed at a location on the equipment itself, as a standalone computer, or remotely with system states and final physical actions being communicated between the job location and the remote location. Fourier, Wavelet, and other harmonic analysis of time series can also be used for signal analysis, such as denoising or for multi-resolution analysis, to determine system misbehavior.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example controller system of utilizing asynchronous and synchronous messages <b>700</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. In some implementations, the controller system <b>700</b> can include a controller <b>710</b>, a local controller <b>720</b>, and a system <b>730</b>. In some examples, the system <b>730</b> can include actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b> and sensors <b>738</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>742</b> that can be connected to devices such as pumps <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>, <b>638</b> and blenders <b>640</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In other examples, the local controller <b>720</b> can be positioned approximate to or within the system <b>730</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">During hydraulic fracturing operations, a multi-unit pumping system, such as a fracturing spread including multiple pumps and blenders, can send telemetry information between a variety of units with different requirements relating to the frequency of communication. Previously, to control the multi-unit pumping system, a commander requires constant synchronous, two-way communication between multiple systems to ensure the safety of the crew and equipment. However, the data supplied to the commander by the multiple systems is often asynchronous, leading to potential inconsistencies in the known state of the system, which can lead to hazardous and costly decisions by an automated system.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some implementations, the controller system <b>700</b> can reconcile asynchronous data arriving from the sensors <b>738</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>742</b> and other system status information (e.g., from the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>) for synchronous coordination with controls of the controller system <b>700</b>. For example, the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize unique identifiers (e.g., AA, aa, BB, bb, CC, cc, etc.) for each control series to ensure grouping of asynchronistic and synchronistic data (e.g., from the sensors <b>738</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>742</b> and the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, respectively). In some implementations, the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize a centralized processor for control or be an independent controller system that can self-diagnose and control a system, which can be distributed across multiple units or remotely.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller system <b>700</b> can reconcile synchronous and asynchronous data inputs and control requirements. The controller system <b>700</b> can also distribute control among multiple units (e.g., system <b>730</b>), locally and remotely, stabilize control architecture, and adjust accordingly when a unit (e.g., system <b>730</b>) is disconnected from the network of the controller system <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some implementations, for an asynchronous protocol, timing for receiving data can be flexible. For example, data can be provided and received based on a pre-defined trigger event <b>750</b> (e.g., 1 sample on a trigger event, Sensor 1 <b>738</b>), a pre-defined rate <b>752</b> (e.g., 1 sample(s), Sensor 2 <b>740</b>), or on a request <b>754</b> (e.g., 1 sample on request, Sensor 3 <b>742</b>). Conversely, to ensure a known state, commands from the controller <b>710</b> can require synchronicity for any handshaking between the controller <b>710</b> and the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>. For example, several commands can be issued from the controller <b>710</b> to the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b> in a short period of time. If the operations (e.g., the several commands) take different amounts of time for each actuator <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b> to accomplish, completion messages can be returned to the controller <b>710</b> in an order that is different from when the initial commands were provided to the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>. To determine which messages came from which of the actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize unique identifiers to track the origin and progress of each command and response mechanism.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize unique message tags to marry asynchronous and synchronous messages between the controller <b>710</b> and the system <b>730</b>. Each piece of data between the controller <b>710</b> and the system <b>730</b> can include a unique identifier (e.g., AA can be associated with data for Sensor 1 <b>738</b>, BB can be associated with data for Sensor 2 <b>740</b>, and CC can be associated with data for Sensor 3 <b>742</b>) to enable tracking of the data. The data between the controller <b>710</b> and the system <b>730</b> can further include additions or changes to the unique identifiers to track the status of the message (e.g., CC response to CC request). Similarly, each command/response message can also be associated with its own tag (e.g., aa or bb) or unique identifier to allow tracking of each message between the controller <b>710</b> and the system <b>730</b>. Examples of utilizing the unique identifiers of the controller system <b>700</b> include:</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">1) Sensor 1 <b>738</b> provides a data sample AA relating to a triggered event <b>750</b> such as a pressure of a pump going beyond a pre-determined threshold. Simultaneously, the controller <b>710</b> can request valve health information from Sensor 3 <b>742</b>, which the Sensor 3 <b>742</b> can receive as a message CC. In the example, the controller <b>710</b> can receive both of the data sample AA and the message CC simultaneously, which may cause the controller <b>710</b> to issue requests bb (e.g., relating to data sample AA and message CC as &#x201c;bb&#x2014; AA CC&#x201d;) to open a valve to release pressure at Actuator 3 <b>736</b>. In this example, the Actuator 3 <b>736</b> can receive multiple instructions from the controller <b>710</b>: 1) instructions to open the value due to the data sample AA received from the Sensor 1 <b>738</b>; and 2) instructions to keep the valve at the Actuator 3 <b>736</b> in its current position, indefinitely, due to the message CC from the Sensor 3 <b>742</b>. As such, the Actuator 3 <b>736</b> can receive both requests and responses. However, it is unclear in this example if the response AA from the Sensor 1 <b>738</b> or the response CC from the Sensor 3 <b>742</b> occurred first, which can leave the controller system <b>700</b> in two different states (e.g., one state with an indefinitely opened valve and another state with a valve that is partially opened, indefinitely). As described herein, the controller <b>710</b> of the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize unique identifiers/tags that can be used for the data event (e.g., the data sample AA and the message CC), which can be added and used both for sending a command and for receipt of a response.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">2) Sensor 2 <b>740</b> provides data BB to the controller <b>710</b> once per second <b>754</b> (e.g., a pre-determined pump rate). The controller <b>710</b> can then provide commands aa to the system <b>730</b> (e.g., as &#x201c;aa BB&#x201d;) to maintain a specific pump rate for two pumps (e.g., one pump controlled by Actuator 1 <b>732</b> and another pump controlled by Actuator 2 <b>734</b>). The controller <b>710</b> can provide the message (e.g., command aa BB) to the local controller <b>720</b> with the unique tag aa BB, which can then provide the corresponding message to the Actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>. In the example where a local controller is available, the message can also indicate which of the Actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> to provide the message to, such as &#x201c;aa BB&#x2014;1 2.&#x201d; The message &#x201c;aa BB&#x2014;1 2&#x201d; can indicate to the local controller <b>720</b> that message aa BB is to be provided to Actuator &#x201c;1&#x201d; <b>732</b> and Actuator &#x201c;2&#x201d; <b>734</b>. The local controller <b>720</b> can also enable a PID feedback algorithm (e.g., a proportional, an integral, or a derivative controller) to maintain the pump rates at the Actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>. Each of the Actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> can also provide their respective status information to the controller <b>710</b> of the controller system <b>700</b> as confirmation. In other examples, the additions of tags &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;2&#x201d; to the unique message/tag (e.g., message &#x201c;aa BB&#x201d;) can inform the controller <b>710</b> that the command aa BB has been received and that the Actuators <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> have acted accordingly pursuant to the instructions in the message aa BB.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some implementations, the controller system <b>700</b> can utilize multiple identifiers within each data message, command, request, or response. For example, one identifier can track a message as a whole (e.g., as described above), while another identifier can track how many operations have been taken in the message. In some implementations, an identifier can also be incremented during each operation and serve as a checksum to ensure that it matches with what the program expects. This identifier can also be equipment agnostic, and rather, depend on a number of operations. The use of multiple identifiers can enable greater ease of following the process of a command and its effects for easier debugging at a future time. For example, the changes in the identifier can be tracked and formed into a log that can be utilized at a future time. The state when an issue occurs and the pattern of states before can also be examined to determine whether anything foreshadows a possible issue. In some examples, the identifiers can be unique to a particular equipment, system type, measurement type, date/time, or any combination thereof, and include metadata such as information relating to crew members, operators, customer information, and well site/location. Unique combinations of status flags can also be used as identifiers by the controller system <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example distributed system of utilizing asynchronous and synchronous messages <b>800</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.
