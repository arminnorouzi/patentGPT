The blockchain can be organized as a sequence of blocks. A block can be added to the blockchain after a discrete duration of time has elapsed since a previous block was added to the blockchain. A block can include one or more records of data received by an electronic ledger system within the discrete duration of time since the previous block was added to the blockchain. A current block can include a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and the one or more records of data that are a subject of the current block. The hash of the previous block can be a cryptographic hash. Another hash can represent the one or more records of data that are the subject of the current block. The other hash can be, for example, a merkle tree root hash. Because a subsequent block can include a hash of the current block, etc., an alteration of a record of data included in the blockchain can be determined by reference to hashes included in subsequent blocks.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The electronic ledger system can operate the blockchain. The electronic ledger system can include an electronic device or, alternatively, can include several electronic devices disposed in a peer-to-peer network. An electronic ledger system in which several electronic devices are disposed in a peer-to-peer network can be referred to as a distributed ledger system. Each electronic device in the distributed ledger system can be referred to as a node of the distributed ledger system. Each node can save a copy of the blockchain. In response to a block being added to the blockchain, each node can update its copy of the blockchain. A consensus algorithm can receive, from the nodes, respective copies of the blockchain. The consensus algorithm can determine a consensus about which of the respective copies of the blockchain is a correct copy of the blockchain. In response to a determination of the consensus, the nodes can update their respective copies of the blockchain to be the correct copy of the blockchain. Because a distributed ledger system can use a consensus algorithm to determine the correct copy of the blockchain, an alteration of a record of data included in a copy of the blockchain stored at a node of the distributed ledger system can be prevented from being deemed to be the correct copy of the record of data. In this manner, a distributed ledger system can be used to ensure an authenticity of a record of data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the efficacy of a distributed ledger system in ensuring an authenticity of a record of data depends upon a copy of the record of data that is transmitted to the distributed ledger system being a correct copy. Particularly in the case of a record of data associated with a transaction between entities, having an incorrect copy of the record of data transmitted to the distributed ledger system can cause one or more errors in the transaction to the detriment of one or both of the entities associated with the transaction. Significantly, in response to an incorrect copy of a record of data having been transmitted to the distributed ledger system, the nodes of the distributed ledger system can needlessly waste a substantial amount of time and energy updating their respective copies of the blockchain to include the incorrect copy of the record of data. For example, an average Bitcoin transaction on the Bitcoin.org blockchain consumes about 215 kilowatt-hours of energy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Conventional techniques for authenticating a record of data before having the record of data transmitted to the distributed ledger system are inadequate. Authentication based upon knowledge or an authenticating item (e.g., a password, a token, etc.) is insufficient because an entity, different from the entities associated with the record of data, can obtain the knowledge (e.g., password) or possession of the authenticating item (e.g., token). Although authentication based upon an inherence factor (e.g., a biometric identifier) can prevent such an entity from authenticating a record of data, such a technique still does not ensure that the entity performing the authentication of the record of data does so with correct knowledge of a subject matter of the record of data.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosed technologies can prevent an incorrect copy of a record of data from being transmitted to a distributed ledger system. A first file can be received. The first file can include information, in audio form or video form, with: (1) a description of a subject matter of the record of data and (2) an authorization to cause a copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the distributed ledger system. The first file can be sent to a device. A second file can be received from the device. The second file can include information that confirms that: (1) the description of the subject matter, included in the first file, is correct, and (2) an entity, which controlled production of the first file, has permission to authorize causing the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the distributed ledger system. The correct copy of the record of data can be caused, based on a receipt of the first file and the second file, to be transmitted to the distributed ledger system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an environment <b>100</b> for preventing a transmission of an incorrect copy of a record of data to an electronic network <b>102</b>, according to the disclosed technologies. The environment <b>100</b> can include, for example, the electronic network <b>102</b> and a system <b>104</b> for preventing transmission of an incorrect copy of a record of data to the electronic network <b>102</b>. The record of data can be associated with an item for which an authentication of a copy is important. For example, the record of data can be associated with a transaction, a will or testament, a document related to a quality assurance program, a document to be used as evidence in a judicial proceeding, or the like. The electronic network <b>102</b> can include a distributed ledger system. If the record of data is associated with a transaction, then, additionally or alternatively, the electronic network <b>102</b> can include one or more of an Automated Clearing House network, a payment rail network, another electronic ledger system, or the like. If the electronic network <b>102</b> is a distributed ledger system, then the record of data can be included, by the distributed ledger system, in a block to be added, by the distributed ledger system, to a blockchain.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to receive <b>106</b><i>a </i>a copy of the record of data from a device <b>108</b><i>a </i>associated with a second entity. Alternatively and optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to receive <b>110</b> the copy of the record of data from a device <b>112</b>. The device <b>112</b> can be different from the device <b>108</b><i>a </i>associated with the second entity. For example, if the record of data is associated with a transaction, the device <b>112</b> can be associated with one of the entities associated with the transaction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system <b>104</b> can be configured to receive <b>114</b><i>a </i>a first file. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to receive <b>114</b><i>a </i>the first file from the device <b>108</b><i>a </i>associated with the second entity. The first file can include a first information. The first information can be in audio form or video form. The first information can include a description of a subject matter of the record of data. The first information can include an authorization to cause the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>. The second entity can be an individual or an organization. For example, the first information can be a video or audio recording, produced under a control of the second entity, that states, &#x201c;This is Bob Smith, chief financial officer of Bigco. I hereby authorize the transfer of $7 million from the Bigco account with Empire State Bank to the account that Upstart has with First National Bank.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a first optional implementation of the disclosed technologies, the description of the subject matter can be required to include one or more specific words or phrases. For example, if this first optional implementation requires the use of the word &#x201c;authorize,&#x201d; then a video or audio recording that states, &#x201c;This is Bob Smith, chief financial officer of Bigco. I hereby approve the transfer of $7 million from the Bigco account with Empire State Bank to the account that Upstart has with First National Bank.&#x201d; can be a reason to treat the first information as not including an authorization to cause the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>. For example, it is possible that Bob Smith misspoke his statement. Alternatively, it is possible that Bob Smith deliberately spoke the word &#x201c;approve&#x201d; so that the first information would be treated as not including an authorization to cause the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>. For example, Bob Smith may have been under duress because he was compelled to make the video or audio recording.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine a type of the subject matter of the record of data. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine that the type of the subject matter of the record of data is &#x201c;a withdrawal of funds from the Bigco account with Empire State Bank.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine an identity of the second entity. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine that Bob Smith is the identity of the second entity. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine the identity of the second entity from an identity of the device <b>108</b><i>a </i>associated with the second entity. Additionally or alternatively, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine the identity of the second entity by analyzing the first information to determine the identity of the second entity. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to use image data processing techniques, face recognition techniques, audio data processing techniques, voice recognition techniques, the like, or some combination of the foregoing to determine the identity of the second entity.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine, based on the identity and the type of the subject matter, that the second entity has permission to cause the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>. For example, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine, based on: (1) the identity of the second entity being Bob Smith and (2) the type of the subject matter of the file of software being &#x201c;a withdrawal of funds from the Bigco account with Empire State Bank,&#x201d; that Bob Smith has permission to cause the copy of the record of data (in which the type of the subject matter is &#x201c;a withdrawal of funds from the Bigco account with Empire State Bank&#x201d;) to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>. For example, if the type of the subject matter was &#x201c;a withdrawal of funds from the Bigco account with Pension Management Corporation&#x201d; (the company that manages the pension funds of the employees of Bigco), then the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine, based on the identity and the type of the subject matter, that the second entity does not have permission to cause the copy of the record of data to be transmitted to the electronic network <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, the system <b>104</b> can be configured to determine, based on the type of the subject matter, a device <b>116</b><i>a </i>associated with a first entity. The first entity can be an individual or an organization.

The device <b>20</b> can include a bus <b>21</b> (which can interconnect major components of the computer <b>20</b>, such as a central processor <b>24</b>), a memory <b>27</b> (such as random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), flash RAM, or the like), a user display <b>22</b> (such as a display screen), a user input interface <b>26</b> (which can include one or more controllers and associated user input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and the like), a fixed storage <b>23</b> (such as a hard drive, flash storage, and the like), a removable media component <b>25</b> (operative to control and receive an optical disk, flash drive, and the like), and a network interface <b>29</b> operable to communicate with one or more remote devices via a suitable network connection.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The bus <b>21</b> can allow data communication between the central processor <b>24</b> and one or more memory components, which can include RAM, ROM, and other memory, as previously noted. Typically RAM can be the main memory into which an operating system and application programs are loaded. A ROM or flash memory component can contain, among other code, the basic input-output system (BIOS) which can control basic hardware operation such as the interaction with peripheral components. Applications resident with the computer <b>20</b> can generally be stored on and accessed via a computer readable medium, such as a hard disk drive (e.g., fixed storage <b>23</b>), an optical drive, floppy disk, or other storage medium.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The fixed storage <b>23</b> can be integral with the computer <b>20</b> or can be separate and accessed through other interfaces. The network interface <b>29</b> can provide a direct connection to a remote server via a wired or wireless connection. The network interface <b>29</b> can provide such connection using any suitable technique and protocol as is readily understood by one of skill in the art, including digital cellular telephone, WiFi&#x2122;, Bluetooth&#xae;, near-field, and the like. For example, the network interface <b>29</b> can allow the computer to communicate with other computers via one or more local, wide-area, or other communication networks, as described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Many other devices or components (not shown) can be connected in a similar manner (e.g., document scanners, digital cameras and so on). Conversely, all of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> need not be present to practice the disclosed technologies. The components can be interconnected in different ways from that illustrated. The operation of a computer such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is readily known in the art and is not discussed in detail in this application. Code to implement the disclosed technologies can be stored in computer-readable storage media such as one or more of the memory <b>27</b>, fixed storage <b>23</b>, removable media <b>25</b>, or on a remote storage location.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">More generally, various configurations of the presently disclosed technologies can include or be realized in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. Configurations also can be realized in the form of a computer program product having computer program code containing instructions embodied in non-transitory and/or tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, universal serial bus (USB) drives, or any other machine readable storage medium, such that when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing configurations of the disclosed technologies. Configurations also can be realized in the form of computer program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, such that when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing configurations of the disclosed technologies. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some configurations, a set of computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium can be implemented by a general-purpose processor, which can transform the general-purpose processor or a device containing the general-purpose processor into a special-purpose device configured to implement or carry out the instructions. Configurations can be implemented using hardware that can include a processor, such as a general purpose microprocessor and/or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that embodies all or part of the techniques according to configurations of the disclosed technologies in hardware and/or firmware. The processor can be coupled to memory, such as RAM, ROM, flash memory, a hard disk or any other device capable of storing electronic information. The memory can store instructions adapted to be executed by the processor to perform the techniques according to configurations of the disclosed technologies.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific configurations. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit configurations of the disclosed technologies to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The configurations were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of configurations of the disclosed technologies and their practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to utilize those configurations as well as various configurations with various modifications as may be suited to the particular use contemplated.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
