Preferable additive agents to be blended in the curable composition include a dispersing agent, an adhesion promoting agent such as a silane coupling agent, an antioxidant agent, a flocculation inhibiting agent, an antifoaming agent, a surfactant, and the like. The surfactant is not particularly limited, and well-known components such as a fluorine-based surfactant and a silicon-based surfactant can be used.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">[Method for Producing Curable Composition]</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0172">A curable composition is produced by mixing respective components described above in a predetermined amount, and then uniformly stirring the resulting mixture.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">&#x3c;Method for Producing Cured Product&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0173">The above-described curable composition is formed into a cured product typically by a method including, molding a curable composition, preferably according to the shape of the cured product to be formed, and exposing the molded curable composition to light.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0174">The cured product produced by the above method shows, for example, a high refractive index at a wavelength of 550 nm of preferably 1.60 or more, more preferably 1.61 or more, more preferably 1.62 or more, and particularly preferably 1.63 or more. The upper limit of the refractive index at a wavelength of 550 nm is not particularly limited, but it may be, for example, 3.0 or less, 2.5 or less, 2.0 or less, 1.9 or less, or the like. On the other hand, the cured product produced by the above method has, for example, a reflectance of preferably less than 2.5% and more preferably less than 2.0% over the entire 380 to 780 nm wavelength region. For this reason, the cured product produced by the above method is suitably used in an optical application requiring a high refractive index and suppression of reflectance increase.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0175">For example, a film made of the cured product of the curable composition mentioned above is suitably used as a high refractive index film constituting an antireflection film or the like in various display panels such as organic EL display panels and liquid crystal display panels.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0176">A film thickness of the high refractive index film including the cured product of the curable composition mentioned above is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on applications. The film thickness of the high refractive index film is typically preferably 1 nm or more and 40 &#x3bc;m or less, and more preferably 50 nm or more and 30 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0177">A method for forming the curable composition is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on the shape of the cured product. The shape of the cured product includes, although is not limited thereto, a film shape, a lens shape, a line shape, a prism shape, and the like. Among these shapes, a film shape is preferable. A method for molding the curable composition is not particularly limited. When the shape of the cured product is a lens shape or a prism shape, the curable composition may be filled in a mold according to the shape of the cured product by using a squeegee or the like. When the shape of the cured product is a line shape, a curable composition may be applied on the base material depending on the shape of the cured product. Examples of the applying method include a printing method such as an ink jet method. Examples of the method for applying the cured material to the film shape include a contact transfer type coating apparatus such as a roll coater, a reverse coater, a bar coater, and the like, and a non-contact type coating apparatus such as a spinner (rotary type coating apparatus) and a curtain flow coater. Also, the curable composition can also be applied to the film shape by a printing method such as an ink jet method.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0178">When the curable composition includes a solvent (S), the curable composition is molded into a desired shape, and then the solvent (S) may be removed from the molded curable composition by, for example, heating.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0179">Note here that, for example, the curable composition molded in a desired shape such as a film shape may be exposed to a degree that the curable composition is not completely cured, and then the curable composition in a semi-cured state may be shaped by a method such as an imprint method. In this case, the shaped curable composition in the semi-cured state is further exposed to light, and the curable composition is sufficiently cured to a desired degree. Furthermore, the curable composition may be applied to a 3D printing method, and a cured product having a desired shape may be formed by laminating a cured product having a thin film shape by repeating ink jet printing and curing by exposure.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0180">As the exposure method for curing the curable composition molded by the above-described method, various methods known as curing methods of a photosensitive composition can be suitably applied. The molded curable composition is exposed to active energy rays such as ultraviolet rays or excimer laser light.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0181">Light exposure for the molded curable composition may be position-selectively performed by a method in which exposure is performed via a mask. When exposure is position-selectively performed, exposed curable composition is developed using an organic solvent to remove an unexposed portion, and thus the patterned cured product can be formed. When developing is carried out, it is preferable that the developing solution is sufficiently removed by methods such as drying by heating after development.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0182">By the method described above, using the above-mentioned curable composition including only a small amount of the solvent (S), a cured product having a desired shape and showing high refractive index is formed.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0215" num="0183">The present invention will be more specifically descried below by way of Examples, but the scope of the present invention is not limited to these Examples.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Examples 1 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2</heading><p id="p-0216" num="0184">In Examples and Comparative Examples, as the photopolymerizable monomer (A), the following compounds were used.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0000">&#x3c;Compound Represented by Formula (a1)&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0218" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00057" num="00057"><img id="EMI-C00057" he="158.75mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002520A1-20230105-C00057.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">&#x3c;Polyfunctional Acrylic Monomer&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0219" num="0185">A2-a: compound having the following structure.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00058" num="00058"><img id="EMI-C00058" he="36.91mm" wi="68.50mm" file="US20230002520A1-20230105-C00058.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">&#x3c;Monofunctional Monomer&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0186">A3-a: phenyl vinyl sulfoxide</p><p id="p-0222" num="0187">A3-b: phenyl acrylate</p><p id="p-0223" num="0188">In Examples and Comparative Examples, as metal oxide nanoparticles (B), zirconium oxide particles B1 (average particle diameter: 10 nm, not surface modified) were used.
