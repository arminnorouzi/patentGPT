These common procedures include, but are by no means limited to, skin rejuvenation, wrinkle removal, skin tightening and lifting, cellulite and fat reduction, treatment of pigmented lesions, tattoo removal, soft tissue coagulation and ablation, vascular lesion reduction, face lifting, muscle contractions and muscle strengthening, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">All of these procedures are performed to improve a visual appearance of the patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides many indisputable advantages of a thermal therapy, these procedures also bring certain limitations and associated risks. Among others is the limited ability of reproducible results as these are highly dependent on applied treatment techniques and the operator's capabilities. Moreover, if the therapy is performed inappropriately, there is an increased risk of burns and adverse events.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is very difficult to ensure a homogeneous energy distribution if the energy delivery is controlled via manual movement of the operator's hand which is the most common procedure. Certain spots can be easily over- or under-treated. For this reason, devices containing scanning or other mechanisms capable of unattended skin delivery have emerged. These devices usually deliver energy without direct contact with the treated area, and only on a limited, well-defined area without apparent unevenness. Maintaining the same distance between the treated tissue and the energy generator or maintaining the necessary tissue contact may be challenging when treating uneven or rugged areas. Therefore, usage of commonly available devices on such specific areas that moreover differ from patient to patient (e.g. the face) might be virtually impossible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Facial unattended application is, besides the complications introduced by attachment to rugged areas and necessity of adaptation to the shapes of different patients, specific by its increased need for protection against burns and other side effects. Although the face heals more easily than other body areas, it is also more exposed, leading to much higher requirements for treatment downtime. Another important aspect of a facial procedure is that the face hosts the most important human senses, whose function must not be compromised during treatment. Above all, eye safety must be ensured throughout the entire treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The current aesthetic market offers either traditional manually controlled radiofrequency or light devices enabling facial tissue heating to a target temperature in the range of 40&#xb0; C.-100&#xb0; C. or unattended LED facial masks whose operation is based on light effects (phototherapy) rather than thermal effects. These masks are predominantly intended for home use and do not pose a risk to patients of burns, overheating or overtreating. The variability in facial shapes of individual patients does not represent any issue for these masks as the delivered energy and attained temperatures are so low that the risk of thermal tissue damage is minimized and there is no need for homogeneous treatment. Also, due to low temperatures, it is not important for such devices to maintain the predetermined distance between the individual diodes and the patient's skin, and the shape of the masks is only a very approximate representation of the human face. But their use is greatly limited by the low energy and minimal to no thermal effect and they are therefore considered as a preventive tool for daily use rather than a method of in-office skin rejuvenation with immediate effect.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Nowadays, the aesthetic market feels the needs of the combination of the heating treatment made by electromagnetic energy delivered to the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis or adipose tissue with the secondary energy providing muscle contraction or muscle stimulation in the field of improvement of visual appearance of the patient. However, none of the actual devices is adapted to treat the uneven rugged areas like the face. In addition, the commercially available devices are usually handheld devices that need to be operated by the medical professional during the whole treatment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus it is necessary to improve medical devices providing more than one treatment energy (e.g. electromagnetic energy and electric current), such that both energies may be deliver via different active elements or the same active element (e.g. electrode). Furthermore, the applicator or pad of the device needs to be attached to the patient which allows unattended treatment of the patient and the applicator or pad needs to be made of flexible material allowing sufficient contact with the uneven treatment area of the body part of the patient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to enable well defined unattended treatment of the uneven, rugged areas of a patient (e.g. facial area) while preserving safety, methods and devices of minimally invasive to non-invasive electromagnetic energy delivery via a single or a plurality of active elements have been proposed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The patient may include skin and a body part, wherein a body part may refer to a body area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The desired effect of the improvement of visual appearance of the patient may include tissue (e.g. skin) heating in the range of 40&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., tissue coagulation at temperatures of 40&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. or tissue ablation at temperatures of 60&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. Various patients and skin conditions may require different treatment approaches&#x2014;higher temperatures allow better results with fewer sessions but require longer healing times while lower temperatures enable treatment with no downtime but limited results within more sessions. Another effect of the heating may lead to decreasing the number of the fat cells.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another desired effect may be muscle contraction causing muscle stimulation (e.g. strengthening or toning) for improving the visual appearance of the patient.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An arrangement for contact or contactless therapy has been proposed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For contact therapy, the proposed device comprises at least one electromagnetic energy generator inside a main unit that generates an electromagnetic energy which is delivered to the treatment area via at least one active element attached to the skin. At least one active element may be embedded in a pad made of flexible material that adapts to the shape of the rugged surface. An underside of the pad may include of an adhesive layer allowing the active elements to adhere to the treatment area and to maintain necessary tissue contact. Furthermore, the device may employ a safety system capable of adjusting one or more therapy parameters based on the measured values from at least one sensor, e.g. thermal sensors or impedance measurement sensors capable of measuring quality of contact with the treated tissue.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For contactless therapy, the proposed device comprises at least one electromagnetic energy generator inside a main unit that generates an electromagnetic energy which is delivered to the treatment area via at least one active element located at a defined distance from the tissue to be treated. A distance of at least one active element from the treatment area may be monitored before, throughout the entire treatment or post-treatment. Furthermore, the device may employ a safety system capable of adjusting one or more therapy parameters based on the measured values from at least one sensor, for example one or more distance sensors. Energy may be delivered by a single or a plurality of static active elements or by moving a single or a plurality of active elements throughout the entire treatment area, for example via a built-in automatic moving system, e.g. an integrated scanner. Treatment areas may be set by means of laser sight&#x2014;the operator may mark the area to be treated prior to the treatment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The active element may deliver energy through its entire surface or by means of a so-called fractional arrangement when the active part includes a matrix formed by points of defined size. These points may be separated by inactive (and therefore untreated) areas that allow faster tissue healing. The points surface may make up from 1% to 99% of the active element area.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electromagnetic energy may be primarily generated by a laser, laser diode module, LED, flash lamp or incandescent light bulb or by radiofrequency generator for causing the heating of the patient. Additionally, an acoustic energy or electric or electromagnetic energy, which does not heat the patient, may be delivered simultaneously, alternately or in overlap with the primary electromagnetic energy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The active element may deliver more than one energy simultaneously (at the same time), successively or in overlap. For example, the active element may deliver a radiofrequency energy and subsequently an electric energy (electric current). In another example, the active element may deliver the radiofrequency energy and the electric energy at the same time.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore the device may be configured to deliver the electromagnetic field by at least one active element and simultaneously (at the same time) to deliver e.g. electric energy by a different elements.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus the proposed methods and devices may lead to proper skin rejuvenation, wrinkle removal, skin tightening and lifting, cellulite and fat reduction, treatment of pigmented lesions, tattoo removal, soft tissue coagulation and ablation, vascular lesions reduction, etc. of uneven rugged areas without causing further harm to important parts of the patient's body, e.g. nerves or internal organs. The proposed method and devices may lead to an adipose tissue reduction, e.g. by fat cells lipolysis or apoptosis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, the proposed methods and devices may lead to tissue rejuvenation, e. g. muscle strengthening or muscle toning through the muscle contraction caused by electric or electromagnetic energy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an apparatus for contact therapy.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of an apparatus for contact therapy.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> represents pad shapes and layout.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> represents pad shapes and layout.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> represents a side view of the pad intended for contact therapy.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows one variant of energy delivery by switching multiple active elements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an apparatus for contactless therapy.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustration of an apparatus for contactless therapy.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is an illustration of the framed grated electrode.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is an illustration of another framed grated electrode.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> is an illustration of framed grated electrode with thinning conductive lines.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> is an illustration of non-framed grated electrode.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an illustration of forehead applicator.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The presented methods and devices may be used for stimulation and/or treatment of a tissue, including but not limited to skin, epidermis, dermis, hypodermis or muscles.

Temperatures within the range of 37.5&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C. or in the range of 38&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C. or in the range of 39&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C. or in the range of 40&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. may further lead to changes in the adipose tissue. During the process of apoptosis caused by high temperatures, fat cells come apart into apoptotic bodies and are further removed via the process of phagocytosis. During a process called necrosis, fat cells are ruptured due to high temperatures, and their content is released into an extracellular matrix. Both processes may lead to a reduction of fat layers enabling reshaping of the face. Removing fat from the face may be beneficial for example in areas like submentum or cheeks.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another desired effect may include tissue rejuvenation, e. g. muscle strengthening through the muscle contraction caused by electric or electromagnetic energy, which doesn't heat the patient, or the muscle relaxation caused by a pressure massage.

The adhesive hydrogel may be made of a polymer matrix or mixture containing water, a polyhydric alcohol, a polyvinylpyrrolidone, a polyisocyanate component, a polyol component or has a methylenediphenyl structure in the main chain. Additionally, a conductive adhesive may be augmented with metallic fillers, such as silver, gold, copper, aluminum, platinum or titanium or graphite that make up 1 to 90% or 2 to 80% or 5 to 70% of adhesive. The adhesive layer may be covered by &#x201c;ST-gel&#xae;&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tensive&#xae;&#x201d; conductive adhesive gel which is applied to the body to reduce its impedance, thereby facilitating the delivery of an electric shock.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The adhesive layer under the pad <b>4</b> may mean that the adhesive layer is between the surface of the pad facing the patient and the body of the patient. The adhesive layer may have impedance 1.1 times, 2 times, 4 times or up to 10 times higher than the impedance of the skin of the patient under the pad <b>4</b>. A definition of the skin impedance may be that it is a portion of the total impedance, measured between two equipotential surfaces in contact with the epidermis, that is inversely proportional to the electrode area, when the internal current flux path is held constant. Data applicable to this definition would be conveniently recorded as admittance per unit area to facilitate application to other geometries. The impedance of the adhesive layer may be set by the same experimental setup as used for measuring the skin impedance. The impedance of the adhesive layer may be higher than the impedance of the skin by a factor in the range of 1.1 to 20 times or 1.2 to 15 times or 1.3 to 10 times.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The impedance of the adhesive layer may have a different values for the different types of energy delivered to the patient, e.g. the impedance may be different for radiofrequency and for electric current delivery.

The sticker may be bonded to the pad such that the sticking layer of the bottom side of the sticker is facing towards the topside of the pad <b>4</b>. The top side of the sticker facing away from the pad <b>4</b> may be made of a non-sticking layer. The size of the sticker with additional overlap may exceed the pad in the range of 0.1 to 10 cm, or in the range of 0.1 to 7 cm, or in the range of 0.2 to 5 cm, or in the range of 0.2 to 3 cm. This overlap may also comprise the sticking layer and may be used to form additional and more proper contact of the pad with the patient.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternatively, the pad <b>4</b> may comprise at least one suction opening, e.g. small cavities or slits adjacent to active elements or the active element may be embedded inside a cavity. The suction opening may be connected via connecting tube to a pump which may be part of the main unit <b>2</b>. When the suction opening is brought into contact with the skin, the air sucked from the suction opening flows toward the connecting tube and the pump and the skin may be slightly sucked into the suction opening.

Furthermore, the pad <b>4</b> may comprise the adhesive layer and the suction openings for combined stronger adhesion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to the vacuum (negative pressure), the pump may also provide a positive pressure by pumping the fluid to the suction opening. The positive pressure is pressure higher than atmospheric pressure and the negative pressure or vacuum is lower than atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is a pressure of the air in the room during the therapy.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pressure (positive or negative) may be applied to the treatment area in pulses providing a massage treatment. The massage treatment may be provided by one or more suction openings changing pressure value to the patient's soft tissue in the meaning that the suction opening apply different pressure to patient tissue. Furthermore, the suction openings may create a pressure gradient in the soft tissue without touching the skin. Such pressure gradients may be targeted on the soft tissue layer, under the skin surface and/or to different soft tissue structure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Massage accelerates and improves treatment therapy by electromagnetic energy, electric energy or electromagnetic energy which does not heat the patient, improves blood and/or lymph circulation, angioedema, erythema effect, accelerates removing of the fat, accelerate metabolism, accelerates elastogenesis and/or neocolagenesis.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each suction opening may provide pressure by a suction mechanism, airflow or gas flow, liquid flow, pressure provided by an object included in the suction opening (e.g. massaging object, pressure cells etc.) and/or in other ways.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Pressure value applied on the patient's tissue means that a suction opening providing massaging effect applies positive, negative and/or sequentially changing positive and negative pressure on the treated and/or adjoining patient's tissue structures and/or creates a pressure gradient under the patient's tissue surface</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Massage applied in order to improve body liquid flow (e.g. lymph drainage) and/or relax tissue in the surface soft tissue layers may be applied with pressure lower than during the massage of deeper soft tissue layers. Such positive or negative pressure compared to the atmospheric pressure may be in range of 10 Pa to 30 000 Pa, or in range of 100 Pa to 20 000 Pa or in range of 0.5 kPa to 19 kPa or in a range of 1 kPa to 15 kPa.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Massage applied in order to improve body liquid flow and/or relaxation of the tissue in the deeper soft tissue layers may be applied with higher pressure. Such positive or negative pressure may be in range from 12 kPa to 400 kPa or from 15 kPa to 300 kPa or from 20 kPa to 200 kPa. An uncomfortable feeling of too high applied pressure may be used to set a pressure threshold according to individual patient feedback.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Negative pressure may stimulate body liquid flow and/or relaxation of the deep soft tissue layers (0.5 cm to non-limited depth in the soft tissue) and/or layers of the soft tissue near the patient surface (0.1 mm to 0.5 cm). In order to increase effectiveness of the massage negative pressure treatment may be used followed by positive pressure treatment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A number of suction openings changing pressure values on the patient's soft tissue in one pad <b>4</b> may be between 1 to 100 or between 1 to 80 or 1 to 40 or between 1 to 10.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Sizes and/or shapes of suction openings may be different according to treated area. One suction opening may cover an area on the patient surface between 0.1 mm2 to 1 cm2 or between 0.1 mm2 to 50 mm2 or between 0.1 mm2 to 40 mm2 or between 0.1 mm2 to 20 mm2. Another suction opening may cover an area on the patient surface between 1 cm2 to 1 m2 or between 1 cm2 to 100 cm2 or between 1 cm2 to 50 cm2 or between 1 cm2 to 40 cm2.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Several suction openings may work simultaneously or switching between them may be in intervals between 1 ms to 10 s or in intervals between 10 ms to 5 s or in intervals between 0.5 s to 2 s.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Suction openings in order to provide massaging effect may be guided according to one or more predetermined massage profile included in the one or more treatment protocols. The massage profile may be selected by the operator and/or by a CPU with regard to the patient's condition. For example a patient with lymphedema may require a different level of compression profile and applied pressure than a patient with a healed leg ulcer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Pressure applied by one or more suction openings may be gradually applied preferably in the positive direction of the lymph flow and/or the blood flow in the veins. According to specific treatment protocols the pressure may be gradually applied in a direction opposite or different from ordinary lymph flow. Values of applied pressure during the treatment may be varied according to the treatment protocol.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A pressure gradient may arise between individual suction openings. Examples of gradients described are not limited for this method and/or device. The setting of the pressure gradient between at least two previous and successive suction openings may be: 0%, i.e. The applied pressure by suction openings is the same (e.g. pressure in all suction openings of the pad is the same);</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">1%, i.e. The applied pressure between a previous and a successive suction opening decreases and/or increases with a gradient of 1% (e.g. the pressure in the first suction opening is 5 kPa and the pressure in the successive suction opening is 4.95 kPa);</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">2%, i.e. The pressure decreases or increases with a gradient of 2%. The pressure gradient between two suction openings may be in range 0% to 100% where 100% means that one suction openings is not active and/or does not apply any pressure on the patient's soft tissue.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A treatment protocol that controls the application of the pressure gradient between a previous and a successive suction opening may be in range between 0.1% to 95%, or in range between 0.1% to 70%, or in range between 1% to 50%.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The suction opening may also comprise an impacting massage object powered by a piston, massage object operated by filling or sucking out liquid or air from the gap volume by an inlet/outlet valve or massage object powered by an element that creates an electric field, magnetic field or electromagnetic field. Additionally, the massage may be provided by impacting of multiple massage objects. The multiple massage objects may have the same or different size, shape, weight or may be created from the same or different materials. The massage objects may be accelerated by air or liquid flowing (through the valve) or by an electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field. Trajectory of the massage objects may be random, circular, linear and/or massage objects may rotate around one or more axes, and/or may do other types of moves in the gap volume.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The massage unit may also comprise a membrane on the side facing the patient which may be accelerated by an electric, magnetic, electromagnetic field or by changing pressure value in the gap volume between wall of the chamber and the membrane. This membrane may act as the massage object.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">During the treatment, it may be convenient to use a combination of pads with adhesive layer and pads with suction openings. In that case at least one pad used during the treatment may comprise adhesive layer and at least additional one pad used during the treatment may comprise suction opening. For example, pad with adhesive layer may be suited for treatment of more uneven areas, e.g. periorbital area, and pad with suction openings for treatment of smoother areas, e.g. cheeks.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The advantage of the device where the attachment od the pads may be provided by adhesion layer or by suction opening or their combination is that there is no need of any additional gripping system which would be necessary to hold the pads on the treatment area during the treatment, e.g. a band or a felt, which may cause a discomfort of the patient.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Yet in another embodiment, it is possible to fasten the flexible pads <b>4</b> to the face by at least one band or felt which may be made from an elastic material and thus adjusted for an individual face. In that case the flexible pads, which may have not the adhesive layer or suction opening, are placed on the treatment area of the patient and their position is then fastened by a band or felt to avoid deflection of the pads from the treatment areas. Alternatively, the band may be replaced by an elastic mask that covers from 5% to 100% or from 30% to 99% or from 40% to 95% or from 50% to 90% of the face and may serve to secure the flexible pads on the treatment areas. Furthermore, it may be possible to use the combination of the pad with adhesive layer or suction opening and the fastening band, felt or mask to ensure strong attachment of the pads on the treatment areas.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, the fastening mechanism may be in the form of a textile or a garment which may be mountable on a user's body part. In use of the device, a surface of the electrode or electrode pad <b>4</b> lays along an inner surface of the garment, while the opposite surface of the electrode or electrode pad <b>4</b> is in contact with the user's skin, preferably by means of a skin-electrode hydrogel interface.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The garment may be fastened for securement of the garment to or around a user's body part, e.g. by hook and loop fastener, button, buckle, stud, leash or cord, magnetic-guided locking system or clamping band and the garment may be manufactured with flexible materials or fabrics that adapt to the shape of the user's body or limb. The electrode pad <b>4</b> may be in the same way configured to be fastened to the inner surface of the garment. The garment is preferably made of breathable materials. Non limiting examples of such materials are soft Neoprene, Nylon, polyurethane, polyester, polyamide, polypropylene, silicone, cotton or any other material which is soft and flexible. All named materials could be used as woven, non-woven, single use fabric or laminated structures.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The garment and the pad may be modular system, which means module or element of the device (pad, garment) and/or system is designed separately and independently from the rest of the modules or elements, at the same time that they are compatible with each other.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The pad <b>4</b> may be designed to be attached to or in contact with the garment, thus being carried by the garment in a stationary or fixed condition, in such a way that the pads are disposed on fixed positions of the garment. The garment ensures the correct adhesion or disposition of the pad to the user's skin. In use of the device, the surface of one or more active elements not in contact with the garment is in contact with the patient's skin, preferably by means of a hydrogel layer that acts as pad-skin interface. Therefore, the active elements included in the pad are in contact with the patient's skin.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The optimal placement of the pad on the patient's body part, and therefore the garment which carries the pad having the active elements, is determined by a technician or clinician helping the patient.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, the garment may comprise more than one pad or the patient may wear more than one garment comprising one or more pads during one treatment session.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The pad <b>4</b> may contain at least one active element <b>13</b> capable of delivering energy from primary electromagnetic generator <b>6</b> or secondary generator <b>9</b> or ultrasound emitter <b>10</b>.

The electrode may be a radiofrequency (RF) electrode. The RF electrode may be a dielectric electrode coated with insulating (e.g. dielectric) material. The RF electrode may be monopolar, bipolar, unipolar or multipolar. The bipolar arrangement may consist of electrodes that alternate between active and return function and where the thermal gradient beneath electrodes is almost the same during treatment. Bipolar electrodes may form circular or ellipsoidal shapes, where electrodes are concentric to each other. However, a group of bipolar electrode systems may be used as well. A unipolar electrode or one or more multipolar electrodes may be used as well. The system may alternatively use monopolar electrodes, where the so called return electrode has larger area than so called active electrode. The thermal gradient beneath the active electrode is therefore higher than beneath the return electrode. The active electrode may be part of the pad and the passive electrode having larger surface area may be located at least 5 cm, 10 cm, or 20 cm from the pad. A neutral electrode may be used as the passive electrode. The neutral electrode may be on the opposite side of the patient's body than the pad is attached. A unipolar electrode may also optionally be used. During unipolar energy delivery there is one electrode, no neutral electrode, and a large field of RF emitted in an omnidirectional field around a single electrode. Capacitive and/or resistive electrodes may be used. Radiofrequency energy may provide energy flux on the surface of the active element <b>13</b> or on the surface of the treated tissue (e.g. skin) in the range of 0.001 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1500 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>or 0.01 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1000 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>or 0.5 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 500 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>or 0.5 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 100 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>or 1 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 50 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The energy flux on the surface of the active element <b>13</b> may be calculated from the size of the active element <b>13</b> and its output value of the energy. The energy flux on the surface of the treated tissue may be calculated from the size of the treated tissue exactly below the active element <b>13</b> and its input value of the energy provided by the active element <b>13</b>. In addition, the RF electrode positioned in the pad <b>4</b> may act as an acoustic window for ultrasound energy.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The active element <b>13</b> may provide a secondary energy from secondary generator <b>9</b> in form of an electric current or a magnetic field. By applying the secondary energy to the treated area of the body of the patient, muscle fibers stimulation may be achieved and thus increasing muscle tone, muscle strengthening, restoration of feeling the muscle, relaxation of the musculature and/or stretching musculature.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The proposed device may provide an electrotherapy in case that the secondary energy delivered by the active element <b>13</b> (e.g a radiofrequency electrode or simply referred just as an electrode) is the electric current. The main effects of electrotherapy are: analgesic, myorelaxation, iontophoresis, anti-edematous effect or muscle stimulation causing a muscle fiber contraction. Each of these effects may be achieved by one or more types of electrotherapy: galvanic current, pulse direct current and alternating current.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Galvanic current (or &#x201c;continuous&#x201d;) is a current that may have constant electric current and/or absolute value of the electric current is in every moment higher than 0. It may be used mostly for iontophoresis, or its trophic stimulation (hyperemic) effect is utilized. At the present invention this current may be often substituted by galvanic intermittent current. Additionally, galvanic component may be about 95% but due to interruption of the originally continuous intensity the frequency may reach 5-12 kHz or 5-10 kHz or 5-9 kHz or 5-8 kHz.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The pulse direct current (DC) is of variable intensity but only one polarity. The basic pulse shape may vary. It includes e.g. diadynamics, rectangular, triangular and exponential pulse of one polarity. Depending on the used frequency and intensity it may have stimulatory, tropic, analgesic, myorelaxation, iontophoresis, at least partial muscle contraction and anti-edematous effect and/or other.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Alternating Current (AC or biphasic) where the basic pulse shape may vary&#x2014;rectangular, triangular, harmonic sinusoidal, exponential and/or other shapes and/or combination of mentioned above. It can be alternating, symmetric and/or asymmetric. Use of alternating currents in contact electrotherapy implies much lower stress on the tissue under the electrode. For these types of currents the capacitive component of skin resistance is involved, and due to that these currents are very well tolerated by the patients.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">AC therapies may be differentiate to five subtypes: TENS, Classic (four-pole) Interference, Two-pole Interference, Isoplanar Interference and Dipole Vector Field. It also exist some specific electrotherapy energy variants and modularity of period, shape of the energy etc.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Due to interferential electrotherapy, different nerves and tissue structures by medium frequency may be stimulated in a range of 500 Hz to 12 kHz or in a range of 500 Hz to 8 kHz, or 500 Hz to 6 kHz, creating pulse envelopes with frequencies for stimulation of the nerves and tissues e.g. sympathetic nerves (0.1-5 Hz), parasympathetic nerves (10-150 Hz), motor nerves (10-50 Hz), smooth muscle (0.1-10 Hz), sensor nerves (90-100 Hz) nociceptive fibres (90-150 Hz).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Electrotherapy may provide stimulus with currents of frequency in the range from 0.1 Hz to 12 kHz or in the range from 0.1 Hz to 8 kHz or in the range from 0.1 Hz to 6 kHz.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Muscle fiber stimulation by electrotherapy may be important during and/or as a part of the RF treatment. Muscle stimulation increases blood flow and lymph circulation. It may improve removing of treated cells and/or prevent of hot spots creation. Moreover internal massage stimulation of adjoining tissues improves homogeneity of tissue and dispersing of the delivered energy. The muscle fiber stimulation by electrotherapy may cause muscle contractions, which may lead to improvement of a visual appearance of the patient through muscle firming and strenghtening, Another beneficial effect is for example during fat removing with the RF therapy. RF therapy may change structure of the fat tissue. The muscle fiber stimulation may provide internal massage, which may be for obese patient more effective than classical massage.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Muscle stimulation may be provided by e.g. intermittent direct currents, alternating currents (medium-frequency and TENS currents), faradic current as a method for multiple stimulation and/or others.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Frequency of the currents may be in the range from 0.1 Hz to 1500 Hz or from 0.1 to 1000 Hz or from 0.1 Hz to 500 Hz or from 0.1 to 300 Hz.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Frequency of the current envelope is typically in the range from 0.1 Hz to 500 Hz or from 0.1 to 250 Hz or from 0.1 Hz to 150 Hz or from 0.1 to 140 Hz.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The electrostimulation may be provided in a combined manner where various treatments with various effects may be achieved. As an illustrative example, the electromagnetic energy with the electrostimulation may be dosed in trains of pulses of electric current where the first train of electrostimulation may achieve different effect than second or other successive train of stimulation. Therefore, the treatment may provide muscle fibers stimulation or muscle contractions followed by relaxation, during continual or pulsed radiofrequency thermal heating provided by electromagnetic energy provided by electromagnetic energy generator.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The electrostimulation may be provided by monopolar, unipolar, bipolar or multipolar mode.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Absolute value of voltage between the electrotherapy electrodes operated in bipolar, multipolar mode (electric current flow between more than two electrodes) and/or provided to at least one electrotherapy electrode may be in range between 0.8 V and 10 kV; or in range between 1 V and 1 kV; or in range between 1 V and 300 V or in range between 1 V and 100 V.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Current density of electrotherapy for non-galvanic current may be in range between 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 150 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, or in range between 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 100 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, or in range between 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 50 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, or in range between 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>; for galvanic current may be preferably in range between <b>0</b>.<b>05</b> mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, or in range between 0.1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>,or in range between 0.01 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>.

The pulse duration of the electromagnetic radiation operated in the pulse regime may be in the range of 0.1 fs to 2000 ms or in the range of 0.5 fs to 1500 ms or in the range of 1 fs to 1200 ms or in the range of 1 fs to 1000 ms. Alternatively the pulse duration may be in the range of 0.1 fs to 1000 ns or in the range of 0.5 fs to 800 ns or in the range of 1 fs to 500 ns or in the range of 1 fs to 300 ns. Alternatively, the pulse duration may be in the range of 0.3 to 5000 ps or in the range of 1 to 4000 ps or in the range of 5 to 3500 ps or in the range of 10 to 3000 ps. Or alternatively the pulse duration may be in the range of 0.05 to 2000 ms or in the range of 0.1 to 1500 ms or in the range of 0.5 to 1250 ms or in the range of 1 to 1000 ms. The electromagnetic generator <b>6</b> in the pulse regime may be operated by CPU <b>11</b> in a single shot mode or in a repetition mode or in a burst mode. The frequency of the repetition mode or the burst mode may be in the range of 0.05 to 10 000 Hz or in the range of 0.1 to 5000 Hz or in the range of 0.3 to 2000 Hz or in the range of 0.5 to 1000 Hz. Alternatively the frequency of the repetition mode or the burst mode may be in the range of 0.1 kHz to 200 MHz or in the range of 0.5 kHz to 150 MHz or in the range of 0.8 kHz to 100 MHz or in the range of 1 kHz to 80 MHz. The single shot mode may be configured to generate a single electromagnetic energy of specific parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, etc.) for irradiation of a single treatment area. The repetition mode may be configured to generate an electromagnetic energy, which may have one or more specific parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, etc.), with a repetition rate of the above-mentioned frequency for irradiation of a single treatment area. The burst mode may be configured to generate multiple consecutive electromagnetic energys, which may have variable parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, delay etc.), during one sequence, wherein the sequences are repeated with the above-mentioned frequency and wherein the sequence may include the same or different sets of consecutive electromagnetic energys.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">Alternatively, the device may contain more than one electromagnetic generator <b>6</b> for generation of the same or a different electromagnetic energy, e.g. one electromagnetic generator is for generation of an ablative electromagnetic energy and the other is for generation of a non-ablative electromagnetic energy. In this case, it is possible for an operator to select which electromagnetic generators may be used for a given treatment or the clinician can choose a required treatment through the human machine interface <b>8</b> and the CPU <b>11</b> will select which electromagnetic generators will be used. It is possible to operate one or more electromagnetic generators of the device <b>100</b> simultaneously, successively or in an overlapping method. For example in the case of two electromagnetic generators: in the simultaneous method, both electromagnetic generators are used simultaneously during a time interval e.g., 1-20 ps. In the successive method, the first electromagnetic generator is used during the first time interval e.g., from 1 to 10 ps. The first electromagnetic generator is then stopped and the second electromagnetic generator is immediately used in a subsequent time interval e.g., from 10 to 20 ps. Such a sequence of two or more successive steps may be repeated. In the overlapping method, the first electromagnetic generator is used during a time interval, e.g., 1-10 ps, and the second electromagnetic generator is used in a second overlapping time interval for e.g., 2-11 ps, wherein during the second time interval the first electromagnetic generator and the second electromagnetic generator are overlapping e.g., with total overlapping method time for 2-10 ps. In the case of more than two electromagnetic generators, the activating and deactivating of the electromagnetic generators in a successive or overlap method may be driven by CPU <b>11</b> in the order which is suitable for a given treatment, e.g. first activating the pre-heating electromagnetic generator, then the ablation electromagnetic generator and then the non-ablative electromagnetic generator.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">The active elements <b>13</b> in the delivery head <b>19</b> may be in the form of optical elements, which may be represented by one or more optical windows, lenses, mirrors, fibers or diffraction elements. The optical element representing active element <b>13</b> may be connected to or may contain electromagnetic generator <b>6</b> inside the delivery head <b>19</b>. The optical element may produce one beam of electromagnetic energy, which may provide an energy spot having an energy spot size defined as a surface of tissue irradiated by one beam of light. One light generator may provide one or more energy spots e.g. by splitting one beam into a plurality of beams. The energy spot size may be in the range of 0.001 cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>, or in the range of 0.005 cm<sup>2 </sup>to 700 cm<sup>2</sup>, or in the range of 0.01 cm<sup>2 </sup>to 300 cm<sup>2</sup>, or in the range of 0.03 cm<sup>2 </sup>to 80 cm<sup>2</sup>. Energy spots of different or the same wavelength may be overlaid or may be separated. Two or more beams of light may be applied to the same spot at the same time or with a time gap ranging from 0.1 &#x3bc;s to 30 seconds. Energy spots may be separated by at least 1% of their diameter, and in addition, energy spots may closely follow each other or may be separated by a gap ranging from 0.01 mm to 20 mm or from 0.05 mm to 15 mm or from 0.1 mm to 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">The CPU <b>11</b> may be further responsible for switching between active elements <b>13</b> or for moving the active elements <b>13</b> within the delivery head <b>19</b> so that the electromagnetic radiation may be delivered homogeneously into the whole treatment area marked with aiming beam <b>18</b>. The rate of switching between active elements <b>13</b> may be dependent on the amount of delivered energy, pulse length, etc. and the speed of CPU <b>11</b> or other mechanism responsible for switching or moving the active elements <b>13</b> (e.g. scanner). Additionally, a device may be configured to switch between multiple active elements <b>13</b> in such a way that they deliver energy simultaneously, successively or in an overlapping method. For example, in the case of two active elements: in the simultaneous method, both active elements are used simultaneously during the time interval e.g., 1-20 ps. In the successive method, the first active element is used during the first time interval e.g., from 1 to 10 ps. The first active element is then stopped and the second active element is immediately used in a subsequent time interval e.g., from 10 to 20 ps. This successive step may be repeated. In the overlapping method, the first active element is used during a time interval for e.g., 1-10 ps, and the second active element is used in a second overlapping time interval for e.g., 2-11 ps, wherein during the second time interval the first active element and the second active element are overlapping e.g., with total overlapping method time for 2-10 ps.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">The aiming beam <b>18</b> has no clinical effect on the treated tissue and may serve as a tool to mark the area to be treated so that the operator knows which exact area will be irradiated and the CPU <b>11</b> may set and adjust treatment parameters accordingly. An aiming beam may be generated by a separate electromagnetic generator or by the primary electromagnetic generator <b>6</b>. Aiming beam <b>18</b> may deliver energy at a wavelength in a range of 300-800 nm and may supply energy at a maximum power of 10 mW.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">In addition, the pad may contain a CPU <b>11</b> driven distance sensor <b>22</b> for measuring a distance from active element <b>13</b> to the treated point within the treated area marked by aiming beam <b>18</b>. The measured value may be used by CPU <b>11</b> as a parameter for adjusting one or more treatment parameters which may depend on the distance between an electromagnetic generator and a treating point, e.g. fluence. Information from distance sensor <b>22</b> may be provided to CPU <b>11</b> before every switch/movement of an active element <b>13</b> so that the delivered energy will remain the same across the treated area independent of its shape or unevenness.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0163">The patient's skin may be pre-cooled to a selected temperature for a selected duration over at least one treatment portion, the selected temperature and duration for pre-cooling preferably being sufficient to cool the skin to at least a selected temperature below normal body temperature. The skin may be cooled to at least the selected temperature to a depth below the at least one depth for the treatment portions so that the at least one treatment portion is substantially surrounded by cooled skin. The cooling may continue during the application of radiation, wherein the duration of the application of radiation may be greater than the thermal relaxation time of the treatment portions. Cooling may be provided by any known mechanism including water cooling, sprayed coolant, presence of an active solid cooling element (e.g. thermoelectric cooler) or air flow cooling. A cooling element may act as an optical element. Alternatively, a spacer may serve as a cooling element. Cooling may be provided during, before or after the treatment with electromagnetic energy. Cooling before treatment may also provide an environment for sudden heat shock, while cooling after treatment may provide faster regeneration after heat shock. The temperature of the coolant may be in the range of &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. to 36&#xb0; C. The temperature of the cooling element during the treatment may be in the range of &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. to 36&#xb0; C. or &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. to 35&#xb0; C. or &#x2212;60 &#xb0; C. to 34&#xb0; C. Further, where the pad is not in contact with the patient's skin, cryogenic spray cooling, gas flow or other non-contact cooling techniques may be utilized. A cooling gel on the skin surface might also be utilized, either in addition to or instead of, one of the cooling techniques indicated above.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">Additionally, device <b>100</b> may include one or more sensors. The sensor may provide information about at least one physical quantity and its measurement may lead to feedback which may be displayed by human machine interface <b>8</b> or indicators <b>17</b>. The one or more sensors may be used for sensing a variety of physical quantities, including but not limited to the energy of the delivered electromagnetic radiation or backscattered electromagnetic radiation from the skin, impedance of the skin, resistance of the skin, temperature of the treated skin, temperature of the untreated skin, temperature of at least one layer of the skin, water content of the device, the phase angle of delivered or reflected energy, the position of the active elements <b>13</b>, the position of the delivery element <b>19</b>, temperature of the cooling media or temperature of the electromagnetic generator <b>6</b>. The sensor may be a temperature, acoustic, vibration, electric, magnetic, flow, positional, optical, imaging, pressure, force, energy flux, impedance, current, Hall or proximity sensor. The sensor may be a capacitive displacement sensor, acoustic proximity sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, infrared camera or thermographic camera. The sensor may be invasive or contactless. The sensor may be located on the delivery element <b>19</b> or in the main unit <b>2</b> or may be a part of a distance sensor <b>22</b>. One sensor may measure more than one physical quantity. For example, a sensor may include a combination of a gyroscope, an accelerometer or a magnetometer. Additionally, the sensor may measure one or more physical quantities of the treated skin or untreated skin.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">The temperature sensor measures and monitors the temperature of the treated skin. The temperature can be analyzed by a CPU <b>11</b>. The temperature sensor may be a contactless sensor (e.g. infrared temperature sensor). The CPU <b>11</b> may also use algorithms to calculate a temperature below the surface of the skin based on the surface temperature of the skin and one or more additional parameters. A temperature feedback system may control the temperature and based on set or pre-set limits alert the operator in human perceptible form e.g. on the human machine interface <b>8</b> or via indicators <b>17</b>. In a limit temperature condition, the device may be configured to adjust treatment parameters of each active element, e.g. output power, activate cooling or stop the treatment. Human perceptible form may be a sound, alert message shown on human machine interface <b>8</b> or indicators <b>17</b> or change of color of any part of the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">A resistance sensor may measure the skin resistance, since it may vary for different patients, as well as the humidity&#x2014;wetness and sweat may influence the resistance and therefore the behavior of the skin in the energy field. Based on the measured skin resistance, the skin impedance may also be calculated.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0167">Information from one or more sensors may be used for generation of a pathway on a convenient model e.g. a model of the human body shown on a display of human machine interface <b>8</b>. The pathway may illustrate a surface or volume of already treated tissue, presently treated tissue, tissue to be treated, or untreated tissue. A convenient model may show a temperature map of the treated tissue providing information about the already treated tissue or untreated tissue.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">The sensor may provide information about the location of bones, inflamed tissue or joints. Such types of tissue may not be targeted by electromagnetic radiation due to the possibility of painful treatment. Bones, joints or inflamed tissue may be detected by any type of sensor such as an imaging sensor (ultrasound sensor, IR sensor), impedance and the like. A detected presence of these tissue types may cause general human perceptible signals or interruption of generation of electromagnetic radiation. Bones may be detected for example by a change of impedance of the tissue or by analysis of reflected electromagnetic radiation.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">Furthermore, the device <b>100</b> may include an emergency stop button <b>16</b> so that the patient can stop the therapy immediately anytime during the treatment.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">It may be part of the invention that the method of treatment includes the following steps: preparation of the tissue; positioning the proposed device; selecting or setting up the treatment parameters; and application of the energy. More than one step may be executed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">Preparation of the tissue may include removing make-up or cleansing the patient's skin. For higher target temperatures, anesthetics may be applied topically or in an injection.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">Positioning the device may include selecting the correct shape of the pad according to the area to be treated and affixing the pad or the neutral electrode to the patient, for example with an adhesive layer, vacuum suction, band or mask, and verifying proper contact with the treated tissue in the case of contact therapy. In the case of contactless therapy, positioning of the device may include adjusting the aiming beam of proposed device so that the device can measure the distance of the active element(s) from the treatment area and adjust the treatment parameters accordingly.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">Selecting or setting up the treatment parameters may include adjusting treatment time, power, duty cycle, delivery time and mode (CM or pulsed), active points surface density/size for fractional arrangement and mode of operation. Selecting the mode of operation may mean choosing simultaneous, successive or overlapping methods or selecting the switching order of active elements or groups of active elements or selecting the proper preprogrammed protocol.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">Application of the energy may include providing at least one type of energy in the form of RF energy, ultrasound energy or electromagnetic energy in the form of polychromatic or monochromatic light, or their combination. The energy may be provided from at least one active element into the skin by proposed device. Energy may be delivered and regulated automatically by the CPU according to information from temperature sensors and impedance measurements and, in the case of contactless therapy, distance sensors. All automatic adjustments and potential impacts on the therapy may be indicated on the device display. Either the operator or the patient may suspend therapy at any time during treatment. A typical treatment might have a duration of about 1 to 60 min or 2 to 50 min or 3 to 40 min per pad depending on the treated area and the size and number of active elements located within the pad.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">In one example, application of energy to the tissue may include providing radiofrequency energy or ultrasound energy or their combination, from the active elements embedded in the pad, to the skin of the patient. In such case, active elements providing radiofrequency energy may be dielectric and capacitive or resistive RF electrodes and the RF energy may cause heating, coagulation or ablation of the skin. Ultrasound energy may be provided through an acoustic window and may rise the temperature in the depth which may suppress the gradient loss of RF energy and thus the desired temperature in a germinal layer may be reach. In addition, the RF electrode may act as an acoustic window for ultrasound energy.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">Alternatively, the application of the energy to the tissue may include providing electromagnetic energy in the form of polychromatic or monochromatic light from the active elements into the skin of the patient. In such case, active elements providing the electromagnetic energy may comprise optical elements described in the proposed device. Optical elements may be represented by an optical window, lens, mirror, fiber or electromagnetic field generator, e.g. LED, laser, flash lamp, incandescent light bulb or other light sources known in the state of art. The electromagnetic energy in the form of polychromatic or monochromatic light may entail the heating, coagulation or ablation of the skin in the treated area.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">After reaching the required temperature and therapy time the therapy is terminated, the device accessories may be removed and a cleansing of the patient's skin may be provided.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
