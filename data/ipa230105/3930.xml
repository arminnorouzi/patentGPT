id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a light guide and a virtual-image display device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a virtual-image display device, for example, a head-mounted display (HMD) is commonly used. Such a head-mounted display (HMD) is classified into a transparent type and a nontransparent type, and for example, Google glass (registered trademark) is well known in the art as a see-through HMD of transparent type through which an image can be seen. Various kinds of HMD of nontransparent type that achieves deep immersive simulation are also released by several companies. Regarding the size of a virtual image that is visually recognized by human through a virtual-image display device, a HMD of transparent type is used in combination with an external information terminal, or is used in combination with the augmented reality (AR) technologies. For this reason, a small and portable HMD is desired. By contrast, a HMD of nontransparent type is used for, for example, games or virtual-reality (VR) technologies. For this reason, a HMD that realizes immersive feeling and a wide viewing angle is desired. Some common characteristics of a virtual-image display device are given below. The viewing angle of a virtual-image display device that is dedicated to its downsizing and reduction in thickness of the main body tends to be narrow. By contrast, when the viewing angle of the display area is widened, the size of the main body of the virtual-image display device tends to be increased and its thickness tends to be increased. Currently, a HMD of transparent type whose thickness is reduced is demanded, and a wide viewing angle is also required for such a HMD of transparent type whose thickness is reduced is demanded.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The technologies are known in the art that satisfies such demands as described above (see, for example, PTLs 1 to 3). However, in such technologies known in the art, the light is guided to the eyes of a user as the light is ejected to the outside of a light guide by the reflection by a plurality of mirrors or a plurality of micro parts. In such technologies or configurations, some of the light beams that are guided through a light guide at varying angles that correspond to the multiple pixels of an image formed by an image display element does not hit any of a plurality of mirrors or a plurality of micro parts. Given these circumstances, a dropout error of brightness may occur on a virtual image that is observed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to deal with the above technical problems, a method of preventing dropout error of brightness has been suggested as follows (see, for example, PTL 4). In such a method of preventing dropout error of brightness, a layer that splits the light is disposed inside the light guide, and the timing at which light beams with varying angles that are guided through a light guide plate are reflected is adjusted. Due to such a configuration, there is a high probability that light beams with angles that tend to cause a dropout error of brightness hit a plurality of mirrors or a plurality of micro parts.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A virtual-image display device with a light guide is known in the art as a device that magnifies a two-dimensional (2D) image by a virtual image optical system and display a magnified virtual image such that an observer or user can observe the displayed magnified virtual image. As an example configuration of such a virtual-image display device with a light guide, head-mounted displays (HMDs) are known in the art. Such head-mounted displays (HMDs) are classified into HMDs of a transparent type and HMDs of a nontransparent type. For example, Google glass (registered trademark of Google limited liability company (LLC) in the US) is well known in the art as a see-through HMD of transparent type through which an image can be seen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a see-through HMD of transparent type is used in combination with an external information terminal, or is used in combination with, for example, the augmented reality (AR) technologies. For this reason, a small and portable HMD is desired. HMDs of nontransparent type are used when, for example, movies are watched, games are played, or when virtual-reality (VR) technologies are provided. For this reason, HMDs that realize immersive feeling and a wide viewing angle are desired.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In HMDs of transparent type, reduction in thickness, reduction in size, and a wide viewing angle are desired. Moreover, it is desired that reduction in transmittance of extraneous light or reduction in reflectivity of light is prevented from occurring, and that a ghost image is prevented from being formed. As a feature that meets such demands, a light guide plate as disclosed in, for example, PTL 3 and a virtual-image display device with the light guide are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The light guide plate disclosed in PTL 3 includes a first total reflection plane and a second total reflection plane that face each other and extend in the same direction. The light guide plate disclosed in PTL 3 turns the optical path between such a pair of reflection planes, and guides the light toward the light beam ejection unit that has an image extraction unit. The image extraction unit includes a plurality of first planes that extend with inclination toward the inside of a light guiding unit on the far side of the image extraction unit in the light-guiding direction, and a plurality of second planes that form an obtuse angle with the multiple first planes. The multiple first planes and the multiple second planes are alternately arranged. A virtual-image display device may be implemented using the light guide plate as configured above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a wide viewing angle is to be achieved using the light guide plate disclosed in PTL 3, a problem is known in the art that an unevenness in brightness or dropout error of brightness occurs on a virtual image. The reasons why such an unevenness in brightness or dropout error of brightness occurs on a virtual image are described with reference to a control sample where the light guide plate according to the disclosure of PTL 3 is used as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, a light guide plate is a horizontally-oriented plate-like member made of a transparent material. For example, such a light guide plate is placed in front of the eyes of human like glasses. With the use of such a light guide plate, an image can be observed through the light that is ejected through a light beam ejection unit, and the sight ahead of the light guide plate can be observed through the light that passes through the light guide plate. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, the directions perpendicular to the sheet of paper indicate the up-and-down directions of the light guide plate under normal operating conditions, and these directions are referred to as the X-directions. The up-and-down directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> that are perpendicular to the X-directions are referred to as the Y-directions. In other words, the forward and backward directions under in-use conditions are referred to as the Y-direction. The directions that are orthogonal to both the X-direction and the Y-direction, which correspond to the right and left directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, are referred to as the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the light guide plate as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, an optical entrance <b>108</b> is illustrated on a bottom-left side, and a light beam ejection unit <b>140</b> is illustrated on a bottom-right side. Moreover, a light guiding unit <b>130</b> is illustrated between the optical entrance <b>108</b> and the light beam ejection unit <b>140</b>. The optical entrance <b>108</b> includes a prism <b>111</b> on which the light is incident, and includes a mirror <b>101</b> that reflects the incident light, which has passed through the prism <b>111</b>, toward the light guiding unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The light guiding unit <b>130</b> according to the present control sample includes a first reflection plane <b>102</b> and a second reflection plane <b>103</b> that are parallel with each other and totally reflect the light reflected by the mirror <b>101</b> in alternating sequence in a zigzag manner to guide the light toward the light beam ejection unit <b>140</b>. The second reflection plane <b>103</b> functions as a plurality of image extraction units <b>105</b> and a plurality of sub-reflection planes <b>133</b> at the portions that face and correspond to the light beam ejection unit <b>140</b>.

For this reason, the thickness of light guide plate in the forward and backward directions gradually gets thinner in stages toward the light beam ejection unit <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The light that is emitted from, for example, a prescribed image forming element is collimated and is incident on the light guide plate through the optical entrance <b>108</b>.

An image that is formed by the image forming element or the like can be observed by the eyes of a human through the light that is reflected by each one of the multiple image extraction units <b>105</b>.

The light guiding unit includes a first reflection plane and a second reflection plane that face each other and are approximately parallel to each other. The light that is taken into the inside of the light guiding unit is guided within the light guiding unit from an optical entrance side toward a light beam ejection unit with alternate total internal reflection between the first reflection plane and the second reflection plane.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">The second reflection plane is configured by a plurality of image extraction units and a plurality of sub-reflection planes that are arranged in alternating sequence on the rear side in the light-guiding direction.

Each one of the multiple sub-reflection planes is formed subsequent to one of the multiple image extraction units so as to be approximately parallel to the first reflection plane.

The optical-path separator exists at some area between the first reflection plane and the second reflection plane, and the optical-path separator does not exist at the other area between the first reflection plane and the second reflection plane. The optical-path separator serves as a boundary surface that totally reflects the light depending on the angle of incidence of the light, and that transmits the light when the angle of incidence of the light falls within a predetermined range.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">Light beams with a wide reflection angle and light beams with a narrow reflection angle with reference to a normal line to the second reflection plane are included in the light that is taken into the light guide through the optical entrance.

Due to the provision of the above boundary surface, the intervals at which the second light of incident lights with varying angles of view that have approximately been collimated is totally reflected by the second reflection plane can be shortened, and the second reflection plane can be irradiated with light beams with varying angles of view with even light intensity.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">Among light beams with varying angles of view that are approximately collimated and incident on the optical entrance, the intervals at which the first light is totally reflected by the second reflection plane are narrower than the intervals at which the second light is totally reflected when there is no boundary surface in the first place.
