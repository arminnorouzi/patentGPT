For example, the plan defines that stimulation should be delivered only in certain physical states of the patient, such as only during rest.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0167">In some embodiments, the treatment plan takes into account expected variability in cardiac activity. In some embodiments, treatment parameters such as the total number of stimulations to be delivered; the total amount of stimulation energy to be delivered; the rate of stimulating; the timing of stimulation are selected taking into account that a change in a parameter may have an effect that is non-linear on the treatment itself. Therefore, in some embodiments, multiple sets of parameters may be defined for obtaining equivalent treatment effects. For example, it may be that delivery of 8000 stimulations randomly dispersed over a day would obtain a treatment effect which is equivalent to stimulations delivered at each cardiac beat for one hour at a heart rate higher than 90 bpm. In some embodiments, systems and/or devices for example as described herein (e.g. the system controller) are preprogrammed with a look-up table including parameter sets, which optionally lead to equivalent treatment effects and may be interchanged.

For example, a cardiac contractility modulation signal is applied during the refractory period. Under such scheduling, a patient whose actual heart rate (i.e. the heart rate during at least a part of a treatment session) is higher than an expected average may receive an excess number of stimulations, and a patient whose heart rate is lower than an expected average may receive fewer stimulations than planned. In some embodiments, to compensate for the variation, parameters such as the treatment session duration or the stimulation current intensity may be updated. For example, for the patient with the higher heart rate: the treatment session duration may be shortened, thereby reducing or avoiding excess stimulations; the stimulation current intensity may be reduced, so that a total amount of energy delivered over a treatment session remains as planned. For example, for the patient with the lower heart rate: the treatment session duration may be lengthened in attempt to reach the planned amount of stimulations; the stimulation current intensity may be increased, so that a total amount of energy delivered over a treatment session reaches the planned amount. In some embodiments, stimulation current intensity is set by controlling (optionally, modulating) a voltage set by the device. In some embodiments, current intensity (or amplitude) is set by setting output voltage under the assumption that electrical impedance of device components (such as the one or more stimulation leads) remains substantially constant, and does not change.

Moreover, according to actual instrumentation and equipment of embodiments of the method and/or system of the invention, several selected tasks could be implemented by hardware, by software or by firmware or by a combination thereof using an operating system.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0309">For example, hardware for performing selected tasks according to embodiments of the invention could be implemented as a chip or a circuit. As software, selected tasks according to embodiments of the invention could be implemented as a plurality of software instructions being executed by a computer using any suitable operating system. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more tasks according to exemplary embodiments of method and/or system as described herein are performed by a data processor, such as a computing platform for executing a plurality of instructions. Optionally, the data processor includes a volatile memory for storing instructions and/or data and/or a non-volatile storage, for example, a magnetic hard-disk and/or removable media, for storing instructions and/or data.

A display and/or a user input device such as a keyboard or mouse are optionally provided as well.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0310">In some embodiments, planning and delivering cardiac electrical stimulation treatment are performed and, more particularly, but not exclusively, cardiac electrical stimulation treatment which parameters can be updated based on and/or in response to actual cardiac activity are performed.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0311">In some embodiments, the stimulation treatment is planned according to characteristics of cardiac activity and is optionally modified in view of actual cardiac activity. In some embodiments, stimulation is selected and/or performed taking into account a natural variability in the function of the heart, including both intra-person and inter-person variability.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0312">In some embodiments, updating one or more parameters of cardiac electrical stimulation treatment, optionally in real time, is performed to compensate for any changes made in the treatment due to actual cardiac activity.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0313">In some embodiments, a treatment plan is defined by setting parameters such as: stimulation rate, stimulation current intensity, a duration of a treatment session, and/or other parameters. In some embodiments, the parameters are selected according to a general treatment goal, for example, a total number of cardiac electrical stimulations to be delivered to the heart, and/or a total amount of cardiac electrical stimulation energy to be delivered to the heart.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0314">In some embodiments, the treatment plan is defined according to characteristics of cardiac activity of the patient being treated. For example, taking into account characteristics such as the patient's heart rate, stroke volume, occurrence rate of irregular cardiac events (such as arrhythmia), and/or other characteristics.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0315">In some embodiments, the treatment plan defines one or more conditions for applying the cardiac electrical stimulation. For example, the plan defines that stimulation should be delivered only when the heart rate is lower and/or higher than a threshold (or within a selected range). For example, the plan defines that stimulation should be delivered only in certain physical states of the patient, such as only during rest.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0316">In some embodiments, the treatment plan takes into account expected variability in cardiac activity. In some embodiments, treatment parameters such as the total number of stimulations to be delivered; the total amount of stimulation energy to be delivered; the rate of stimulating; the timing of stimulation are selected taking into account that a change in a parameter may have an effect that is non-linear on the treatment itself. Therefore, in some embodiments, multiple sets of parameters may be defined for obtaining equivalent treatment effects. For example, it may be that delivery of 8000 stimulations randomly dispersed over a day would obtain a treatment effect which is equivalent to stimulations delivered at each cardiac beat for one hour at a heart rate higher than 90 bpm. In some embodiments, systems and/or devices for example as described herein (e.g. the system controller) are preprogrammed with a look-up table including parameter sets, which optionally lead to equivalent treatment effects and may be interchanged. In some embodiments, a treatment parameter is selected and/or calculated according to one more additional treatment parameters and/or according to a desired treatment effect.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0317">In some embodiments, cardiac electrical stimulation treatment is delivered according to the plan, but variations may be made in the plan in response to actual cardiac activity. Optionally, variations are made in real time. For example, if an irregular beat is identified, stimulation at that beat may be skipped. In some embodiments, variations in the treatment plan are made in response to actual cardiac activity measured (and optionally monitored over time) by one or more sensors, such as via ECG measurement.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0318">In some embodiments, the variations made in the plan are compensated for, for example so as to reach the general treatment goal. In some embodiments, compensating comprises updating one or more treatment parameters, such as: updating a duration of a treatment session; updating the rate of cardiac electrical stimulations; updating the current intensity of the stimulations; updating the number of electrodes being activated (for example so as to contact a different sized area of tissue); updating the time interval and/or number of beats between consecutive stimulations; and/or other treatment parameters.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0319">In some embodiments, an implantable device is provided, including one or more leads for delivering the cardiac electrical stimulation and a controller configured for controlling stimulation via the leads. In some embodiments, the controller is configured for automatically updating one or more treatment parameters in response to a variation made in the treatment plan due to actual cardiac activity. In some embodiments, the controller is programmed with one or more treatment plans and one or more &#x201c;fallback&#x201d; instructions for updating the treatment parameters when treatment is being carried out and is optionally changed due to actual cardiac activity.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0320">Some examples of &#x201c;fallback&#x201d; instructions include: lengthening a treatment session duration if the number of stimulations actually delivered is smaller than a set number of stimulations; increasing an intensity of the stimulation current if the total amount of energy delivered is lower than a set amount of energy to be delivered;</p><p id="p-0314" num="0321">increasing the rate of cardiac electrical stimulations if a treatment session time period has almost ended but not enough stimulations were actually delivered; updating a heart rate threshold for applying of stimulations if the actual heart rate over the treatment session (or a part of it) was not within the defined heart rate for delivery of stimulations.
