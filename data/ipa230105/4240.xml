In some embodiments, the bending is not limited to the two opposite ends <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, and it is also possible to bend any end of the touch sensing film <b>110</b> separately.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> has two lengths L along the first direction (such as, the X-axis direction), and one of the lengths L is greater than the length of the overlapping region OR along the first direction (such as, the X-axis direction). Therefore, a majority of the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> is located in the overlapping region OR, while a portion of the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> is located in the non-overlapping region NOR. That is, the entire overlapping region OR is located within the range of the peripheral area PA (also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). In this way, the overlapping region OR can be folded within the shielding range of the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> to prevent the overlapping region OR from affecting the visual effect.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, along the second direction (such as, the Z-axis direction), except for the lowermost portion <b>1121</b> of the second surface <b>112</b> in the overlapping region OR, the other portion <b>1122</b> of the second surface <b>112</b> is folded to the top. The distance between the uppermost second surface <b>112</b> (the other portion <b>1122</b>) and the lowermost second surface <b>112</b> (the lowermost portion <b>1121</b>) in the overlapping region OR along the second direction (such as, the Z-axis direction) defines a second thickness T<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the second thickness T<b>2</b> is from 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm, such as 0.1 mm, 0.11 mm, 0.12 mm, 0.13 mm, 0.14 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.16 mm, 0.17 mm, 0.18 mm, 0.19 mm, 0.2 mm, or the value of any interval in the foregoing point values. The thickness obtained by subtracting twice the first thickness T<b>1</b> from the second thickness T<b>2</b> is the thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b>. The thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b> may be greater than or equal to 50 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m, i.e., 50 &#x3bc;m (T<b>2</b>&#x2212;2T<b>1</b>) 100 &#x3bc;m, such as, 50 &#x3bc;m, 60 &#x3bc;m, 70 &#x3bc;m, 80 &#x3bc;m, 90 &#x3bc;m, 100 &#x3bc;m, or the value of any of the foregoing intervals. When the thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b> is less than 50 &#x3bc;m, it is easy to cause the bending degree of the touch sensing film <b>110</b> to be too large (i.e., the bending radius is too small). In this case, it is easy to cause a conductive line or an electrode pattern in the bending area to break, thus causing the touch to be ineffective. When the thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b> is greater than 100 &#x3bc;m, a third adhesive layer <b>123</b> (also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>) needs to be thicker to effectively adhere the touch sensing film <b>110</b> and a display module <b>150</b>, resulting in the overall thickness of the touch display device <b>100</b> being too large, which runs counter to the development trend of the touch display module of becoming lighter and thinner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, in some embodiments, in addition to adhering to the cover plate <b>130</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b>, the second adhesive layer <b>122</b> may further extend between the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b> to adhere the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b>. That is, the second adhesive layer <b>122</b> is also disposed between the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b>. In this case, the second adhesive layer <b>122</b> can make the adhesion between the light-shielding layer <b>140</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b> tighter, and the second adhesive layer <b>122</b> can also make the interface between the second adhesive layer <b>122</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b> less likely to generate bubbles.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> and the display module <b>150</b> are provided, and then, the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> is used to adhere the touch sensing film <b>110</b> and the display module <b>150</b> to obtain the touch display device <b>100</b>. In the touch display device <b>100</b>, the surface of the touch sensing film <b>110</b> adjacent to the cover plate <b>130</b> only has the second surface <b>112</b>, and the surface of the touch sensing film <b>110</b> adjacent to the display module <b>150</b> has both of a portion <b>1112</b> of the first surface <b>111</b> and the other portion <b>1122</b> of the second surface <b>112</b>. The distance between the portion <b>1112</b> of the first surface <b>111</b> and the other portion <b>1122</b> of the second surface <b>112</b> along the second direction (such as, the Z-axis direction) defines a height difference H<b>1</b> (i.e., the thickness obtained by subtracting T<b>1</b> from T<b>2</b>, also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). That is, if a gap between the touch sensing film <b>110</b> and the display module <b>150</b> is filled with the third adhesive layer <b>123</b>, the distance of the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> coated on the non-overlapping region NOR along the second direction (such as, the Z-axis direction) defines a thickness T<b>4</b>. The distance of the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> coated on the overlapping region OR along the second direction (such as, the Z-axis direction) defines a thickness T<b>3</b>. The thickness T<b>4</b> is greater than the thickness T<b>3</b>. In some embodiments, the thickness T<b>4</b> of the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> is greater than or equal to twice the thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b> and less than or equal to five times the thickness of the first adhesive layer <b>121</b>, i.e., 2 (thickness T<b>1</b> which is twice the thickness T<b>2</b>)&#x2264;T<b>4</b>&#x2264;5 (T<b>2</b>&#x2212;2T<b>1</b>). If the thickness T<b>4</b> is less than this range, the thickness T<b>4</b> of the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> is insufficient to tightly adhere the display module <b>150</b> and the touch sensing film <b>110</b> in the presence of the height difference H<b>1</b>. That is, if the thickness T<b>4</b> is less than this range, bubbles are prone to appear between the display module <b>150</b> and the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> or between the display module <b>150</b> and the portion <b>1122</b>, and cause moisture to invade the touch sensing film <b>110</b>, which causes a touch failure. If the thickness T<b>4</b> is greater than this range, the overall thickness of the touch display device <b>100</b> is too large, which runs counter to the development trend of the touch display module of becoming lighter and thinner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the third adhesive layer <b>123</b> is made of a light-transmitting material to avoid affecting the visual presentation of the visible area VA.
