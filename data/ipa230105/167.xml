Common devices use heaters to create an aerosol from a suitable medium which is then inhaled by a user. Often suitable media require significant levels of heating prior to generating an aerosol for inhalation. Similarly, current devices offer users a large variety in the media from which inhalable aerosol can be generated. Current devices often require a change in the device, such as the loading of the media, to enable a change in the aerosol generating medium active within the device. Accordingly, it is conventional for such devices to include a replaceable part which can provide a source of energy and a heating element and a consumable or replaceable part which contains an aerosol generating medium which when exhausted is replaced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desirable for aerosol provision devices to rapidly deliver an aerosolized payload to a user. Therefore there is a requirement to avoid long warm up times prior to a user receiving an aerosolized payload.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure is directed toward solving some of the above problems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various approaches are described herein which seek to help address or mitigate at least some of the issues discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of certain embodiments there is provided an aerosol provision system for generating aerosol for user inhalation, the aerosol provision system comprising a replaceable part and a reusable part. The replaceable part comprises a substrate comprising aerosol generating material for generating the aerosol for user inhalation. In some examples the housing of the replaceable part may include an air channel and the substrate may be disposed with respect to the air channel so that air passing through the air channel drawn by user inhalation carries the aerosol generated by the substrate to the user. In other examples the replaceable part may not include an air channel itself but is instead configured to be disposed in an air channel provided by the reusable part. The reusable part comprises a housing including an interface configured to operatively engage with the replaceable part, and an air channel configured at least partially in the housing to provide a passage of air drawn by the user to receive the aerosol generated from the aerosol generating material. A detector is configured to detect a passage of air drawn through the air channel, and at least one aerosol generating element or cell is disposed with respect to the interface and configured, in use, to generate the aerosol from the aerosol generating material. A control circuit is configured to receive a signal from the detector indicating an amount of air drawn by the user and to control the at least one aerosol generating element to generate the aerosol selectively from different regions of the aerosol generating material in response to the amount of air drawn through the air channel. According to this example, the at least one aerosol generating element is configured with respect to the substrate of the replaceable part to generate aerosol selectively from different regions of the aerosol generating material in accordance with the amount of air drawn by the user to generate a selectable amount of the aerosol.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some example embodiments the substrate is configured to be moved with respect to the at least one aerosol generating element so that the aerosol can be generated from the different regions of the aerosol generating material. In other examples the at least one aerosol generating element comprises a plurality of aerosol generating elements which may be selectively activated in series (sequentially) or in parallel to generate the aerosol at different rates or for different durations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some examples the different regions of the aerosol generating material may be discrete portions or dots, but in other examples aerosol generating material may be a continuous deposit, sheet or medium and the different regions are different sections of a continuous or contiguous deposit of the aerosol generating material on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the example embodiments, the control circuit controls the at least one aerosol generating element to generate aerosol from different regions of the aerosol generating material in proportion to one or both of a strength of a user's puff (an amount of air drawn per unit time) and a duration of the user's puff (air draw duration).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It will be appreciated that features and aspects of the disclosure described herein in relation to the first and other aspects of the disclosure are equally applicable to, and may be combined with, embodiments of the disclosure according to other aspects of the disclosure as appropriate, and not just in the specific combinations described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the disclosure will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of a portion of an aerosol provision device (e-cigarette) which includes a reusable part and a consumable part according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a three-dimensional representation of the different components of the aerosol provision device (e-cigarette) comprising the reusable part, and the consumable part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an expanded view of a representation in layers of components of an aerosol provision device according to an example embodiment of the present technique;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of components of the aerosol provision device providing an example cell of an embodiment of the present technique;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an illustrative arrangement of a plurality of gel portions of an aerosol generating material disposed with respect to a corresponding plurality of heating elements;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic representation of an aerosol provision device according to another example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is example of a disk shaped substrate on which a continuous portion of aerosol generating gel is disposed;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of components of the aerosol provision device providing an example cell of an example embodiment of the present technique corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic representation of an aerosol provision device according to another example embodiment corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graphical plot of temperature in the vicinity of the heater or heaters with respect to time illustrating an operation of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Aspects and features of certain examples and embodiments are discussed/described herein. Some aspects and features of certain examples and embodiments may be implemented conventionally and these are not discussed/described in detail in the interests of brevity. It will thus be appreciated that aspects and features of apparatus and methods discussed herein which are not described in detail may be implemented in accordance with any conventional techniques for implementing such aspects and features.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure relates to aerosol provision systems, which may also be referred to as heat not burn systems, such as e-cigarettes. Throughout the following description the term &#x201c;e-cigarette&#x201d; or &#x201c;electronic cigarette&#x201d; may sometimes be used, but it will be appreciated this term may be used interchangeably with aerosol provision system/device and electronic aerosol provision system/device. Furthermore, and as is common in the technical field, the terms &#x201c;vapor&#x201d; and &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d;, and related terms such as &#x201c;vaporize&#x201d;, &#x201c;volatilize&#x201d; and &#x201c;aerosolize&#x201d;, may generally be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Aerosol provision systems (e-cigarettes) often, though not always, comprise a modular assembly including both a reusable part (control unit part) and a replaceable (disposable) cartridge part. Often the replaceable cartridge part will comprise the vapor precursor material and the vaporizer and the reusable part will comprise the power supply (e.g. rechargeable battery) and control circuit. It will be appreciated these different parts may comprise further elements depending on functionality. For example, the reusable device part may comprise a user interface for receiving user input and displaying operating status characteristics, and the replaceable cartridge part may comprise a temperature sensor for helping to control temperature. Cartridges are electrically and mechanically coupled to a control unit for use, for example using a screw thread, latching or bayonet fixing with appropriately engaging electrical contacts. When the vapor precursor material in a cartridge is exhausted, or the user wishes to switch to a different cartridge having a different vapor precursor material, a cartridge may be removed from the control unit and a replacement cartridge attached in its place. Devices conforming to this type of two-part modular configuration may generally be referred to as two-part devices. It is also common for electronic cigarettes to have a generally elongate shape. For the sake of providing a concrete example, certain embodiments of the disclosure described herein will be taken to comprise this kind of generally elongate two-part device employing disposable cartridges. However, it will be appreciated the underlying principles described herein may equally be adopted for different electronic cigarette configurations, for example single-part devices or modular devices comprising more than two parts, refillable devices and single-use disposable devices, as well as devices conforming to other overall shapes, for example based on so-called box-mod high performance devices that typically have a more box-like shape. More generally, it will be appreciated certain embodiments of the disclosure are based on approaches for seeking to help more reliably form a seal for an opening in a reservoir wall through which a wick passes in accordance with the principles described herein, and other constructional and functional aspects of electronic cigarettes implementing approaches in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosure are not of primary significance and may, for example, be implemented in accordance with any established approaches.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view through an example aerosol provision device <b>20</b> in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosure, with a corresponding three dimensional representation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the aerosol provision device <b>20</b> comprises two main components, namely a reusable part <b>22</b> and a replaceable part <b>24</b> also referred to as a consumable. In normal use the reusable part <b>22</b> and the replaceable/cartridge part <b>24</b> are releasably coupled together at an interface <b>26</b>. When the replaceable/cartridge part <b>24</b> is exhausted or the user simply wishes to switch to a different cartridge part, the cartridge part may be removed from the reusable part and a replacement cartridge part attached to the reusable part in its place. The interface <b>26</b> provides a structural, electrical and air path connection between the two parts and may be established in accordance with conventional techniques, for example based around a screw thread, latch mechanism, push-fit or friction fit, or bayonet fixing with appropriately arranged electrical contacts and openings for establishing the electrical connection and air path between the two parts as appropriate. The specific manner in which the replaceable part <b>24</b> mechanically couples to the reusable part <b>22</b> is not significant to the principles described herein, but for the sake of a concrete example is assumed here to comprise a latching mechanism, for example with a portion of the cartridge being received in a corresponding receptacle in the reusable part with cooperating latch engaging elements (not represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). It will also be appreciated the interface <b>26</b> in some implementations may not support an electrical and/or air path connection between the respective parts. For example, in some implementations a vaporizer may be provided in the reusable part rather than in the cartridge part, or the transfer of electrical power from the reusable part to the cartridge part may be wireless (e.g. based on electromagnetic induction), so that an electrical connection between the reusable part and the cartridge part is not needed. Furthermore, in some implementations the airflow through the electronic cigarette might not go through the reusable part so that an air path connection between the reusable part and the cartridge part is not needed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The replaceable part <b>24</b> may in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosure be broadly conventional apart from where modified in accordance with the approaches described herein in accordance with certain embodiments of the disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the replaceable part <b>24</b> comprises a housing <b>62</b> formed of a plastics material. In other examples the housing <b>62</b> may be at least partly formed from paper and/or card. For example, the housing <b>62</b> may be paper wrapped around one or more (cylindrical) portions of aerosol generating material. The replaceable housing <b>62</b> may support other components of the replaceable part <b>24</b> and provides the mechanical interface <b>26</b> with the reusable part <b>22</b>. The replaceable housing is generally circularly symmetric about a longitudinal axis along which the replaceable part couples to the reusable part <b>22</b>. In this example the replaceable part has a length of around 4 cm and a diameter of around 1.5 cm. However, it will be appreciated the specific geometry, and more generally the overall shape and materials used, may be different in different implementations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Broadly speaking, however, in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure, the replaceable part <b>24</b> comprises or consists of one or more portions of aerosol generating material. The replaceable part <b>24</b> is the component which provides the aerosol generating material to the reusable part <b>22</b> and, when engaged with the reusable part <b>22</b>, is able to be used to generate aerosol for user inhalation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, the replaceable part <b>24</b> consists of, and is formed entirely of, the aerosol generating material. In these examples, the substrate <b>110</b> as used herein may refer to either the replaceable part <b>24</b> or the aerosol generating material. That is, the replaceable part, aerosol generating material and substrate may be one and the same. In these examples, the reusable part <b>22</b> may be configured to receive the aerosol generating material, e.g., via a suitable receptacle acting as the interface <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other examples, the reusable part <b>22</b> may comprise a support on which the aerosol generating material may be deposited. In these implementations, the combination of the support and aerosol generating material may be referred to as the substrate <b>110</b>. In these examples, the reusable part <b>22</b> may consist of, or comprise, the substrate <b>110</b>. In one example, the substrate <b>110</b> may be housed in the replaceable part <b>24</b>, e.g., in a plastic housing, and the plastic housing of the replaceable part <b>24</b> is configured to engage with the reusable part <b>22</b> at the interface <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the replaceable part <b>24</b> may consist of the substrate <b>110</b> and the reusable part <b>22</b> may be configured to receive the substrate <b>110</b>, e.g., via a suitable receptacle acting as the interface <b>26</b>. The support may, for example, be or comprise paper, card, paperboard, cardboard, reconstituted material, a plastics material, a ceramic material, a composite material, glass, a metal, or a metal alloy. In some embodiments, the support comprises a susceptor. In some embodiments, the susceptor is embedded within the material. In some alternative embodiments, the susceptor is on one or either side of the material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the purposes of a concrete disclosure, the replaceable part <b>24</b> comprises a replaceable housing <b>62</b> within which the substrate <b>110</b> is housed. However, it should be appreciated that certain aspects of the present disclosure may be equally applied regardless of the form of the replaceable part <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, within the replaceable housing <b>62</b> is a layer providing a substrate <b>110</b> on which is disposed aerosol generating material. The substrate is supported by one or more walls of the housing <b>62</b> in close proximity to a heating layer <b>112</b> which may protrude from the reusable part <b>22</b> into the replaceable part <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the replaceable part <b>24</b> in some examples includes an air channel <b>72</b>, <b>75</b>. The reusable part <b>22</b> comprises an outer housing <b>32</b> with an opening that defines an air inlet <b>48</b> for the e-cigarette, a battery <b>46</b> for providing operating power for the electronic cigarette, control circuitry <b>38</b> for controlling and monitoring the operation of the electronic cigarette, a user input button <b>34</b> and a visual display <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The outer housing <b>32</b> may be formed, for example, from a plastics or metallic material and in this example has a circular cross-section generally conforming to the shape and size of the replaceable part <b>24</b> so as to provide a smooth transition between the two parts at the interface <b>26</b>. In this example, the reusable part has a length of around 8 cm so the overall length of the e-cigarette when the replaceable part and reusable part are coupled together is around 12 cm. However, and as already noted, it will be appreciated that the overall shape and scale of an electronic cigarette implementing an embodiment of the disclosure is not significant to the principles described herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The air inlet <b>48</b> connects to an air path <b>50</b> through the reusable part <b>22</b>. The reusable part air path <b>50</b> in turn connects to the replaceable part air path <b>72</b> across the interface <b>26</b> when the reusable part <b>22</b> and replaceable part <b>24</b> are connected together. Thus, when a user inhales on the mouthpiece opening <b>70</b>, air is drawn in through the air inlet <b>48</b>, along the reusable part air path <b>50</b>, across the interface <b>26</b>, through the vapor generation region <b>73</b> in the vicinity of the aerosol generating material, along the replaceable part air path <b>72</b>, through an air channel <b>75</b> and out through the mouthpiece opening <b>70</b> for user inhalation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore according to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the replaceable part <b>24</b> includes an air channel <b>75</b>. However, in other embodiments, the replaceable part <b>24</b> may not include an air channel. In these embodiments, the replaceable part <b>24</b> is configured with an arrangement of the substrate to the effect that when the replaceable part <b>24</b> is engaged with the reusable part <b>22</b>, the substrate <b>110</b> is disposed with respect to the air channel <b>72</b> formed in the reusable part <b>22</b> so that air passing through an air channel <b>50</b>, of the reusable <b>22</b> part drawn by user inhalation carries the aerosol generated by the substrate <b>110</b> of the replaceable part <b>24</b> to the user. For example, the substrate <b>110</b> may be disposed in the air channel <b>50</b>, such that air may pass over one or more surfaces of the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A battery <b>46</b> in this example may be rechargeable and may be of a conventional type, for example of the kind normally used in electronic cigarettes and other applications requiring provision of relatively high currents over relatively short periods. The battery <b>46</b> may be recharged through a charging connector in the reusable part <b>22</b> housing <b>32</b>, for example a USB connector (not shown).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The user input button <b>34</b> in this example is a conventional mechanical button, for example comprising a spring mounted component which may be pressed by a user to establish an electrical contact. In this regard, the input button may be considered an input device for detecting user input and the specific manner in which the button is implemented is not significant. For example, other forms of mechanical button(s) or touch-sensitive button(s) (e.g. based on capacitive or optical sensing techniques) may be used in other implementations.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The display <b>44</b> is provided to provide a user with a visual indication of various characteristics associated with the aerosol provision device, for example current power setting information, remaining battery power, and so forth. More generally, the manner in which the display is provided and information is displayed to a user using the display is not significant to the principles described herein. For example, some embodiments may not include a visual display and may include other means for providing a user with information relating to operating characteristics of the aerosol provision device, for example using audio signaling or haptic feedback, or may not include any means for providing a user with information relating to operating characteristics of the aerosol provision device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Control circuitry <b>38</b> is suitably configured/programmed to control the operation of the electronic cigarette to provide functionality in accordance with the established techniques for operating electronic cigarettes. For example, the control circuitry <b>38</b> may be configured to control a supply of power from the battery <b>46</b> to a heat controller, which controls the heating layer <b>112</b> to generate vapor from a portion of one or more doses of the material in the replaceable part <b>24</b> for user inhalation via the mouthpiece outlet <b>70</b> in response to user activation of the input button <b>34</b>, or in other implementations in response to other triggers, for example in response to detecting user inhalation. The control circuitry (processor circuitry) <b>38</b> may be considered to logically comprise various sub-units/circuitry elements associated with different aspects of the aerosol provision device's operation, for example user input detection, power supply control, display driving, and so on. It will be appreciated the functionality of the control circuitry <b>38</b> can be provided in various different ways, for example using one or more suitably programmed programmable computer(s) and/or one or more suitably configured application-specific integrated circuit(s)/circuitry/chip(s)/chipset(s) configured to provide the desired functionality.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be explained in more detail below, the control circuitry may also include a memory and a clock/timer in order to estimate an amount of gel which has been used during a puff and therefore an amount remaining. Accordingly the control circuitry can determine whether a gel portion has been exhausted.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term puff as used herein refers to a continuous or effectively continuous draw of air through the air channel by a user to inhale vapor from the aerosol provision device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The aerosol provision system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> differs from conventional electronic cigarettes in a manner in which portion of the aerosol generating material are heated to generate an aerosol for user inhalation in response to an amount of air drawn by the user though the air channel <b>50</b>, <b>72</b> through the mouth piece <b>70</b>. As will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> the control circuit <b>38</b> controls the heater layer <b>112</b> selectively energize different heating elements of the heating layer <b>112</b> in response to an amount of air flow in the air channel <b>50</b>, <b>72</b> as detected by an air flow detector <b>92</b>. According to example embodiments of the present technique therefore the aerosolizable provision device is configured to provide a puff response, that is, an amount of heating and/or aerosol is generated in response to and in proportion with a user's puff strength/duration. The device finds particular application with Tobacco Heated Product (THP) devices. Previously proposed arrangements have tended to include a single heater to generate vapor for example from a reconstituted tobacco rod (taking a form similar to a combustible cigarette) which heats an entire tobacco rod to provide aerosol during a usage session. However a single larger heating element which heats a relatively large mass of consumable can take a reasonably long time (e.g., 40 seconds to a minute) to reach an operational temperature and begin vaporizing the consumable. Equally, it is quite difficult to rapidly change the temperature of heaters because heaters have a thermal response time comparable to or greater than the typical length of a puff.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present technique is therefore based on the realization that puff response can be achieved in THP when using relatively smaller heaters arranged to heat relatively smaller patches of gel, whereby the thermal response time of the heater/system may be relatively quicker.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An example consumable is a flat substrate <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref> (e.g., of paper/card) having a plurality of aerosol generating material (gel) portions <b>114</b> located on a surface thereof, each having a pre-defined mass. Each of the gel portions <b>114</b> may be heated by an individual heater <b>120</b> positioned below the flat substrate <b>110</b> or in close proximity according to an arrangement which may vary in accordance with physical characteristics of the aerosol provision device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A more detailed arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in which an exploded view is shown of the substrate <b>110</b> on which the portions of the aerosol generating material <b>114</b> are shown above the heating layer <b>112</b>, which is shown above a control layer <b>113</b>. It will be appreciated that the arrangement of the control layer <b>113</b>, the heating layer <b>112</b> and the substrate <b>110</b> is for illustrative purposes only and may not conform to a practical configuration of an aerosol provision device embodying the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows separate portions, dots or discrete portions of the aerosol generating material, which form different regions, in other examples, the aerosol generating material may be a continuous deposit, sheet or medium and the different regions are different sections of a continuous or contiguous deposit of the aerosol generating material on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the heating layer <b>112</b> includes a plurality of aerosol generating elements, each of the aerosol generating elements comprising a controllable cell <b>115</b>. The heating layer <b>112</b> therefore provides adjacent each of the gel portions <b>114</b> in the substrate <b>110</b> a controllable cell which can generate heat for that gel portion. An example representation of one of the cells <b>115</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the cell is shown to comprise a heating element or heater <b>120</b> which is connected to a circuit which includes connection to a power supply <b>146</b>.<b>1</b> and a variable resistor or potentiometer <b>117</b> or similar device which can vary an amount of current supplied by the circuit to the heating element <b>120</b>. A control channel or conductor <b>119</b> connects a control input on the potentiometer <b>117</b> to the controller <b>38</b>. A signal applied to the control channel <b>119</b> from the controller <b>38</b> to the potentiometer <b>117</b> can vary an amount of current supplied to the heating element <b>120</b> from the power supply <b>146</b>.<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example described below, the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> is a heater, e.g., a resistive heater, which supplies energy (in the form of heat) to the aerosol generating medium to generate heat. The device <b>100</b> may have a plurality of chambers or regions that may or may not be separate from one another. The device <b>100</b> may have a power chamber (not shown) comprising a power source for supplying power to the source of energy for heating <b>120</b>. The source of energy for heating <b>120</b> in the described example is an electrically resistive heater <b>120</b>. However, in other examples, the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> may be a chemically activated heater which may or may not operate via exothermic reactions or the like. The source of energy for heating <b>120</b> may be part of an inductive heating system, wherein the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> is the source of energy for inductive heating, such as a coil of copper wire, and the substrate <b>110</b> may be or may contain a susceptor or the like. The susceptor may for example be a sheet of aluminum foil or the like. For the purposes of providing a concrete example, the source of energy for heating is herein described as a resistive heater, but it should be appreciated that references different heaters or heating system components are envisaged for use in the present device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The heater <b>120</b> provides thermal energy, heat, to the surrounding environment of the heater <b>120</b>. At least some portion of the substrate <b>110</b> is within the area of effect of the heater <b>120</b>. The area of effect of the heater <b>120</b> is the area within which the heater <b>120</b> may provide heat to an item.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The substrate <b>110</b> of the present example includes aerosol generating medium disposed on a surface thereof. However, in other implementations, the substrate <b>110</b> may be formed exclusively of aerosol generating medium. In yet other implementations, the substrate <b>110</b> may have a layered structure from a plurality of materials. In one example, the substrate <b>110</b> may have a layer formed from at least one of thermally conductive material, inductive material, permeable material or impermeable material.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The source of aerosol generating medium may take any suitable form or construction. In one embodiment, the source of aerosol generating medium may include a substrate (for example, paper, card, foil) including a first and second side, with the aerosol generating medium disposed on the first side of the substrate. The substrate in this instance may act as a carrier for the aerosol generating medium. In some implementations, the substrate may be, or may include, a metallic element that is arranged to be heated by a varying magnetic field. In such implementations, the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> may include an induction coil, which, when energized, causes heating within the metallic element of the source <b>110</b>. The degree of heating may be affected by the distance between the metallic element and the induction coil. In yet further alternative implementations, the source of aerosol generating medium may consist entirely (or substantially entirely) of aerosol generating medium (i.e., without a carrier). For the purposes of describing a concrete example, the source <b>110</b> described herein includes a substrate with aerosol generating medium disposed on the first side of the substrate, while the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> is herein a resistive heater.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an example the aerosol forming material is disposed on the substrate <b>110</b> such that the distance from the source of energy for heating <b>120</b> to the aerosol forming material is within the range of 0.010 mm, 0.015 mm, 0.017 mm, 0.020 mm. 0.023 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.075 mm, 0.1 mm, to about 4 mm, 3.5 mm, 3 mm, 2.5 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm or 0.3 mm.

Alternatively each cell could be connected to a single power supply such as the power supply <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The cell shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> provides an individually controllable heater <b>120</b> which can be controlled by the controller <b>38</b> to produce an amount of heat provided to heat the gel portion <b>114</b>. Since the substrate <b>110</b> includes a plurality of gel portions <b>114</b> and the heating layer <b>112</b> includes a corresponding number of cells with individual heaters <b>120</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the controller <b>38</b> can control the heaters in series or in parallel to cause one or more of the gel portions to generate an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain embodiments, the controller <b>38</b> is configured to control the cells <b>110</b> of the heating layer to vary an amount of heat and therefore aerosol generated by a gel portion or portions <b>114</b> in response to and in proportion with an amount of air drawn by a user through the air channel <b>50</b>, <b>72</b>. The amount of air drawn though the air channel <b>50</b>, <b>72</b> is detected by the air-flow sensor <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The air-flow sensor <b>92</b> could be a pressure transducer or an anemometer such as a hot wire anemometer, an acoustic sensor or a sensor which measures the cooling effect from water.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one example, the power supply to the heater <b>120</b> of a cell can be varied in response to a strength of the user's puff, as measured by the air flow sensor <b>92</b>. For example, a strength of the puff in terms of a magnitude of a signal detected by the air flow sensor <b>92</b> is proportional to an applied electrical power to the heater. Suppose a first puff causes a first power level P<sub>first </sub>to be delivered to the heater <b>120</b> of a cell <b>110</b>, a second puff causes a power level P<sub>second </sub>to be supplied to the heater <b>120</b> of a cell. In the event that P<sub>second </sub>is greater than P<sub>first</sub>, a greater amount of aerosol can be generated more quickly because the greater power vaporizes the gel portion <b>114</b> relatively more quickly and generates relatively more aerosol per unit time. In the event that the puff duration as measured by the air flow sensor <b>92</b> is longer than the time necessary to vaporize all of a gel portion <b>114</b>, then power can subsequently be applied to a second gel portion <b>114</b> by the heater <b>120</b> of another cell <b>110</b>, while the heater <b>120</b> of the first cell <b>110</b> is turned off, to continue generating the aerosol for that puff. As a result of a configuration of the plurality of smaller heaters compared with a smaller number of larger heaters (e.g. one) the heaters have a relatively small mass. As a result, the heaters can reach operating temperature more quickly than a larger heater.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An amount of aerosol generated by each gel portion can be considered to be approximately proportional to an amount of cumulative energy applied to the gel portion from the power generated by the heater with respect to time. Therefore by recording an indication of an amount of power which is being applied to a gel portion over time, the controller <b>38</b> can be configured to estimate an amount of aerosol the gel portion will produce until exhausted and therefore an amount of aerosol remaining before the gel portion is exhausted. To this end, the controller <b>38</b> can include a memory for storing an amount of time for which an amount of heat has been applied to a gel portion <b>114</b>, the time being measured with respect to a clock <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. The recorded time and power can be used to calculate a cumulative amount of energy which has been applied to a gel portion <b>114</b> and therefore the amount of gel still remaining. Alternatively, the air flow sensor <b>92</b> can be used to determine an amount of air drawn through the air channel in the vicinity of the vapor generating region <b>73</b> to detect an amount of vapor generated by a gel portion, so that the controller <b>38</b> can activate the different cells and determine whether it is necessary to activate another gel portion if one becomes exhausted. In a second example, a heater <b>120</b> of a cell <b>115</b> can be operated to supply a fixed power P<sub>fixed </sub>to provide a set amount of aerosol from a corresponding gel portion <b>114</b> per unit time. If a strength of a user's puff is stronger than a default puff strength, for which P<sub>fixed </sub>has been correspondingly set, then an additional power P<sub>add </sub>is simultaneously supplied to a heater <b>120</b> of a second of the plurality of cells <b>115</b> to generate an aerosol from a second portion of gel <b>114</b> to increase a total volume of aerosol entering the air channel supplied per unit time. Hence, P<sub>fixed</sub>+P<sub>add </sub>may be equal to P<sub>second </sub>in the above example. However activating two heaters <b>120</b> from two different cells <b>115</b> in parallel can produce the aerosol more quickly than a single heater <b>120</b> from a single cell <b>115</b>. This can also be thought of as increasing the surface area of the active part of the heater arrangement. As with the first example, if the duration of the puff is greater than the time necessary to deplete a gel portion <b>114</b>, then another gel portion <b>114</b> can be heated to maintain the volume of aerosol per unit time generated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In each example, the total amount of power supplied to the heater arrangement (or the active parts of the heater arrangement in contact with the gel) at any one time is proportional to the strength of the detected puff.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another example, the user's previous puff data, as measured by the air flow sensor <b>92</b> e.g. strength, duration or frequency can be stored in a memory and then used to predict future puff behavior of the user e.g. the next puff to be taken. This means, the controller <b>38</b> can be configured to deliver a specific power level to the heater <b>120</b> of a cell <b>110</b> before the user takes a puff, so that the aerosol is ready immediately for inhalation by the user. Thus the controller <b>38</b> can be configured to activate the required number of cells to produce the predicted required volume of aerosol. Similarly to previous examples, if it is determined that the predicted puff will deplete the gel portion <b>14</b> before the end of the duration of the predicted puff, then another gel portion <b>14</b> can be heated to maintain the volume of aerosol predicted to be required.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the example embodiments described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, each of the gel portions is provided with a corresponding cell <b>115</b> and a heater <b>120</b>.

The substrate <b>110</b> in this implementation may be formed of partially or entirely of paper or card.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to this example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an amount of power supplied to the heater <b>120</b> and a rotation of the substrate is controlled by the controller <b>238</b> in response to a strength of a puff from the user as measured by an air flow sensor <b>192</b>. That is to say that a signal indicative of an amount of air being drawn by the user through the aerosol provision device <b>100</b> generated by the air flow sensor <b>192</b> is fed to the controller <b>238</b> which controls an amount of heat produced by the heater <b>120</b> and therefore the amount of aerosol generated. As for the above example, an amount of power supplied to the heater <b>120</b> can be controlled to be proportional to the puff strength from the user as indicated by an amount of air drawn by the user. Therefore an amount of power supplied to the heater is controlled in proportion with the amount of air drawn. If a duration of a user's puff continues for a time which exceeds an amount of vapor which can be generated from a gel portion or a remaining amount of a gel portion then the controller <b>238</b> can control the rotation mechanism to rotate the substrate so that a new portion of the gel can be heated to generate vapor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As will be appreciated for the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in contrast to the example embodiments presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, with only a single heater, vapor can be only generated from one gel portion <b>114</b> at a time. However a plurality of heaters <b>120</b> can also be included with the aerosol provision device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> so that if there is a demand to increase an amount of vapor included in an aerosol generated in proportion to a user's puff strength or duration of a user's puff then more than one heater can be activated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The above embodiments have been described with respect to a plurality of discrete gel portions in which one or more discrete heaters are used to heat a single gel portion which may be continuous or dis-continuous. However, in other examples, the gel may be continuous and multiple heaters could be used to vaporize the gel. For instance, in the case of the second example embodiments with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a heater surface may be split into segments, which may either be activated or not based on the strength of the user's puff, or they may already be activated and moved towards/away from the consumable. One example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> in which the gel <b>214</b> is formed on a disk shaped substrate <b>210</b>. Two heating elements <b>220</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>220</b>.<b>2</b> are arranged below different sections <b>243</b>, <b>244</b> of the gel into which a continuous surface of the gel is divided <b>241</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>243</b>, <b>244</b>. As for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the substrate can be rotated as the gel sections are exhausted.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, a humidity sensor is also included to determine an amount of water vapor in surrounding air, which is used by the controller <b>238</b> to adjust an amount of heat applied to a gel portion or adjust an estimate of an amount of the gel remaining before activating another gel portion. Air humidity can affect a rate at which vapor is generated when heat is applied to a gel portion to form an aerosol. As such a user may need to draw more air depending on the air humidity. Therefore by estimating a measure of the air humidity, the controller can determine more accurately an amount of gel remaining in the gel portion with respect to an amount of heat (energy) already imparted to the gel portion and therefore when it is necessary to switch to a new gel portion.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the above examples, the controller <b>38</b> manages the heating elements <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>.<b>2</b> to generate the vapor from the gel portions in an open loop manner in the sense that the estimate of an amount of vapor generated from a gel portion is determined without directly measuring whether the vapor is being produced by a gel portion. This can provide a more simple arrangement for controlling the heating elements to generate the vapor, but may have a disadvantage in that a manufacturing tolerance for a consumable which includes the gel portions may be required to be high in order to avoid gel portions either being exhausted before the controller switches to a new gel portion <b>114</b> or the controller switching to a new gel portion when gel in a previous portion still remains.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As will be appreciated, in other example embodiments a detector may be used to provide an estimate of vapor produced from the gel in the aerosol and therefore to detect when a gel portion has been exhausted and stops generating vapor, before or during switching. One example of such a detector is an optical obstruction or turbidity type sensor in which the amount of vapor present is determined from an amount of light absorbed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As a further example embodiment a temperature sensor could be provided proximate the heating elements or a temperature sensor could be provided for each heating element. Such example embodiments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, which correspond to the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, each of the controllable cells includes a temperature sensor <b>300</b>, which is connected the controller <b>38</b>. The temperature sensor can therefore measure the temperature in or around the gel portion <b>114</b>. An alternative is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> in which a single temperature sensor <b>300</b> is provided for the plurality of controllable cells with associated gel portions <b>114</b>. For the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, it may be sufficient for a temperature sensor <b>300</b> to be disposed in the vicinity of the consumable. According to these example embodiments, the temperature sensor or sensors <b>300</b> can be used to detect a rate of change of temperature. As will be appreciated, whilst there is gel in a gel portion <b>114</b>, the temperature in the vicinity of the gel portion will remain substantially constant, because the gel is absorbing the heat as the heat energy is being converted into vapor, however once the vapor is exhausted the temperature around the heater will increase rapidly. An example is illustrated graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which shows a plot <b>320</b> of temperature with respect to time. During a first section there is an increase in temperature until a gel portion <b>114</b> begins to generate vapor. After the heater <b>120</b> reaches an ambient temperature and the gel is generating vapor the temperature around the gel portion remains relatively constant as shown in section <b>324</b>. However as the gel is exhausted the heat begins to rise with time as shown in a section <b>326</b>. By comparing the rate of change of temperature with respect to time &#x394;T/&#x394;t with a threshold, the controller <b>38</b> can detect when the gel portion has become exhausted. Accordingly the controller <b>38</b> can be configured to detect if the rate of change of the temperature exceeds a predefined limit corresponding to an exhaustion of the gel and then switch off the heater and switch to another gel portion.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In further example embodiments an aerosol provision system for generating aerosol for user inhalation may comprise a replaceable part <b>24</b> and a reusable part <b>22</b>.
