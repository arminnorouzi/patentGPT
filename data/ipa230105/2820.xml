The rare mutation refers to a relatively rare mutant-type DNA sequence among a large number of wild-type DNA sequences, such as a small amount of tumor mutant gene DNA contained in the blood of a tumor patient, a small amount of tumor mutant DNA remaining in the blood of a cancer patient after treatment, a small amount of fetal DNA contained in the blood of a pregnant woman, a small amount of different genetic traits which are chimeric or mixed in a chimera and a drug-resistant mutation of bacteria or viruses occurring at an initial stage. All the above belong to a category of the rare mutation, and a rare mutation in a narrow sense generally refers to a point mutation. The above mutations are often associated with a disease, either as a direct cause of an attack of a certain disease or as an early sign or an important biomarker of an attack of a certain disease. Therefore, the rare mutation is closely related to human health, and the detection of the rare mutation is of very positive significance in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis, early screening of diseases, disease prognosis and treatment evaluation. Many methods are used for detecting the mutation, but most of the reported methods are limited to a qualitative detection of the mutation and an accurate quantitative detection cannot be performed, where a high-throughput method for quantitatively detecting the rare mutation is especially rarer. Several main detection methods at present are briefly described below.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="2">1. Measurement Methods Based on Capillary Electrophoresis Detection</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One method is a detection technique based on Sanger sequencing. The method mainly includes: separating and purifying the DNA of a sample to be detected, designing a primer for a site to be detected to perform amplification, and then performing direct sequencing. Whether a rare mutation exists may be determined by determining whether a trace allele different from a wild-type gene exists in a sequencing result. Another method is a method based on terminated extension of a fluorescently labeled specific nucleotide. The method mainly includes: designing an amplification primer for a site to be detected to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification on an object fragment, designing a specific extension primer for the site to be detected, and then selectively replacing a corresponding nucleotide in a single deoxynucleotide (dNTP) with one nucleotide in a fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) according to sequence characteristics of the site to be detected. When mutant-type DNA sequence exists in DNA, the extension is terminated at a position of several bases downstream of a target site instead of a position of the target site, and a trace signal is detected through capillary electrophoresis. Defects of these methods are inaccurate detection results and relatively low detection sensitivity when the capillary electrophoresis detection has a relatively high background.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">2. Detection Method Based on Amplification Refractory Mutation System Technology</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), also known as allele specific amplification (ASA), is a method firstly developed by Newton et al. to detect a known mutation. A basic principle is that if a base at a 3&#x2032;-end of a primer is not complementary to a template base, the primer cannot be extended with a general heat-resistant DNA polymerase. Therefore, three primers are designed according to a known point mutation, a base at a 3&#x2032;-end of each of the three primers is separately complementary to a mutant template base and a normal template base, so as to distinguish a template with a certain point mutation from a normal template. At present, this technology has become one of the important methods for an individualized molecular detection of tumors in the world. The disadvantages of this method are that this method cannot perform a quantitative detection on a rare mutation and is not suitable for detecting multiple sites simultaneously.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">3. Detection Method Based on Digital PCR</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At the end of the 20th century, Vogelstein et al. proposed the concept of a digital PCR (dPCR). One sample is divided into dozens to tens of thousands of parts which are assigned to different reaction units, where each unit contains one or more copied target molecules (DNA templates), PCR amplification is separately performed on the target molecules in each reaction unit, and after the amplification, a statistical analysis and quantification are performed on fluorescence signals of each reaction unit. This method requires a dPCR platform, increasing an operation difficulty and a detection cost.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application provides a high-throughput detection method for rare mutation of a gene. Through DNA fragmentation, universal adapter connection, multiplex PCR amplification with specific primers and adapter sequence primers and high-throughput and high-depth sequencing, this technology can perform parallel sequencing on multiple sites to be detected, align and splice sequencing sequences, and analyze and remove a (false positive) sequence with a sequencing error by specifically splicing the sequences, improving the accuracy of a quantitative detection and analysis of a rare mutation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the above technical problems and achieve the above technical object, the present application adopts the following technical solution: a high-throughput detection method for rare mutation of gene.

A distance between a 3&#x2032;-end of a specific binding sequence and the site to be detected is 2-100 bp. The specific probe has a length of preferably 18-36 bp, more preferably 20-27 bp.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(2) DNA to be detected is fragmented by a physical method (such as ultrasound) or a chemical method (such as random enzyme digestion or a transposase). The fragment length of DNA after treatment is preferably 200-1000 bp. The fragmented DNA to be detected is ligated to a Y-type universal adapter (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and PCR amplification is performed with a forward universal primer and a reverse universal primer so that a genomic library is constructed. Each of the forward universal primer and the reverse universal primer contains a sequence the same as or reversely complementary to a bifurcated end of the Y-type universal adapter so that each DNA molecule, both ends of which are ligated to the universal adapter, may be subjected to the PCR amplification to obtain a whole genomic library. Preferably, a number of cycles of the amplification is 6-12.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(3) The forward-strand probe in (1) and the reverse universal primer in (2) form an amplification primer combination 1, the reverse-strand probe in (1) and the forward universal primer in (2) form an amplification primer combination 2, and the constructed genomic library of the DNA to be detected is amplified through the two combinations, separately. As described in (2), the constructed whole genomic library of the DNA to be detected contains a sequence structure of the universal adapter, and one universal amplification primer of the adapter and one specific probe designed for a target site can enrich and amplify fragments containing the target site in the whole genomic library.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(4) Amplification products of the primer combination 1 and the primer combination 2 are mixed in equal amounts, and the mixture is amplified by a pair of PCR primers matched with sequencing primers of a second-generation sequencing platform. Generally, each of the PCR primers has a tag sequence with a length of several to dozens of bases, and amplification products from different samples may be amplified by PCR primers with different tag sequences so that the amplification products from different samples may be mixed together and in data of the subsequent high-throughput sequencing, sequences obtained through the sequencing may be assigned to different samples according to the tag sequences.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">(5) A product of a second round of PCR amplification is subjected to high-throughput pair-ended sequencing. The sequencing may have a read length of PE150-300 bp, and an average sequencing depth is preferably greater than 50000X.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">(6) The sequencing data is analyzed, and samples of sequencing sequences are classified. Genome sequence alignment is performed as follows: the sequences obtained through the sequencing are assigned to corresponding samples according to the tag sequences and then to amplification products of corresponding gene fragments according to a base composition of each sequence. As described in (3), one universal amplification primer of the adapter and one specific probe designed for the target site are used for amplification so that sequencing sequences containing the target site may be obtained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the sequencing sequences start from the same specific probe and have different end positions from each other due to different breakpoint positions of random fragmentation. Sequencing sequences with the same start position and end positions are classified and analyzed, a statistical count of such sequences is N, a certain base type whose count is below 10%*N at the target site is regarded as a sequencing error and filtered, after the filtration, a sequencing depth of an allele of each target site is counted, a sequencing depth of a reference allele of the target site is counted as a, a sequencing depth of another allele (mutation) of the target site is counted as b, and a mutation proportion of the target site is b/(a+b).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A mutation proportion was detected for each of 46 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in simulated samples.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Probes were designed for the 46 SNP sites, and a pair of a forward-strand probe and a reverse-strand probe was designed for each site, separately.
