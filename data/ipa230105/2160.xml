A second target container is transported back into the sorting buffer for processing of different order lines after placement of an item for a first order line, and is moved via a second sorting position to one of the buffer positions and subsequently to the loading position if a source container with an item for a second order line has already been transported into the buffer track section.

for order picking of items, in particular inventory items or returned items, and to a picking station for carrying out the method, as described in the preambles of claims <b>1</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">WO 2011/103404 A1 discloses a method for manual order picking of items at a picking station. In this method, the source containers are retrieved from a warehouse, transported to the picking station, and finally are made available at a (single) retrieval position. The target containers are stored in a sorting buffer, and are delivered in a sequence from the sorting buffer onto a conveyor system, and ultimately are made available sequentially (one after the other) at a (single) loading position. Transport of the source containers from the warehouse to the retrieval position and transport of the target containers from the sorting buffer to the loading position are matched to one another such that a source container and a target container for an order arrive at the retrieval position and loading position approximately simultaneously. The order picking person can retrieve from the source container that is provided at the retrieval position, and place these items in the target container that is provided at the loading position. The target container is conveyed from the loading position back into the sorting buffer if the order assigned to this target container still contains an unprocessed order line. The order picking person always has a single source container and a single target container at hand. Picking stations of this nature are also called one-to-one picking stations. These are characterized by a high pick rate (approximately 1000 items picked per hour), and a low number of mis-picks. The sorting buffer of the known picking system comprises storage racks and at least one storage and retrieval device that is movable between the storage racks, with which device the target containers can be stored at buffer positions and retrieved from the buffer positions. The great mechanical effort for the sorting buffer and the complexity of the control device are disadvantageous. Furthermore, the target containers must travel long transport paths, for which reason the provision of the target containers takes a relatively long time.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP 1 767 472 A1 discloses a method for manual order picking of items at a picking station. In this method, the source containers are retrieved from a warehouse, transported to the picking station, and finally are made available at a minimum of two retrieval positions. The target containers are stored in a sorting buffer, and are delivered in a sequence from the sorting buffer onto a conveyor system, and ultimately are made available at least at two loading positions next to one another. At least over relatively short phases of operation, the order picking person has multiple source containers and multiple target containers at hand. Consequently, a high pick rate can be achieved in principle, but a relatively high number of mis-picks must be expected. Furthermore, the target containers must travel long transport paths, for which reason the provision of the target containers takes a relatively long time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 2 098 464 B1 discloses a method for manual order picking of items at a picking station. The source containers are repeatedly delivered to the order picking person in a circulating manner, on a circulating conveyor device, until a predefined number of items is picked into the target containers from the respective source container. The target containers are each repeatedly delivered to the order picking person in a circulating manner on multiple circulating conveyor devices until the items from the delivered source container have been picked in the desired number to the respective target container in circulation. The order picking person always has one source container and multiple target containers at hand.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similarly, in EP 3 015 404 A1, a method is known for manual picking or returning to stock of items at a picking station, wherein a picking area is divided into picking zones located one behind the other, and each picking zone is assigned a plurality of retrieval positions arranged side by side, one source container being provided at each position. The source containers contain different items. Groups of target containers are moved successively through the picking zones on a target container conveyor system. An order is divided into suborders, and the source containers are delivered to the respective target container group in accordance with the suborders. The order picking person always has multiple source containers and multiple target containers at hand.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">From EP 2 173 644 B <b>1</b>, a method is known for picking of returned items at a picking station, wherein the returned items are provided at a delivery position, and each returned item is detected. The returned items are transported from the delivery position to the picking station on a returned-item conveyor system. For each returned item, a source container is identified in which the returned item is placed. The source container is retrieved from a warehouse while the returned item is transported to the picking station.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One task of the invention is therefore to specify an improved method for order picking of items, in particular inventory items or returned items, and an improved picking station for carrying out the method. In particular, efficient picking at the picking station is to be made possible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The task of the invention is accomplished in that a first target container for processing of different order lines for at least one order is transported back into the sorting buffer after placement of an item for a first order line, and is temporarily buffered at a first sorting position at least until a source container with an item for a second order line is conveyed onward into a buffer track section provided upstream of the retrieval position, and said first target container can be moved from the first sorting position to one of the buffer positions and subsequently to the loading position once the source container having an item for a second order line has been transported into the buffer track section, and a second target container for processing of different order lines for at least one order is transported back into the sorting buffer after placement of an item for a first order line, and is moved through a second sorting position to one of the buffer positions and subsequently to the loading position if a source container with an item for a second order line has already been transported into a buffer track section provided upstream of the retrieval position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the task of the invention is accomplished in that<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">the sorting buffer has buffer positions arranged one behind the other in a delivery direction on a first conveyor device, and sorting positions arranged one behind the other in a return direction on a second conveyor device, and third conveyor devices connecting the sorting positions to the buffer positions in terms of conveying, and in that the delivery device is configured with the single loading position on a fourth conveyor device,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">wherein the first conveyor device and the second conveyor device are connected to one another by the fourth conveyor device in order to convey the target containers onward from the sorting buffer to the loading position, and to convey them away from the loading position to the sorting buffer, for processing of different order lines for at least one order, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">wherein the first conveyor device has at least one conveyor unit for transport of the target containers, and the second conveyor device has at least one conveyor unit for transport of the target containers, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">wherein conveyor units for transport of the target containers are assigned to the buffer positions and to the sorting positions, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">a control unit controls the conveyor units selectively and in such a manner that the target containers in the sorting buffer are sorted into a sequence that is determined as a function of the sequence in which the source containers are provided at the retrieval position, and in that a source container and a target container for an order arrive at the retrieval position and loading position approximately simultaneously.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">The sorting function is performed by the sorting buffer. In this process, a small number of target containers in comparison with the number of source containers is sorted. The sorting buffer is in the immediate vicinity of the loading position. The target containers can be transported to the loading position especially rapidly. Specifically, the sorting buffer implements the sorting function of the target containers, the provision of the target containers in the sorted sequence, and the transport of the target containers out of the sorting buffer and into the sorting buffer. Standardized conveyor devices, which operate reliably, are used for this purpose. In the sorting buffer, transport of the target containers preferably takes place on a horizontal transport plane that is formed by the conveyor units.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the items are held in the source container in a &#x201c;single-product&#x201d; manner, and the items are held in the target containers in a &#x201c;single-order&#x201d; manner. Therefore a single item type is contained in a source container, and a single order is contained in a target container. However, for performance improvement/maximization of the range of items in the warehouse/optimization of the sorting buffer, source containers can each contain different item types and/or the target containers can each contain different orders. In this context, an order comprises one order line or multiple order lines. This is made possible by compartments in the source container and/or target container.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">The picking station comprises a single retrieval position for a source container and a single loading position for a target container. As a result, mis-picks can be reduced to a minimum if picking is performed manually. Similarly, the order picking person need hardly move from the station.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">It also proves to be advantageous when the following measures of the method are carried out:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">retrieval of the source containers from the warehouse by means of a source container distribution system having at least one storage and retrieval device and a source container conveyor system between the warehouse and the picking station, wherein the source container conveyor system comprises at least the buffer track section for transport of the source containers to the retrieval position,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">transport of the source containers in random (chaotic) sequence on the source container conveyor system from the at least one storage and retrieval device to the retrieval position, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">determination, at a sequence determination point that is located along the transport path between the at least one storage and retrieval device and the retrieval position, of the random (chaotic) sequence of the source containers that are required for processing of different order lines for at least one order.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0022">Even though the required source containers for processing of the order lines are delivered to the retrieval position in a random sequence, this sequence is detected at the sequence determination point. The target containers in the sorting buffer determine which source containers must be retrieved. The target containers are sorted in and by the sorting buffer into a sequence that is determined by the sequence of the source containers. It is advantageous that the demands on the sequence in which the source containers are delivered to the retrieval position are negligible, and a high retrieval rate is thus achieved. The picking station can be supplied with source containers essentially without interruption. Moreover, the complexity of the control of the retrieval process is reduced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0023">An additional performance improvement (number of item picks per hour) can be achieved when the
