An RRAM device contains a storage element called a memristor (a contraction of &#x201c;memory resistor&#x201d;) whose resistance varies as a function of the voltage imposed across it.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normally, a dielectric material does not conduct an electric current. In fact, dielectric substances are commonly employed in capacitors for the purpose of preventing the flow of current and maintaining separation of electric charge poles. However, if the dielectric material is subjected to a high enough voltage, it will suddenly conduct due to a phenomenon known as dielectric breakdown. In a conventional dielectric material, dielectric breakdown causes permanent damage and failure of the associated component. In a memristor, however, a controlled, conductive pathway is temporarily formed whose behavior is dependent on the material employed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one form of memristor, an applied voltage causes the dielectric medium to acquire microscopic conductive paths called filaments. The filaments appear as a result of various phenomena such as metal migration or physical defects. Once a filament appears, it can be broken or reversed by the application of a different external voltage. The controlled formation and destruction of a filament allows for a change in resistance of the memristor. Another form of memristor uses an applied voltage to cause a change in the state of a material (such as chalcogenide or certain metal oxide materials), rapidly flipping the material from a conducting phase to a non-conducting (or less conducting) phase, which results in a corresponding and measurable change in the resistance of the material. Regardless of the form of memristor employed, the change in resistance between states of the material can be sensed and arbitrarily assigned to different logical states for storing digital data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the advantages provided by RRAM devices, significant problems with RRAM devices include stochasticity in the operating voltages (set and reset voltages) and the resistance states (high-resistance state (HRS) and low-resistance state (LRS)), poor reliability (endurance and retention), and poor reproducibility (chip-to-chip and device-to-device variability) fundamentally caused by the random growth and rupture of the conductive filaments. In hybrid RRAM cells, the stochasticity issues are primarily associated with defects introduced during the fabrication process, especially originating from the poor size distribution and non-homogeneous distribution of the inorganic elements within the organic matrix, causing a non-uniform electric field and thus affecting the underlying electrochemical processes. These disadvantages, along with other limitations such as processing complexity, high fabrication cost, and high power consumption, continue to restrict the widespread use of RRAM devices as a viable memory storage solution.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention, as manifested in one or more embodiments, beneficially improves the performance (e.g., set and reset switching characteristics) of organic-based RRAM devices. More particularly, one or more embodiments of the invention provide a novel organic-inorganic hybrid RRAM media whose bipolar switching characteristics and stochasticity can be selectively controlled by certain process parameters, such as vapor-phase infiltration (VPI), an ex situ hybridization technique derived from atomic layer deposition. In one or more embodiments, hybrid RRAM devices based on an AlO<sub>x</sub>-infiltrated SU-8 hybrid switching medium feature facile tenability of device switching voltages, off-state current, and on-off ratio by adjusting an amount of infiltrated AlO<sub>x </sub>in the hybrid switching medium. Furthermore, embodiments of the invention achieve a significant reduction in the stochastic, cycle-to-cycle variations of switching parameters enabled at least in part by AlO<sub>x </sub>infiltration, driven by infiltration-induced changes in mechanical, dielectric, and chemical properties of organic media and their influence on the dimension and information characteristics of conductive filaments. Additionally, embodiments of the invention beneficially demonstrate multi-level analog switching capabilities potentially useful for neuromorphic computing applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a first aspect of one or more embodiments of the invention, an RRAM device includes a plurality of memory cells, each of at least a subset of the memory cells including first and second electrodes, and an organic thin film compound mixed with silver perchlorate (AgClO<sub>4</sub>) salt as a base layer that is incorporated with a prescribed quantity of inorganic metal oxide molecules using VPI, the base layer being formed on an upper surface of the first electrode and the second electrode being formed on an upper surface of the base layer. Resistive switching characteristics of the RRAM device are controlled as a function of a concentration of AgClO<sub>4 </sub>salt in the base layer. A variation of device switching parameters is controlled as a function of an amount of infiltrated metal oxide molecules in the base layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one or more embodiments, the base layer is an SU-8:AgClO<sub>4 </sub>matrix. A variation of RRAM device switching parameters, including V<sub>SET </sub>and V<sub>RESET</sub>, is significantly reduced by incorporating molecular AlO<sub>x </sub>network by VPI in the SU-8:AgClO<sub>4 </sub>matrix. Furthermore, control of the device switching parameters is beneficially enabled by selectively adjusting (i.e., tuning) the amount of infiltrated AlO<sub>x</sub>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one or more embodiments, the RRAM device is well-suited for use as an artificial, analog synaptic switching device for low-power neuromorphic computing applications.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a second aspect according to one or more embodiments of the invention, a method for forming an RRAM cell includes: forming a first electrode on at least a portion of an upper surface of a substrate; forming an organic thin film compound mixed with AgClO<sub>4 </sub>salt as a base layer on at least a portion of an upper surface of the first electrode; incorporating the base layer with a prescribed quantity of inorganic metal oxide molecules using VPI; forming a second electrode on at least a portion of an upper surface of the base layer; controlling resistive switching characteristics of the RRAM device as a function of a concentration of AgClO<sub>4 </sub>salt in the base layer; and controlling a variation of device switching parameters as a function of an amount of infiltrated metal oxide molecules in the base layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Techniques of the present invention can provide substantial beneficial technical effects.

It is to be appreciated, however, that embodiments of the invention are not limited to the specific device(s) and/or methods illustratively shown and described herein. Rather, it will become apparent to those skilled in the art given the teachings herein that numerous modifications can be made to the embodiments shown that are within the scope of the claimed invention. That is, no limitations with respect to the embodiments shown and described herein are intended or should be inferred.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">Although the overall fabrication method and structures formed thereby are considered to be entirely novel, certain individual processing steps required to fabricate RRAM devices according to one or more embodiments of the invention may utilize conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques and conventional semiconductor fabrication tooling. These techniques and tooling will already be familiar to one having ordinary skill in the relevant arts. Moreover, many of the processing steps and tooling used to fabricate semiconductor devices are also described in a number of readily available publications, including, for example: P. H. Holloway et al., <i>Handbook of Compound Semiconductors: Growth, Processing, Characterization, and Devices</i>, Cambridge University Press, 2008; and R. K. Willardson et al., <i>Processing and Properties of Compound Semiconductors</i>, Academic Press, 2001, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties for all purposes. It is emphasized that while some individual processing steps may be set forth herein, those steps are merely illustrative, and it is contemplated that one skilled in the art may be familiar with several equally suitable alternatives that would also fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">It is to be understood that the various layers and/or regions shown in the accompanying figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Furthermore, one or more material layers of a type commonly used in such integrated circuit devices may not be explicitly shown in a given figure for clarity of description. This does not imply, however, that the material layer(s) not explicitly shown are omitted in the actual device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">Embodiments of the invention provide organic-inorganic hybrid composite thin films comprising an organic thin film layer infiltrated with inorganic metal oxide molecules. The nanocomposite thin film can be used as an active layer for RRAM devices that feature reduced variance in device switching characteristics, controllable switching parameters by adjusting an amount of infiltrated inorganic materials, multi-level analog switching characteristics for neuromorphic device operation, and/or demonstrated lithographic patternability, among other beneficial features and advantages.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061">Resistive random-access memory (RRAM or ReRAM), also known as conductive bridge random-access memory (CBRAM), also known as programmable metallization cell (PMC), is a type of memory device which relies on electrochemical processes to control the movement of nanoscale quantities of metal/metal ions across a dielectric/solid electrolyte medium. A standard RRAM cell has a simple two-terminal &#x201c;top electrode/solid electrolyte/bottom electrode&#x201d; or a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) sandwich structure and switches between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS) to store, retrieve and erase information (also known as resistive switching). The top electrode typically comprises an electrochemically active material, such as silver (Ag), copper (Cu), or nickel (Ni), and the bottom electrode comprises an electrochemically inert material, such as platinum (Pt), gold (Au), tungsten (W), or tantalum (Ta). A material class for the dielectric film or the solid electrolyte is preferably comprised of oxides, higher chalcogenides (including glasses), semiconductors, as well as organic compounds including polymers. Key desirable attributes of RRAM devices include low voltage and current, rapid write and erase, good retention and endurance, and the ability for the storage cells to be physically scaled to a few tens of nanometers (nm) with suitable patterning processes.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0062">More recently, organic and organic-inorganic hybrid materials have been given much attention as a switching medium in RRAM devices, primarily because they can display tunable mixed material properties and offer various advantages, such as flexibility, simple fabrication process, disposability, biocompatibility, and tunable memory properties, typically achieved by changing the inorganic composition within the organic polymer matrix.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0063">Despite these advantages, major problems with RRAM devices include stochasticity in the operating voltages (set and reset voltages) and the resistance states (HRS and LRS), poor reliability (endurance and retention), and reproducibility (chip-to-chip and device-to-device variation), which are fundamentally caused by the random growth and rupture of the conductive filament. In hybrid RRAM cells, the stochasticity issues are primarily associated with defects introduced during the fabrication process, especially originating from poor size distribution and non-homogeneous distribution of the inorganic elements within the organic matrix, causing non-uniform electric fields and, thus, affecting the underlying electrochemical processes. Adoption of a suitable strategy to improve the control over the structural, physical, and chemical properties of hybrid switching media would enable high-performance hybrid RRAMs with reliable and predictable memory characteristics.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0064">To improve the various device performance issues, several strategies have been explored in various inorganic switching mediums to control and confine the conductive filament in the switching layer to make performance of RRAM more reliable and practical. Through electrode engineering, RRAM devices can effectively enhance the device-to-device uniformity and reduce the distribution of the performance parameters. For instance, as described in Q. Liu, et al., &#x201c;Controllable Growth of Nanoscale Conductive Filaments in Solid-Electrolyte-Based ReRAM by Using a Metal Nanocrystal Covered Bottom Electrode,&#x201d; <i>ACS Nano </i>2010, 4 (10), pp. 6162-6168, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, the surface of the bottom Pt electrode of a Ag/ZrO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CuNC/Pt memory device was decorated so as to control the silver filament formation along the direction of the Cu metal nanocluster (NC). This device, compared to the device with no CuNC (i.e., Ag/ZrO<sub>2</sub>/Pt), showed much narrower set and reset voltage distribution. Shin et al. (K.-Y Shin, et al., &#x201c;Controllable Formation of Nanofilaments in Resistive Memories via Tip-Enhanced Electric Fields,&#x201d; <i>Advanced Electronic Materials </i>2016, 2 (10), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) fabricated a pyramid tip structured Ag/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Pt resistive switching device in which the Ag filament formation was spatially controlled near the pyramid tip. The devices with this structure exhibited low set and reset voltage, higher endurance and retention compared to the conventional geometry device. Likewise, You et al. (B. K. You, et al., &#x201c;Reliable Control of Filament Formation in Resistive Memories by Self-Assembled Nanoinsulators Derived from a Block Copolymer,&#x201d; <i>ACS Nano </i>2014, 8 (9), pp. 9492-9502, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) decorated insulating SiO<sub>2 </sub>nanodots between the top Pt electrode and NiO switching medium using block copolymers for the Pt/SiO<sub>2</sub>/NiO/Ni RRAM device and reduced the standard deviation (SD) for set and reset by 77% and 60%, respectively, and the SD for HRS reduced drastically by 99% compared to the base device (Pt/NiO/Ni).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0065">Another strategy that has been frequently implemented is doping the switching medium by either alloying, embedding nanoparticles, or inserting a two-dimensional (2D) layer into the medium to improve the device performance. Yeon et al. (H. Yeon, et al., &#x201c;Alloying Conducting Channels for Reliable Neuromorphic Computing,&#x201d; <i>Nat Nanotechnol </i>2020, 15 (7), pp. 574-579, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) have reported dramatic reduction of set voltage temporal variation from 16.4% to 3.3% when doping Cu into silicon as the resistive switching medium. Au et al. (K. Au, et al., &#x201c;Enhanced Resistive Switching Effect in Ag Nanoparticle Embedded BaTiO<sub>3 </sub>Thin Films,&#x201d; <i>J. Appl. Phys. </i>2013, 114 (2), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) incorporated Ag nanoparticles into BaTiO<sub>3 </sub>switching medium to increase the on/off ratio and decrease the switching voltage. Zhao et al. (X. Zhao, et al., &#x201c;Confining Cation Injection to Enhance CBRAM Performance by Nanopore Graphene Layer,&#x201d; <i>Small </i>2017, 13 (35), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) used a nanopore graphene as an interlayer between the top Cu electrode and the HfO<sub>2 </sub>switching medium to confine the formation of filaments and thus improved the uniformity of HRS current level.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0066">Engineering strategies to physically constrain the conductive filament within channels in the switching medium has also been realized for improved RRAM-based neuromorphic computing and in-memory data processing. For instance, Choi et al. (Choi, S.; Tan, S. H.; Li, Z.; Kim, Y.; Choi, C.; Chen, P. Y.; Yeon, H.; Yu, S.; Kim, J., SiGe epitaxial memory for neuromorphic computing with reproducible high performance based on engineered dislocations. <i>Nat Mater </i>2018, 17 (4), pp. 335-340, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) demonstrated engineering the dislocations within epitaxially grown amorphous silicon switching medium by alloying with germanium (Ge) to physically constrain the filament growth within SiGe, which resulted in reducing the temporal variation in the set voltage to as low as 1.7% (from 28% for the undoped silicon medium).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0067">However, while various strategies have been suggested and explored to improve the performance of inorganic-based RRAM memory devices, such investigations have been relatively limited for hybrid material-based RRAM devices. For instance, Hong et al. (J.-Y. Hong, et al., &#x201c;A Facile Route for the Preparation of Organic Bistable Memory Devices Based on Size-controlled Conducting Polypyrrole Nanoparticles,&#x201d; <i>Org. Electron. </i>2013, 14 (3), pp., 979-983, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) have shown that the size of polypyrrole NPs embedded in PVA layers play a key role in affecting the charge trapping, and the devices with NPs larger than 60 nm exhibited poor memory performance due to charge leakage originated by rough surfaces. Kim et al. (S.-J. Kim, et al., &#x201c;Control of Gold Nanoparticle-Protein Aggregates in Albumen Matrix for Configurable Switching Devices,&#x201d; <i>Adv. Mater. Interf. </i>2018, 5 (9), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) demonstrated that poor switching characteristics Albumen:Au NP due to Au NP agglomeration could result in poor switching performance and this could be improved by adding an additional poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) capping agent into the hybrid material which prevented the nanoparticle agglomeration inside the hybrid material to provide uniform switching properties.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0068">The present invention, as manifested by one or more embodiments, relates to a novel RRAM device and fabrication method (i) that provides the ability to tune resistive switching across an organic compound such as SU-8, or other polymer compound or block copolymer (BCP), by changing the quantity of silver perchlorate (AgClO<sub>4</sub>) salt concentration, (ii) that not only significantly suppresses the variation of device switching parameters, including V<sub>SET </sub>and V<sub>RESET</sub>, but also enables their control by adjusting the amount of infiltrated AlO<sub>x </sub>by incorporating a molecular AlO<sub>x </sub>network by VPI into the SU-8:AgClO<sub>4 </sub>matrix, and (iii) that provides an artificial, analog synaptic switching device that is well-adapted for low-power neuromorphic computing applications, among other important benefits.

As demonstrated through experimentation, the cross-linked hybrid switching medium exhibited consistent DC switching at compliance current amounts varying between about 10 &#x3bc;A to 1 mA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>E and <b>11</b>F</figref>. By way of example only and without limitation, in order to demonstrate PPF, a continuous train of identical pulses was applied with amplitude of 0.5 V and duration of the pulse was changed between 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 ms, corresponding to frequencies of 200 hertz (Hz), 133.33 Hz, 100 Hz and 66.67 Hz, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>G and <b>11</b>H</figref>. The devices showed a gradual increase in conductance level for the setting process to occur and this was dependent on the pulse interval, which is analogous to PPF effects in biological synapse.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0103">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>, when the pulse interval is short enough (e.g., about 5 ms (200 Hz)), the setting process occurs very quickly (e.g., after about 30 pulses, in this illustrative embodiment), as indicated by curve <b>1102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>. When the pulse interval is increased to 7.5 ms (133.33 Hz), the setting process occurs slower (e.g., after about 80 pulses), as indicated by curve <b>1104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>. After increasing the interval to 10 ms (100 Hz), the setting process is further delayed (e.g., after about 90 pulses), as indicated by curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>g</i></figref>). At a pulse interval of 15 ms (66.67 Hz), no setting was observed, as indicated by curve <b>1108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0104">The current values at pulse peak are plotted as a function of pulse number in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>H</figref> (and inset). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>H</figref>, this illustrative plot shows that as the frequency increases, the number pulses required for the SU-8:AgClO<sub>4</sub>:AlO<sub>x </sub>hybrid RRAM device to turn on decreases. The ability to pattern these hybrid cells formed in accordance with embodiments of the invention, combined with the neuromorphic capability they display, demonstrate that they are a good candidate for making large-scale, cross-bar RRAM devices that can be easily fabricated with industry compatible tools and processing methods.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0105">At least a portion of the techniques according to one or more embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in an integrated circuit, either alone or with other integrated circuit elements.
