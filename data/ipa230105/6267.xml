relates generally to the formation of secondary batteries, and more specifically, to distributed cell formation systems and pre-lithiation modules for lithium containing secondary batteries.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In rocking-chair battery cells, both the positive electrode and the negative electrode of a secondary battery comprise materials into which a carrier ion, such as lithium, inserts and extracts. As the battery is discharged, carrier ions are extracted from the negative electrode and inserted into the positive electrode. As the battery is charged, the carrier ions are extracted from the positive electrode and inserted into the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Silicon has become a promising candidate to replace carbonaceous materials as the anode because of its high specific capacity. For instance, graphite anodes formed from LiC<sub>6 </sub>may have a specific capacity of about 370 milli-amp hours per gram (mAh/g), while crystalline silicon anodes formed from Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4 </sub>may have a specific capacity of about 3600 mAh/g, a nearly 10 fold increase over graphite anodes. However, the use of silicon anodes has been limited, due to the large volumetric changes (e.g., 300%) in silicon when Li carrier ions are inserted into silicon anodes. This volumetric increase along with the cracking and pulverization associated with the charge and discharge cycles has limited the use of silicon anodes in practice. In addition, the use of silicon anodes has been limited due to its poor initial columbic efficiency (ICE), which leads to a capacity loss during the initial formation of secondary batteries that utilize silicon anodes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After a lithium containing secondary battery is assembled, the assembled battery is typically subjected to a formation process. During the formation process the battery is slowly charged and discharged one or more times. At least some known formation processes include a pre-lithiation process to add lithium to the battery. These formation processes are typically performed by large centralized systems. Such systems include a central control center that is connected to all of the batteries that are to undergo the formation process. The central control center directly controls the charging, discharging, and (where applicable) pre-lithiation of all of the batteries to which it is connected. In order to be capable of controlling the formation processes and distributing electrical power to a large number of batteries, the central control centers are relatively large and expensive systems using a significant amount of power, occupying a significant amount of space, and utilizing a large amount of wire to connect to all of the batteries undergoing formation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a pre-lithiation module for a lithium containing secondary battery includes a switched capacitor circuit and a pre-lithiation module controller connected to the switched capacitor circuit.

Thus, instead of a centralized system that requires dedicated connections to every battery undergoing the formation process and that controls the formation process for hundreds or thousands of batteries, the formation process in example embodiments of this disclosure is distributed among smaller clusters, each of which directly handles the formation process for a battery to which it is connected. These embodiments may simplify the construction of formation systems by requiring a less powerful central controller and less interconnection wiring, while allowing the formation processing system to be more easily scaled up or down, and physically distributed where desired.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Some embodiments of the present disclosure may provide benefits such as mitigation or improvement of the poor ICE associated with silicon-based anodes in secondary batteries utilizing an auxiliary anode electrochemically coupled with the secondary battery that provides additional carrier ions during and/or subsequent to initial battery formation. The use of an auxiliary anode mitigates the initial loss of carrier ions in the secondary battery during initial formation, thereby providing a technical benefit of, for example, increasing the capacity of the secondary battery after formation. Further, the introduction of additional carrier ions after battery formation mitigates the cycle-based decrease in carrier ions that are typically lost through secondary reactions, thereby providing a technical benefit of decreasing the cycle-by-cycle capacity loss in a secondary battery. Further still, the introduction of additional carrier ions after battery formation improves the cycling performance of the secondary battery by maintaining the anode of the secondary battery at a lower potential voltage at discharge, as the anode includes additional carrier ions. In some embodiments, the auxiliary anode is removed from the secondary battery after formation, thereby providing a technical benefit of increasing the energy density of the battery.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a secondary battery <b>100</b> of an exemplary embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a unit cell <b>200</b> for the secondary battery <b>100</b>.

When a secondary battery is charged for the first time, the carrier ions are extracted from the cathode and introduced into the anode. As a result, the anode potential is lowered significantly (toward the potential of the carrier ions), and the cathode potential is increased (to become even more positive). These changes in potential may give rise to parasitic reactions on both the cathode and the anode, but sometimes more severely on the anode. For example, a decomposition product comprising lithium (or other carrier ions) and electrolyte components, known as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), may readily form on the surfaces of carbon anodes. These surfaces or covering layers are carrier ion conductors, which establish an ionic connection between the anode and the electrolyte and prevent the reactions from proceeding any further.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Although formation of the SEI layer is desired for the stability of a half-cell system comprising the anode and the electrolyte, a portion of the carrier ions introduced into the cells via the cathode is irreversibly bound and thus removed from cyclic operation, i.e., from the capacity available to the user. As a result, during the initial discharge, fewer carrier ions are returned to the cathode from the anode than was initially provided by the cathode during the initial charging operation, leading to irreversible capacity loss. During each subsequent charge and discharge cycle, the capacity losses resulting from mechanical and/or electrical degradation to the anode and/or the cathode tend to be much less per cycle, but even the relatively small carrier ion losses per cycle contribute significantly to reductions in energy density and cycle life as the battery ages. In addition, chemical and electrochemical degradation may also occur on the electrodes and cause capacity losses. To compensate for the formation of SEI (or another carrier ion-consuming mechanism such as mechanical and/or electrical degradation of the negative electrode), additional or supplementary carrier ions may be provided from an auxiliary electrode after formation of the battery.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In general, the positive electrode <b>208</b> of the secondary battery <b>100</b> (e.g., the collective population of the cathode structures <b>206</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b>) preferably has a reversible coulombic capacity that is matched to the discharge capacity of the negative electrode <b>209</b> (e.g., the collective population of the anode structures <b>207</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b>).
