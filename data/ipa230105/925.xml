IPF has been included in the 2018 National Rare Diseases List, and at present, its incidence is increasing annually in China. IPF tends to occur in middle- and old-aged male population and is manifested as progressively worsening dyspnea, accompanied by restrictive ventilatory dysfunction and gas exchange disorder, eventually leading to hypoxemia and even respiratory failure. The prognosis of IPF is poor, and its lung histology and high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest are manifested as a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with diffuse alveolitis and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis as the main pathologic features, and progressive and irreversible lung damage. The lost of alveoli in numbers leads to the decline or even loss of the pulmonary ventilation function, resulting in hypoxia, reduced mobility and even death of patients. As a result, the average survival duration for those diagnosed with IPF is only 2.8 years, the mortality rate is higher than that of most tumors, and thus IPF is called a &#x201c;tumor-like disease&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traditional method for treatment of IPF is mainly administrating anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-fibrotic drugs. Glucocorticoids can suppress the inflammatory response and the immune process. Immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.) also have the effect of inhibiting the inflammatory response. Thus, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants/cytotoxic drugs were used as the basic drugs for the treatment of IPF, but they are not ideally effective in patients with intermediate to advanced fibrosis. The drugs currently approved for IPF treatment in China include Pirfenidone, Nintedanib, etc., which have a delay effect on the decline of pulmonary function of patients. But it is difficult to improve the pulmonary function or reverse the progression of the disease, and the occurrence of fibrosis cannot be really prevented. At present, the fundamental reason for the lack of effective conventional treatment for IPF worldwide, other than whole-lung transplantation, is the lack of effective methods to regenerate and repair the damaged alveolar structures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Frank McKeon research group at Harvard University was the first to identify a cell group of bronchial basal cells from the distal bronchi of mice in 2011. In 2018, such group of bronchial basal cells was successfully identified in adults in vivo and isolated and amplified in vitro. This group of cells belongs to the basal cell category and has the potential to differentiate into bronchial and alveolar epithelium.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present application provides a use of a REGEND001 autologous cell deliverable formulation in preparing a product, wherein the product has a function of improving the pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
