Compared with terrestrial cellular network communication, the satellite communication has many unique advantages. Firstly, the satellite communication is not restricted by the user's regions, for example, regions which are not covered by general land communication and may not be provided with a communication device, such as oceans, mountains, deserts, or the like, or the regions which may not be covered by communication due to sparse population. For the satellite communication, since one satellite may cover a large area of the ground, and a satellite may orbit around the earth, so that every corner of the earth may be covered with the satellite communication theoretically. Secondly, the satellite communication has relatively high social value. The satellite communication may cover remote mountain areas and poor and backward countries or regions at relatively low cost, so that people in these regions may enjoy advanced voice communication and mobile Internet technologies, which is conducive to narrowing the digital divide with developed regions and promoting development in these regions. Thirdly, the satellite communication distance is long, and the cost of communication may not be significantly increased with the increase of the communication distance. Finally, the satellite communication has high stability and is not restricted by natural disasters.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The communication satellite is classified into a Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, a Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite, a High Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellite, and the like according to different orbital altitudes. A brief description of the LEO and the GEO is given below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The orbital altitude of the LEO ranges from 500 km to 1500 km, and the corresponding orbital period is about 1.5 hours to 2 hours. The signal propagation delay of single-hop communication between terminal devices is generally less than 20 ms. The maximum satellite visual time is 20 minutes. The signal propagation distance is short, the link loss is less, and the requirements for transmitting power of the terminal device are not high.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The orbital altitude of the GEO is 35,786 km and the rotation period around the earth is 24 hours. The signal propagation delay of single-hop communication between the terminal devices is generally 250 ms. In order to ensure the coverage of the satellite and improve the system capacity of the entire satellite communication system, the satellite covers the ground by using multiple beams, and one satellite may form dozens or even hundreds of beams to cover the ground. One satellite beam may cover the ground region with the diameter of tens to hundreds of kilometers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to ensure the coverage of the satellite and improve the system capacity of the entire satellite communication system, the satellite covers the ground by using multiple beams, and one satellite may form dozens or even hundreds of beams to cover the ground. One satellite beam may cover the ground region with the diameter of tens to hundreds of kilometers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Before the detailed description of a method for cell switching provided by the embodiments of the disclosure, a first type of RACH and a second type of RACH are briefly described respectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a New Radio (NR) system, a RACH includes: the first type of RACH and the second type of RACH. Herein, in the first type of RACH, two information exchanges need to be performed between the terminal device and a network device. Therefore, the first type of RACH is also called 2-steps RACH, in the second type of RACH, four information exchanges need to be performed between the terminal device and the network device. Therefore, the second type of RACH is also called 4-steps RACH. According to different RACH modes, the RACH includes Contention-Based Random Access (CBRA) and Contention-Free Random Access (CFRA). According to different RACH types, the RACH includes a first type of RACH and a second type of RACH. The first type of RACH and the second type of RACH are respectively briefly described below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The processing flow of the second type of RACH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, includes the following four operations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At S<b>101</b>, a terminal device sends a RACH Preamble to a network device through a Message 1 (Msg 1).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The terminal device sends the selected Preamble on a selected time domain resource of Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). The network device may estimate the size of uplink grant required by the terminal device to transmit an Msg3 and uplink Timing according to the Preamble.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At S<b>102</b>, after detecting that the terminal device sends the Preamble, the network device sends a Random Access Response (RAR) message to the terminal device through a Msg2, so as to inform the terminal device of the uplink resource information which is used when sending the Msg3, allocate a Radio Network Temporary identity (RNTI) for the terminal device, provide a time advance command for the terminal device, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">After sending the Msg1, the terminal device starts a RAR window, and detects a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) in the RAR window. The detected PDCCH is scrambled with RA-RNTI.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At S<b>103</b>, after receiving the RAR message, the terminal device sends the Msg3 in the uplink resource indicated in the RAR message.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Herein, the message of Msg3 is mainly used to notify the network device what event triggers the RACH process. For example, if it is an initial RACH event, the Msg3 may carry an ID of the terminal device and an establishment cause, and if it is a Radio Resource Control (RRC) reestablishment event, the Msg3 may carry an identity of the terminal device in a connected state and the establishment cause.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Meanwhile, the ID carried by the Msg3 may enable the contention collision to be resolved in operation S<b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At S<b>104</b>, the network device sends an Msg4 including a contention resolution message to the terminal device, and allocates an uplink transmission resource to the terminal device simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When receiving the Msg4 from the network device, the terminal device may detect whether a specific temporary identity of the terminal device which is sent in the Msg3 by the terminal device is included in the contention resolution message sent by a base station. If the specific temporary identity of the terminal device is included in the contention resolution message, it indicates that the RACH process of the terminal device is successful, otherwise, the RACH process fails, and the terminal device needs to initiate the RACH process from the first step again.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another function of the Msg4 is to send a RRC configuration message to the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The contention collision resolution includes two ways. Herein, the first way is that: if the terminal device carries a Cell Radio Network Temper Identity (C-RNTI) in the Msg3, the Msg4 is scheduled by the PDCCH scrambled with the C-RNTI. The second way is that: if the terminal device does not carry the C-RNTI in the Msg3, for example, the terminal device is initial access, the Msg4 is scheduled by the PDCCH scrambled with the TC-RNTI. Collision resolution is achieved by the terminal device receiving a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) of the Msg4 to match with a Service Data Unit (SDU) of a Common Control Channel (CCCH) in the PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above RACH process needs to be completed through four information exchanges between the network device and the terminal device, which leads to the extension of the RACH process. In order to solve the problem of the extension of the RACH process, the first type of PACH is proposed. The processing flow of the first type of PACH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At S<b>201</b>, the terminal device sends an MsgA to the network device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The MsgA consists of a Preamble and a payload. Optionally, the Preamble is the same as the Preamble in the second type of RACH, and this Preamble is transmitted on the PRACH resource. The information carried in the payload is the same as the information in the Msg3 in the second type of RACH, for example, a RRC signaling when the RRC is in an idle state, and a C-RNTI when the RRC in the connected state. The payload may be transmitted by a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The result of receiving the MsgA by the network device may include the following two situations: first, the network device successfully decodes one or more Preambles; and second, the network device successfully decodes one or more preambles and one or more payloads.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At S<b>202</b>, the terminal device receives an MsgB from the network device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, the MsgB includes contents of the Msg2 and the Msg4 in the second type of RACH.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similar to an LTE system, the NR system supports the switching process of the terminal device in the connected state. When the terminal device using a network service moves from one cell to another cell, or due to the adjustment of the wireless transmission service load, the activation operation maintenance, the device failure, etc., in order to ensure the continuity of communication and the quality of the service, the system transfers a communication link between the terminal device and the original cell to the new cell, that is, the switching, process is performed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Taking an Xn interface switching process as an example, the cell switching process applicable to the LTE system and the NR system is divided into the following three stages.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At stage 1, switching preparation: including measurement control and reporting, a switching request and switching acknowledge message. The switching acknowledge message includes a switching command generated by a target cell, and a source cell is not allowed to make any modification for the switching command generated by the target cell and directly forwards the switching command to the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At stage 2, switching execution: the terminal device performs the switching process immediately after receiving the switching command, that is, the terminal device is disconnected with the source cell and is connected with the target cell (for example, RACH is performed, a RRC switching completion message is sent to a target network device, etc.); and the terminal device performs Secondary Node (SN) state transfer, and data forwarding.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At stage 3, switching completion: the target cell performs a Path Switch with an Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and a User Port Function (UPF) to release the context of the terminal device of the source network device.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For a terminal device with single-sending and single-receiving capability, after receiving the switching command, the terminal device is disconnected with the source cell, starts to synchronize the target cell, and initiates the RACH process. After the RACH process is completed, the terminal device can perform data transmission in the target cell. During the RACH process, data transmission may be interrupted.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a NR terrestrial network, the transmission delay between the terminal device and the network device is small, and the time required for the terminal device to perform RACH in the target cell is not long, so that the interrupted time of data transmission is also short. Compared with the terrestrial network, the transmission delay between the terminal device in the NTN and the hazard is larger. Correspondingly, the time required for the terminal device to perform RACH in the target cell is longer, so that the data interruption time in the cell switching process is greatly increased to affect the transmission performance of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The technical solutions of the embodiments of the disclosure may be applied to various communications systems, such as a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) system, a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) system, a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, a LTE Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system, a LTE Time Division Duplex (TDD) system, an Advanced Long Term Evolution (LTE-A) system, an NR system, an evolution system of the NR system, an LTE-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum (LTE-U) system, a NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum (NR-U) system, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) communications system, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), a next generation of communication systems, or other communication systems.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">System architecture and service scenarios described in the embodiments of the disclosure are intended to describe the technical solutions in the embodiments of the disclosure more clearly, but are not intended to limit the technical solutions provided in the embodiments of the disclosure.
