Such devices are frequently made by fitting polymeric material over a dental cast, for example, by placing a thermoplastic over a physical dental cast and/or model and shaping the thermoplastic by changing its temperature. The physical dental model may come from traditional dental methods, for example, a plaster cast of a dental impression taken directly from a patient, or digital dentistry, such as a three-dimensional print based on a three-dimensional scan of a patient's teeth. The physical dental model may also have been altered, for example, to reflect a desired tooth alignment rather than the patient's existing tooth alignment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Once fitted, excess material is removed from the polymeric shell dental appliances before use. This is often done by cutting, with the dental device edge determined by a dental technician. This process is often done by hand, and can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Further, this cutting process relies on the choices of a technician, and may produce inconsistent results.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed is a computer-implemented method for generating an edge curve to facilitate generating the edge for at least a portion of a dental device, said method comprising:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000">identifying at least one tooth reference point for each of at least two teeth on a dental model;<br/>identifying at least one offset point corresponding to each of said at least one tooth reference points such that said at least one offset point is on a gingival surface of said dental model and positioned outside an interproximal area; and<br/>generating said edge curve by connecting the offset points such that the edge curve is outside the interproximal area and on the gingival surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The at least two teeth may include adjacent teeth or teeth which are separated by one or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The method disclosed digitally generates an edge curve, a curve on a dental model to facilitate generating an edge or portion thereof for a dental device. In one embodiment, the edge curve is used to facilitate cutting an edge for a polymeric shell dental device. In one embodiment, the edge curve defines the edge of three-dimensionally printed dental device. The method reduces the time and labor required to prepare a dental device for a patient to use. Further, the use of offset points allows more precise control over the shape of the dental device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Since the precise offset distances may be set, edge curves can be consistent across dental devices. This can help both dental technicians maintain consistency in their own work, as well as allowing patients to specify their preferences. For example, in orthodontic treatment by clear aligner, a sequential series of clear aligners gradually changes the position of a patient's teeth. A patient may prefer an offset distance of 0.15 mm from the tooth reference points, for example; with the method disclosed, the entire series of clear aligners may have the same offset distance, even if made by different dental technicians.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">A dental model is a representation of teeth, gingiva, palate, jaws, and/or other items in the mouth, such as brackets, crowns, and/or veneers. Examples of a dental model include but are not limited to: a three-dimensional scan of a dental cast and/or model, and/or a generated three-dimensional dental model, for example, as part of a treatment plan. Three-dimensional scans may be used in making dental splints, retainers, and/or indirect bonding trays. Generated three-dimensional models are useful in designing orthodontic treatments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">A tooth reference point is a point in, on, and/or within 0.5 mm of the tooth. It may be from the list including but not limited to: anatomical features including but not limited to crown centers, cusps, grooves, occlusal points, pits, and/or visible apices; calculated features including but not limited to a point on an axis such as a tooth long axis and/or midpoints such as a mesial-distal midpoint; geometrical features including but not limited to geometric centers and/or points on axes; technical features including but not limited to orthodontic brackets; a projection to the surface derived from one or more of the above; and/or a translation of any of the above.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">According to an embodiment, the method identifies at least one tooth reference point on at least two teeth on a dental model. One embodiment uses as the tooth reference point a visible apex of the tooth, discussed below.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">Next, an offset point is identified for each tooth reference point. Offset describes the location of an object compared to another object. An offset point is a point with a location based on the location of a corresponding dental model point. A dental model point is a point in, on, and/or within a specific distance such as 0.5 mm of the dental model. A dental model points may be, for example, a tooth reference point, a control point (as discussed below), or a pre-identified offset point. There may be multiple offset points for a single dental model point. Offset points are used to generate an edge curve.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">There are a number of ways an offset point may be identified. An embodiment identifies an offset point by translating a dental model point along a surface, where the translated dental model point is identified as the offset point. An embodiment identifies an offset point by translating a dental model point in a direction and then projecting the translated dental model point on to the surface, where the projected, translated dental model point is identified as the offset point.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">To find an offset point, first, a tooth reference point may be translated in the offset direction by the offset distance, with the translation represented by an offset vector. For example, the direction of the offset vector, typically along a long axis, may be directed away from the occlusion and towards the gingiva associated with the tooth. Translated tooth reference point may be inside the gingiva, and needs to be projected back onto the gingival surface. There are several methods to project a dental model point on to the surface, e.g. using a projection direction, or finding the nearest point on the correct surface. Further details are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Finally, the edge curve is fitted through the offset points. In one embodiment, the edge curve is a spline. A spline is a curve that connects particular points; it is defined by a special function that is defined piecewise by other functions. Methods for fitting a spline include but are not limited to: polynomial curve fitting including but not limited to square splines, and/or cubic splines including cubic Hermite splines; and/or trigonometrical splines including but not limited to Fourier series. See Bartels, 1995. The edge curve is outside the interproximal area, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">In an embodiment, the method further comprises a step where the edge curve is projected on to the surface of the dental model, by sampling a number of points along the edge curve and selecting the nearest point on the surface of the dental model. This is discussed below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">There may be other factors in defining the curve, such as additional points, parameters, and post-processing. These are discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">The offset points may be used to define an edge curve for the entire edge of a dental device, or a portion of the edge of a dental device, for example, the lingual side only.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">According to an embodiment, the disclosure further comprises, wherein the at least two teeth comprises a first tooth and a second tooth:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">identifying at least one control point in a region defined by at least three of: a first visible apex corresponding to a first tooth, a second visible apex corresponding to a second tooth, a first offset point corresponding to the first visible apex, and/or a second offset point corresponding to the second visible apex, the at least one control point lying on the gingival surface outside the interproximal area; and<br/>generating the edge curve by connecting the first offset point, the at least one control point, and the second offset point.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">One embodiment defines the edge curve with at least one control point, in addition to the offset points. A control point is an additional point from a region defined by a selection of tooth reference points and/or offset points that helps define the edge curve. There may be multiple control points in the region. Multiple control points are particularly useful where there is a longer distance between tooth reference points, for example, where a tooth is missing or there is a large gap between teeth.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">The region the control point comes from can vary. For example, a region may be a triangular region defined by visible apices from two teeth and an offset point, a rectangular region defined by two visible apices and two offset points, or a polygonal region defined by different points along lines between visible apices and/or offset points. It may also come from any of the boundaries of these, except a boundary between two adjacent visible apices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">One advantage of the at least one control point is that it allows for finer control of the shape of the edge curve. The edge curve can be tailored to better suit the dental device's environment, purpose, or patient, as discussed below. In particular, it allows the dental technician to control the waviness of the edge curve, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">An embodiment further comprises:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000">identifying said at least one control point based on a point between two offset points and/or tooth reference points, wherein said point between is projected onto the surface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">In one embodiment, a point between two points is calculated and projected back onto the surface. The two points may be offset points, tooth reference points, or a combination. The projected point between is identified as a control point. Details of projecting a point onto a surface are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">An embodiment further comprises identifying a visible apex by:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000">identifying at least a part of a margin line of a tooth;<br/>identifying at least one margin line point along on said at least a part of a margin line;<br/>evaluating a measurement of each said at least one margin line point compared to a reference; and<br/>selecting as the visible apex a margin line point with an optimal measurement.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">In one embodiment, a tooth reference point may be a visible apex. A visible apex is an optimum of the margin line of the tooth, e.g. the lowest point or highest point visible for the margin line and/or a portion of the margin line. An optimum can be identified by finding a point with an optimal measurement. The margin line of the tooth is boundary between tooth and gingiva.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0026">A tooth can have more than one visible apex, for example, one on the buccal side, and one on the lingual side. The visible apex for a tooth provides a useful confluence of geometry and anatomy&#x2014;it can be calculated from a three-dimensional scan or model, and as the lowest visible point on the tooth, can help ensure a tooth is fully covered by the dental device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0027">Connecting several visible apices can offer an approximation of the shape of the gingiva below the teeth, an useful marker in finding an edge curve.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0028">The margin line of the tooth can be derived from segmenting a scan. For example, the surface normal of each facet may be evaluated; where there is a sudden change in direction over relatively few facets, there may be a point on the margin line between tooth and gingiva. In another embodiment, the roughness of a local area may be evaluated; relatively smooth areas are labeled as teeth, and rougher areas are labeled gingiva. The margin line is the boundary between these areas, Segmentation techniques using planarity, medial axis, convexity, shape diameter function, and curvature criteria are particularly useful, and are discussed in Shamir 2008.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0029">A margin line point is a point on the margin line. Margin line points may be identified by various methods. In one embodiment, they may be the vertices or points of a three-dimensional scan or model nearest the margin line. In another, they are chosen at regular intervals on the margin line from a scan; fewer margin line points allow for faster computation. In another, the margin line points may be points from a spline approximating the margin line.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0030">Where there is more than one margin line point, the margin line points may be separated into groups, for example, lingual margin line points and buccal margin line points.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0031">A measurement of each margin line point is then evaluated compared to the reference. The measurement is a quantity that allows the comparison of margin line points to the reference, for example, a distance or a dot product.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0032">The reference may generally be a stable feature for comparing measurements. The reference may be from the list comprising: anatomical features including but not limited to cusps, crown centers, occlusal points, pits, and/or grooves; calculated features including but not limited to an axis such as a tooth long axis, points on axes, and/or midpoints such as a mesial-distal midpoints; geometrical features including but not limited to geometric centers, axes, planes, and/or points on axes and/or planes; technical features including but not limited to orthodontic brackets; and/or a surface point derived from one or more of the above.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0033">In one embodiment, the reference is a unit vector of the tooth long axis and the measurement is a dot product of the margin line point and the tooth long axis unit vector. Each margin line point has a set of Euclidean coordinates, e.g. x, y, and z coordinates. The dot product of the tooth long axis unit vector and the Euclidean coordinates of a margin line point is a length of projection of a segment that connects a margin line point and reference frame origin (here, at Euclidean coordinates (0,0,0)) on the tooth long axis unit vector; thus, it corresponds to a distance along the tooth long axis. The margin line point with the minimum dot product is the visible apex.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0034">In one embodiment, the measurement is a Euclidean distance and the reference is the occlusal plane. Where each margin line point has a set of Euclidean coordinates, the distance from the occlusal plane is calculated. The optimal measurement is the maximum distance, and thus, the margin line point with the maximum distance is the visible apex.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">According to an embodiment, a method for identifying a visible apex is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">The method includes</p><p id="p-0042" num="0000">identifying an offset plane; and<br/>identifying at least one visible apex based on the offset plane.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0037">In another embodiment, a visible apex may be determined with an offset plane. First, an offset plane is derived for example, as described above and also discussed later in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. This may be, for example, an occlusal plane based on the occlusal surface of an oral situation, or a mesial-distal plane of a tooth for which a visible apex is determined, as described above.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0038">Next, at least one visible apex is identified based on that offset plane. As described below, this may be done by a number of methods e.g. by placing the offset plane in the gingiva and moving it towards the occlusal surface until it meets the margin line and/or reaches the first tooth point, i.e. transitions from gingiva to tooth, or by placing the offset plane at the occlusal surface and moving it away from the occlusal surface until it finds the last point where it meets the tooth, i.e. transitions from the tooth to gingiva. As the dental model undergoes the step of segmentation prior to this step of identifying the visible apex, dental objects like individual tooth and gingiva are distinctly and separately known.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0039">The moving such as incremental moving of the offset plane may occur along a certain direction such as along the long axis of the tooth, or orthogonally to the offset plane itself, at least until the offset plane makes the transition from gingiva to tooth or vice verca. The transition may be determined by, for example tooth facet, i.e. a facet of the dental model that has been classified as tooth. Where tooth facets are used, the offset plane may intersect more than a single tooth facet. The visible apex may be where it intersects fewer tooth facets than the next incremental step, for a given region.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">The point at which the offset plane meets the margin line or tooth facet is a visible apex. As there are visible apices on both the lingual and the buccal sides of a tooth, the offset plane may be further moved toward the occlusal surface to find the other visible apex. In another embodiment, an offset plate is limited to either the lingual or the buccal side, with a boundary along, e.g. the mesial distal axis, and the visible apex for each side is found with different offset planes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">An embodiment for identifying a visible apex further comprises:</p><p id="p-0048" num="0000">selecting a dental model comprising at least one tooth or a jaw;<br/>placing an offset plane at gingiva proximal to a tooth and beyond the margin line of the tooth/the tooth/the jaw in a direction away from its occlusal surface;<br/>incrementally moving the offset plane toward the occlusal surface until the offset plane intersects a margin line or a tooth facet; and<br/>identifying the visible apex as the intersection of the offset plane and the margin line or the tooth facet.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042">It is preferred that placing an offset plane at gingiva proximal to a tooth include the offset plane intersecting only the gingiva e.g. below the margin line on the lower jaw or above the margin line on the upper jaw.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0043">In another embodiment, a visible apex for a tooth may be determined with an offset plane by placing an offset plane at the occlusal surface, and incrementally bringing it towards gingiva proximal to the tooth until the offset plane leaves the margin line or tooth tissue, i.e. transitions from the tooth to gingiva.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0044">An embodiment for identifying a visible apex further comprises:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000">selecting a dental model comprising a tooth or a jaw;<br/>placing an offset plane for the tooth or the jaw at the occlusal surface;<br/>incrementally moving the offset plane away from the occlusal surface until the offset plane last intersects a tooth facet; and<br/>identifying the visible apex as the last intersection of the offset plane and the tooth.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0045">An embodiment further comprises selecting a dental model comprising a tooth based on tooth segmentation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0046">A dental model that has undergone tooth segmentation may also have a visible apex identified, by one of the methods discussed above. This allows the identification of visible apices for individual tooth in a dental model.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0047">A dental model comprising more than one tooth may undergo tooth segmentation, i.e. segmenting the model into individual teeth. This may further be accompanied by identifying the teeth through a classification algorithm, e.g. PCA or a convolutional neural network. Once a tooth is identified in such a manner, it may be further segmented into buccal and lingual sides, e.g. by generating a plane between the long axis, a mesial point, and a distal point.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0048">In an embodiment, the disclosure further comprises identifying at least one offset point by:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000">displacing a corresponding dental model point based on a offset distance and a offset direction, wherein a corresponding dental model point is an instance of the tooth reference points or the at least one control point.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0049">As discussed above, an offset point is a point with a location based on the location of a corresponding dental model point.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0050">The displacement of an offset point is calculated based on an offset distance and an offset direction. Different methods of displacement are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0051">The offset direction can be chosen in a number of ways, and need not be the same for each offset point. It may be based off an anatomical feature, such as the tooth long axis and/or the occlusal plane. It may be based on some geometrical information, such as planes of the dental model as a whole or centers of particular teeth. It may also be based on a calculation of any of the above, for example, an average of tooth long axes, or a normal of the occlusal plane. One embodiment uses a mathematical model to calculate a plane based on anatomical data, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0052">The offset distance can be identified by a method from the list comprising: user input, calculation by algorithm, and/or standard values. The offset distance for an offset point based on a tooth reference point may typically be more than zero. In one embodiment, the minimum offset distance may be 10<sup>&#x2212;18 </sup>mm, based on the minimum allowable threshold over zero in existing software for a 3D mesh. In another embodiment, the minimum offset distance may be 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>mm, a difference in size detectable by the human mouth (Breen 2019. In another embodiment, the minimum offset distance may be 2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>mm, based on the potential error in precision of a milling machine.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0053">The at least one offset point allows the creation of an edge curve that is based on a patient's anatomy, but can be modified to improve the function of a dental device. For example, generating an edge curve from offset points for a clear aligner allows a dental practitioner to control the fit and coverage of the clear aligner&#x2014;a smaller offset distance means more flexibility, while a bigger offset distance means more coverage. By using offset points, the dental practitioner has more control over the treatment for the patient.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0054">Multiple offset points may have the same offset distance, or different offset distances tailored to the situation. For example, the dental practitioner may want less coverage on the lingual side than the buccal side, and use a smaller offset distance on the lingual side. In another example, a patients' incisors may require more movement and therefore more coverage than the molars, so the incisors' offset distance is also larger than that of the molars.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0055">An embodiment further comprises identifying the offset direction for an instance of the at least one offset point a by:</p><p id="p-0065" num="0000">identifying a set of dental model data;<br/>processing said dental model data using a mathematical model to generate an offset plane; and<br/>determining the offset direction based on the offset plane.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0056">One embodiment identifies the offset direction for a particular offset point using an offset plane generated from a set of dental model data. Various mathematical models can also be used to generate the offset plane, including but not limited to: linear regression, polynomial regression, principle component analysis.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0057">A set of dental model data is a collection of points in, on, and/or within 0.5 mm of the dental model that provide information about the dental model. Different sets of dental model data may provide different information about the tooth, and the dental model data set can be selected to solve the problem at hand. For example, where the dental model data is a collection of mesial and distal points of teeth, the dental model data would provide information about the orientation and location of teeth on a relevant portion of the jaw. Another embodiment may use the visible apices of the teeth as the dental model data, to determine a plane approximating the boundary of visible dentition.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0058">One embodiment generates the offset plane using linear regression. In this embodiment, the offset plane is a flat plane that best fits the dental model data, for example, by minimizing the squared error of each point in the set of dental model data in relation to the plane.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0059">Another embodiment generates the offset plane using polynomial regression. In particular situations, it is useful to have a curved plane rather than a flat plane. For example, while the occlusal plane is traditionally depicted as a flat plane, the jaw itself is curved, and a curved surface can provide a closer-fitting approximation of where the teeth occlude. Polynomial regression allows the offset plane to be a curve fitted to the dental data.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0060">Another embodiment generates the offset plane using principle component analysis to generate a plane. A principle component analysis takes a data set, such as the set of dental model data, and finds the directions in which it has the greatest variation, the principle components. The first principle component is the direction that contains the most variation, and therefore the most information about the system, the second the second most, and so on. Two principle components can be used to generated a plane. A useful plane can be generated from the top two principle components of the dental model data.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0061">Once the offset plane is identified, it can be used to guide the offset direction. In one embodiment, a vector orthogonal to the offset plane can be used as the offset direction. This is useful, because it can be applied to any dental model point, no matter its location. The offset direction is therefore indirectly based off anatomical information. Further, the same offset direction can be used for an entire set of data, allowing the data to move in unison.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0062">In short, the offset plane can provide useful information about the anatomy of the dentition, in a manner suitable for efficient computation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0063">In an embodiment, the disclosure further comprises a method of displacement to identify the at least one offset point by:</p><p id="p-0074" num="0000">translating a corresponding dental model point along the surface of the dental model in the offset direction by the offset distance.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0064">In one embodiment, the offset point is displaced by translating the corresponding dental model point directly on the surface of the gingiva. An offset direction is chosen. If the offset direction is not parallel to the surface, its dimensionality may be reduced such that it can travel along the surface. The corresponding dental model point is translated by the offset distance. In one embodiment, the offset distance is measured by the length of each path along the facets of the mesh of the three-dimensional scan or model.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0065">An embodiment further comprises identifying at least one offset point by:</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000">translating said corresponding dental model point in the offset direction by the offset distance; and<br/>projecting translated said corresponding dental model point onto the surface.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0066">In one embodiment, at least one offset point is generated by translating the corresponding dental model point in the offset direction by the offset distance, then projecting the translated corresponding dental model point back on to the surface.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0067">The translated corresponding dental model point may be translated into the gingiva or tooth, or into empty space around the dental model. Thus, it needs to be projected back on to the surface of the dental model. Methods of projecting onto the surface are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0068">Methods to determine the offset distance are discussed above; methods to determine the offset direction are discussed above and below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0069">An embodiment further comprises projecting a dental model point onto a surface of the dental model by:</p><p id="p-0082" num="0000">identifying a tooth corresponding to the dental model point, wherein the at least two teeth comprises the tooth and wherein the dental model point is a point in, on, and/or within 0.5 mm the dental model;<br/>identifying a projection plane for the tooth corresponding to the dental model point; and<br/>translating the dental model point in a projection direction based on the projection plane such that the dental model point is on the surface of the dental model, wherein the projection direction is calculated based on the projection plane.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0070">At times, translating in the offset direction may result in the corresponding dental model point being located somewhere unsuitable for generating an edge for the dental device, such as the inside the gingiva of the dental model. In order to generate an edge curve, the translated point may need to be projected to the surface of the dental model.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0071">In one embodiment, a dental model point is projected onto the surface of a dental model based on an projection plane. The dental model point is defined above.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0072">The projection direction is the direction in which the dental model point is translated to get it to a surface of the dental model plane. The projection plane is a plane used to calculate the projection direction.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0073">In one embodiment, the projection plane is defined by a mesial point, a distal point, and the tooth long axis, as discussed below. This projection plane splits the tooth into lingual and buccal sides. A normal vector of either of these planes can be used as the projection direction, to move the corresponding dental model point to the surface of the dental model. Other vectors based on the projection plane may also be used, for example, vectors set at 30 degrees from the projection plane.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0074">In another embodiment, the projection plane is generated from a dental arch, the offset plane, and the mesial-distal midpoint of a tooth. The dental arch is generated by fitting a third-order curve to the mesial-distal midpoints of the teeth of a jaw, by a method such as least squares regression. This results in a smooth curve that approximates the arch of the jaw, but may not pass directly through every mesial-distal midpoint. The offset plane is generated as discussed above. Then, for a given tooth, a projection direction is set to be parallel to the offset plane, and perpendicular to the dental arch at the point where the dental arch is nearest the tooth's mesial-distal midpoint. This projection direction is pointed towards the buccal surface; the projection direction opposite is to the lingual surface.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0075">In one embodiment, the projection plane is a plane calculated from a dental model data set of mesial and distal points, and the projection direction is a normal of this plane. For a given tooth, a midpoint between a mesial point and a distal point can be projected onto the surface of the dental model, and used as a terminal tooth point, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0076">An embodiment further comprises projecting a dental model point onto a surface of the dental model by:</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000">identifying an area of interest on the surface of the dental model; and<br/>identifying within the area of interest a point closest to said dental model point.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0077">As discussed above, it may be necessary to project a dental model point onto the surface of the dental model. In one embodiment, the dental model point is projected onto the surface by identifying an area of interest on the surface, then identifying the point on said surface nearest the translated point.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0078">An area of interest is an area on the surface of the dental model . . . . In one embodiment, the area of interest is the entire surface of the dental model; thus, the closest point would be the absolute closest point. In another embodiment, however, the area of interest may be the lingual side or the buccal side of the dental model data, ensuring that the dental model point is projected onto the desired surface. In another embodiment, the area of interested is bounded by two neighboring visible apices and two neighboring offset points; in this embodiment, identifying a smaller area of interest reduces the computational processing needed to find the surface point.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0079">In some embodiments, the dental model is a digital three-dimensional data object expressed as a three-dimensional mesh or a point cloud. Each vertex of the three-dimensional mesh and point of the point cloud has Euclidean coordinates. These Euclidean coordinates can be used to calculate a distance from the dental model point.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0080">In an embodiment, the minimum distance is calculated by comparing each vertex on the mesh to the dental model point and use the vertex with the minimum distance. There are a number of methods to make this search more efficient (Ericson 2004, particularly chapters 6-8).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0081">An embodiment further comprises validating the dental model point projected to the surface by:</p><p id="p-0096" num="0000">identifying a surface normal of a facet containing the dental model point projected to the surface; and<br/>comparing a value of the surface normal to an expected range of values for surface normals.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0082">When a dental model point is projected to the surface, it may be helpful to check that it is usable.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0083">The dental model may be a digital scan of a physical object, such as a dental cast. Dental casts may be flawed representations of the actual teeth and gingiva of the patient, for example, when bubbles are caught between the cast and the mold. Removing these flaws can improve the quality of an edge curve.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0084">One embodiment further comprises a validation step, where the surface normal of the surface-projected dental model point is compared to a range of expected values. The surface normal may be the normal for a nearby facet of the mesh of the dental model, or an average of normal for nearby facets. The expected range of values may be based on an anatomical feature such as the tooth long axis, and/or the projection plane or the offset plane. In an embodiment finding an offset point based on a translated tooth reference point, the expected range of values less than a predetermined value such as 89&#xb0; difference from a vector perpendicular to a projection plane based on the corresponding tooth's mesial point, distal point, and tooth long axis.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0085">The surface normal may be expected to be normal to a projection plane based on a mesial point, a distal point, and a tooth long axis. The surface normal may also be expected to be parallel to an offset plane based on mesial and distal points of a jaw. Where the surface normal is outside the expected range of values, the surface point is typically discarded as invalid, and the next surface point in the offset direction is be tried instead, until a valid surface point is found</p><p id="p-0101" num="0086">An embodiment further comprises controlling the waviness of the edge curve by: setting a first offset distance, wherein the first offset distance is an offset distance or set of offset distances corresponding to at least two offset points based on tooth reference points; and</p><p id="p-0102" num="0000">setting a second offset distance, wherein the second offset distance is an offset distance or set of offset distances corresponding to at least one offset point based on at least one control point.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0087">In one embodiment, setting a first offset distance and a second offset distance controls the waviness of the edge curve. Waviness is the degree to which the edge curve curves in alternating directions. The first offset distance corresponds to at least two tooth reference points. The second offset distance corresponds to at least one control point.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0088">In an embodiment where a control point is based on a point between offset points, setting the second offset distance to zero generates a straight edge curve when viewed from a direction parallel to the offset plane; In other directions, the edge curve may still look wavy, for example, due to the texture of the dental model's surface.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0089">Where the second offset distance is not zero, the edge curve will be wavy when viewed from a direction parallel to the offset plane, and the magnitude of the second offset distance corresponds to the amplitude of the waves. In an embodiment where the edge curve is used on a clear aligner, a typical range for the second offset distance is 0.5 mm to 4 mm, where 0.5 mm generates a slightly wavy edge curve, and 4 mm generates a very wavy edge curve.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0090">Conversely, in an embodiment where the control point is a point between visible apices, setting the second offset distance to zero results in a very wavy line. Setting the second offset distance to a first offset distance results in a straight line when viewed from a direction parallel to the offset plane. The second offset distance still controls the waviness of the line.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0091">Controlling waviness is useful for adjusting the edge curve to its environment. For example, on the lingual side of a clear aligner, the edge curve may be smoother, as the surface is smoother there and it improves the comfort of the wearer by facilitating a smoother edge next to the tongue. On the buccal side however, the surface is bumpier and adding waves provides a better grip on the surface.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0092">An embodiment further comprises:</p><p id="p-0109" num="0000">setting a bounding box enclosing an interproximal area between two adjacent teeth; and<br/>comparing the offset points to the bounding box to prevent said edge curve from crossing into the interproximal area.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0093">One embodiment further comprises using a bounding box to prevent the edge curve from entering the interproximal area. A bounding box is a three-dimensional area roughly shaped like a box, used to set a boundary.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0094">In one embodiment, a bounding box is generated based on two adjacent teeth from the dental model, a first tooth and a second tooth. The base of the bounding box is the quadrilateral defined by the first tooth's buccal visible apex, the first tooth's lingual visible apex, the second tooth's buccal visible apex, and the second tooth's lingual visible apex. The top of the bounding box is the base translated away from the gingiva, in a direction normal to the offset plane and towards the occlusal surface, by a set distance, for example, 10 to 15 mm. The sides of the bounding box are defined by connecting the top and the bottom.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0095">Each offset point is then validated by a comparison to the bounding box. If the offset point is found to be inside the bounding box, a point outside the bounding box is in place of the original offset point. Thus, the edge curve is kept outside the interproximal area.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0096">In an embodiment, validation may rely on the identification of visible apices. The identification of visible apices may be based on the segmentation step, which results in separating individual tooth from one another and gingiva and occurs prior to designing the staged virtual models.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0097">An embodiment further comprises fitting the edge curve to a terminal tooth by:</p><p id="p-0115" num="0000">identifying at least one terminal tooth point for the terminal tooth; and<br/>fitting said edge curve through the at least one terminal tooth point.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0098">One embodiment fits the edge curve to a terminal tooth by finding at least one terminal tooth point to fit the edge curve through.

Where the edge curve fits partially over an end tooth, it may cross the margin line at the visible apex or further in a distal direction, i.e. towards the distal point of the end tooth. Where the terminal tooth is not an end tooth such as a tooth penultimate to the end tooth, the visible apex of the tooth may be included in calculating the spline on the relevant side, ensuring that the edge curve passes validation later. In such case, the edge curve is prevented from passing through the interproximal area for example the edge curve passing through the visible apex and over the terminal tooth.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0100">Where the edge curve is partially over the terminal tooth, the edge curve may be controlled with the assistance of a terminal tooth point. A terminal tooth point is a point on the terminal tooth.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0101">In the absence of at least one terminal tooth point, the edge curve will be fitted to the nearest offset points. However, terminal tooth points can help provide a more precise fit over the terminal tooth, allowing a dental technician to choose where the edge curve is located on the terminal tooth/teeth.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0102">In one embodiment, a terminal tooth point can be based on a mesial-distal midpoint.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0103">A midpoint between a mesial point and a distal point is calculated, then projected onto the occlusal surface of the tooth, by one of the methods discussed above.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0104">In one embodiment, at least one terminal tooth point is calculated by translating at least one margin line point upward onto the terminal tooth.

Below, some useful methods are listed.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0106">One embodiment further comprises setting a minimum curve radius for the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0107">A curve radius is the radius of the circular arc which best approximates the curve at that point. Many dental devices are milled, and a milling device may not be able to cut a curve that is too sharp.

Where the Euclidean distance is below a minimum distance, a new offset point is calculated for each of the offset point below a minimum distance, by one of the methods discussed above. Each new offset point's offset distance is half of the difference between the Euclidean distance and the minimum threshold, and the new offset point's offset direction is outwards from the line between the pair of points. The edge curve is then fit according to the new offset points, ensuring a minimum width.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0114">One embodiment further comprises manual adjustment of the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0115">In one embodiment, a technician may be dissatisfied with the automatically generated edge curve, and choose to adjust the offset points, tooth terminal points, and or the curve itself manually.

This allows a fast and familiar way for users to modify the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0126">A new line drawn by the user may be input, for example, using a drawing tool such as a mouse, touch pad, or stylus. The first point and the second point here may be derived from the end points of the user's line, or the intersection of the user's line and the original edge curve. Where the line drawn by the user does not intersect with the original edge curve, the nearest point on the original edge curve may be used as the first or the second point.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0127">This embodiment may further comprise post/processing to clean up the user's drawing, including but not limited to detection and removal and extraneous parts of the line, and/or smoothing of curves.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0128">A method of any one or more of the preceding claims, further comprising generating a modified curve section by:</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000">identifying at least one primary curve point on the original curve section;<br/>moving the at least one primary curve point; and<br/>generating the modified curve section based on the moved at least one primary curve point.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0129">In an embodiment, the user input for a modified curve section may be based on moving a point on the curve, and the modified curve section may be based on the movement of that point.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0130">First, a primary curve point is found. This is a point on a curve and may be, for example, a control point, a tooth reference point, a point based on the prior points, or any other point on the curve. Next, the primary curve point is moved. This may be done, for example, with user input, and/or by a pre-determined distance and direction. User-input may come from, for example, a user moving the primary curve point itself, or by finding a user-input point, as described below.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0131">A modified curve section may be calculated based on the moved primary curve point. This may be done in a similar manner to fitting the edge curve above, e.g. by fitting a spline through the moved points and the first and the second points.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0132">A method of any one or more of the preceding claims further comprising:</p><p id="p-0153" num="0000">obtaining a user-input point; and<br/>selecting as the primary curve point a curve point of the original curve section closest to the user-input point.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0133">In some embodiments, user input may be based on a user-input point, such as a point that a user selects near the curve. In an embodiment, a user selects a user-input point, such as a nearby pixel on a screen, and the primary curve point is the point nearest the user input point, e.g. with the shortest Euclidean distance between the points. This allows the user to move the curve without precisely selecting a point on the curve, and may be particularly useful where the input device is a computer mouse, and a user can click a point near the curve without worrying over much about the accuracy of their click.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0134">An embodiment further comprises:</p><p id="p-0156" num="0000">generating a modified curve section; and<br/>displaying the modified curve section.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0135">In an embodiment, the modified curve section is displayed, e.g. on a screen or another device. Such display on the screen may be provided as a preview of the possible change in the edge curve. This allows a user to see what a change to an curve would be like before actually changing it. This further permits the user to make changes that still comply with the validation procedures as described above.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0136">An embodiment further comprises displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section simultaneously. This allows an immediate visual comparison of the original curve and the modified curve. The display may be made by showing only the curve sections or curve sections along with rest of the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0137">An embodiment further comprises displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section over a related 3D model.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0138">An embodiment further comprises displaying both the original curve section and the modified curve section over a related 3D model, e.g. a digital dental model representing oral condition of the patient. This allows modifications to be made with the context in mind; for example, in a dental situation, this allows the modifications to consider the anatomy and other condition e.g. gingival health of the patient.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0139">An embodiment further comprises displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section with different transparencies. Displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section at different transparencies allows the user to more easily distinguish them. For example, the modified curve may be presented to be more transparent to emphasize its temporary character. The user may be provided with User Interface controls such as a slider to control (increase or decrease) the transparency of the curve sections. The slider may include individual sliders corresponding to each curve section or a single slider that controls transparency ratio between the two curves or controls transparency of one curve and transparency of other curve is adjusted by applying a predefined ratio to the transparency selected based on controlling the slider.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0140">An embodiment further comprises displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section in different colors.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0141">Displaying the modified curve section and the original curve section at different colors allows the user to more easily distinguish them. For example, the original curve section may be displayed as the same color as the original curve, while the modified curve section may be displayed in a different color to emphasize that it is a potential change.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0142">An embodiment further comprises iteratively updating the display by:</p><p id="p-0165" num="0000">moving the at least one primary curve point;<br/>calculating a modified curve section based on the moved at least one primary curve point; and<br/>displaying the modified curve section.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0143">The modified curve section may be calculated and displayed dynamically, such that a user can see a number of potential changes, and adjust the primary curve point accordingly. This allows the user to quickly adjust the curve to meet their needs. This is accomplished by updated the modified curve section each time to user moves the at least one primary curve point.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0144">An embodiment further comprises:</p><p id="p-0168" num="0000">retaining a previous curve section; and<br/>reverting to the previous curve section by replacing the modified curve section with the previous curve section, the previous curve section comprising the original curve section of the edge curve or a modified curve section prior to the replaced modified curve section.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0145">By retaining the previous curve section, a user may be able to quickly undo an unwanted change, e.g. by clicking &#x201c;undo&#x201d;, and/or &#x201c;Ctrl+z&#x201d; on a keyboard. Multiple previous curve sections may be retained, allowing the user to revert back to previous versions of the curve.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0146">An embodiment further comprises identifying a visible apex from a limited part of an oral situation, tooth, gingiva and/or margin line.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0147">In an embodiment, a visible apex may be selected from a limited part of an oral situation, tooth, gingiva, and/or margin line. The limited part may be confined to the center of the lingual or buccal side of the tooth. This may allow better control over the edge curve by increasing the likelihood that the visible apices occur at more regular intervals, and may also increase the likelihood that the visible apices and their corresponding control points better reflect the anatomy of the patient.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0148">This may also make manufacturing easier, by reducing the likelihood of parts of the curve that are too difficult to cut. For example, if a visible apex were previously to be found too close to or on the mesial side of a tooth, combined with an offset point and/or the visible apex of a neighboring tooth, it may have made a sharp turn that may have been both difficult to manufacture and increased patient discomfort. The limited part may prevent such a situation from occurring.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0149">An embodiment further comprises identifying the limited part by:</p><p id="p-0174" num="0000">identifying a mesial-distal axis;<br/>identifying a tooth long axis for the tooth;<br/>identifying a lingual-buccal axis based on an orthogonal of the tooth long axis and the mesial distal axis; and<br/>identifying the limited part by generating at least one limitation of an oral situation, tooth, gingiva, and/or margin line based on the lingual-buccal axis.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0150">An embodiment identifies a limited part based on a lingual-buccal axis, which may be used to help generate boundaries to define the limited part.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0151">First, a mesial-distal axis is identified based on a mesial point and a distal point. The mesial-distal axis may be an axis passing through both a mesial point and a distal point. A tooth long axis is also identified, the tooth axis is typically perpendicular to the mesial distal axis and usually runs along the height of the tooth crown.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0152">Next, a lingual-buccal axis is identified. The lingual-buccal axis may be an orthogonal of the mesial-distal axis and the tooth long axis, and may be found, for example, by calculating their cross-product.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0153">Next, a limitation may be generated based on the lingual-buccal axis. A limitation may be used to help bound of define a limited part, as discussed in further detail below. This limitation may apply to the oral situation, the tooth, the gingiva, and/or the margin line.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0154">An embodiment further comprises defining a limited part by:</p><p id="p-0180" num="0000">generating a first limitation plane based on a first rotated lingual-buccal axis along the tooth long axis;<br/>generating a second limitation plane based on a second rotated lingual-buccal axis along the tooth long axis;<br/>defining the limited part based on a length, area, and/or volume between the first and the second limitation planes.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0155">In an embodiment, the limited part is defined based on rotating the tooth long axis.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0156">First, a first rotated lingual-buccal axis is generated, for example, by rotating the lingual-buccal axis between a selected range between 1 and 90 degrees clockwise around the tooth long axis. This is then translated along the tooth long axis, generating a first limitation plane.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0157">Next, a first rotated lingual-buccal axis is generated, for example, by rotating the lingual-buccal axis between a selected range between 1 and 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the tooth long axis. This is then translated along the tooth long axis, generating a second limitation plane.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0158">The first and second limitation planes may then be used to define the limited part, which may be a length, area, and/volume. The dimensionality of the limited part may depend on the dimensionality of the underlying model. For example, for the margin line, the limited part may be the length of margin line between the first limitation plane and the second limitation plane. For the surface of the oral situation, the limited part may be the area between the first limitation plane and the second limitation plane. For the 3D model, the limited part may be the volume between the limitation planes.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0159">An embodiment further comprises defining a limited part by:</p><p id="p-0186" num="0000">generating a first limitation plane based on a first translated lingual-buccal axis and parallel to a tooth long axis;<br/>generating a second limitation plane based on a second translated lingual-buccal axis and parallel to a tooth long axis; and<br/>defining the limited part based on a length, area, and/or volume between the first and the second limitation planes.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0160">First, a first translated lingual-buccal axis is generated, for example, by translating an axis parallel to the lingual-buccal axis by a fixed distance (e.g. 0.01 mm to 3 mm) or a relative distance (e.g. 50% of the distance between the tooth long axis and a mesial point) in the direction of the mesial point. The first translated axis may then be used to generate a first limitation plane, for example, a plane parallel to the plane intersecting the lingual-buccal axis and the tooth long axis and passing through the first translated axis.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0161">Next, a second translated lingual-buccal axis is generated, for example, by translating an axis parallel to the lingual-buccal axis by a fixed distance (e.g. 0.01 mm to 3 mm) or a relative distance (e.g. 50% of the distance between the tooth long axis and a distal point) in the direction of the distal point. The second translated axis may then be used to generate a second limitation plane, for example, a plane parallel to the plane intersecting the lingual-buccal axis and the tooth long axis and passing through the second translated axis.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0162">The first and second limitation planes may then be used to define the limited part, which may be a length, area, and/volume. The dimensionality of the limited part may depend on the dimensionality of the underlying model. For example, for the margin line, the limited part may be the length of margin line between the first limitation plane and the second limitation plane. For the surface of the oral situation, the limited part may be the area between the first limitation plane and the second limitation plane. For the 3D model, the limited part may be the volume between the limitation planes.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0163">An embodiment further comprises identifying a visible apex from a limited part based on a bounding box.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0164">A limited part may also be generated based on a bounding box, for example, generating a bounding box based on a rectangular prism or cylinder centered around the intersection of the mesial-distal axis, the tooth long axis, and the lingual-buccal axis.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0165">One embodiment further comprises generating a digital data format suitable for manufacturing a physical object based on said edge curve.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0166">After an edge curve has been generated, it may need to be converted to a digital format that allows a physical object to be manufactured, for example, by cutting an existing physical object or by defining the edge of a three-dimensional printed object. In one embodiment, random points along the edge curve are sampled, and the Euclidean coordinates are calculated based on the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0167">The edge curve is usually a spline. As a spline is a collection of functions, it may often be stored as a matrix. A given point on the spline may be calculated, rather than stored as a point in three-dimensional space. To put the edge curve in a digital format suitable for cutting, the edge curve is sampled at intervals. Intervals of 0.1 mm to 1 mm, preferably 0.3 mm, are used, providing sufficient guidance for a milling machine or printer while allowing for calculations in a reasonable time. For each sample, the nearest point on the surface of the dental model is found. The nearest points are then stored as a polyline, a collection of points connecting into a line, and this is used to guide the cutting or printing of the dental device.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0168">One embodiment further comprises wherein said dental device be generated with the edge curve, wherein said dental device may be from a list comprising: an aligner, a mouthguard, a splint, an indirect bonding tray, and/or any portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0169">In one embodiment, a generated edge curve is used to generate a dental device, for example, a 3D-printed device such as an indirect bonding tray or a printed aligner. The edge curve is projected from the dental model to a related dental device. In an embodiment with a printed aligner, an edge of the aligner being designed may be based on the edge curve, whether using the edge curve directly, or further processing it to meet technical criteria for 3D printing, such as minimum thicknesses or avoiding steep overhangs.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0170">According to an embodiment, a data processing system is disclosed.

The system <b>100</b> comprises a computer device <b>102</b> comprising a computer readable medium <b>104</b> and a microprocessor <b>103</b>. The system further comprises a visual display unit <b>107</b>, an input unit such as a computer keyboard <b>105</b> and a computer mouse <b>106</b> for entering data and activating virtual buttons visualized on the visual display unit <b>107</b>. The visual display unit <b>107</b> may for example be a computer screen.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0206">The computer device <b>102</b> is capable of obtaining generated three-dimensional dental models from a digital modelling device <b>101</b><i>b</i>, that may be used as dental models.

The received or formed digital 3D representation can be stored in the computer readable medium <b>104</b> and provided to the microprocessor <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0208">The system <b>100</b> is configured to allow an operator to design an edge curve for a dental device using information obtained from a scan. This can be realized, for example, by displaying a dental model on the visual display unit <b>107</b>, and the operator can then visualize his/her edge curve design on the visual display unit.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0209">The system comprises a unit <b>108</b> for transmitting the edge curve in a digital data format suitable for manufacture to a fabrication machine for generating a dental device to e.g. a computer aided manufacturing (CAM) device <b>109</b> or to another computer system e.g. located at a milling or printing center where the customized dental restorations are manufactured.

As discussed above, the dental model may be a three-dimensional scan or a digital model, although it is not limited to these embodiments. A three-dimensional scan may be made from an cast of a patient's teeth, or directly from the patient. A digital model may originate from a scan, but has been modified in some way, for example, the teeth have been moved to be the next step in an orthodontic treatment plan, or brackets have been added to simulate a tray for indirect bonding.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0214">Step <b>202</b> segments the teeth and gingiva. Some discussion of mesh segmentation may be found in Shamir, 2008. Tooth segmentation divides the scan into tooth and gingiva, as well as separating individual teeth.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0215">Step <b>203</b> identifies tooth reference points, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0216">Step <b>204</b> identifies at least one control point, as discussed above. An edge curve can be generated from offset points from tooth reference points alone. However, identifying control points allows for more control over the edge curve, for example, in controlling the waviness of the edge curve.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0217">Step <b>205</b> identifies offset points, based on the tooth reference points and any control points, if there are control points. Identifying offset points means displacing the tooth reference points and/or control points by an offset distance in an offset direction. This may be done by one of the methods discussed above. By controlling the offset distance for different groups of offset points, the edge curve may be tailored to the specific situation, as discussed below and above.
