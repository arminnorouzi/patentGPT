The weight may either be entered manually with an external scale or be sent automatically when the scale is connected to the automated system. The dimensions of the parcel can be determined manually or automatically by a sender with a sizing device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Small scale merchants, such as merchants that have less than 25 employees also need an efficient and easy way to weigh items and packages for shipping to consumers. Often small scale merchants manually weigh packages and manually enter them into a computer terminal to estimate shipping costs. From this, there is a need and desire by small scale merchants to have a way to more efficiently weigh the packages and have the weights digitized and saved in one or more databases for easy access, and by a way that is convenient and cost effective. Therefore, there is a need for a device that uses currently available weighing technology, in an easy and cost effective manner to streamline the package weighing process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,541 describes a method and apparatus for measuring the three dimensions of a parcel. The parcel is placed in the corner of a field of measurement upon a flat surface and against two adjacent walls. At the base of each wall, and along the angle where the adjacent walls meet, is a calibrated reflective strip. The calibration marks on each of the reflective strips are of known size and spacing. Two mobile sensors are activated for reading the number of visible calibrated marks and transmitting this data to a processor which calculates the length, width, and height of the parcel by subtracting the observed visible calibration marks from the number of possible calibration marks. The three dimensions (length, width, height) and eventually the weight can then be displayed and/or transmitted to a parcel processing system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,861 is directed to a method and apparatus for measuring the dimensions and determining the three-dimensional, spatial volume of objects. An object detection system is used to detect proper placement of an object to be measured, and waveguides are employed as standoffs and received wave isolators for reflected-wave sensors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This background information is provided to reveal information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present invention.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Those of ordinary skill in the art realize that the following descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention are illustrative and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Other embodiments of the present invention will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this detailed description of the present invention, a person skilled in the art should note that directional terms, such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; and other like terms are used for the convenience of the reader in reference to the drawings. Also, a person skilled in the art should notice this description may contain other terminology to convey position, orientation, and direction without departing from the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, in this detailed description, a person skilled in the art should note that quantitative qualifying terms such as &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;mostly,&#x201d; and other terms are used, in general, to mean that the referred to object, characteristic, or quality constitutes a majority of the subject of the reference. The meaning of any of these terms is dependent upon the context within which it is used, and the meaning may be expressly modified.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present system and method may use wireless communications. Generally, depending on the type of wireless communication system, a wireless communication device or mobile device, such as a smartphone, cellular telephone, two-way radio, personal digital assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), laptop computer, home entertainment equipment, etc., communicates directly or indirectly with other wireless communication devices. For direct communications (also known as point-to-point communications), the participating wireless communication devices tune their receivers and transmitters to the same channel or channels (e.g., one of the plurality of radio frequency (RF) carriers of the wireless communication system) and communicate over that channel or channels. For indirect wireless communications, each wireless communication device communicates directly with an associated base station (e.g., for cellular services) and/or an associated access point (e.g., for an in-home or in-building wireless network) via an assigned channel. To complete a communication connection between the wireless communication devices, the associated base stations and/or associated access points communicate with each other directly, via a system controller, via the public switch telephone network, via the Internet, and/or via some other wide area network.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Mobile devices can be portable handsets, smartphones, or personal digital assistants, although they may be implemented in other forms. For example, mobile devices can be tablet computers, such as iPads, or other computing devices configured for communication through a mobile wireless communication network and/or other types of wireless communication links. Program applications, including the present warehouse management and shipping application, can be configured to execute on many different types of mobile devices. For example, a mobile device application can be written to execute on a Windows Mobile based mobile device, Android, iPhone, Java Mobile, or Blackberry based mobile device, for example.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An embodiment of the invention, as shown and described by the various figures and accompanying text, provides a dimensioning device for use with computer-implemented package and shipping management processes or warehouse management capabilities. The device and method are for ascertaining four-dimensional measurements of cuboidal and boxed items to provide data to computerized package management processes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">This approach addresses a key problem of how to get dimensions for a shipping order loaded into the system without requiring a user to input the data manually. As discussed above, typically a package is measured in three dimensions, width, length, and height and may also be measured by the weight. With a command (e.g. activation from an application running on a handheld or mounted device) these four values may be measured and read into the system (and web application) for use in preparing a package to be shipped.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similar to how network printers may be configured for use in an application, there is an option to configure this network dimensioning device to read these dimension values. The dimensioning device may have a wired or wireless communication connection with the computer and/or network running the package and shipping management software, e.g. the device may be Wi-Fi enabled.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an example embodiment of the present invention will be described. A package dimensioning device <b>10</b> is configured for ascertaining measurements of cuboidal and boxed items (e.g., package <b>12</b>) to provide data to computer-implemented package management processes, e.g., order processing, marketplace listings, shipping processing and/or Warehouse Management Systems. While the description herein discusses the use of the device <b>10</b> in the context of shipping, it can also be used to gather information about a package for the purpose of listing it for sale on marketplaces, e.g., Amazon.

Typically, the charges by the carriers to their customers are based on the so-called &#x201c;dim-weight factor&#x201d; or &#x201c;dimensional weight factor&#x201d; (DWF) of the article being shipped. The DWF is an industry dimension calculated as the length times width times height in inches divided by a standard agency or association-recognized divisor or conversion factor, commonly 166 (L&#xd7;W&#xd7;H+&#xf7;166). The &#x201c;166&#x201d; divisor or conversion factor has been recognized and adopted by the International Air Transport Association (I.A.T.A). Even if an object or package is of irregular configuration, the dim weight, using the longest measurement each of length, width, and height, may still be utilized for billing purposes. The volume computed by multiplication of object length times width times height may hereinafter be termed the &#x201c;cubic volume,&#x201d; &#x201c;spatial volume,&#x201d; or simply the &#x201c;cube&#x201d; of the object.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the scale defined at the base <b>12</b> of the device <b>10</b> measures the weight while the multiple sensors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> provide data signals that are used in geometrical calculations internally by the dimensioning device or by the system to provide the length, width and height measurements of the package or box.

Optical and laser sensors may be used in the embodiments, e.g., Laser Displacement, Inductive Displacement and Collimated Beam Sensors that provide high-speed and accurate measurements. The measurements may be carried out by optical sensors, using different kinds of light and thus may be contactless and maintenance free. The measurement technology may be based on laser, LED or structured light technology e.g., based on camera vision sensors.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Ultrasound technology is extremely safe, emitting no radiation (such as visible, ultraviolet, or infrared light), no audible sound, no odor, and no heat. Further, ultrasound, as used in the present invention, will not damage a package or its contents during the measurement operation. Finally, the ultrasonic sensors utilized in the present invention have no moving parts and may also be maintenance free.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Ultrasonic transducers and ultrasonic sensors are devices that generate or sense ultrasound energy. They can be divided into three broad categories: transmitters, receivers and transceivers. Transmitters convert electrical signals into ultrasound, receivers convert ultrasound into electrical signals, and transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a similar way to radar and sonar, ultrasonic transducers are used in systems which evaluate targets by interpreting the reflected signals. For example, by measuring the time between sending a signal and receiving an echo the distance of an object can be calculated. Passive ultrasonic sensors may, for example, be provided by microphones that detect ultrasonic noise that is present under certain conditions. The design of transducer can vary greatly depending on its use.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ultrasound can also be used to make point-to-point distance measurements by transmitting and receiving discrete bursts of ultrasound between transducers. This technique is known as Sonomicrometry where the transit-time of the ultrasound signal is measured electronically (i.e. digitally) and converted mathematically to the distance between transducers assuming the speed of sound of the medium between the transducers is known. This method can be very precise in terms of temporal and spatial resolution because the time-of-flight measurement can be derived from tracking the same incident (received) waveform either by reference level or zero crossing. This enables the measurement resolution to far exceed the wavelength of the sound frequency generated by the transducers.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention contemplates that the dimensioning device can be selected to operate in both metric and imperial units of measure for use in the USA or any other country.

Circuitry (e.g., processing circuitry) is a collection of circuits implemented in tangible entities of the machine <b>900</b> that include hardware (e.g., simple circuits, gates, logic, etc.). Circuitry membership may be flexible over time. Circuitries include members that may, alone or in combination, perform specified operations when operating. In an example, hardware of the circuitry may be immutably designed to carry out a specific operation (e.g., hardwired). In an example, the hardware of the circuitry may include variably connected physical components (e.g., execution units, transistors, simple circuits, etc.) including a machine readable medium physically modified (e.g., magnetically, electrically, moveable placement of invariant massed particles, etc.) to encode instructions of the specific operation. In connecting the physical components, the underlying electrical properties of a hardware constituent are changed, for example, from an insulator to a conductor or vice versa. The instructions enable embedded hardware (e.g., the execution units or a loading mechanism) to create members of the circuitry in hardware via the variable connections to carry out portions of the specific operation when in operation. Accordingly, in an example, the machine-readable medium elements are part of the circuitry or are communicatively coupled to the other components of the circuitry when the device is operating. In an example, any of the physical components may be used in more than one member of more than one circuitry. For example, under operation, execution units may be used in a first circuit of a first circuitry at one point in time and reused by a second circuit in the first circuitry, or by a third circuit in a second circuitry at a different time.
