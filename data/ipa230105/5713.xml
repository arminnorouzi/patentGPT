That is, the overall shape of the gas nozzle has a pair of end faces formed in the shape of a circle, ellipse, or polygon, and a side portion having a predetermined length in an approximately vertical direction with formed between said pair of end faces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gas nozzle has a plurality of through-holes along the axis of the columnar body where gases such as etching gas, for example, pass through. The material of the gas nozzle is typically sintered yttria or sintered alumina, which has excellent corrosion resistance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the technical problems of gas nozzles made of sintered ceramics is the generation of particles from the gas nozzles, and several measures have been taken to reduce this problem. As one of the solutions, a technology focusing on the surface condition of the inner wall of the gas nozzle is disclosed in PTL 1.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The gas nozzle disclosed in PTL 1 is described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a schematic diagram of the gas nozzle, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an I-I cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gas nozzle <b>10</b> shown in PTL 1, similar to a typical gas nozzle, is composed of a columnar body made of sintered ceramic having through-holes <b>13</b> through which gas flows, and outflow ports <b>14</b> for the gas at the through-holes <b>13</b> are formed on one end face <b>11</b> of the main body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an inside wall <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>13</b> in the gas nozzle <b>10</b> has two regions: a first region A located in the vicinity of the outflow port <b>14</b> and a second region B located in an inner portion of the main body, compared to region A.

For this reason, when the fired surface is exposed to the plasma-converted gas, particles are unlikely to fall off. Therefore, since the first region is located in the vicinity of the outlet, it is possible to satisfactorily reduce generation of particles in the first region that is likely to be exposed to the plasma-converted gas.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, PTL 1 shows that when the average crystal grain size in the vicinity of the outlet <b>14</b> of the gas nozzle <b>10</b> is large, the generation of particles can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">PTL 1 recites &#x201c;Additionally, when the average crystal grain size in the fired surface of the ceramic sintered body is small, the filling rate of crystal grain in the fired surface is increased. For this reason, mechanical strength of the fired surface is increased. Therefore, in the second region that is unlikely to be exposed to the plasma-converted gas compared to the first region because of being located further inward of the main body, damage of the main body due to mechanical stress or thermal stress can be suppressed by increasing the mechanical strength while reducing influence by the plasma-converted gas.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, when the inventors verified the gas nozzle described in PTL 1, the particle reduction effect was small and its performance was not always satisfactory.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of the intensive studies of the inventors, they found that it is more effective to reduce particle generation if the average crystal grain size of the inner wall of the outlet side of the gas nozzle is smaller than the average crystal grain size of the inner wall of the back side, and this led to the completion of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention was made in view of the above situation, and it is an object to provide a gas nozzle with a fired surface that is more effective in reducing particles.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The gas nozzle is a columnar gas nozzle made of sintered ceramics having at least one through-hole through which gas flows, wherein both the entire inner surface of the through-hole and the end face where the outlet of the through-hole is provided are fired surfaces, and the inner surface of the through-hole has a first region A in the vicinity of the outlet and a second region B located at a deeper position than the first region A.

The end face <b>1</b>A and the entire inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> correspond to the face.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">That is, in the nozzle <b>1</b>, at least, both the entire inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> and the end face <b>1</b><i>a</i>, where the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> is provided, are formed as fired surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Faces other than the entire inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> and the end face <b>1</b><i>a</i>, where the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> is provided may be processed or fired surfaces. Moreover, the whole surface of the nozzle <b>1</b> may be fired surface.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fired surface is the surface without polishing, grinding, or other processing, and without covering or coating treatment after firing of ceramics to the fired surface, but chemical treatments for cleaning control may be appropriately performed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The side surface <b>1</b>C of the gas nozzle <b>1</b> may be left fired surfaced. Or the fired surface thereof may be subjected to processing such as polishing or grinding, and/or covering or coating treatment may be performed thereon.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As escribed above, both the entire inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> and the end face <b>1</b><i>a</i>, where the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> is provided of the gas nozzle <b>1</b> are left fired-surfaced and are kept in a state without being subjected to processing such as polishing or grinding. Accordingly, no crushing layer due to processing exists.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Consequently, even when the fired surface is damaged by plasma, the generation of particularly large particles caused by the peeling of the crushing layer is inhibited.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b> has a first region A in the vicinity of the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a second region B located at a deeper position than the first region A. The average crystal grain size in the first region A is formed to be smaller than the average crystal grain size in the second region B.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first region A and the second region B are formed continuously from the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>to the depth side of the gas nozzle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The particle generation due to peeling off of the crystal grains is suppressed when the average crystal grain size in the first region A is formed to be smaller than the average crystal grain size in the second region B.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Though the reason has not been clarified clearly at present, it can be estimated that the small average crystal grain size in region A which is more prone to be strongly exposed to plasma increases the strength of the surface, and thus, the surface withstands the physical impacts of radicals when exposed to the plasma, and consequently, the generation of particles is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the case of the gas nozzle of the apparatus, which supplies a halogen-based corrosive gas as raw material gas into a reaction chamber and turns it into a plasmanized etching gas to perform microfabrication on an object, it can be thought that in the region B of the gas nozzle where, for example, halogenated corrosive gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) come in contact in a larger area ratio rather than plasma the increase in the average grain size reduces the number of grain boundaries and makes the grain boundaries more resistant to corrosion by halogenated corrosive gases, and as a result, the generation of particles by corrosion is inhibited. Considering the balance between effects on sintered ceramics and grain size that each of plasma and halogenated corrosive gas (e.g., fluorine gas) has, it is considered that the size relationship of the average crystal grain size as in the present invention is suitable.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As concretely shown in one embodiment of the first region A and the second region B, the distance from the outlet in the depth direction in the first region A is within 0.5 mm, and the distance from the outlet in the depth direction in the second region B which is further to depth side of the first region A is within 3 mm. The average crystal grain size in the second region B is 1.2 times or less than that in the first region A. The average crystal grain size in the first region A is 3 &#x3bc;m to 3.5 &#x3bc;m and that of the second region B is 3.4 &#x3bc;m to 4 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The average grain size is obtained by analyzing the taken pictures with an image analysis tool (Product name: Mac-View), which pictures are taken by observing and shooting the surfaces of the first region A and the second region B with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reason why the first region A is at a distance within 0.5 mm from the outlet in the depth direction is that, when fired, this region is likely to be affected by heating by conduction, and the grain size is apt to become larger; as a result, the difference in grain size between ones in the first region A and the second region B becomes clear.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the reason why the second region B is at a distance within 3 mm from the outlet further in the depth direction from the first region A is that firing progresses in this region at an approximately constant temperature due to heating by conduction; as a result, the grain size becomes a nearly constant distribution. That is, the grain size is stable in this region and the region further in the depth direction, and these regions are sufficient to identify as the region where the advantageous effects of the present invention are obtained.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the effects of the present invention are further exerted by setting the average crystal grain size in the second region B to be 1.2 times or less than that in the first region A.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the average crystal grain size in the second region B exceeds 1.2 times or more than that in the first region A, the stress difference between crystals becomes too much and it may cause peeling of at the boundary, at the inner wall, of the region A and the region B.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The gas nozzle <b>1</b> is manufactured by a typical manufacturing method.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One example is as follows:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000">First, a slurry is prepared by wet-mixing in a ball mill after adding water and an organic binder to a ceramics powder. Then, ceramic granulated powder are prepared by granulating the slurry by spray drying.<br/>The ceramic granulated powder is formed into a predetermined shape using a molding method such as a die press molding method or cold isostatic pressing (CIP) molding method to obtain a cylindrical, for example, molding.<br/>Next, after boring through-holes into the molding, the molding is fired at a temperature of 1400&#xb0; C. or higher and 2000&#xb0; C. or lower in air ambient atmosphere or oxygen atmosphere to obtain a gas nozzle according to the present invention. Because the gas nozzle is not processed after firing, the entire region of the inner surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the through-holes <b>2</b>, the end face <b>1</b>A where the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the through-hole <b>2</b>, and other surfaces have fired surfaces.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">When the moldings are fired in a firing furnace after preparing moldings having a predetermined shape, the moldings are preferably arranged to quicken heating at the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the gas nozzle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Specifically, when the molding is mounted on a mounting table, a portion to be the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the gas nozzle <b>1</b> of the molding is mounted to come into contact with the mounting table; that is, a portion to be the inlet <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the gas nozzle <b>1</b> of the molding is mounted to face upward.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">With this, at the time of firing the molding, the molding is heated inward from the upper portion, the inlet <b>2</b><i>c</i>, and the heat escapes from the outlet <b>2</b><i>b </i>side to the mounting table. As a result, the second region B, located inside the molding, is largely heated in comparison to the first region A, located in the vicinity of the outlet <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In the case where the gas nozzle is formed of, for example, yttria sintered body, yttrium-aluminum-garnet sintered body, spinel sintered body, or high-purity alumina sintered body, liquid-phase sintering occurs when molding is fired.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">With this, the grain size in the second region B, to which larger heat is subjected, is likely to grow larger than that in the first region A.
