Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a curable composition, a kit, an interlayer, a laminate, an imprint pattern producing method, and a method for manufacturing a device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An imprinting method is a technique in which a fine pattern is transferred to a material by pressing a metal mold (generally also called a mold or a stamper) on which a pattern is formed. The imprinting method enables simple and precise production of a fine pattern, and thus is expected to be applied in various fields, such as a precision processing field for semiconductor integrated circuits, in recent years. In particular, a nanoimprint technique for forming a fine pattern of a nano-order level is attracting attention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP2018-080260A discloses, as a composition used in an imprinting method, an adhesion layer-forming composition to allow a substrate to adhere to a photocurable composition, at least containing a curable main agent (A) having at least one functional group which is bonded to a base material and having at least one radically polymerizable functional group, a polymerization inhibitor (B), and an organic solvent (C), in which the content of the polymerization inhibitor (B) is 0.1 parts by weight or greater and 10 parts by weight or lower with respect to 100 parts by weight of the curable main agent (A).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the imprinting method, methods called a thermal imprinting method and a curable imprinting method have been proposed depending on a transfer method. In the thermal imprinting method, for example, a mold is pressed against a thermoplastic resin heated to a temperature equal to or higher than a glass transition temperature (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;Tg&#x201d; in some cases), the thermoplastic resin is cooled, and then the mold is released to form a fine pattern. In this method, various materials can be selected, but there are problems in that it is difficult to form a fine pattern, such as the need for high pressure during pressing and the deterioration of dimensional accuracy due to heat contraction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the curable imprinting method, for example, while the mold is pressed against a curable layer formed of a composition for forming a pattern, the curable layer is cured by light, heat, or the like, and then the mold is released. Since it is imprinted on an uncured material, it is possible to omit part or all of high-pressure addition and high-temperature heating, and it is possible to easily produce a fine pattern. Moreover, since a dimensional change before and after curing is small, there is also an advantage that a fine pattern can be formed with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, new developments such as a nanocasting method in which the advantages of both the thermal imprinting method and the curable imprinting method are combined, and a reversal imprinting method for producing a three-dimensional laminated structure have also been reported.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Examples of the curable imprinting method include a method in which a curable layer is formed by applying, by a coating or the like, a composition for forming a pattern to a member to be applied, which is selected from the group consisting of a base material (subjected to an adhesion treatment such as forming an interlayer as necessary) and a mold, and then a member which is not selected as the member to be applied from the group consisting of the base material and the mold is brought into contact with the curable layer as a contact member. For example, the curable layer is cured by light irradiation or the like in a state in which the above-described contact member and the above-described curable layer are in contact with each other, and then the mold is released to produce a cured substance to which a desired pattern is transferred.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In such an imprinting method, since it is necessary to release the mold from the composition for forming a pattern while leaving the composition for forming a pattern on the base material, sufficient adhesiveness between the base material and the composition for forming a pattern may be required.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the composition as described in JP2018-080260A is used to form an interlayer between the base material and the curable layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in a case where the interlayer is formed between the base material and the curable layer, there is room for further improvement in the point that pattern defects of a pattern obtained from the curable layer formed on the interlayer are generated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide a curable composition which is used for forming an interlayer existing between a base material and a curable layer, in which a solution stability of the curable composition and a suppression of pattern defects of the curable layer formed on the interlayer formed by the composition are excellent;
