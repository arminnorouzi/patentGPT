to, for example, an interlayer film for laminated glass, for use in laminated glass, and laminated glass comprising the interlayer film for laminated glass.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, laminated glass obtained by interposing an interlayer film for laminated glass between two glass plates and integrating them is widely known. Such an interlayer film for laminated glass is often formed from a plasticized polyvinyl acetal in which a plasticizer is compounded into a polyvinyl acetal resin. Laminated glass is widely used as window glass for, for example, vehicles such as automobile, airplanes, and architectural structures because of less causing glass debris to fly even if subjected to an external impact, and thus being safe.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although inorganic glass is generally widely used for glass plates in laminated glass, a problem of inorganic glass is heavy weight, occurrence of cracks when subjected to an impact, and the like. Thus, organic glass such as a polycarbonate plate or a polymethyl methacrylate plate may be sometimes used for one of such plates for laminated glass.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laminated glass is generally produced by placing an interlayer film for laminated glass between two glass plates and subjecting them to thermocompression bonding under high-temperature and high-pressure in an autoclave or the like. However, if one of the two glass plates in such laminated glass is organic glass, warpage may occur due to the difference in coefficient of linear expansion between inorganic glass and organic glass during returning to room temperature after thermocompression bonding.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1 discloses suppression of warpage with a glass laminate having a laminate structure in which a hard resin sheet (organic glass) is laminated on an inorganic glass plate with an interlayer film being interposed therebetween, wherein the hard resin sheet has a glass transition temperature, an optical transmittance, a storage elastic modulus, and a loss tangent tan &#x3b4; in respective specified ranges.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 2 discloses suppression of warpage with an interlayer film in which polyvinyl butyral film/resin layer higher in viscosity at room temperature than polyvinyl butyral film/polyvinyl butyral film are laminated in the listed order.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">PTL 1: WO 2018/159520</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">PTL 2: JP 10-119184 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0009">However, it has been found that, although the interlayer films described in PTLs 1 and 2 achieved the effect of reducing warpage at a certain level, they easily cause warpage to occur, for example, when the temperature after thermocompression bonding with organic glass and inorganic glass is less than room temperature. In other words, warpage occurs under severer conditions than conventional conditions and there is a need for improvement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide an interlayer film for laminated glass, which can allow for sufficient suppression of warpage even in a case where laminated glass is obtained by allowing inorganic glass and organic glass to adhere.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present inventors have made intensive studies, and as a result, have found that warpage can be sufficiently suppressed with an interlayer film for laminated glass, the film comprising a thermoplastic resin and having a shear storage elastic modulus at 30&#xb0;
