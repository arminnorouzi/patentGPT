However, the invention is not limited to the described embodiments, and a person skilled in the art will appreciate that many other embodiments of the invention are possible without deviating from the basic concept of the invention, and that any such work around will also fall under scope of this invention. It is envisioned that other styles and configurations of the present invention can be easily incorporated into the teachings of the present invention, and the configurations shall be shown and described for purposes of clarity and disclosure and not by way of limitation of scope.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments of the invention described in detail below relate to a transparent panel or window insert of corresponding shape and size to a casement or awning window. The transparent panel or window insert is attached to the frame of an insect screen by way of a series of releasable fasteners around the outer perimeter of the transparent panel or window insert. A void, corresponding to the shape and size of a A/C hose is cut into the transparent panel or window insert. In some embodiments of the invention the void may be bayoneted to cooperate with bayonette-style hose connections.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transparent panel or window insert allows the use of mobile or stand-up air conditioners in crank style and awning windows. It is easy to install and allows an unobstructed outside view. The hose connecting directly into the transparent panel or window insert. The ability of being able to directly clip the hose into the window insert allows a cost effective way to cool rooms in most newer builds. Most newbuilds only have the crank-style or awning windows. Embodiments of this invention will allow many who do not have sliding windows to take advantage of the mobile or standup A/C units.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The transparent panel or window insert may be fabricated from various plastics, for example polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethersulfone (PES), etc. Furthermore, the transparent panel or window insert can be coated, for example, have a coating acting as an infrared filter or infrared reflector for thermal insulation coating.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transparent panel or window insert is placed in same spot where the insect screen is located. For high rise and residential, commercial or industrial circumstances where an awning or casement window is used it eliminating the need to use just a sliding window in conjunction with mobile stand-up A/C units. The A/C hose is place in a void in the transparent panel or window insert. The awning or casement is opened all the way, and the A/C then vents through the window opening through the insect screen. This allows for the A/C to vent out of the awning or casement opening. In winter months when A/C is not needed, the transparent panel or window insert is removed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The system described herein makes it possible to install air-conditioning units in casement and awning window apertures without causing any damage whatsoever to window frames and walls. The method makes it possible to install air-conditioning units only for the period for which the latter are required in the hot season and to remove them when they are not required. The installation and removal of the transparent panel or window insert is simple and does not require a high level of expertise.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The features of the invention which are believed to be novel are particularly pointed out in the specification.
