Panel blinds comprise a plurality of elongated vertical strips, generally comprised of a fabric. The strips are each rotatable about an axis such as to define a light and dark condition. A drawback of panel blinds is that they may not sufficiently block light in the dark condition, e.g. when compared to curtains, as light tends to permeate through the fabric as well as between the gaps of adjacently hung strips.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Venetian blinds are another variant that comprise a plurality of horizontally hung slats generally made from wood, plastics or metals. The slats are therefore not prone to light permeating through the surfaces as with fabric-made panel blinds however, they are still susceptible to light passing through the gaps of adjacent slats. Another drawback of ready-made Venetian blinds is that they will not offer the perfect fit within a window frame and thus tend to suffer from light haloing around the edges. Made-to-measure blinds can mitigate the issue but are expensive. Furthermore, replacing individual slats of Venetian blinds for cleaning or repairs is cumbersome and may require specialist assistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Blinds also offer minimal privacy when in the light condition, e.g. allowing someone external to see into the interior.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">GB2549637 discloses a curtain-blind system in which blackout strips are spaced by translucent strips. The blackout curtain strips are held on hangers to form a continuous, curtain-like window covering. The hangers allow turning of the blackout strips to a dark condition and to a light condition in which light can pass through the intervening translucent strips.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However the system disclosed in GB2549637 is time-consuming to hang, e.g. requiring measuring of the widow and assembly to match the widow width in a manner similar to curtains. Furthermore, if any of the strips are damaged or sullied, the entire curtain-blind must be removed for repair or replacement, again like a curtain.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is the aim of the present invention to provide a curtain-blind system that overcomes or mitigates one or more of the problems addressed above.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is a curtain-blind system comprising,<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a plurality of hangers,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a plurality of curtain-blind sections, each section comprising,        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0011">a first surface,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0012">a second surface,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0013">a first connector clamping the first surface,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0014">a second connector clamping the second surface,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">wherein the first connector is releasably hung on a first hanger, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">wherein the second connector is releasably hung on a second hanger, and wherein the curtain-blind sections are arranged side-by-side on the plurality of hangers in use to define the curtain-blind system with the first connector of one curtain-blind section being independently releasable from an adjacent curtain-blind section whilst remaining clamped to the first surface.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0017">Optionally, the second connector of said one curtain-blind section may also be independently releasable from an adjacent curtain blind section whilst remaining clamped to the second surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0018">Optionally, each of the plurality of curtain-blind sections may be releasable from its adjacent curtain-blind sections.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0019">Advantageously, the curtain blind can be simply parted by a user between adjacent sections even when hung in use. Furthermore, individual sections can be individually hung independently of adjacent sections. This means that an entire curtain blind can be assembled and hung one section at a time. Individual sections can also be removed and replaced with ease, if required, without having to remove the entire curtain blind.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0020">Optionally, one connector of each adjacent curtain-blind section may be releasably attached to a common hanger, e.g. on the same or opposing sides of a common hanger.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0021">The first connector may clamp both sides of the first surface. The second connector may clamp both sides of the second surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0022">The connectors act as interstitial members and are each mounted to their respective surfaces prior to being hung on a hanger. This prevents the user from having to clamp the entire curtain-blind at the same time prior to mounting the entire curtain blind to the hanger. The ability to hang the curtain-blind section by section can simplify installation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0023">The first surface of one section may be hung parallel with, next to and/or immediately adjacent the second surface of an adjacent section. Any spacing between said surfaces when hung may be minimal, e.g. less than 3 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm or 0.5 cm.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0024">Two adjacent curtain-blind sections may be hung on a common hanger such that one of the curtain-blind sections can be released independently from the adjacent curtain blind section whilst leaving the hanger in place.

The third surface may join the first and second surfaces, e.g. being continuous with the first and second surfaces.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">In the light condition, the first and second surfaces may be arranged to allow the light to transverse through the curtain-blind system. They may be angled to minimise the amount of light that lands on the major surface of the first and second surfaces (e.g. such that the first and second surfaces are angled such that the major faces are substantially/mostly parallel to the light).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">Optionally, the curtain-blind system comprises a head-rail for mounting the plurality of hangers.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">Optionally, the plurality of hangers are slidable along a longitudinal length of the head-rail.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">Optionally, each of the hangers comprise a central axis about which they are rotatable, wherein the axis may be orthogonal to the longitudinal length of the head-rail.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">Optionally, the rotation of the hangers moves the curtain-blind system between the light and dark conditions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">Optionally, the curtain-blind system may comprise an actuator.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">Optionally, the actuator may drive the rotation of the hangers about their respective axes, such as to move the curtain-blind system between the light and dark condition.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">Optionally, the actuator may be able to move the hangers within the head-rail, such to draw the curtain-blind system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">Optionally, the actuator comprises a cord, chain or wand (e.g. a manual actuator).

Alternatively the actuator could be driven by a rack and pinion type arrangement.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0095">The actuation of the hangers can be driven by a manual input or by a motor, e.g. with user controls. In the manual actuation examples, the manual actuator may comprise a cord/string, a chain or a rigid elongate member, such as a wand. The actuation system allows control of the angular orientation (i.e. rotation control) of the hangers and/or the spacing of the hangers along the head-rail.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0096">Various alternatives are possible and any such means that are common in the art will be known to the person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows another example view of a hanger that is substantially identical to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with the only difference being that the hanger comprises first and second hooks, such as to form an anchor shape. The two hooks are arranged back-to-back or side-by-side. The two hooks may share a common stem portion.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0098">The hooks could be curved in form or perpendicular. A single hook could receive one or two handles <b>45</b>, <b>55</b> of the connectors, i.e. holding one or two curtain-blind surfaces on each hook, depending on the desired implementation. The hooks could be wider to receive two handles <b>45</b>, <b>55</b> side-by-side if desired.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> &#x26; <b>6</b></figref> show a schematical top-view and 3D view respectively of the light (a) and dark (b) conditions of the curtain-blind system. The system comprises a plurality of curtain-blind sections in a side-by-side arrangement. In the light condition, the first and second surfaces are substantially parallel to the direction of light, minimising the surface area of the impermeable surfaces for light contact. The light-permeable third surface extends between the first and second surfaces, as such the light is substantially unincumbered from traversing through the curtain-blind system</p><p id="p-0087" num="0100">In the dark condition the curtain-blind sections are angled such that the first surface of one curtain blind section at least partially overlaps the second surface of an adjacent curtain-blind section. Light therefore cannot transverse through the curtain-blind system in the dark condition.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0101">Operation</p><p id="p-0089" num="0102">In use, the curtain-blind system will resemble the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The curtain-blind system is predominantly considered as a window treatment/cover and as such is considered for use in relation to window frames, although it will be understood that this is non-limiting and may be used in other openings such as door frames.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0103">In the light condition, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the light transverses through the light permeable third surface into a room. An actuator is then used to move the curtain-blind system into the dark condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. The actuator may be a pullcord or similar (not shown), the mechanism of which will be known to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0104">The curtain-blind may be also put into a drawn condition in which the drawstring is pulled, actuating the plurality of hangers to slidably move within the head-rail.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0105">To assemble the curtain blind system, the plurality of hangers are slid into the head-rail at an open-end which is then sealed. The head-rail is then mounted within a door or window frame. The first and second surfaces of each curtain-blind section are clamped by a first or second connector respectively. This can be performed at a safe height to mitigate the chances of falling from a chair or a ladder when installing the system.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0106">The handles of the curtain-blind sections can be releasably attached to the hangers, specifically the hooks thereof. Where the hanger comprises a single attachment means, such as the J-shaped hanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second connector of each curtain-blind section should be first located on a hanger in turn. The first connector of a given curtain-blind section can then be located onto the adjacent hanger which is already holding the second connector of the adjacent curtain-blind section, thereby resulting in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In the event of needing to remove a individual curtain-blind section, the first connector can be removed immediately and independently of the second connector of the adjacent curtain-blind section that is on the same hanger. To remove the second connector, the first connector of the opposing adjacent hanger has to be removed in order to gain access thereto. Once done, the curtain-blind section can then be removed. Hence, individual sections can be easily removed and replaced with minimal or no interference with the other curtain-blind sections in the system, thereby making it easier and more convenient to use.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0107">When using a hanger comprising two attachment means, such as the dual hook hanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each curtain-blind section can be both mounted and dismounted from the curtain-blind system independently from both the adjacent curtain-blind sections.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0108">Using the system described herein, multiple successive curtain-blind sections can simply be added and/or removed as desired to form the overall curtain-blind.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
