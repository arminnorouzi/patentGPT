In order to reduce the burden on the doctors, an image analysis technique by a computer is indispensable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, many image analysis (image recognition) technologies based on artificial intelligence such as deep learning have been attempted, and some of the technologies have been reported to be capable of outputting determination results equivalent to those by doctors. For example, Patent Literatures 1 and 2 disclose image analysis techniques for medical images.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature 1</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Publication Tokukai No. 2018-175226</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature 2</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Publication Tokukai No. 2015-156894</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A doctor ascertains structural characteristics of lesion areas in tissues, and also understands how each lesion area can be captured as an image. The doctor then determines, based on a captured image of a tissue, a change that has occurred in the tissue.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, based on properties of a nodular shadow found from a lung CT image of a patient, a doctor can infer and determine a type of pulmonary nodule. An image analysis technique is demanded that makes it possible to determine a type of pulmonary nodule from a nodular shadow at the same level as determination of a type of pulmonary nodule by a doctor. Such an image analysis technique can be utilized in detection and determination of lesions in a variety of organs and tissues, as well as in interpretation of lung CT images.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In recent years, various techniques have been devised in which a computer (artificial intelligence) autonomously outputs an inference result by learning enormous amounts of image data by itself. For example, it is possible that an artificial intelligence which has learned correspondences between tissue images determined by a doctor and determination results is created, and an inference result is outputted by inputting a tissue image to be analyzed into the artificial intelligence. However, the inference obtained using the artificial intelligence has a problem that a user such as a doctor cannot understand an outputted inference result. This is because the grounds based on which the artificial intelligence has outputted the inference result are often incomprehensible from the analyzed image. In a case where the grounds for outputting the inference result are unknown, it is difficult to utilize the inference result as it is for current medical treatment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present invention has been made so as to solve the problem, and an object of an aspect of the present invention is to achieve, for example, an image analyzing method and an image analyzing device each of which is for highly accurately determining, like a doctor does, a change that has occurred in a tissue, by analyzing a tissue image based on a structural characteristic of the change that has occurred in the tissue.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to attain the object, an image analyzing method in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is a method for analyzing a tissue image obtained by capturing an image of a tissue, and the method includes: a binarizing step of extracting, from the tissue image, a target region image to be analyzed and generating, with respect to the target region image, a plurality of binarized images having respective binarization reference values different from each other; a feature number calculating step of calculating, with respect to each of the plurality of binarized images, a feature number including a first feature number that indicates the number of hole-shaped regions, each of the hole-shaped regions being surrounded by pixels each having a first pixel value obtained by binarization, and each of the hole-shaped regions being constituted by pixels each having a second pixel value obtained by the binarization; a reference value specifying step of specifying a binarized image in which the first feature number is maximized and specifying (i) a first reference value that indicates a binarization reference value in the binarized image which has been specified and (ii) a maximum first feature number that indicates the first feature number in the binarized image; and a determining step of determining, based on the first reference value and the maximum first feature number, a change that has occurred in the tissue.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to attain the object, an image analyzing device in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is an image analyzing device for analyzing a tissue image obtained by capturing an image of a tissue, and the image analyzing device includes: a binarizing section that extracts, from the tissue image, a target region image to be analyzed and generates, with respect to the target region image, a plurality of binarized images having respective binarization reference values different from each other; a feature number calculating section that calculates, with respect to each of the plurality of binarized images, a first feature number that indicates the number of hole-shaped regions, each of the hole-shaped regions being surrounded by pixels each having a first pixel value obtained by binarization, and each of the hole-shaped regions being constituted by pixels each having a second pixel value obtained by the binarization; a reference value specifying section that specifies a binarized image in which the first feature number is maximized and specifies (i) a first reference value that indicates a binarization reference value in the binarized image which has been specified and (ii) a maximum first feature number that indicates the first feature number in the binarized image; and a determining section that determines, based on the first reference value and the maximum first feature number, a change that has occurred in the tissue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The image analyzing device in accordance with each of the aspects of the present invention can be realized by a computer.

invention will be described below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As an example of a tissue image, the inventors of the present invention have analyzed a region of a lung (tissue) in a computed tomography (CT) image obtained by imaging a chest of a subject. Specifically, the inventors of the present invention have compared and analyzed in detail a region in which a pulmonary nodule has not occurred and a region in which a pulmonary nodule has occurred in the lung CT image (tissue image).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Specifically, the inventors of the present invention have extracted a nodular shadow to be analyzed from the lung CT image, and generated, with respect to the nodular shadow, a plurality of binarized images having respective binarization reference values different from each other. Then, the inventors of the present invention have analyzed, for each of the binarized images, how a one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> (first feature number) and a zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b> (second feature number), which have been calculated, change when the binarization reference value is changed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that it is possible to highly accurately determine a type of pulmonary nodule from which a nodular shadow is derived, based on a binarization reference value with which the one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> is maximized and on a maximum value of the one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the inventors of the present invention have also found that, by further utilizing (1) through (3) described below, it is possible to improve the accuracy of determination of a pulmonary nodule and to enhance efficiency of the determination process.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(1) A binarization reference value with which the zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b> is maximized, and a maximum value of the zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b></p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">(2) A ratio between the one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> and the zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b></p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">(3) The one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> and the zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b> per unit area of a nodular shadow</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(Mathematical Representation for Analysis of Tissue Image)</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the following description will discuss a mathematical representation applied to analyze a tissue image in the image analyzing method in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to quantify and analyze a change that has occurred in a tissue, the image analyzing method in accordance with an aspect of the present invention applies the concept of homology, in particular, persistent homology, with respect to a binarized image. Homology is one of mathematical fields which facilitates an analysis of, for example, connection between figures by algebraically substituting morphological characteristics of the figures.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The concept of homology is a mathematical concept indicative of connection and contact between constituents. In a tissue image, an appropriate binarization reference value (also referred to as a binarization parameter) is set so that the tissue image is binarized. Then, from the binarized image, a zero-dimensional Betti number and a one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> are calculated. The zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b> and the one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> each having been thus calculated can be used to (i) assess a degree of connection between constituents of the tissue and (ii) assess a degree of contact between the constituents.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A Betti number is a topological pointer number which is independent of a shape of each of figures (for example, corresponding to constituents of a tissue) but is dependent on merely contact and separation between figures. In a case where a q-th singular homology group is finitely generated, the q-th singular homology group can be expressed by a direct sum of a free Abelian group and a finite Abelian group. A rank of the free Abelian group is called a &#x201c;Betti number&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">&#x3c;Zero-Dimensional Betti Number b<b>0</b>&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b> is mathematically defined as follows. The number of connected components of a figure (also called a &#x201c;one-dimensional complex&#x201d;) K obtained by connecting a finite number of line segments is generally referred to as a zero-dimensional Betti number. The expression &#x201c;a figure obtained by connecting a finite number of points with use of a finite number of line segments is connected&#x201d; means that it is possible to reach any second vertex from any first vertex of the figure by following a side of the figure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In each of a plurality of binarized images generated with use of different binarization reference values, the number of connected regions obtained by connecting pixels each having one of pixel values obtained by binarization (e.g., a pixel value of <b>0</b> obtained as a result of binarization) is a zero-dimensional Betti number b<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">&#x3c;One-Dimensional Betti Number b<b>1</b>&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> is mathematically defined as follows.

For example, the binarizing section can be subjected to deep learning using, as training data, correspondences between chest CT images and target region images (e.g., images having features as a nodular shadow) to be detected (or cut out) from the chest CT images. Here, the chest CT image used as the training data can be, for example, a chest CT image including an image of a region in which a feature as a nodular shadow has been recognized in advance by interpretation by a doctor.

In this case, the binarizing section <b>41</b> generates a plurality of binarized images by binarizing, every time the binarizing section <b>41</b> changes the binarization reference value, a single CT image obtained by capturing an image of a lung.

That is, the binarizing section <b>41</b> sets a binarization reference value within a range between 0 and 255. For example, in a case where a binarization reference value is set to a pixel value of 100, a pixel value of a pixel that has a pixel value of not more than 100 becomes 0 as a result of the binarization process, and a pixel value of a pixel that has a pixel value of more than 100 becomes 255 as a result of the binarization process.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0109">The manner of setting the binarization reference value is not limited to this example. For example, a binarization reference value can be set to a CT value of &#x2212;1000 HU to &#x2212;700 HU, which is commonly set in a chest CT image that is captured to image a lung. In a case where the binarization reference value is set to &#x2212;900 HU, a pixel value of a pixel that has a CT value of not more than &#x2212;900 HU becomes 0 as a result of the binarization process, and a pixel value of a pixel that has a CT value of more than &#x2212;900 HU becomes 255 as a result of the binarization process.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0110">The binarizing section <b>41</b> can limit a range of CT values in a target region image prior to the binarization process. In a lung CT image, a region having a CT value range of 0 HU to 1000 HU is ignored and therefore, for example, an object to be subjected to the binarization process can be limited to a region having a CT value range of &#x2212;1000 HU to 0 HU. In this case, CT values in a range of &#x2212;1000 HU to 0 HU are associated with pixel values in a range of 0 to 255. For example, a value obtained by rounding off a decimal point of a value of 255&#xd7;(CT value)/(CT value range in target region image) can be determined as a pixel value corresponding to the CT value.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0111">[Betti Number Calculating Section <b>42</b>]</p><p id="p-0111" num="0112">The Betti number calculating section <b>42</b> calculates, for each of a plurality of binarized images, a one-dimensional Betti number b<b>1</b> indicating the number of hole-shaped regions.
