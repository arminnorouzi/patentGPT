The greenhouse gases partially absorb the infra-red radiation emitted by the earth surface, which hampers its dissipation to the space. An increase in the greenhouse gases can result in the raise of global mean temperature.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methane is a by-product of the consumption of nutrients by microbes in the gut of ruminant animals. For example, a cow releases between 85 and 170 kg of methane per year on average. The rumen, e.g., a first stomach of a ruminant animal, is filled with microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa that break down high fiber plant material consume by the animal into nutrients via a fermentative process. The microorganisms process the plant material to produce methane and carbon dioxide. The majority of the methane is released by belching by the animal, thereby contributing to green house gas increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for a feed supplement for animals to reduce methane and carbon dioxide production in ruminant animals.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method and process to prepare sodium percarbonated feed additive polyphenol particles, including a process for preparing dry feed additive using a dispersing agent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Feed additive polyphenol particles can be prepared by reacting phenols with sodium percarbonate (2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in a solution of an organic solvent compatible with water, water, a peroxidase and a dispersing agent.

The feed additive or feed supplement can be in the form of particles or pellets that can be mixed in a regular feed diet of the animal. The feed additive can include a phenolic compound, together with sodium and carbonate components, e.g., forming sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the feed additive can include natural substances, such as phenolic compounds selected and activated from plant phenols, which can help reducing methane or carbon dioxide production by an animal, such as a ruminant, for example, by mixing in a feed diet of the animal. The feed diet can be optimized to enhance health, growth, meat, and milk production of the animals.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the feed additive can include sodium and carbonate components, which can help in dissolving the phenolic feed additive during the consumption of the feed additive by the animal. The incorporation of the sodium and carbonate components can be accomplished by using an oxidant having sodium percarbonate, which can be dissolved in a water solution to release sodium and carbonate ions for reacting with the phenolic feed additive.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method for reducing methane or carbon dioxide production in animals, such as in ruminants, which includes feeding orally to the animal a feed composition containing a sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The animal feed supplement described herein can be used to reduce methane and carbon dioxide production or emission by animals, while increasing availability of nutrients, increase efficiency of milk and meat production by the animals. The present sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive has been added to beef cow diet and can reduce their methane emissions by as much as 82% to 90% percent, in addition to allow the cows to convert feed to body weight 20 percent more efficiently. Further, the efficacy of the present feed additive does not diminish among 21 cows fed 1.5 to 3 ounces of feed additive daily for 21 weeks.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive can include an enzyme catalyzed oxidative crosslinking of a phenolic compound, using an oxidant having a sodium percarbonate to incorporate sodium and carbonate elements to the feed additive. The sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive can be fed to an animal to reduce methane or carbon dioxide production by the animal. For example, the feed additive can be mixed with a regular feed diet of the animal, to be orally consumed by the animal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate flow charts for forming phenolic particles according to some embodiments.

Operation <b>140</b> removes the polymer products from the solution to be used as a feed additive for an animal to reduce methane or carbon dioxide emission.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive and the use of the feed additive are considered to be purely non-therapeutic. However, in some embodiments, the feed additive and its usage can be therapeutic to the animals.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the sodium carbonate phenolic feed additive can be used to reduce methane and carbon dioxide production in the rumen of a ruminant, and thereby reduce or eliminate associated bloat. Thus, the feed additive can help solving a significant problem in feedlot or grazing livestock production systems due to a high-grain diet or high legume forage diet in ruminants.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the animal is a ruminant animal or a pseudo-ruminant animal. The ruminant refers to any hoofed animal of the suborder Ruminantia and the order Artiodactyla, characteristically digesting its food in two steps. Ruminants include cattle, sheep, goats, llamas, giraffes, bisons, buffalo, deer, elk, wildebeest, antelope, pronghorn, alpacas and yaks. The pseudo-ruminant can include horses, camels, hippopotami, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The amount of the animal feed supplement consumed by the animal can vary depending on the animals, such as on types of the animals, sizes of the animals, and ages of the animals. The total daily feed supplement amount can be divided and provided in portions during the day, such as two or three portions per day. Each animal can consume up to about 100 g of feed additive per day. For example, an animal can consume less than 100 g, less than 90 g, less than 80 g, less than 70 g, less than 60 g, less than 50 g, less than 40 g, less than 30 g, less than 20 g, or less than 10 g of the feed supplement per day depending on the size of the animal. As a specific example, an average cow can consume about 40 g to 85 g of feed additive per day.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preliminary data indicates that the feed additive disclosed in the present specification can reduce methane or carbon dioxide production and emission by as much as 82% to 90% percent compared to methane or carbon dioxide production and emission if the animal feed supplement is not consumed. Further, the effect can be a long term effect with no side effect, e.g., the animals can more efficiently convert the feed having the feed additive to body weight during at least in the 21 week study time.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">General Process</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the feed additive can include phenol particles or pellets, which can be formed by an enzyme catalyzed oxidative crosslinking of a phenol, together with by using a dispersing agent to control the size of the phenol particles. The phenol particles can further include sodium and carbonate, for example, by using sodium percarbonate as the oxidant in the process of the enzyme catalyzed oxidative crosslinking of the phenol to form the phenol particles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the process to form the feed additive can include dissolving a phenol, such as a polyphenol or a phenolic compound, in a solvent. An oxidizing agent, or an oxidant, is then added to the solution, together with an oxidoreductase as a catalyst to oxidize the polyphenol using the oxidizing agent to form phenoxy radicals to produce polymers and oligomers. The polymers and oligomers can coalesce to form polyphenol particles. The oxidant can include sodium percarbonate, which can be dissociated into sodium and carbonate ions, together with hydrogen peroxide. The sodium and carbonate ions can be incorporated in the polyphenol particles, which can assist in dissolving the polyphenol particles during the digestion of the particles. A dispersing agent is added, for example, before the particle coalescence to control the size of the particles. The oxidative reaction is configured to form phenoxy radicals to produce polymers and oligomers, with the polymers and oligomers coalesced to form the particles.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method to form an animal feed additive which can reduce methane or carbon dioxide emission from the animal. The method can include an enzyme catalyzed oxidative crosslinking or polymerizing a phenol, such as a polyphenol or a phenolic compound, to form particulate feed additive.
