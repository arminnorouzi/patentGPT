In order to meet different performance requirements of various application scenarios, the 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Radio Access Network (RAN) #<b>72</b> plenary decided to conduct the study of New Radio (NR), or what is called fifth Generation (5G). The work Item (WI) of NR was approved at the 3GPP RAN #<b>75</b> session to standardize the NR.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In communications, both Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G NR involves correct reception of reliable information, optimized energy efficiency ratio (EER), determination of information validity, flexible resource allocation, elastic system structure, effective information processing on non-access stratum, and lower traffic interruption and call drop rate, higher security and privacy and support to lower consumption, which play an important role in the normal communication between a base station and a User Equipment (UE), rational scheduling of resources, and also in the balance of system payload, thus laying a solid foundation for increasing throughput, meeting a variety of traffic needs in communications, enhancing the spectrum utilization and improving service quality. Therefore, LTE and 5G are indispensable no matter in enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) or enhanced Machine Type Communication (eMTC). And a wide range of requests can be found in terms of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), Vehicular to X (V2X) and Device to Device (D2D), Unlicensed Spectrum communications, and monitoring on UE communication quality, network plan optimization, Non Terrestrial Network (NTN) and Terrestrial Network (TN), or combined, radio resource management and multi-antenna codebook selection, as well as signaling design, neighbor management, traffic management and beamforming. Information is generally transmitted by broadcast and unicast, and both ways are beneficial to fulfilling the above requests and make up an integral part of the 5G system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the number and complexity of system scenarios increases, more and more requests have been made on reducing interruption rate and latency, strengthening reliability and system stability, increasing the traffic flexibility and power conservation, and in the meantime the compatibility between different versions of systems shall be taken into account for system designing.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various communication scenarios, a user may be allocated multiple identifiers, and the functions of these identifiers may or may not be the same. For each conversation a user often needs only one identifier to determine the node, but it can also use a combination of different identifiers to do so, thus the network can verify the user information upon reception of the identifiers, acquire relevant context, and create a corresponding processing entity on the network side to ensure user security and reserve resources, as well as establish the data channel of the core network; besides, there is an issue of what kind of and which identifier is to be used for a user, because the usage relates to the processing of the above procedures and whether a user can be accessed to a system, and different identifiers imply different ways of processing. The selection of identifiers not only involves the processing strategy of the network, the principle of system design but also relates to the delay of user access to the system and communications, the amount of power consumption, as well as the utilization efficiency of resources and security, hence is a significant issue particularly when it comes to network slicing. The issue is more apparent for a user in an idle state or an inactive state, since in such states the user cannot establish links with the system for performing data transmissions and configuration updates, and the system has not allocated dedicated transmission resources for the user, but communications in these states play an important role in many aspects, like reducing the delay of the user and power consumption, therefore, an extra mechanism design is required for guaranteeing the user's communications. Another important feature of inactive communications is that the method of transmitting user data and the method of transmitting signaling have to be efficient, and secure, and the security is generally implemented by integrity protection, encryption and authentication, none of which is easy to realize for a user in an inactive or idle state, for that the transmissions of identifiers themselves are an exposure which is potentially risky to the user. Therefore, how to enhance security and reduce possible risks are very important to ordinary users, especially to IoT users.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To address the above problem, the present application provides a solution.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be noted that if no conflict is incurred, embodiments in any node in the present application and the characteristics of the embodiments are also applicable to any other node, and vice versa. What's more, the embodiments in the present application and the characteristics in the embodiments can be arbitrarily combined if there is no conflict. Besides, it should be noted that although the description above only takes IoT scenarios as an example of application scenario in the scheme proposed herein; the present application is also applicable to scenarios of non-terrestrial network scenarios, where similar technical effects can be achieved. Similarly, the present application also applies to scenarios where, for instance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or Vehicle-mounted equipment is provided, to achieve similar technical effects. Additionally, the adoption of a unified solution for various scenarios, including but not limited to NTN and TN scenarios, contributes to the reduction of hardcore complexity and costs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present application provides a method in a first node for wireless communications, comprising:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">receiving a first signaling; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">transmitting a first signal;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">herein, the first signaling is used to indicate a first identifier and a second identifier, the first identifier and the second identifier both being used to determine the first node; the first signal carries a target identifier, the target identifier being either the first identifier or the second identifier; when the target identifier is the first identifier, the first signal carries a first message; when the target identifier is the second identifier, the first signal carries a second message; a first logical channel is used for bearing the first message, while a second logical channel is used for bearing the second message, the first logical channel being different from the second logical channel, the first message and the second message coming from an Access Stratum; the first signal carries a first data block, the first data block being from a Non-Access Stratum; both a size of the first data block and a size of the first signal are used to determine the target identifier; the first node is in a Radio Resource Control (RRC) Inactive state when transmitting the first signal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the issue to be solved in the present application includes: when the first node is transmitting Non-Access Stratum (NAS) data in a Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactive state, it needs to transmit an identifier of the node at the same time.

the identifiers are used to determine the first node, and more importantly, are required to ensure the utilization efficiency and even security of resources. For example, when a user is performing uplink transmissions, data of the user need to be encapsulate into a fixed data block to facilitate detection of the base station, the inadequacy of detecting capability of the base station or uncertainty of the detection itself will result in some trouble in the signal reception, once the reception is failed, more of the power of the first node will be consumed and the system resources will be reused more frequently. Therefore, the size of the fixed data block is restricted, i.e., a limited number of types of data blocks with a fixed size, which leads to a result that a larger number of padding bits will occur when the size of a first signal transmitted by the first node does not match with the size of the data block, thus causing unneeded wastes of resources. In addition, the above identifiers being transmitted in a transparent mode is insecure, so, when performing retransmissions, new identifiers shall be reconsidered to increase security; in the meantime, these aspects shall be taken into account comprehensively, under various requirements of security, different strategies of selecting identifiers are developed to ensure security and enhance the efficiency of resource utilization. The present application combines the selection of identifiers with the size of data carried by the first signal and the size of the first signal, along with consideration of the influence of retransmission, thus enhancing the resource utilization ratio while guaranteeing the security.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Other features, objects and advantages of the present application will become more apparent from the detailed description of non-restrictive embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of receiving a first signaling and transmitting a first signal according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a network architecture according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a radio protocol architecture of a user plane and a control plane according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a first node and a second node according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of transmission according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of transmission according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of determining a size of a first signal according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a first identifier and a second identifier being used to determine a first node according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a size of a first data block and a size of a first signal both being used to determine a target identifier according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a target identifier being used to minimize a number of padding bits carried by a first signal according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a MAC PDU according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a structure block diagram of a processing device in a first node according to one embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a structure block diagram of a processing device in a second node according to one embodiment of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The technical scheme of the present application is described below in further details in conjunction with the drawings.
