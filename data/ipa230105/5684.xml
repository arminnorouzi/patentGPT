An example of one device commonly utilized to connect and disconnect circuits is a contactor, which is electrically connected to one or more devices or power sources. A contactor is configured such that it can interrupt or complete a circuit to control electrical power to and from a device. One type of conventional contactor is a hermetically sealed contactor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to contactors, which serve the purpose of connecting and disconnecting electrical circuits during normal operation of a device, various additional devices can be employed in order to provide overcurrent protection. These devices can prevent short circuits, overloading, and permanent damage to an electrical system or a connected electrical device. These devices include disconnect devices which can quickly break the circuit in a permanent way such that the circuit will remain broken until the disconnect device is repaired, replaced, or reset. One such type of disconnect device is a fuse. A conventional fuse is a type of low resistance conductor that acts as a sacrificial device. Typical fuses comprise a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, interrupting the circuit that it connects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As society advances, various innovations to electrical systems and electronic devices are becoming increasingly common. An example of such innovations includes recent advances in electrical automobiles, which may one day become the energy-efficient standard and replace traditional petroleum-powered vehicles. In such expensive and routinely used electrical devices, overcurrent protection is particularly applicable to prevent device malfunction and prevent permanent damage to the devices. Furthermore, overcurrent protection can prevent safety hazards, such as electrical fires. These modern improvements to electrical systems and devices require modern solutions to increase convenience and efficiency of mechanisms for triggering fuse devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein are passive triggering features and configurations for the activation of pyrotechnic features to function as a fuse mechanism within switching devices, such as contactors or fuse devices. These passive triggering configurations can be configured to trigger in response to a threshold level of current flowing through the switching device corresponding to a dangerous overcurrent. The different embodiments of the present invention are arranged to activate the pyrotechnic fuse mechanism during contact levitation and corresponding arcing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment of an electrical switching device according to the present invention comprises a housing with internal component with in the housing. The internal components comprise contacts configured to operate to change the state of the switching device from a closed state allowing current flow through the switching device to an open state which interrupts current flow through the switching device. A pyrotechnic feature is included that is configured to interact with the internal components to transition the switching device from the closed state to the open state when the pyrotechnic feature is activated. The pyrotechnic feature is configured to trigger in response to levitation between the contacts at elevated current signal flowing through the switching device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments according to the present invention can be arranged with a pyrotechnic initiator that is coupled directly to the switching device's high voltage terminals. When high current levitation occurs between the fixed and movable contacts, resistance between the fixed and movable contacts increases rapidly. This results in the current at the terminals to be directed down the path of least resistance, i.e. to the pyrotechnic initiator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other further features and advantages of the invention would be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, taken together with the accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals designate corresponding parts in the figures, in which:</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front sectional view of an embodiment of a contactor able to incorporate features of the present invention, shown in the &#x201c;closed&#x201d;

These embodiments set forth passive switching features and configurations for use with switching devices, such as contactors or fuse devices, integrating pyrotechnic circuit breaking features. These switching devices can be electrically connected to an electrical device or system to turn power to the connected device or system &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off.&#x201d; While the example devices disclosed herein can utilize active triggering configurations in addition to, or in lieu of, the disclosed passive features, the passive features provide the advantage of automatically triggering a pyrotechnic circuit break in response to a threshold current level.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the switching devices according to the present invention comprise an internal pyrotechnic charge coupled to a pyrotechnic activation or triggering mechanism. The pyrotechnic triggering mechanism can be coupled directly to the switching device's high voltage (fixed) contacts using known electrical coupling mechanisms. The pyrotechnic charge is configured to function as a fuse, permanently breaking the circuit through the contactor or fuse device, for example, by moving moveable contacts out of contact with fixed contacts.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described in detail below, the closing force between the fixed and movable contacts of the contactor can be overcome by a repulsive levitation force. This levitation force is generated by the current flowing through the contacts and can cause separation of the fixed and movable contacts during elevated current flow. When this separation begins, arcing can occur between the fixed and movable contacts. This arcing in turn causes a rapid increase of resistance between the fixed and movable contacts. The elevated current at the terminals then takes a path of least resistance to the pyrotechnic triggering device, which causes activation of the pyrotechnic charge. This in turn can cause permanent separation of the fixed and movable contacts.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is understood that the levitation arcing activated pyrotechnic actuator can be used in conjunction with other passive and active pyrotechnic activation circuits. In these embodiments, the switching devices can be arranged with a single pyrotechnic activation or triggering mechanism, that can be activated from different sources or circuits that activate a single pyrotechnic charge. Alternatively, multiple pyrotechnic triggering mechanisms can be included, each of which activates its own pyrotechnic charge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Throughout this description, the preferred embodiment and examples illustrated should be considered as exemplars, rather than as limitations on the present invention.

A plunger structure <b>111</b> is connected to, or at least partially surrounds, a portion of the shaft <b>110</b>. The body <b>102</b> also houses a solenoid <b>112</b>. Many different solenoids can be used, with one example of a suitable solenoid being a solenoid operating under a low voltage and with a relatively high force. One example of a suitable solenoid is commercially available solenoid Model No. SD1564 N1200, from Bicron Inc., although many other solenoids can be used. In the embodiment shown, the plunger structure <b>111</b> can comprise a metallic material that can be moved and controlled by the solenoid <b>112</b>. Movement of the plunger structure <b>111</b> controls movement of the connected shaft <b>110</b>, which in turn controls movement of the connected moveable contact <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The travel distance of the shaft <b>110</b> can be controlled utilizing various features, for example, springs to control travel/overtravel distance or various portions of the body <b>102</b> that can block or restrict the travel distance of the shaft <b>110</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the travel distance of the shaft <b>110</b> is partially controlled by a hard stop <b>113</b>, which is configured to abut against a winged portion <b>114</b> of the shaft <b>110</b>, to limit the distance of the shaft <b>110</b> when the shaft <b>110</b> has traveled a sufficient distance from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The hard stop <b>113</b> can comprise any material or shape suitable for providing a surface to interact with the shaft <b>110</b> in order to limit the movement or travel distance of the shaft <b>110</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hard stop <b>113</b> comprises a plastic material. In some embodiments, the hard stop <b>113</b> is configured to break or shear off when the pyrotechnic disconnect elements are triggered, as will be discussed in more detail further below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now that the basic switching features of the contactor device <b>110</b> have been set forth, the pyrotechnic disconnect elements will now be described. The contactor device <b>100</b> can comprise several elements that can function as overcurrent protection, including a pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> and a piston structure <b>204</b>. The piston structure <b>204</b> can be positioned near or at least partially around one or more of the internal components, for example, the shaft <b>110</b> as shown. Movement of the piston from a resting position can change the configuration of the internal components to interrupt flow of electricity through the device, for example, by pushing against or otherwise moving the shaft <b>100</b> as described herein. The pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> can be configured such that it is activated when current exceeds a predetermined threshold level, in order to prevent permanent damage to a connected electric device or a safety hazard such as an electrical fire.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The contactor device <b>100</b> can comprise various sensor features that can detect when current through the device has reached a dangerous level and can trigger the pyrotechnic charge when this threshold level has been detected. In some embodiments, the contactor device <b>100</b> can comprise a dedicated current sensor configured to detect the level of current flowing through the device. The current sensor can be configured to directly or indirectly activate the pyrotechnic charge when the current has reached a threshold level. In some embodiments, the current sensors can transmit a signal proportional to the detected current to activate the pyrotechnic charge when a threshold current level is detected. In some embodiments, the current sensors can comprise a Hall effect sensor, a transformer or current clamp meter, a resistor, a fiber optic current sensor, or an interferometer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> is configured to be activated by electrical pulse and is driven by an airbag system configured to detect multiple factors, similar to that utilized in modern vehicles. In some embodiments, the contactor device <b>100</b> can comprise one or more pyrotechnic pins <b>203</b> that can be configured to trigger the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> when the pyrotechnic pins <b>203</b> receive an activation signal. In some embodiments, the pyrotechnic charge can be connected to another feature that already monitors the flowing current. This other feature, for example, a battery management component, can then be configured to send a signal to activate the pyrotechnic charge when a threshold current level is detected.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> can be a single charge structure or a multiple charge structure. In some embodiments, the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> comprises a double charge structure comprising first an initiator charge and then a secondary gas generator charge. Many different types of pyrotechnic charges can be utilized provided the pyrotechnic charge used is sufficient to provide sufficient force to move the piston structure <b>204</b> to permanently break the circuit of the contactor device <b>100</b> as described herein. In some embodiments, the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> comprises zirconium potassium perchlorate, which has the advantage of being suitable for use as both an initiator charge and a gas generator charge. In some embodiments, the initiator charge comprises a fast-burning material such as zirconium potassium perchlorate, zirconium tungsten potassium perchlorate, titanium potassium perchlorate, zirconium hydride potassium perchlorate, or titanium hydride potassium perchlorate. In some embodiments, the gas generator charge comprises a slow-burning material such as boron potassium nitrate, or black powder.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> is activated, the resulting force causes the piston structure <b>204</b> to be driven away from its resting position near or around the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b>, which in turn causes the piston structure <b>204</b> to push against the shaft <b>110</b> and cause the shaft to be driven away from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The resulting force is also sufficient to break or shear off the hard stop <b>113</b>, causing the shaft <b>110</b> to be forced even further away from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, for example, being pushed into a separate internal compartment <b>206</b> of the body <b>102</b>. The piston structure <b>204</b> can comprise sufficient dimensions (e.g. shape, size, spatial orientation or other configuration) such that the piston structure <b>204</b> can hold the internal components in a position or configuration wherein electricity cannot flow through the contactor device. This is done, for example, by holding the shaft <b>110</b> in place further away from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, such as, by holding the shaft <b>110</b> such that it is substantially within the separate internal compartment <b>206</b> of the body <b>102</b>. This in turn causes the moveable contact <b>108</b>, which is connected to the shaft <b>110</b>, to be separated by an even larger spatial gap from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, causing the device to be in the &#x201c;triggered&#x201d; or permanent &#x201c;open&#x201d; configuration wherein electricity cannot flow through the device. In some embodiments, the piston structure <b>204</b> comprises sufficient dimensions such that once it is displaced by activation of the pyrotechnic features <b>202</b>, the piston structure <b>204</b> is forced into a position where it interacts with a portion of the body <b>102</b>, such that it cannot easily be moved.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to the rapidly created large spatial gap between the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and the moveable contact <b>108</b>, additional structures can be utilized. For example, in some embodiments, one or more arc blowout magnets <b>208</b> (two shown) can be utilized to further control electrical arcing. While the main method for interrupting current flow is to rapidly open the contacts to a much larger air gap as described herein, there can also be additional performance gained through a secondary gas blast directed at the arc, for example, through use of a gas generator charge.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, including the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, other optional design features can be included, which can help prevent hazards caused by the rapid buildup of gas resulting from the activation of the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b>. In these embodiments, the body <b>102</b> can be configured such that when the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> is activated, the piston structure <b>204</b> drives the shaft <b>110</b> with sufficient force to puncture a portion of the body <b>102</b>. This will allow the rapid buildup of gas to escape. This is achieved, in some embodiments, by a portion of the body <b>102</b> comprising a membrane that can be punctured during the pyrotechnic disconnect cycle, for example, by a sharp portion <b>210</b> of the shaft <b>110</b>, allowing gas to escape from a connected vent portion <b>212</b> of the body <b>102</b>, which can be a high temperature filter membrane. The high temperature gas can then pass out of the body <b>102</b>. The pressure release may cool the electrical arc and improve performance as well as prevent the contactor housing from rupturing.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The differences between breaking the circuit of electrical flow through the contactor device <b>100</b> during normal switching operation and the permanent breaking of the circuit of electrical flow through the contactor device <b>100</b> when the device is in its &#x201c;triggered&#x201d; state is better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref> show the contactor device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, but in different orientations.

The contactor device <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is still in the &#x201c;set&#x201d; position without the pyrotechnic features being activated. The disconnection spatial gap <b>302</b> causes the moveable contact <b>108</b> to be spaced a sufficient distance from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, which are otherwise electrically isolated from one another, to interrupt flow of electricity through the device. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the contactor device <b>100</b> in its triggered stated when the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> has been activated, causing the piston structure <b>204</b> to force the shaft <b>110</b> and moveable contact <b>108</b>, in a direction further away from the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. This rapidly creates a larger circuit break spatial gap <b>350</b> between the fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and the moveable contact <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The resulting force from the activation of the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b>, and the resulting sudden movement of the piston structure <b>204</b> and the shaft <b>110</b>, is sufficient to break or shear off the hard stop <b>113</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to be displaced from its original position connected to the body <b>113</b>. The hard stop <b>113</b> can comprise a sturdy material that is connected or integrated with the body <b>102</b>, such that it functions as a stop for the shaft <b>110</b> during normal device operation between &#x201c;closed&#x201d; and &#x201c;open&#x201d; circuit states. However, during operation of the pyrotechnic disconnect features, the hard stop <b>113</b> can be intentionally designed to &#x201c;fail&#x201d; as a stop structure and break or shear off to allow the shaft <b>110</b> to proceed into the separate body compartment <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the piston structure <b>204</b> can be configured such that it can interact with a piston-stop portion <b>352</b> of the body <b>102</b> after the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> has been activated. This can be done, for example, by interacting with a position of the piston structure <b>204</b>, for example, a portion of the piston-stop portion <b>352</b> configured to interact or mate with another portion on the piston structure <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the piston structure <b>204</b> will not be in a position to come into contact with the piston-stop portion <b>352</b> until after the piston structure <b>204</b> has been displaced by activation of the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b>. This causes the piston structure <b>204</b> to be held between the piston-stop portion <b>352</b> and the moveable contact <b>108</b>, when the pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> has been activated and the piston structure <b>204</b> has been forced from its resting position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this configuration places the piston structure <b>204</b> in a position, which holds or locks the piston structure <b>204</b> against the moveable contact <b>108</b>.

The PCB <b>400</b> can be a PCB designed to accommodate pyrotechnic trigging configurations incorporating features of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the PCB <b>400</b> is shown located near the top portion of the contactor device <b>100</b>; however, it is understood that the PCB <b>400</b> can be located in or on any portion of the contactor device <b>100</b> and can be internal to the contactor device <b>100</b> or external to the contactor device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Aside from contactor devices, which can operate to restrict or allow electrical flow through the device during ordinary operation, another type of switching device that can serve as an example environment for use with the passive pyrotechnic triggering configurations are fuse devices. Fuse devices only allow electrical flow through the device during ordinary operation and function as a sacrificial circuit break when a threshold current level passes through the device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> show such an example fuse device <b>430</b>, which comprises similar features, and operates similarly to the contactor device <b>100</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, however, without comprising some of the features, such as a solenoid or other mechanism for opening and closing the fixed and moveable contacts. During ordinary operation, the fuse device <b>430</b> is constantly in a &#x201c;closed&#x201d; state allowing current flow through the device, until the pyrotechnic features are activated, resulting in the device being in an &#x201c;open&#x201d; state thereafter, preventing current flow through the device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> show a body <b>432</b> (similar to the body <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above), fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> (similar to fixed contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above). However, in this embodiment, the fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> are formed separately from the power terminals <b>438</b>, <b>440</b>, which are electrically connected to the fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> for connection to external circuitry, the power terminals and fixed contacts being one-in-the-same in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> further show moveable contacts <b>442</b> (similar to moveable contact <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above), a shaft structure <b>444</b> (similar to the shaft structure <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above, except shaped differently).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The shaft structure <b>444</b> is connected to the moveable contact <b>442</b> and the piston structure <b>446</b> (which is similar to the piston structure <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above). The piston structure <b>446</b> can at least partially surround a pyrotechnic charge <b>448</b>, such that when the pyrotechnic charge <b>448</b> is activated the moveable contact <b>442</b> and the piston structure <b>446</b> are forced in a direction away from the fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b>, therefore breaking the circuits. In some embodiments, the fuse device <b>430</b> can comprise a support structure <b>450</b> configured to help hold the fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and the moveable contacts <b>442</b> in place. In some embodiments, triggering of the pyrotechnic charge <b>448</b> causes the piston structure <b>446</b> to be driven away from the pyrotechnic charge with such force that the support structure <b>450</b> is broken or displaced. In some embodiments, the fuse device <b>430</b> can be triggered by active signals. In some embodiments, the fuse device <b>430</b> can be triggered by passive triggering configurations, such as those discussed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the fuse device <b>430</b> in its &#x201c;closed&#x201d; state, wherein the fixed contacts <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and the moveable contacts <b>442</b> are together and electrical flow through the device <b>430</b> is permitted.

In the following embodiments described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the pyrotechnic triggering configurations will be described with reference to being applied to the contactor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. However, it is understood that the pyrotechnic triggering configurations described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref> can be applied as triggering devices in any switching mechanism incorporating pyrotechnic features including, for example, the fuse device described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> comprising a PCB <b>502</b> (traces not shown), similar to PCB <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, electrical power terminals <b>504</b>, similar to the fixed contact structures <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, and a passive trigger switch <b>506</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> further shows the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> integrated with an electrical device <b>503</b>, comprising a body <b>508</b>, which can be similar to the body <b>102</b>, containing internal components therein. The pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is shown without a top &#x201c;cap&#x201d; portion of the body so that the PCB <b>502</b> is viewable and exposed, however, it is understood that in normal device operation, features such as a closed body including a cap and epoxy material can be included. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> also shows pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b> that are similar to pyrotechnic pins <b>203</b> in FIGS, <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. Coil pins <b>512</b> are included which allow for electrical connection to an internal coil or solenoid, for example, similar to solenoid <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. A tubulation structure <b>514</b> is also included which can facilitate formation of an internal hermetic seal or management of electronegative gases within the electrical device <b>503</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation of the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when a pre-determined level of current passes through the device <b>503</b>, for example, a level of current denoting a dangerous level of current that can result in permanent damage to a device or creation of a hazard such as a fire, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> will activate. This in turn completes a circuit to transmit a signal to the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b>, thereby activating an internal pyrotechnic element, for example, such as pyrotechnic charge <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. In these embodiments, the PCB <b>502</b> can be configured such that it directs a triggering signal to the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b>, which are in electrical communication with pyrotechnic features internal to the device <b>503</b>. The electrical pathway for this triggering signal can be dependent on closing or activating the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>, such that when the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> is open or un-triggered (in a resting state) the electrical pathway for the triggering signal to the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b> is obstructed. Likewise, when the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> is closed or activated, the triggering signal can be directed toward the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b> and trigger the internal pyrotechnic feature.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The passive trigger switch <b>506</b> can be connected to a sensor that is configured to detect when a predetermined level of current passes through the device <b>503</b>, the sensor signals the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> to trigger. In some embodiments, it is the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> itself that is configured detect or passively respond and trigger when the current flowing through the device <b>503</b> reaches a pre-determined level. For example, in some embodiments, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> comprises a switch configured to react to a magnetic field generated by current flowing through the electrical power terminals <b>504</b> of the device <b>503</b> or from the flow of current through a region of the device <b>503</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> is a reed switch or other switching mechanism configured to activate in response to the generation of a magnetic field of sufficient strength. Different configurations can be utilized with a reed switch. For example, the reed switch can be configured such that the contacts are open when resting, closing when a sufficient magnetic field is present, or closed when resting, opening when a sufficient magnetic field is present. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the reed switch can be organized into a reed relay and be actuated by a magnetic coil. In most embodiments incorporating a reed switch herein, the reed switch is configured such that the contacts are open when resting, preventing an electrical signal from traveling to the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b> and activating the pyrotechnic features until a sufficient magnetic field corresponding to a dangerous current level closes the reed switch.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some of the embodiments, the PCB <b>502</b> comprises a plurality of passive trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b>, which allow the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> to be adjusted according to desired trip current. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b>, PCB <b>502</b>, the electrical device <b>503</b>, the electrical power terminals <b>504</b>, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>, the body <b>508</b>, the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b>, the coil pins <b>512</b>, the tubulation structure <b>514</b>, and the trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the desired trip current can be adjusted by mounting the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> to a different one of the trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b>, which in turn adjusts the trip distance <b>518</b> between the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> and one or more of the electrical power terminals <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">By adjusting the trip distance <b>518</b> between the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> and one or more of the power terminals <b>504</b>, the amount of current flowing through the device <b>503</b> that is required to activate the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>, and therefore trigger the device's internal pyrotechnic features, can be adjusted. For example, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> can comprise a reed switch that is configured to activate when a pre-determined magnetic field is generated due to a pre-determined level of current flowing through the power terminals <b>504</b>. The strength of the magnetic field needed to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>, and therefore the level of corresponding current flowing through he device required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>, can be adjusted by simply changing the trip distance <b>518</b> between the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> and the power terminals <b>504</b>. In the embodiment shown, this can be accomplished by mounting the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> to a different passive trigger switch mounting feature <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">By moving the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> farther from the power terminal <b>504</b>, a greater magnetic field, and therefore a greater current, would be required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> and therefore trigger the pyrotechnic features of the device <b>503</b>. This can provide a pre-designed switching device with a pre-designed PCB so that the device can be mass manufactured, while allowing for different trip currents based upon placement of the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> at a different one of the passive trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b>. For example, the passive trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b> can be on locations of the PCB <b>502</b> corresponding to different levels of magnetic field strength, which in turn can correspond to different levels of desired trip current. A company can manufacture one PCB configuration and can place the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> at different passive trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b> to create devices that will trip at different currents. In embodiments utilizing a coil or solenoid, for example as with contactors, the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> can be configured to turn off power to the coil. In these embodiments, this configuration can decrease the time it takes for the pyrotechnic features to open the contacts as it will not have to resist the coil.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In other embodiments, additional features can be included in lieu of, or in addition to, the trigger switch mounting features <b>516</b> in order to further interact with the passive trigger switch <b>506</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a device <b>602</b> having a pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>600</b> similar to pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. The device <b>603</b> include a PCB <b>602</b> (similar to the PCB <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), an electrical device <b>603</b> (similar to the electrical device <b>503</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and electrical power terminals <b>604</b> (similar to electrical power terminals <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The device <b>603</b> further comprises a passive trigger switch <b>606</b> (similar to the passive trigger switch <b>506</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), a body <b>608</b> (similar to the body <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), pyrotechnic pins <b>610</b> (similar to the pyrotechnic pins <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), coil pins <b>612</b> (similar to coil pins <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and a tubulation structure <b>614</b> (similar to the tubulation structure <b>514</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Although similar embodiments could include trigger switch mounting features, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> does not include trigger switch mounting features. Instead, the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>600</b> includes a core structure <b>630</b> that contributes to determining the targeted trip current of the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The core structure <b>630</b> can comprise any known material that can channel, direct, or control a magnetic field generated by current flowing through the device <b>603</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the core structure <b>630</b> comprises metal. In some embodiments, the core structure <b>630</b> comprises iron, a ferrous alloy or another ferrous material. In some embodiments, the core structure <b>630</b> is magnetic. The core structure <b>630</b> can comprise any suitable shape or configuration that produces the desired magnetic field characteristics, including any regular or irregular polygon or a custom shape. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the core structure <b>630</b> comprises a curved strip-shape. The core structure <b>630</b> can be configured in any spatial position in relation to the device <b>603</b> and the PCB <b>602</b> to facilitate interaction between a generated magnetic field and the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the core structure <b>630</b> at least partially surrounds one of the electrical power terminals <b>604</b> and is adjacent to the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The magnetic field generated from the core structure <b>630</b> can more significant than that of the power terminal itself, and the desired trigger current can be controlled by adjusting the distance between a portion of the core structure <b>630</b> and the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>, rather than from the power terminal <b>604</b> and the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>600</b>, the PCB <b>602</b>, the electrical device <b>603</b>, the electrical power terminals <b>604</b>, the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>, the body <b>608</b>, the pyrotechnic pins <b>610</b>, the coil pins <b>612</b>, the tubulation structure <b>614</b>, and the core structure <b>630</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> further shows the trip distance <b>636</b> between the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> and the core structure <b>630</b>. Like with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> can comprise a reed switch, or other passive mechanism, that is configured to activate when a pre-determined magnetic field is generated due to a pre-determined level of current flowing through the power terminal <b>604</b> and/or the core structure <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The strength of the magnetic field needed to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>, and therefore the level of corresponding current flowing through the device required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>606</b>, can be adjusted by simply changing the trip distance <b>636</b> between the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> and a portion of the core structure <b>630</b>. By moving the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> farther from the core structure <b>630</b>, a greater magnetic field, and therefore a greater current, would be required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>606</b> and therefore trigger the pyrotechnic features of the device <b>603</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, in lieu of or in addition to trigger switch mounting features <b>606</b> or a core structure <b>630</b>, an external triggering mechanism can be utilized. In some embodiments, this external triggering mechanism can replace the need for a PCB, although in other embodiments, the external triggering mechanism can be utilized in addition to a PCB. An example embodiment, wherein an external triggering mechanism replaces the need for a PCB is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>700</b> (similar to pyrotechnic triggering configuration <b>600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).

The conductive bus bar <b>732</b> can be configured to allow current to flow to the pyrotechnic pins <b>710</b> and therefore to trigger the internal pyrotechnic features of the device <b>703</b>. The passive trigger switch <b>706</b>, similar to the passive trigger switches in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, is configured in an open state, that does not allow electrical current to pass though the conductive bus bar <b>732</b> and therefore to allow triggering of the pyrotechnic features.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the current from the device <b>703</b> reaches a threshold level, a sufficient magnetic field is generated to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>706</b>.

By increasing the thickness of the non-magnetic spacer portion <b>734</b>, and therefore moving the passive trigger switch <b>706</b> farther from the conductive bus structure <b>732</b>, a greater magnetic field, and therefore a greater current, would be required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>706</b> and therefore trigger the pyrotechnic features of the device <b>703</b>. Likewise, by moving the passive trigger switch <b>706</b> closer to the conductive bus structure <b>732</b>, a lesser magnetic field, and therefore lesser current, would be required to trigger the passive trigger switch <b>706</b> and therefore trigger the pyrotechnic features of the device <b>703</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">It is understood that the different pyrotechnic passive switching circuits can be arranged in many different ways according to the present invention. FIG. shows a simplified schematic of one embodiment of pyrotechnic passive switching circuit <b>800</b> according to the present invention. The circuit <b>800</b> generally comprises an operating power circuit <b>802</b> that comprises the standard operating power source <b>804</b> coupled to an operating load <b>806</b> that is energized and powered by the power source <b>802</b>. A contactor or fuse <b>808</b> is arranged in the circuit <b>800</b> to break the electrical connection between the power source <b>804</b> and the load when dangerous current flows in the circuit <b>802</b>. It is understood that the fuse <b>808</b> can also be included with features to operate as a contactor to disconnect the power source <b>804</b> from the load during normal operating conditions. It is also understood that fuse <b>808</b> can comprise a contactor where the passive switching circuit <b>800</b> operates to change the condition of the contactor to break the circuit path as described above.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">A pyrotechnic activation circuit <b>810</b> can be included that is arranged to work with the operating power circuit <b>802</b> to protect against overcurrent conditions. The circuit <b>810</b> comprises a pyrotechnic actuator/activator <b>812</b> as described above, that is arranged to change the condition of the fuse <b>808</b> when activated. The circuit also includes an overcurrent actuated pyrotechnic fuse trigger <b>814</b> that is arranged adjacent to the circuit <b>802</b> in a position that permits it to sense an overcurrent condition in the circuit <b>802</b>. In the embodiment shown, the trigger <b>814</b> can comprise a reed switch, but it is understood that many different alternative devices can be used. The trigger <b>814</b> can be placed in many different locations in relation to the circuit <b>802</b>, such as adjacent a power terminal as described above, or adjacent other conductors in the circuit carrying operating current. The circuit <b>810</b> can also comprise a secondary power source <b>816</b> that can be coupled to the pyrotechnic actuator <b>812</b> when the fuse trigger is closed in response to elevated current levels.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">During operation, the fuse <b>808</b> is closed, allowing the operating power source power <b>804</b> to power the load <b>806</b>. When normal current levels flow through the circuit <b>802</b>, the trigger <b>814</b> remains open and secondary power source <b>816</b> is disconnected from the pyrotechnic actuator <b>812</b>. When currents above a certain level (dangerously high levels) flow through the circuit <b>802</b>, the trigger <b>814</b> closes in response to the elevated magnetic field. This connects the secondary power source to the pyrotechnic actuator <b>812</b>, causing it to actuate and break the fuse <b>808</b>. This in turn disconnects the operating power source <b>804</b> from the load <b>806</b>, to break the conductive path for the elevated current in the circuit <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">It is understood that other circuits according to the present invention can be arranged in many different ways with many different devices and elements. Many different secondary power sources can be used, with some embodiments using an integrated battery or capacitor circuit storing a charge sufficient to initiate the pyrotechnic actuator <b>812</b>. In other embodiments the secondary power source can comprise an on-board low voltage power that is still sufficient to initiate the pyrotechnic actuator <b>812</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows another embodiment of a pyrotechnic passive switching circuit <b>900</b> according to the present invention that contains many of the same features as the switching circuit <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The circuit <b>900</b> comprises an operating power circuit <b>902</b> that comprises the standard operating power source <b>904</b> coupled to an operating load <b>906</b>. A contactor or fuse <b>908</b> is arranged in the circuit <b>900</b> to break the electrical connection between the power source <b>904</b> and the load <b>906</b> when dangerous current flows in the circuit <b>902</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The circuit <b>900</b> includes pyrotechnic actuator/activator <b>912</b> and an overcurrent actuated pyrotechnic fuse trigger <b>914</b> similar to those described above. However, in the circuit <b>900</b> these elements are not arranged in a separate pyrotechnic activation circuit working with a secondary power source to initiate the pyrotechnic actuator <b>912</b>. Instead, these elements are integrated with operating power circuit <b>902</b> with the trigger <b>914</b> arranged to sense elevated currents in the circuit <b>902</b> and also coupled to the circuit <b>902</b> at a conductor carrying the elevated current. In the embodiment shown, the trigger <b>914</b> is coupled to the circuit conductors in parallel with the fuse <b>908</b>, but it is understood that it can be arranged in other ways.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">During normal operation, the trigger <b>914</b> is open and power from the power source <b>904</b> is conducted to the load <b>906</b>, through the fuse <b>908</b>. When the trigger <b>914</b> senses elevated current, it closes and the elevated current passes through the trigger <b>914</b> to the pyrotechnic actuator <b>912</b>, initiating the actuator and breaking the fuse <b>908</b>. This breaks the normal conduction path between the power source <b>904</b> and load <b>908</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The trigger <b>914</b> is also arranged such that the elevated current from the power source <b>904</b> quickly ruptures or otherwise destroys the trigger <b>914</b>, thereby breaking the current path through the trigger <b>914</b>. The trigger <b>914</b> carries the current long enough to activate the actuator, but is destroyed shortly thereafter. This results in the power source <b>904</b> being electrically isolated from the load <b>906</b> and any elevated current path being broken. It is understood that the trigger <b>914</b> and actuator <b>912</b> can have elements that contain them during rupture or initiation, such as an encasing material like epoxy.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">It is also understood that the elements of the circuits according to the present invention can be coupled together using many different electrical conductors. This can include conductive paths on a printed circuit board, or wires. It is also understood that the circuits described above can be arranged on and integral to the contactor or fuse, to provide an easy to use and compact device. The circuit <b>900</b> can provide certain advantages, such as not requiring a separate secondary power source to activate the pyrotechnic actuator <b>912</b>. This can result in a simplified and less expensive device.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Different embodiments of the present invention can initiate the pyrotechnic charge using many different active and passive circuits and elements. Some alternative arrangements according to the present invention can rely on contact levitation and related arcing to passively trigger the pyrotechnic charge. Contact levitation can occur when the moveable contact separates from the fixed contacts due to the electromagnetic forces generated during elevated current flow through the contacts during operation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Although the inventors do not want to be limited to any one theory of operation, is it is understood that there can be at least three factors that result in levitation between the contacts. The first is current constriction, the second is due to parallel conductors with current flow in opposing directions, and the third is current flow perpendicular to the field of the arc suppression magnets. It understood that moving charges create their own magnetic fields, with current carrying conductors capable of enacting forces on one another. Parallel currents in conductors can cause magnetic fields that result in an attraction between the conductors. Antiparallel currents can create magnetic fields that cause repulsion between the conductors. Levitation occurs as the result of the magnetic field generated by a current in the switching device's internal contacts.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>16</b></figref> are schematic representations of features of a switching device <b>950</b> showing these three levitation factors. The switching device <b>950</b> comprises a stationary contact <b>952</b> and a movable contact <b>954</b>, with operation of the switching device resulting from movement of the movable contact <b>954</b> between contacting the stationary contact <b>952</b>, and moving (e.g. down) out of contact with the stationary contact <b>952</b>. The movable contact <b>954</b> has a holding force <b>956</b> when it is in contact with the stationary contact <b>952</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The first and second factors (current constriction and parallel conductors) can be influenced by the geometry of the stationary and movable contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b>. In the embodiment shown, some of the relevant geometric features comprise the length of the contact bend A, the contact thickness B, the contact bend spacing C, and the contact width D.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Current constriction relates to the repulsive forces that can be generated between the contacts by currents conducting between the two contacts across less than the entire contact surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a schematic representation the contact area between the stationary contact <b>952</b> and the movable contact <b>954</b>, with interface <b>970</b> between the two. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> also shows interface <b>970</b> from a top view. When conducting electricity between the stationary and movable contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b>, current does conduct equally across the contact surface at the interface <b>970</b> between the two. Instead, current is typically restricted to small regions <b>972</b> (i.e. current constriction) at the contact interface <b>970</b>. This causes the current flowing through the contacts to change direction toward the region <b>972</b>. This in turn creates first and second current vectors <b>974</b> and <b>976</b> in the opposing contacts that have a component that is substantially parallel to the interface <b>970</b>. The parallel components are in opposite directions creating magnetic fields that are opposite to one another. This in turn creates a repulsive force between the contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As the current flowing through the contacts increases, this repulsive force can also increase, and the repulsive acts on the contacts in a direction against the contact holding force <b>956</b>. This repulsive force can be significant at higher currents, and levitation between the contacts can occur when this repulsive force exceeds the force <b>956</b> between the contacts. This levitation force in turn can cause the movable contact <b>954</b> to separate from the stationary contact <b>952</b> against the contact holding force <b>956</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the current flowing through the contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b> can similarly cause a repulsive force between the two. The current flow <b>958</b> during operation conduct through the stationary contact <b>952</b> and the movable contact <b>954</b>. The stationary contact bend <b>966</b> has a length A where current is flowing in the opposite direction to the current <b>958</b> flowing in the movable contact <b>954</b>. This also creates opposing magnetic fields that creates a repulsive force between the contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b>. This repulsive force can also increase as the current <b>958</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The positioning of the arc suppression magnets can also contribute to levitation. Some embodiments of a switching device can comprise arc magnets that can be positioned such that arcs between stationary and movable contacts are pushed outward. This magnet configuration can result in unidirectional break performance with the contacts. The orientation of the magnets can also result in the movable contact being forced downward in opposition to the closing force between the contacts. Electrons moving through a magnetic field can be moved in a particular direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a further repulsive force <b>964</b> between the contacts <b>952</b>, <b>954</b> can be created by the interaction of the perpendicular magnetic field of the arc magnets and the electrons in the current <b>958</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Arcing can occur between the fixed and movable contacts when levitation causes separation of the fixed and moveable contacts. Some of the variables used to determine the current at which the levitation force begins to open (or separate) the contacts are the contact closing force, adjacent parallel geometry of the stationary contact and movable contact, and arc magnets.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the embodiments described above, different systems and methods for triggering or initiating the pyrotechnic actuator are disclosed, which rely on externally powered triggering or integrated triggering of the pyrotechnic actuator and charge. In some of these embodiments, devices such as reed switches are used, which can close in response to an elevated contact current, in turn can close one of a variety of power sources to the pyrotechnic actuator. In these embodiments, the reed switch (or switching device) can be calibrated to close when the predetermined trip current threshold is surpassed. In the present embodiments, levitation arcing can be used to initiate the pyrotechnic actuator or charge, without the need for additional elements such as a reed switch.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows another embodiment of a pyrotechnic passive switching circuit <b>1100</b> according to the present invention that relies on the levitation arcing to trigger the pyrotechnic actuator. Like the circuits above, the circuit <b>1100</b> comprises an operating power circuit <b>1102</b> that comprises the standard operating power source <b>1104</b> coupled to an operating load <b>1106</b>. A pyrotechnic activated fuse <b>1108</b> is arranged in the circuit <b>1100</b> and uses a pyrotechnic charge to break the electrical connection <b>1110</b> between the power source <b>1104</b> and the load <b>1106</b> when dangerously high current flows in the circuit <b>1102</b>. This can be accomplished as described above by the pyrotechnic charge separating the contacts in the contactor.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Unlike the embodiments above, the circuit <b>1100</b> does not have an overcurrent actuated pyrotechnic fuse trigger, such as a reed switch. Instead, the initiator pins for the pyrotechnic fuse (or device) are connected directly across the contactor high voltage terminals. As current levels through the contactor's fixed contacts (i.e. through the high voltage terminals) rise above a threshold or &#x201c;trip current&#x201d;, levitation force overcomes the contact force between the stationary and movable contacts. This causes separation between the fixed and movable contacts, and levitation arcing occurs between the two. During arcing the resistance increases rapidly between the high voltage terminals and the movable contacts. This causes the current to pass through the initiator path <b>1112</b>, because it becomes the path of least resistance. The pyro charge in the pyro activated fuse <b>1108</b> ignites, rapidly producing heat and pressure. This forces the contact's internal plunger through the barrel and onto the movable contact as described in the embodiments above. The movable contact rapidly separates from the stationary contact, and arc magnets can be included to stretch and cool the arc, as described above.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">It is understood that although the pyrotechnic fuse/device is described above as being connected directly to the high voltage terminals, in other embodiments intervening devices and features can be included. This can include, for example, different electronic or sensing features that can be arranged in many different ways in or on the switching devices according to the present invention. This also includes some embodiments that can be arranged on a printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">It is also understood that different contactor embodiments can have multiple pyrotechnic triggering mechanisms. For example, in some embodiments it may be desirable to have both active and passive triggering features for a contactor. This can be arranged by either having two triggering circuits to the same pyro initiator and charge, or by including two different initiators and charges. In embodiments with multiple initiators, the first initiator can be connected to the high voltage terminals as described above for activation by levitation arcing. The second initiator can be connected to contactor's output pins for coupling to the desired active triggering circuit. The two initiators and their triggering circuits can be electrically isolated from one another.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows another embodiment of a pyrotechnic switching circuit <b>1200</b> according to the present invention including both active and passive triggering circuits.

First and second pyrotechnic initiators <b>1208</b>, <b>1214</b> are arranged in the circuit <b>1200</b> to break the electrical connection between the power source <b>1204</b> and the load <b>1206</b> when dangerous current flows in the power circuit <b>1202</b>. In this embodiment, one of the initiators <b>1208</b> is passive (automatically actuated at elevated current), while other <b>1210</b> can be manually actuated by a signal from the user or from the system.
