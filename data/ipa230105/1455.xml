A substrate cleaning device is used to clean a substrate.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, a substrate cleaning device described in JP 5904169 B2 includes two suction pads for holding a back-surface peripheral portion of a wafer, a spin chuck for holding a back-surface center portion of the wafer and a brush for cleaning the back surface of the wafer. The two suction pads hold the wafer and move in a transverse direction. In this state, the back-surface center portion of the wafer is cleaned by the brush. Thereafter, the spin chuck receives the wafer from the suction pads. Further, the spin chuck rotates while holding the back-surface center portion of the wafer. In this state, the back-surface peripheral portion of the wafer is cleaned by the brush.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a substrate cleaning device described in JP 5904169 B2, the back surface of a wafer is dried by an air knife when the wafer is received from and transferred to a spin chuck, so that the surface of the spin chuck and the back surface of the wafer come into contact with each other while being dry. However, it is not easy to sufficiently prevent the cleaning liquid from adhering to the surface of the spin chuck. When the contaminated cleaning liquid adheres to the surface of the spin chuck, the cleanliness of the spin chuck is degraded. Therefore, it is required to keep the spin chuck clean.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a substrate cleaning device and a substrate cleaning method that enable maintenance of a holder of a substrate clean.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(1) A substrate cleaning device according to a first invention includes a first holder that has a reference position and holds a substrate such that a center of the substrate is located at the reference position, a second holder that is configured to be rotatable about a vertical axis and holds a lower-surface center region of the substrate, a cleaner that cleans the lower-surface center region by coming into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate held by the first holder and cleans a lower-surface outer region by coming into contact with the lower-surface outer region surrounding the lower-surface center region of the substrate rotated by the second holder, and a mobile base that is provided with the second holder and the cleaner, moves in a horizontal plane such that the second holder overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in a plan view when the substrate is received and transferred between the first holder and the second holder, and moves in a horizontal plane such that the cleaner overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in the plan view when the lower-surface center region is cleaned, wherein the second holder rotates while not holding the substrate during cleaning of the lower-surface center region.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the substrate cleaning device according to this invention, the cleaner comes into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate with the substrate being held by the first holder such that the center of the substrate is located at the reference position during cleaning of the lower-surface center region of the substrate. Further, the second holder is rotated about the vertical axis while not holding the substrate. During cleaning of the lower-surface outer region of the substrate, the cleaner comes into contact with the lower-surface outer region of the substrate with the substrate rotated about a vertical axis while the lower-surface center region of the substrate is held by the second holder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The second holder and the cleaner are provided at the mobile base. When the substrate is received and transferred between the first holder and the second holder, the mobile base is moved in a horizontal plane such that the second holder overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in a plan view. During cleaning of the lower-surface center region, the mobile base is moved in a horizontal plane such that the cleaner overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in a plan view.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With this configuration, during cleaning of the lower-surface center region of the substrate, the second holder is retreated to a position not overlapping with the substrate. Further, even in a case in which the liquid that includes contaminants and has splashed from the substrate adheres to the second holder, the liquid is shaken off from the second holder by the rotation of the second holder. Thus, the second holder can be kept clean.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(2) The substrate cleaning device may further include a gas injector that is arranged between the cleaner and the second holder and injects gas toward the substrate. In this case, it is possible to prevent the liquid including contaminants from being splashed from the substrate toward the second holder using the gas injected from the gas injector during cleaning of the lower-surface center region. Further, the lower-surface center region can be efficiently dried by the gas injected from the gas injector. Thus, the liquid can be prevented from adhering to the second holder, and the second holder can be kept clean.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(3) The substrate cleaning device may further include a linear guide that extends in one direction in the horizontal plane, wherein the mobile base may move linearly along the linear guide. In this case, the mobile base can be moved in a horizontal plane with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(4) A rotation speed of the second holder during cleaning of the lower-surface center region may be equal to or higher than 500 rpm. In this case, the liquid adhering to the second holder is shaken off from the second holder in a short period of time. Thus, the second holder can be kept clean more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(5) A substrate cleaning device according to a second invention includes a first holder that holds a substrate, a second holder that rotates the substrate about a vertical axis while holding a lower-surface center region of the substrate, a cleaner that cleans the lower-surface center region by coming into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate held by the first holder and cleans a lower-surface outer region by coming into contact with the lower-surface outer region surrounding the lower-surface center region of the substrate rotated by the second holder, and a gas injector that is arranged to be movable upwardly and downwardly between the cleaner and the second holder, injects gas toward the substrate from a first height spaced apart from the substrate by a predetermined distance during cleaning of the lower-surface center region and injects gas toward the substrate from a second height closer to the substrate than the first height during drying of the lower-surface center region.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this substrate cleaning device, when the lower-surface center region of the substrate is cleaned, the cleaner comes into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate with the substrate held by the first holder.

During drying of the lower-surface center region, the gas injector injects gas toward the substrate from a second height closer to the substrate than the first height.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With this configuration, during cleaning of the lower-surface center region, the gas injected from the gas injector prevents the liquid including contaminants from being splashed from the substrate toward the second holder.

Thus, the second holder can be kept clean more reliably.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(7) The substrate cleaning device may further include a common supporter that supports the cleaner and the gas injector. In this case, the cleaner and the gas injector are moved integrally in accordance with the position of the substrate. Thus, the lower surface of the substrate can be cleaned efficiently. Further, because the gas injector is provided to be movable upwardly and downwardly, even in a case in which the cleaner and the gas injector are supported by the common supporter, the gas injector can be close to the substrate when the lower-surface center region of the substrate is dried as compared to the time when the lower-surface center region of the substrate is cleaned.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the lower surface of the substrate can be dried efficiently.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(8) A substrate cleaning method according to a third invention includes holding a substrate using a first holder such that a center of the substrate is located at a reference position during cleaning of a lower-surface center region of the substrate, rotating a second holder about a vertical axis while not holding the substrate during cleaning of the lower-surface center region, causing a cleaner to come into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate held by the first holder during cleaning of the lower-surface center region, rotating the substrate about a vertical axis while holding the lower-surface center region of the substrate using the second holder during cleaning of a lower-surface outer region surrounding the lower-surface center region of the substrate, causing the cleaner to come into contact with the lower-surface outer region of the substrate rotated by the second holder during cleaning of the lower-surface outer region, and moving a mobile base provided with the second holder and the cleaner in a horizontal plane such that the second holder overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in a plan view when the substrate is received and transferred between the first holder and the second holder, and moving the mobile base such that the cleaner overlaps with the reference position of the first holder in the plan view during cleaning of the lower-surface center region.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With this substrate cleaning method, during cleaning of the lower-surface center region of the substrate, the second holder is retreated to a position not overlapping with the substrate.

Further, because the gas injector is provided to be movable upwardly and downwardly, even in a case in which the cleaner and the gas injector are supported by the common supporter, the gas injector can be close to the substrate when the lower-surface center region of the substrate is dried as compared to the time when the lower-surface center region of the substrate is cleaned. Thus, the lower surface of the substrate can be dried efficiently.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other features, elements, characteristics, and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments of the present disclosure with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic plan view of a substrate cleaning device according to one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an external perspective view showing the inner configuration of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a control system of the substrate cleaning device;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining the schematic operation of the substrate cleaning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a substrate cleaning process performed by the control device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the substrate cleaning process performed by the control device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A substrate cleaning device according to embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.

In this state, the lower-surface brush <b>51</b> comes into contact with the lower-surface center region of the substrate W. At this time, the suction holder <b>21</b> is rotated about the vertical axis while not holding the substrate W.
