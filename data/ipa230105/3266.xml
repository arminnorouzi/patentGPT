id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A position detection device includes a magnetic detection element that is positioned radially outside a first clutch component portion and a second clutch component portion of a dog clutch around an axis. The magnetic detection element is provided between a first magnetic flux path portion and a second magnetic flux path portion. The magnetic detection element outputs a sensor signal indicating the direction of a magnetic flux passing between the first magnetic flux path portion and the second magnetic flux path portion. The magnetic detection element outputs a sensor signal indicating a position relationship between the first clutch component portion concerning a first hole portion as well as a first tooth portion and the second clutch component portion concerning the second hole portion as well as the second tooth portion, based on changes in magnetic flux directions depending on the position relationship in a rotation direction around the axis.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="128.10mm" wi="144.78mm"

The transmission includes pairs of gears between a main shaft and a countershaft. The twin-clutch gearbox is placed over the main shaft, and allows the transmission to connect and disconnect from the rotational driving force of an engine. The main shaft includes an inner main spindle and an outer main spindle that rotatably supports the inner main spindle. The twin-clutch gearbox includes a first clutch and a second clutch. The first clutch connects and disconnects a rotational driving force transmitted to the inner main spindle. The second clutch connects and disconnects a rotational driving force transmitted to the outer main spindle. The transmission is configured so that a dog clutch including dog teeth and dog holes transmits a rotational driving force between adjacent transmission gears on the spindles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect of a position detection device of the present disclosure, a magnetic detection element may be positioned radially outside a first clutch component portion and a second clutch component portion around the axis between a first magnetic flux path portion and a second magnetic flux path portion, to output a sensor signal indicating the direction of the magnetic flux passing between the first magnetic flux path portion and the second magnetic flux path portion. Furthermore, the magnetic detection element may be configured to output a sensor signal indicating a position relationship between the first clutch component portion concerning a first hole portion as well as a first tooth portion and the second clutch component portion concerning a second hole portion as well as a second tooth portion, based on changes in directions of the magnetic flux depending on the position relationship in a rotation direction around the axis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of a position detection device of the present disclosure, a magnetic detection element may be positioned radially outside a first clutch component portion and a second clutch component portion around the axis, between a first magnetic flux path portion and a second magnetic flux path portion, and may configured to output a sensor signal indicating a direction of a composite magnetic flux with a combination of a first magnetic flux passing between the first clutch component portion and the first magnetic flux path portion and a second magnetic flux passing between the second clutch component portion and the second magnetic flux path portion. In addition, the magnetic detection element may be configured to output the sensor signal indicating the position relationship between the first clutch component portion concerning a first hole portion as well as a first tooth portion and the second clutch component portion concerning a second hole portion as well as a second tooth portion, based on changes in directions of the composite magnetic flux depending on the position relationship in a rotation direction around the axis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of a position detection device of the present disclosure, a magnetic detection element may be positioned radially outside a first clutch component portion and a second clutch component portion around the axis between a first magnetic pole formation portion and a second magnetic pole formation portion, and may be configured to output a sensor signal indicating the direction of a magnetic flux generated by a magnetic field generator.
