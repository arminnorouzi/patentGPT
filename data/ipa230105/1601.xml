The guide bar has a clamping section and a free end with a redirection section located at the free end. The guide bar has two side elements which extend from the clamping section to the redirection section. The guide bar has a peripheral guide groove and a central section that is located between the side elements. The central section forms a groove base of the guide groove.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Guide bars for chainsaws are subject to a high degree of wear during operation. In particular, run-in sections and the redirection section of the guide bar are subject to a high degree of wear due to the high mechanical load during operation. To reduce wear, it is known in the prior art to arrange a rotatably mounted redirect sprocket at the guide bar tip, on the redirection section. It is also known from EP 2 550 138 B1 to provide a hardened insert or the like at the guide bar tip. However, the construction of such bars is comparatively complex.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the disclosure is to provide a guide bar that has a simple structure and reduced wear.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The guide bar for a chainsaw has a peripheral guide groove and a central section that is located between the side elements. The central section forms a groove base of the guide groove. The central section has an edge layer. The edge layer includes a hardened region. The hardened region extends from its first end having a first edge layer depth to a second end having a second edge layer depth. The first edge layer depth and the second edge layer depth are each measured orthogonally to the groove base.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first edge layer depth corresponds to the distance between the groove base and the first end of the hardened region. The second edge layer depth corresponds to the distance between the groove base and the second end of the hardened region. The first edge layer depth of the hardened region at the first end is less than the second edge layer depth of the hardened region at the second end. The second edge layer depth of the hardened region at the second end is greater than 1 mm. The edge layer depth at the first end of the hardened region is at most 3 mm. The closer the hardened region is to the groove base, the greater is the resistance to wear, that is, the wear resistance. Accordingly, it is advantageous if the edge layer depth at the first end of the hardened region is at most 1.5 mm, particularly preferably at most 0.5 mm. It is particularly advantageous if the hardened region extends to the groove base of the guide groove.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a chainsaw is in operation, the saw chain is usually supported on the guide surfaces of the guide bar by its connecting links. The drive links of the saw chain in this case are at a distance from the groove base. If there is wear on the guide surfaces, the distance between the drive links and the groove base can be reduced in such a manner that the drive links and the groove base come into contact. In this state, the saw chain rests via its drive links on the groove base, and via its connecting links on the guide surfaces of the guide bar. A hardened region realized in the edge layer of the groove base counteracts wear on the guide bar on the groove base. Since the saw chain rests with its drive links on the groove base, the forces acting upon the guide surfaces, and thus also the wear on the guide surfaces of the guide bar, are reduced. Thus, further deformation of the entire guide bar induced by wear can be avoided, or at least reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The at least one hardened region is preferably induction hardened or laser hardened. In the case of such a manner of hardening, the material is heated to a temperature of about 900&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C. This causes austenitization of the structure. The guide bar is then quenched, which effects a transformation of the austenitic structure into a martensitic structure. A martensitic structure has a significantly greater hardness than the initial structure, thereby also increasing the wear resistance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an alternative embodiment of the guide bar, the hardness increase of the at least one hardened region is preferably effected by a weld of the guide bar. The advantage of the weld is that it can be used to assemble a multi-part guide bar and at the same time to partially harden it. The weld has a weld center spot. Particularly advantageously, the weld center spot of the weld is at a distance of less than 6 mm from the groove base. It is thus ensured that the region whose hardness is increased by the weld is sufficiently close to the groove base of the guide bar to increase the wear resistance of the bar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is preferably provided that the edge layer has an edge layer depth measured orthogonally to the groove base, the edge layer depth being less than 50%, in particular less than 40%, preferably less than 30% of a maximum height of the central section of the guide bar. The maximum height corresponds to the maximum distance between the groove base on the first longitudinal side and the groove base on the second longitudinal side of the guide bar. The distance is to be measured in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal center axis. The region of the central section radially inside the edge layer is preferably unhardened, in particular completely unhardened.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The guide bar is preferably a solid bar. The solid bar is made of a single material. In the case of a solid bar, the side elements and the central section are realized as a single piece. The guide groove on the center section is to be machined, in particular milled, preferably ground, into the guide bar. Particularly large guide bars are usually realized as solid bars. Since, in the case of solid bars, the side elements and the central section do not have to be mounted, the hardened region in the edge layer of the groove base is preferably produced by laser hardening or induction hardening. Alternatively, hardening may also be effected via a weld. In this case, the function of the weld is reduced merely to increasing hardness, but no longer to joining individual guide bar parts that form, for example, the side elements and the central section of the guide bar.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the guide bar is realized in a multipart form, at least one side element and the central section being connected to each other by the weld, the weld effecting the hardness increase of the at least one hardened region of the central section. Alternatively, both side elements and the central section may be joined together by the weld. Preferably, the weld is a projection weld, preferably a spot weld. If guide bars are to be produced in large quantities, projection welding is suitable due to its high process speed at low production costs. Preferably, the weld includes a plurality of welding spots, adjacent welding spots being spaced apart by a distance of at most 15 mm, in particular of at most 10 mm, preferably of at most 5 mm. The distance between adjacent welding spots relates to their weld center spots. Accordingly, the distance between adjacent welding spots is measured from the weld center spot of one welding spot to the weld center spot of the adjacent welding spot. The smaller the distance is between the individual welding spots, the more uniform is the hardness of the guide bar. Preferably, the welding spots have a constant distance from the guide groove. The distance between adjacent welding spots is to be measured in the movement direction of the saw chain provided on the guide bar. If the distance between adjacent welding spots is sufficiently small, a pronounced wave contour of the guide bar, due to the occurrence of wear, can be avoided. Alternatively, the weld may be a laser weld. This renders possible a particularly uniform, at least partial hardness increase of the edge layer of the central section. If the weld is embodied as a projection weld or a spot weld, the weld center spot is to be understood as the actual geometric mid-point of the weld. If the weld is realized as a laser weld, the weld center spot corresponds to the center between the first end and the second end of the hardened region, measured orthogonally to the groove base, in other words a center line of the weld seam.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It can advantageously be provided that the hardened region of the edge layer extends over a wear section in the movement direction of a saw chain that can be guided on the guide bar. Preferably, the guide groove of the guide bar has a first groove depth in the wear section, the first groove depth being reduced compared to a second groove depth provided outside of the wear section. The first groove depth is in particular adapted in such a manner that a saw chain provided for the guide bar contacts the groove base in the wear section with its drive links. Thus, even when the guide bar is in the delivery state, the saw chain is supported via the drive links on the groove base of the guide groove as well as via the connecting links on the guide surfaces of the side elements. The contact force exerted by the saw chain is thus also transmitted to the groove base, thereby relieving the guide surfaces. Deformation of the guide bar is thus counteracted already in the delivery state, and/or shortly after it.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Particularly preferably, the guide bar has a first longitudinal side and a second longitudinal side, there being realized on each side element a guide surface that extends along the longitudinal sides of the guide bar, the hardness of the guide surfaces being increased at least in the wear section. Thus, the wear resistance is also increased on the guide surfaces, thereby counteracting deformation of the entire guide bar. In particular, the drive links contact the groove base in the wear section at a point in time when the saw chain with its links is still resting on a zone of the guide surfaces hardened, in particular, by induction hardening.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Clearly, a hardness increase may be provided on a plurality of sections of the central section of the guide bar. The hardness increase according to the disclosure should be provided on all the regions of the guide bar that are particularly subject to wear. The edge layer of the central section therefore preferably has a plurality of hardened regions. Preferably, there is at least one hardened region realized on the redirection section of the guide bar. The redirection section of the guide bar is most subject to stress, in particular in the case of guide bars without a redirect sprocket.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It can advantageously be provided that the guide bar includes at least one run-in region and at least one run-out region. A run-in region is to be understood as the section of the guide bar in which the saw chain contacts the guide bar after not having previously been guided by the guide bar. Such a run-in region is provided, for example, at the clamping end of the guide bar, which is located directly adjacent to the drive sprocket. There is another run-in region on guide bars that have a redirect sprocket. The saw chain is guided, over the redirect sprocket, along the redirection section, and so is lifted away from guide surface of the side elements. As a result, the friction between the saw chain and the guide bar in the region of the redirection section is minimized. Immediately adjacent to the redirect sprocket in the movement direction of the saw chain, the saw chain makes contact with the guide bar. This section forms another run-in region of the guide bar, which is subject to high degree of wear stress. A run-out region is to be understood as the section of the guide bar in which the saw chain lifts away from the guide bar. Such a run-out region is located, for example, adjacent to the drive sprocket in the direction opposite to the movement direction of the saw chain. In the case of a guide bar having a redirect sprocket, there is a further run-out region provided adjacent to the redirect sprocket in the direction opposite to the movement direction of the saw chain. Preferably, there is a hardened region realized at least at one run-in region and/or at least at one run-out region. Clearly, hardened regions may be provided at all run-in regions and at all run-out regions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of a chainsaw with a guide bar arranged thereon;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side view of a guide bar known from the prior art;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of a guide bar according to the disclosure that has a hardened region and a reduced groove depth in the redirection section;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of a further embodiment of a guide bar that has a hardened region and a reduced groove depth outside of the redirection section;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of an embodiment of a guide bar that has a redirect sprocket, having a hardened region and a reduced groove depth;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of an embodiment of a guide bar as a solid bar, having a hardened region and a reduced groove depth in the redirection section;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic side view of an embodiment of a guide bar as a solid bar, having a hardened region and a reduced groove depth outside of the redirection section;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a schematic, partial lateral representation of the hardened region of a guide bar; and,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a schematic, partial cross-section of a hardened region of a guide bar along the section line in the direction of the arrows IX according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a chainsaw <b>1</b> that has a guide bar <b>2</b>.

The edge layer <b>24</b> extends out from the groove base <b>23</b> of the central section <b>31</b> over an edge layer depth t<sub>R</sub>. The edge layer depth t<sub>R </sub>is measured orthogonally to the groove base <b>23</b>. In the embodiment, the edge layer depth t<sub>R </sub>is less than 50%, in particular less than 40%, preferably less than 30% of a maximum height (h) of the groove base <b>31</b> of the guide bar <b>2</b>. The maximum height h corresponds to the maximum distance between the groove base <b>23</b> on the first longitudinal side <b>19</b> and the groove base <b>23</b> on the second longitudinal side <b>20</b> of the guide bar <b>2</b>. The distance is to be measured in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal center axis <b>17</b>. The region of the central section <b>31</b> radially inside the edge layer <b>24</b> is preferably unhardened, in particular completely unhardened. In an alternative embodiment of the guide bar <b>2</b>, other edge layer depths t<sub>R </sub>may also be expedient.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The weld <b>34</b> causes a hardness increase, with respect to the base material of the central section <b>31</b>, that extends out from the weld zone over a zone of influence. The weld zone and the zone of influence together form the hardened region <b>25</b>. The weld causes local melting of the center section <b>31</b> and the side elements <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;, resulting in a mixed structure in the weld zone. The temperature that prevails in this case results in austenitization in the weld zone. Since the weld zone is relatively small in relation to the guide bar <b>2</b>, it cools down rapidly, due to the material surrounding the weld zone, as well as the ambient air. This process causes a quenching of the weld, which favors the generation of a martensitic microstructure. No molten pool is formed in the zone of influence, yet the temperature is sufficiently high to produce a transformation hardening according to the above principle. It may be expedient to perform a targeted quenching via an oil bath or a water bath. In the preferred embodiment, the quenching is effected by compressed air. Accordingly, the guide bar <b>2</b> is cooled by compressed air after hardening.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the central section <b>31</b> of the guide bar <b>2</b> is made of a material different from that of the side elements <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032;.

The side elements <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032; are preferably made of a quenched and tempered steel with a high carbon content, in particular 50CrMo4. The fusion of the central section <b>31</b> with the side elements <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032; at the welding zone causes the materials to mix, as a result of which sufficient carbon is also present at the central section <b>31</b> in the weld zone, such that there can be a formation of martensite in the central section <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hardened region <b>25</b> is represented schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. The hardened region <b>25</b> extends, in a direction orthogonal to the groove base <b>23</b>, from a first end <b>32</b> to a second end <b>33</b>. The hardened region <b>25</b> lies entirely within the edge layer <b>24</b> of the central section <b>31</b>. The hardened region <b>25</b> has an edge layer depth t<sub>1 </sub>at its first end <b>32</b>, measured orthogonally to the groove base <b>23</b>. In addition, the hardened region <b>25</b> has an edge layer depth t<sub>2 </sub>at its second end <b>33</b>, measured orthogonally to the groove base <b>23</b>. The edge layer depth t<sub>1 </sub>at the first end <b>32</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> is less than the edge layer depth t<sub>2 </sub>at the second end <b>33</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b>.

In a particularly preferred embodiment of the guide bar <b>2</b>, the edge layer depth t<sub>1 </sub>at the first end <b>32</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> has the value zero. Accordingly, the first end <b>32</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> is located at the groove base <b>23</b>. Furthermore, the hardened region <b>25</b> is realized in such a manner in the edge layer <b>24</b> that the edge layer depth t<b>2</b> at the second end <b>33</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> is at least 1 mm, in particular at least 5 mm, preferably at least 10 mm. The edge layer depth t<b>2</b> at the second end <b>33</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> is at most the edge layer depth t<sub>R </sub>of the edge layer <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the weld <b>34</b> has a weld center spot <b>40</b>.

In a particularly preferred embodiment of the guide bar <b>2</b>, the distance a between the groove base <b>23</b> and the weld center spot <b>40</b> is less than 5 mm, in particular less than 4 mm, advantageously less than 3 mm. The smaller the selected distance a between the weld center spot <b>40</b> and the groove base <b>23</b>, the smaller the distance is between the hardened region <b>25</b> and the groove base <b>23</b>. The distance a between the weld center spot <b>40</b> of the weld <b>34</b> and the groove base <b>23</b> is to be selected so that the hardened region extends as far as possible to the groove base <b>23</b>. However, the weld zone in this case should not include parts of the groove base <b>23</b>, as this would otherwise lose its shape contour due to the molten bath. In this case, it might even be necessary to rework the guide bar <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the weld <b>34</b> is composed of a plurality of welding spots <b>35</b>. The welding spots <b>35</b> are located along the movement direction <b>26</b> of the saw chain <b>3</b>. Such welding spots <b>35</b> may be produced, in particular, in projection welding or in spot welding. Adjacent welding spots <b>35</b> are spaced apart from each other by a distance b between their weld center spots <b>40</b>, the distance b being at most 15 mm, in particular at most 10 mm, preferably at most 5 mm. As the distance b decreases, the hardening process becomes more uniform, that is, the boundary lines at the ends <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> become more uniform. This has the advantage that when the guide bar <b>2</b> is worn, the groove base <b>23</b> retains a comparatively uniform structure, and a pronounced wave structure of the groove base <b>23</b> can be avoided. This is advantageous for the running properties of the guide bar <b>2</b>. Furthermore, in the case of the weld <b>34</b>, in particular in the case of a projection weld, the current intensity can be reduced, or adapted, in such a manner that the diameter of the welding spots <b>35</b> is reduced. As a result, the distance b between adjacent welding spots <b>35</b> can be reduced, and the distance a between the welding center spots and the groove base can also be reduced. Consequently, the boundary lines at the ends <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> of the hardened region <b>25</b> can be further smoothed. If the weld <b>34</b> is realized in the form of a single weld seam <b>36</b>, for example by a laser welding process, the result is a uniformly extending boundary line of the hardened region <b>25</b>. If a plurality of weld seams <b>36</b> are provided, the distances between adjacent weld seams <b>36</b> should preferably be selected in a manner similar to the distances between adjacent welding spots <b>35</b>.

In the preferred embodiment, the guide groove <b>4</b> of the guide bar <b>2</b> has a first groove depth c that is at least partially adapted in such a manner that a saw chain <b>3</b> provided for the guide bar <b>2</b> in the delivery state contacts, or at least almost contacts, the groove base <b>23</b> with its drive links <b>47</b>. Provided between the groove base <b>23</b> and the tip of the drive link, when the saw chain <b>3</b> is in the mounted state, is a distance e, which is preferably less than 2 mm, in particular less than <b>1</b> mm, particularly preferably less than 0.5 mm. In the embodiment, the first groove depth c is adapted to the regions of the guide bar <b>2</b> at which the central section <b>31</b> has the hardened region <b>25</b> in its edge layer <b>24</b>. This region is referred to in the following as the wear section <b>37</b>, in which the hardened region <b>25</b> of the edge layer <b>24</b> extends in the movement direction <b>26</b> of a saw chain <b>3</b> that can be guided on the guide bar <b>2</b>. The adapted first groove depth c of the guide groove <b>4</b> in the wear region <b>37</b> is less than the second groove depth d outside of the wear region <b>37</b>. The adapted first groove depth c of the guide groove <b>4</b> extends over at least 20%, preferably over at least 40%, advantageously over at least 70% of the wear region <b>37</b>, in particular of the redirection section <b>27</b>.

It may also be expedient to provide the entire guide groove <b>4</b> with an adapted first groove depth c. The guide groove <b>4</b> is realized in the wear section <b>37</b> in such a manner that the saw chain <b>3</b> is supported, via its connecting links <b>48</b>, on the guide surfaces <b>21</b> of the side elements <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>&#x2032; and, on the other hand, via its drive links <b>47</b>, on the groove base <b>23</b> of the guide groove <b>4</b>. Thus, the forces acting upon the guide bar <b>2</b> from the saw chain <b>3</b> are no longer transmitted solely to the guide surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032;, but are additionally distributed to the groove base <b>23</b> of the central section <b>31</b>. In this way, the wear on the guide bar <b>2</b> can be reduced. Preferably, both a hardening of the central section <b>31</b> and an adaptation of the first groove depth c are provided, especially in the regions of the guide bar <b>2</b> in which particularly large forces act upon the guide bar <b>2</b>.
