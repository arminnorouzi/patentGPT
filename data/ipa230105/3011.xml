These two methods are widely used and both have been tested and certified by Underwriter Laboratories, Inc. (&#x201c;UL&#x201d; is an independent worldwide testing and regulatory compliance certification organization) as being compliant with certain specified fire and hose stream UL test standards.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, UL has tested and certified various building construction &#x201c;joint systems&#x201d; in accordance with their testing standards set forth in &#x201c;UL 2079 Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems, fifth edition (Aug. 26, 2015).&#x201d; These enhanced UL fire test standards apply to a large number of building construction joint systems (and related wall assemblies) of various materials and construction. UL's joint system fire tests evaluate the length of time that a specified joint system will contain a fire during a predetermined/controlled exposure to fire. Consequently, UL's joint system fire tests evaluate the joint system's resistance to heat and, in some instances, to a hose stream, while carrying an applied load (if the assembly is load bearing). UL's joint system fire tests may, in some instances, include an air leakage test to determine the rate of air leakage through joint systems resulting from a specified air pressure difference applied across the surface of the joint system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the building construction industry, metal framing assemblies are commonly used to construct commercial and residential buildings. Metal framing assemblies are generally constructed from a plurality of metal framing members including studs, joists, trusses, and other metal posts and beams (e.g., I-beams) formed from sheet metal (and frequently fabricated to have the same general cross-sectional dimensions as standard wooden members used for similar purposes). Metal framing members are typically constructed by either brake-pressing or roll-forming (with both methods being referred to as &#x201c;cold-formed&#x201d; processing) 12-to-24-gauge galvanized sheet steel. Although many cross-sectional shapes are available, the primary shapes used in building construction are C-shaped studs and U-shaped tracks. For example, most wall assemblies are constructed from U-shaped tracks fastened to the floor (footer) and ceiling (header) with a plurality of C-shaped studs laterally spaced apart, and vertically positioned between, the opposing header and footer tracks. The sealing of perimeter and head-of-wall linear joints is an important aspect of building construction because a robust and effective seal can impede and/or prevent the spread of fire and smoke.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although some progress has been made in recent years, there is still a need in the art for new and improved building construction products that better promote life safety&#x2014;including innovative building construction products that facilitate the construction of head-of-wall assemblies, which, in turn, better seal linear construction joints (for purposes of impeding the transmission of fire and smoke in the event of a building fire, and/or impending the transmission of sound from one room to another). In particular, there is a need in the art for new and improved devices and methods that facilitate the attachment of a header track to an overhead beam that as has been sprayed and encrusted with a fire-proofing and/or insulation material. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides for further related advantages.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In brief, the present invention in an embodiment is directed to a Z-shaped attachment element for use in building construction.
