Specific examples of the technology may indicate a suspicion of or likelihood of sepsis.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Often, when blood or another body fluid is analyzed, it may be subjected to tests to identify various parameters or biomarkers in a sample. However, it is possible that simply specifying parameters to be measured may provide suboptimal results in some cases. For example, in the context of health condition diagnosis and treatment, it is possible that a single parameter may be relevant to the treatment and/or diagnosis of multiple conditions, including some conditions that would benefit from measurements having a level of accuracy that would be pointless for other conditions. Additionally, in some cases, tests may be organized, and test results may be reported based on particular types of parameters (e.g., cell types), but it is possible that a sample may be collected and/or analyzed for a purpose that would benefit from consideration of information related to multiple types of parameters. This can cause various problems, such as making it more difficult to obtain information relevant to a particular analytic goal and/or rendering analysis less efficient in cases where tests for a parameter are keyed to more demanding requirements than may be appropriate for a particular use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sepsis is an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response to infection that may rapidly progress to a life-threatening condition that can lead to shock and organ failure (i.e., septic shock and severe sepsis) if not treated immediately. A patient admitted to a medical facility may show clinical features of systemic inflammation. A medical professional may then attempt to determine if the inflammation is caused by an infection, leading to a diagnosis of sepsis, or some other causes, leading to a diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In some cases, a patient may have no obvious signs of systemic inflammation, which may mean that the patient may not be considered at risk for sepsis. For example, patients who are younger and healthier may compensate for having sepsis and may show no signs or inconsistent signs of sepsis or inflammation and, therefore, may not be treated for sepsis and suffer consequences of sepsis being untreated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If undetected, sepsis may lead to severe sepsis or septic shock, which has a mortality rate of about 60%. A large fraction of hospital deaths are associated with sepsis. Diagnosing sepsis is challenging because of the lack of an accurate biomarker. Additionally, clinical criteria that may indicate sepsis, such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, may not distinguish sepsis from SIRS or other conditions. These criteria may be associated with non-infectious etiologies that may be present in a hospital emergency room, including trauma, burns, pancreatitis, sickle cell crisis, and other inflammatory disorders. These similarities between sepsis and inflammation may make diagnosing sepsis challenging and time-consuming. For example, obtaining blood culture results to confirm an infection and/or identify a pathogen responsible for the infection may take several days. During the time it takes to complete conventional diagnostic testing, the patient's condition could deteriorate, possibly to a degree that the patient requires extraordinary clinical support or can no longer be treated effectively. For these and additional reasons, improved or new systems and methods for assessing the likelihood of systemic infection, including sepsis, are desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need for improved technology for analyzing samples in a manner that is consistent with specific analytic goals. It may thus be an object of some embodiments to provide a method that could comprise steps such as receiving an order identifying a condition that one or more tests should be performed, determining the one or more tests to perform to diagnose or assess the condition, determining a set of custom behaviors to use in performing that test and obtaining a result for that test by performing it using the custom behaviors, and presenting the results for the one or more tests performed to diagnoses or assess the condition. In some embodiments, this objective may be fulfilled by the subject matter of the independent claims, wherein further embodiments are incorporated in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for an efficient and accurate way to assess whether an individual has sepsis or may develop sepsis or a severe infection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention improve upon diagnostic, biological, and medical related technologies or technical fields by providing a fast, simple, and accurate determination of the sepsis status. Based on the sepsis status, treatment may be started quickly, thereby preventing complications, including organ failure and death, of not treating sepsis fast enough. The sepsis status may include an indication that the patient is at high risk of developing sepsis, rather than a diagnosis of sepsis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sepsis status may indicate sepsis is indicated by the blood sample or that sepsis is likely to develop based on characteristics measured in the blood sample. Sepsis being likely in the blood sample may indicate that a treatment for sepsis in the individual is recommended or needed. Sepsis results from an uncontrolled systemic response to an infection. Sepsis may result from any infection in the body. For example, a simple skin infection may trigger a septic event. A post-surgical infection may lead to sepsis as the post-surgical infection may include infection and systemic inflammation. Predicting which infections may result in a septic event is difficult and not always possible. Clinicians desire an early detection or indication that a patient may become septic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present technology include a method for testing a blood sample for sepsis. The method may include receiving a blood sample from an individual. The method may also include executing an instruction to analyze the blood sample for characteristics related to sepsis. In addition, the method may include measuring values of a set of characteristics in the blood sample. The set of characteristics may be determined prior to measuring the values. The method may further include analyzing the values of the set of characteristics to produce a representation of a suspicion of sepsis. In addition, the method may include displaying the representation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the present technology include a method of training and using machine learning models to estimate a likelihood of sepsis based on test blood sample data sets. The method may include receiving, by a computer system, a training data set including a plurality of data elements. Each training data element of the plurality of data elements may include a blood sample data set and a condition data set. The blood sample data set may include, for each individual of a plurality of individuals, values for a set of characteristics associated with a blood sample. The condition data set may indicate a presence of sepsis in each individual of the plurality of individuals. The method may also include training a machine learning model, using the training data set. The training may result in identifying one or more parameters of a function in the machine learning model based on correspondences between the blood sample data set and the condition data set. Furthermore, the method may include receiving, by the computer system, a test blood sample data set including a value for each characteristic of the set of characteristics. The method may use the trained machine learning model and the test blood sample data set to generate a representation of the likelihood of sepsis in the test blood sample data set.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present technology may include an automated system for testing a blood sample for sepsis. The blood sample may be obtained from an individual. The system may include a first module. The first module may include a first assembly configured to measure direct current (DC) impedance of cells of the blood sample passing individually through a cell interrogation zone. The first module may also include a second assembly configured to measure radiofrequency (RF) conductivity of cells of the blood sample passing individually through the cell interrogation zone. The first module may further include a third assembly configured to measure light propagation of cells of the blood sample passing individually through the cell interrogation zone. In addition, the automated system may include a second module configured to count cells. The automated system may also include a data processing module in connectivity with the first module and the second module. The data processing module may include a processor and a tangible, non-transitory computer readable medium, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium programmed with a computer application. The computer application when executed by a processor may cause the processor to execute an instruction to analyze the blood sample for sepsis. The processor may be caused to measure values of a set of characteristics in the blood sample. The set of characteristics may be determined prior to measuring the values. The processor may also be caused to analyze the values of the set of characteristics to produce a representation of a suspicion of sepsis. The processor may further be caused to display the representation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A better understanding of the nature and advantages of embodiments of the present invention may be gained with reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drawings and detailed description that follow are intended to be merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as contemplated by the inventors.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents an exemplary process that may be used in some embodiments to control and/or present results of tests on a condition specific basis.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a method for testing a blood sample for sepsis according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of a bi-dimensional mathematical model according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example user interface according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a method of training and using machine learning models to estimate a likelihood of sepsis according to embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a simplified block diagram of a module system according to embodiments of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Diagnostic markers for sepsis have been researched for many years. Even so, there has not been a clear diagnostic test or biomarker for determining sepsis available. It was previously believed that a series of seven blood-cell-related factors could be reviewed in order to determine possible septic infection. See, for example, Park et al., &#x201c;Screening of sepsis using leukocyte cell population data from the Coulter automatic blood cell analyzer DxH800<i>,&#x201d; International Journal of Laboratory Hematology, </i>2011, 33, 391-399 at 397-98. As recently as a few years ago, it was believed that parameters or indices based on a calculation including at least two of the seven factors were needed in order to make a septic infection prediction. Standard deviation of monocyte volume, and white blood cell count are parameters that have been related to the likelihood of sepsis. While these and other parameters have shown predictive ability for sepsis, other parameters or other combination of parameters (including the mentioned parameters) may also be informative in determining a likelihood of sepsis. In addition, even with identified parameters, the values of the parameters may vary with the particular patient population, sample collection practices, medical facilities, and medical devices. Methods and apparatuses that can account for variations may also be desired.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, &#x201c;parameter&#x201d; may refer to a property measured from a blood sample (e.g., cell population data parameters) or independent variables in a function. The broader definition of &#x201c;parameter&#x201d; including both types applies unless context makes clear otherwise. A &#x201c;characteristic&#x201d; refers to a property of a blood sample and not an independent variable in a function.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The definition of sepsis itself has changed, illustrating additional difficulties in conclusively diagnosing sepsis. Under the Sepsis-2 definition, sepsis was defined based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. SIRS may refer to a clinical syndrome that results from a dysregulated inflammatory response to a noninfectious insult, such as an autoimmune disorder, pancreatitis, vasculitis, thromboembolism, burns, or surgery. SIRS criteria include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count. SIRS criteria are described in Kaukonen et al., &#x201c;Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Criteria in Defining Severe Sepsis,&#x201d; <i>New England of Med., </i>372:1629-38 (2015) (doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1415236) and the Supplementary Appendix, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. &#x201c;Sepsis&#x201d; may be the clinical syndrome that results from a dysregulated inflammatory response to an infection. Under Sepsis-2, sepsis includes two SIRS criteria and infection. &#x201c;Severe sepsis&#x201d; may refer to sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction resulting from infection. &#x201c;Septic shock&#x201d; may refer to a condition of severe sepsis plus hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation, which may be defined as infusion of 20-30 mL/kg of crystalloids.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In 2016, Sepsis-3 updated the definition of sepsis, which is described in Singer et al., &#x201c;The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3),&#x201d; <i>JAMA, </i>315(8):801-810 (2016) (doi: 10.1001/jama.2016.0287). Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ dysfunction can be identified using a Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The SOFA &#x201c;score grades abnormality by organ system and accounts for clinical interventions.&#x201d; &#x201c;Septic shock&#x201d; is considered a subset of sepsis, when &#x201c;underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality.&#x201d; There is no &#x201c;severe sepsis&#x201d; in Sepsis-3. As Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 definitions are not identical, even defining &#x201c;sepsis&#x201d; is challenging. Nonetheless, certain patient sample measurements, alone or in combination, may identify patients who meet the criteria for Sepsis-2 and/or Sepsis-3, or are at elevated risk of meeting the criteria for Sepsis-2 and/or Sepsis-3 in the near future (e.g., within 24 hours, or within 48 hours, of sample testing), as described herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As sepsis is defined based on a set of clinical signs and symptoms, sepsis is not detectable in the blood the way a parasite or a low hemoglobin concentration may be detected. Methods and systems described herein may enable a clinician to identify or determine sepsis when clinical conditions are vague or non-specific (e.g., flu-like symptoms, which may be symptoms of sepsis). If &#x201c;detecting&#x201d; or a form of the word is used herein with sepsis, the term should be understood to mean determining, diagnosing, or assessing sepsis, rather than measuring a specific component definitively indicating sepsis.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Conventional systems and methods for diagnosing sepsis may be inefficient and/or time consuming. In current practice, clinical criteria may be used to diagnose sepsis by detecting systemic inflammation that accompanies sepsis. The clinical criteria, however, may be common to both sepsis and SIRS, which may be associated with non-infectious conditions. An individual who may have sepsis may undergo laboratory tests, including but not limited to a test to generate a complete blood count (CBC) with differential (CBC-diff); measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum lactate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Procalcitonin (PCT); and cultures for bacteria. These technologies may result in poor sensitivity and/or specificity when used to diagnose sepsis. Other systems and methods may be limited to leukocyte Cell Population Data (CPD) and may still be lacking in sensitivity and/or specificity. Some conventional methods may use CPD parameter(s) (e.g., monocyte volume) that lack the sensitivity and/or specificity of CPD parameters used herein. In some cases, conventional methods may require the use of multiple analytical methods to show an increased sensitivity or specificity. Some of these tests may be expensive and may not be run routinely on individuals, and as a result, individuals who are infected and potentially septic but not yet symptomatic may not be diagnosed promptly or not diagnosed at all. The lack of an efficient and accurate method and system to evaluate the infection status may lead to a clinician administering antibiotics as a precautionary measure, resulting in overuse of antibiotics. Adverse drug events, adverse treatment interactions or side effects that might be easily managed in a healthy patient can present significant problems in a patient with SIRS, sepsis or similarly severe clinical conditions. Medicating all potentially septic patients with antibiotics, therefore, is not an ideal clinical strategy.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the other hand, waiting for test results may endanger an individual's life. Analyzing a blood culture to definitively diagnose sepsis may take two to four days. In that time, an individual can develop sepsis, develop organ failure, be past the point of recovery, and eventually die. A quick and accurate method to evaluate sepsis would improve patient outcomes and save lives. Any time saved in identifying sepsis or potential sepsis may improve patient outcomes. By one estimate, a septic patient's chance of recovery decreases by 7%-8% for every hour of delay in treatment of the underlying infection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Other tests may also be inadequate. CRP may not be specific to bacterial and viral infections, as it has also been associated with cancer and heart disease. Serum lactate may not be specific to sepsis and may be used more as a prognostic biomarker in sepsis instead of a diagnostic biomarker. ESR may represent physical properties associated with inflammatory processes but has poor specificity for infection. Blood cultures may be too time consuming to allow physicians to make immediate or timely treatment decisions. Additionally, antibiotic drugs and/or fastidious pathogens may limit the sensitivity of blood cultures. PCT, lacking sufficient sensitivity and specificity in symptomatic patients, may not reliably differentiate sepsis from other non-infectious causes of SIRS in critically ill patients. Furthermore, because PCT may be a separate, specialized test that may be performed only upon clinician request, the test may not be administered early and may not be an early identifier of septic patients.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Conventional systems may include computers, which are not able to evaluate the infection status with sufficient sensitivity and specificity even if the computer had all the information provided from a blood sample. In some instances, one or more conventional tests for sepsis may indicate sepsis, and one or more conventional tests for sepsis may be inconclusive or contraindicate sepsis. Conventional systems may be unable to reconcile inconsistent or conflicting indicators with regard to whether a patient has or is likely to develop sepsis. Embodiments of the present invention may improve computer-related technology by allowing the computer to perform evaluation of the infection status, including the evaluation of a sepsis status, which may include a suspicion or likelihood of sepsis.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention may evaluate the sepsis status. The sepsis status may indicate that an individual has sepsis, a suspicion of sepsis, or a likelihood of sepsis. If an individual is evaluated to have sepsis, suspected to have sepsis, or likely to have sepsis, clinical criteria may be used to confirm whether the individual has sepsis. Clinical criteria may include heart rate, body temperature, presence of a fever, and mental status. Individuals diagnosed with sepsis may receive closer monitoring, hospital admission, aggressive IV fluids, repeated blood cultures, vitamin (e.g. vitamin C) treatment, antibiotic treatment, antiviral treatment, antifungal treatment, supportive care, and/or prioritized diagnoses and treatment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">I. Panels for Detecting Conditions</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In light of the above, it could be beneficial to be able to automatically customize the analysis of samples based on specific objectives that analysis is intended to or could be expected to advance. According to a first aspect, some embodiments may include a method comprising steps such as receiving an order identifying a condition that one or more tests should be performed to detect, determining the one or more tests to perform to detect the condition, determining a set of custom behaviors to use in performing that test and obtaining a result for that test by performing it using the custom behaviors, and presenting the results for the one or more tests performed to detect the condition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments according to the first aspect, the one or more tests to perform to detect the condition may include a first test in a first panel and a second test in a second panel. In such embodiments, the results for the one or more tests performed to detect the condition may be simultaneously presented in a single output.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments according to the first aspect, there may be a first test to perform to detect the condition that is performed on an analyzer having a default data collection requirement, and the set of custom behaviors may comprise a custom data requirement for the first test. In some embodiments of this type, the condition may be a condition that needs to be detected at an early state, for example in a certain embodiment this may be sepsis, the default data collection requirement for the first test may be acquiring data from between 500 and 1,000 monocytes, and the extended data collection requirement for the second test may be acquiring data from a higher number of monocytes (e.g., between 1,000 and 2,000, between 4,000 and 5,000, etc.). Additionally, in other embodiments, various other parameters may be used to detect a condition at an early state or even before a condition can be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms from a physical examination. Similarly, in some embodiments such as described initially in this paragraph, the one or more tests to perform to detect the condition may comprise a second test, and the set of custom behaviors to use in performing the second test may be no custom behaviors. The different tests may involve analyzing the same or similar features in different ways or at different times, e.g., acquiring data from additional cells to increase the confidence in an observation or measurement or to evaluate a change over time. The different tests may involve analyzing different features, e.g., a distribution width for a cell population or cell sub-population, or one or more extrema for a cell population or cell sub-population. The different tests may involve analyzing a mix of the same features and different features, so long as the &#x201c;different tests&#x201d; are not the same test performed at what is clinically the same time, i.e., over a time period in which no difference in the test result would be expected based on actual differences in the patient sample as compared to normal sample-to-sample or test-to-test variability.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments according to the first aspect, the method may comprise, using an index calculation function, calculating a value indicating a likelihood that the condition identified in the order is present. Such an embodiment may also comprise presenting the value indicating the likelihood that the condition identified in the order is present. Similarly, in some embodiments of this type, the index calculation function for a condition identified in an order may be a function that calculates a value indicating the likelihood that the condition is present based on a predefined set of parameters. In some embodiments, parameters may, but are not limited to, distribution width associated with various measurable parameters associated with the patient sample; ratios between various measurable parameters associated with the patient sample; cell population data associated with granulated cells or a sub-population of granulated cells in a blood sample; cell population data associated with lymphocytes or monocytes in a blood sample; the standard deviation of the volume of monocytes in the patient sample; a count of white blood cells in the patient sample; a sum of monocytes and neutrophils in the patient sample; WBC&#x2032; (a linear transformation of the count of white blood cells in the patient sample, as is described below); the standard deviation of the volume of monocytes in the patient sample following an extended data range (volume) mode from a higher number of monocytes than normal; a count of early granulated cells in the patient sample; a count of neutrophils in the patient sample; one or more measures of the neutrophil cell population or features of the neutrophils in the patient samples, such as average volume, standard deviation of volume, or the like; a combination of the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode, and a count of white blood cells in the patient sample; a combination of the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode, and a sum of monocytes and neutrophils in the patient sample; a combination of the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode, and WBC&#x2032;; a combination of a count of white blood cells in the patient sample and a sum of monocytes and neutrophils in the patient sample; a combination of a count of white blood cells in the patient sample and the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode; a combination of a ratio of monocytes to neutrophils in the patient sample and WBC&#x2032;; a combination of the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode, a count of white blood cells in the patient sample, and a ratio of monocytes to neutrophils in the patient sample; a combination of the standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes in the patient sample, with or without extended data range (volume) mode, WBC&#x2032;, and a ratio of monocytes to neutrophils in the patient sample; and combinations and sub-combinations thereof. Extended data range (volume) mode refers to using an extended volume range that allows monocyte populations with cell volumes that exceed the five-part differential measuring range to be fully developed so that a standard deviation of the volume of the monocytes can be computed based on the full monocyte population.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Combinations of parameters may be assessed sequentially, e.g., evaluating an observation from the patient sample to a threshold for suspicion of sepsis for a first parameter, and then evaluating an observation from the patient sample to a threshold for suspicion of sepsis for a second parameter; or may be assessed as a co-variate regression; or may be assessed as an index or transformation; or a combination of means of combining the parameters may be used. In some instances, including, but not limited to, white blood cell count, a transformation may be used to consider both a lower threshold and an upper threshold simultaneously. In other instances, a transformation may be used to moderate large differences in absolute value between two parameters or to remove or reduce the influence of correlated parameters (e.g., a parameter influenced by cell volume [e.g., RF] may be divided by volume to remove that factor). Any value from negative infinity to positive infinity may be transformed to a [0,1] range. Exemplary transformations may be linear or non-linear, including logarithmic transformations. A computer performing the method may be communicatively connected to a remotely located server and may also be configured to receive an updated index calculation function.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments according to the first aspect, the one or more tests to perform to detect the condition may comprise a first test and a second test, where the first test is a test of a white blood cell parameter and the second test may be a test of a red blood cell parameter. Additionally, in some embodiments of this type the first test and the second test may be performed using reagents as part of a single panel or in a single apparatus.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Corresponding systems comprising one or more computers configured by computer executable instructions stored on non-transitory computer readable media to perform steps of methods described in any of the preceding embodiments, as well as non-transitory computer readable media storing instructions for performing steps of method described in any of the preceding embodiments, could also be implemented without undue experimentation by those of ordinary skill in the art based on this disclosure. Similarly, the disclosed technology may be used in the diagnosis of a variety of clinical conditions, such as sepsis, malaria, dengue, anemia, leukemia, etc. Accordingly, the preceding description of potential embodiments and aspects, as well as the discussion of illustrative embodiments set forth herein, should be understood as being illustrative only, and should not be treated as limiting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents an exemplary process that may be used in some embodiments to control and/or present results of tests on a condition specific basis. Initially, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an order will be received <b>101</b> for testing for a specific condition. Preferably, this step (as well, optionally, as the other steps from the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) will be performed by a computer controlling a piece of laboratory equipment (e.g., a hematology analyzer) that would perform tests for detecting the relevant condition. In embodiments where a process such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is performed by a computer, the step of receiving <b>101</b> a condition specific test order could be performed in a variety of manners. For example, in some embodiments, a computer may be configured to receive <b>101</b> an order for testing for a specific condition when a physician specifies that tests for that condition should be run on a sample. Such an order may, in some embodiments, be transmitted electronically to the analyzer, while in other embodiments an analyzer implemented based on this disclosure may be configured to include specific conditions in a menu presented to an operator and to allow that operator to use that menu to specify the condition. In yet other embodiments, a computer may be configured to automatically generate an order to test a sample for a condition. For example, the computer may be configured with rules (such as those described in co-pending PCT application PCT/US18/20087 for a Cross Discipline Disease Management System, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) for triggering a reflex test for a specific condition when it appears that there is a heightened likelihood that that condition is present.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this context, a &#x201c;reflex test&#x201d; refers to a test that is performed because certain data or circumstances indicate that additional testing would be helpful. Reflex testing often occurs because of improbable or unusual results (e.g., very high cell counts, potentially indicative of a miscount rather than actual cell density in a sample or a statistically aberrant test result for a sample), or results which could have significant clinical effects (e.g., platelet counts that would disqualify a patient for surgery). In such cases, the reflex testing may be intended to verify an improbable or clinically important test result. In the context of this disclosure, reflex testing may occur to confirm a result, to increase the confidence in a result (e.g., by extended sampling), and/or because the result of one or more routine or specially-ordered tests may indicate that another panel of tests, such as a panel of tests for a specific condition, such as sepsis, is indicated. The reflex testing may occur because a medical practitioner ordered a condition-specific panel, and a set of one or more primary tests indicated that additional testing was advisable (e.g., one or more results was consistent with a diagnosis of the condition). The reflex testing for a condition-specific panel may occur even if the medical practitioner did not order a condition-specific panel, if the results indicate that the condition-specific panel should be tested. Alternately, the testing described herein as reflex testing may be part of the routine processing of a condition-specific panel (e.g., not actually reflex testing, but rather routine testing vis-&#xe0;-vis an order for a condition-specific panel, regardless of the results of whatever tests happen to be run first in time).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Exemplary circumstances that could trigger reflex testing for a condition-specific panel include patient demographics and/or patient condition (e.g., a sepsis-specific panel could be run for all emergency department patients with a fever or altered mental state, based on information in the test order and/or the hospital information systems, including electronic medical records and/or the laboratory information system); the result of whatever test or tests for a particular sample were ordered (e.g., a sepsis-specific panel might be run for any sample submitted for a complete blood count with differential or CBC-diff with a high standard of deviation for monocyte volume); the order of a medical practitioner (e.g., an order to complete a condition-specific panel); the initial findings from a condition-specific panel (e.g., additional testing run as part of a condition-specific panel only if certain primary tests are consistent with diagnosis of the condition, for example, testing a blood sample from a patient with suspected sepsis for WBC&#x2032; and standard deviation of monocyte volume, and performing extended testing for other parameters only if one or both tests exceed cutoff values for suspicion of sepsis); or combinations thereof. For example, in some embodiments, a computer may be configured to be able to receive <b>101</b> an order for testing a specific condition both when it is directly requested by a physician, and when it is automatically generated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, once a condition specific test order has been received <b>101</b>, the process continues with identifying <b>102</b> the test(s) to perform for that condition. As with receiving <b>101</b> the condition specific test order, the step of identifying <b>102</b> test(s) for the specified condition may be performed in a variety of different ways. For example, in some embodiments, a computer performing a method such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may have stored, either in its own memory or in a local database, data (e.g., in one or more tables) correlating particular conditions with particular test(s) that would be relevant to the identification of those conditions. In such an embodiment, the step of identifying <b>102</b> the test(s) to perform may be done by the computer retrieving the test(s) from its own memory or local database by running a query using the condition specified in the previously received <b>101</b> order. In other embodiments, a computer performing a process such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may query a remote database (e.g., a database hosted on a cloud server) to identify <b>102</b> what test(s) should be performed, or may attempt to query a remote database and, if such a query fails (e.g., if there is a problem communicating with the remote database) fall back on whatever information is stored in the computer's memory or in a local database.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other alternatives may also be possible. For example, in some embodiments, a condition specific test order may specify both the test(s) to perform and the condition which the test(s) are intended to detect. In this type of scenario, a computer performing a process such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may simply identify <b>102</b> the test(s) to perform as the test(s) specified in the order itself, or may identify <b>102</b> the test(s) as the test(s) specified in the order plus any additional test(s) that may be indicated by information stored in a local or remote database. Additional variations (e.g., identifying test(s) specified in an order as the test(s) to be performed, with any additional test(s) indicated by information in a local or remote database being treated as possible reflex test(s) in case the test(s) specified in the order were inconclusive or indicated that additional tests may be clinically relevant) may also be possible in some embodiments. Accordingly, the discussion above of identifying <b>102</b> test(s) to be performed, like the discussion of receiving <b>101</b> a condition specific test order, should be understood as being illustrative only, and should not be treated as limiting on the scope of any claims in this document or any other document claiming the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The database may be absolute, applying the same standard to all condition-specific test orders. In other cases, the database may be modified based, for example, on local data trends, temporal data trends, local decision rules, patient subpopulations, or the like. For example, an oncology practice may include different tests, different thresholds for triggering reflex testing, or may use different formulas to assess the likelihood of sepsis than an emergency department, an intensive care unit, a post-operative observation unit, a pediatric unit, etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After identification <b>102</b> of the test(s) to be performed, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> continues with a determination <b>103</b> of whether there are custom behaviors for the next test (which, if this is the first time the determination <b>103</b> had been performed for a sample, would be the first test identified for the condition). To illustrate what this type of determination might entail, consider the case where the received <b>101</b> order is to test a sample to determine whether the individual from whom that sample was collected is suffering from sepsis, and the identified <b>102</b> test(s) to perform on that sample included determining monocyte distribution width (MDW). Consider also the hypothetical situation in which such an order is to be processed using an instrument having a default behavior for determining MDW that includes a number of monocytes to detect in a sample. In this type of hypothetical scenario, the step of determining <b>103</b> whether there is custom behavior for the sample may include determining that, because the sample is being run to diagnosis sepsis, the data collection should be extended such that the default behavior would be overridden and data for a larger number of monocytes would be acquired, thereby allowing for a more precise MDW determination of a type that may be appropriate for testing for sepsis but that may not be necessary for other purposes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments following this type of hypothetical scenario, the default behavior for determining MDW may be detection of between 500 and 1,000 monocytes, while the custom behavior may be acquiring data for between 1,000 and 2,000 monocytes. In other embodiments, the custom behavior may be acquiring data for between 4,000 and 5,000 monocytes. In other embodiments, different types of custom behaviors may be implemented. For example, the sample may be reflexed for additional testing on the same or different apparatus. As described above, exemplary reflex testing may include other cell population measurements. However, reflex testing could also include testing on different apparatuses and/or in different fields. For example, a patient sample could be reflexed between a cell counting and/or measuring apparatus and one or more of a chemical, immunoassay, microbiological, or other apparatus to supplement or complete the initial order. Accordingly, the discussion above of specific custom behaviors should be understood as being illustrative only, and should not be treated as limiting.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With respect to execution, the determination <b>103</b> of whether there are custom behaviors for a test could be performed in manners similar to those discussed previously for the identification <b>102</b> of tests to perform. Thus, in some embodiments, whether there is custom behavior for a test could be determined <b>103</b> by a computer performing a query of its own memory of a local database using the relevant test and condition, and use the result of that query to define the custom behavior (if any) for that test. Similarly, in some embodiments, whether there is custom behavior for a test could be determined <b>103</b> by querying a remote database and/or by reference to the condition specific testing order (e.g., if the order had specified particular behaviors, such as extended data collection, to be used when performing particular test(s)). Accordingly, like the identification <b>102</b> of test(s), the determination <b>103</b> of custom behavior should be understood as potentially being susceptible to implementation in different manners, and the protection provided by this or any related document should not be limited to only embodiments in which that step is performed using one of the exemplary implementations described herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the determination <b>103</b> had been made of whether there were custom behaviors for a test, that test could then be performed <b>104</b> with its default behaviors (if there were no custom behaviors for that test), or could be performed <b>105</b> with the custom behaviors (if it had been determined <b>103</b> that such custom behaviors existed). This could then repeat until all tests for the condition <b>106</b> from the condition specific test order had been performed. Alternately, or additionally, the custom behavior could relate to how the test results are acquired. For example, different population characteristics, such as extrema or standard deviations, may be identified; ratios or relative measures of different cells, cell population characteristics, biomarkers, or the like may be calculated; or different thresholds for declaring a sample normal or abnormal may be applied as custom behaviors. In some cases, the custom behaviors may include if-then cascades that effect how the data is analyzed or represented to a human. In some cases, an if-then cascade may include reflex testing, or cycles between data analysis and reflex testing, until a reasonably reliable recommendation regarding a condition-specific diagnosis can be made or the cascade is terminated, e.g., because the analysis is indeterminate or the sample has been spent or expired and cannot be subjected to further testing. The resolution of the data acquired may be increased or decreased based on the data analysis. If less precision or faster data processing is preferred, then the resolution of the data as it is acquired may be decreased. If greater precision is desired, then the resolution of the data as it is acquired may be increased.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Finally, the results of the tests could be presented <b>107</b>. In some embodiments, this may be done, for example, by simply presenting the test results on a panel by panel basis and allowing the user to see the test results by selecting the panels in which the tests were contained. Alternatively, in some embodiments, all test results may be gathered into a single page so that they could be presented together regardless of whether the reagents for those tests had been included in different panels. For instance, in this type of embodiment, if tests performed on a sample had included a test performed with a reagent from a white blood cell panel and a test with a reagent from a red blood cell panel, then those results could be presented <b>107</b> together in a single interface despite the fact that the tests had been in (i.e., had relied on reagents or different test processes from) different panels. Additionally, some embodiments of aspects of the disclosed technology may allow analyzers that do not include code for gathering results of tests from multiple panels in a single output to provide condition-specific, unified output through the use of condition specific panels. That is, in some embodiments a panel may be provided which is organized to include the test results that would be used to detect a particular condition, rather than to include test results on a particular type of subject matter (e.g., red blood cell or white blood cell panels).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further variations on the presentation <b>107</b> of results may also be possible in some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, prior to the presentation of results, the data gathered in the tests may be used to calculate a value reflecting how likely it is that the specified condition is present. This may be calculated, in some embodiments, using an equation of the general form index=f(parameter 1, parameter 2, . . . parameter n) to calculate a value illustrating the likelihood that a patient from whom a sample was taken has the relevant clinical condition based on the data collected regarding that sample. In some cases, this likelihood may be determined without reference to a single, condition-specific biomarker or analyte. For example, the condition may be sepsis, for which there is no known biomarker or analyte that is individually diagnostic of sepsis, in contrast to a condition like infection with <i>E. coli</i>, which can be confirmed by blood culture.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the index presentation may include identification of additional tests that might facilitate a diagnosis. For example, if the system is unable to reflex test between laboratory instruments of different types, the index presentation may include specific chemical, immunoassay, microbiological or cell measurement tests that might improve the accuracy or precision of the index, based on which test(s) were unavailable for reflex testing and/or were not included in the medical practitioner's order.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, a computer in a laboratory that would perform an index calculation such as described above may be configured to communicate with a remote server to determine if the server had a model for calculating an index that was more recent than the computer's then current model and, if so, the computer could update to use the more current model for future index calculations. In embodiments where this type of updating is supported, it may also be used for upgrading data other than models used for calculating likelihood indices. For example, it is possible that, as additional research is done, a remote server may be updated to include data indicating new tests and/or custom behaviors that had been found to be useful in detecting various conditions, and this information may be propagated to local laboratory computers in a manner similar to that described for the index updates.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">II. Panels for Determining Sepsis</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the present technology include panels for testing for sepsis. The panel may be run on blood samples commonly obtained from patients visiting an emergency department. Testing for sepsis may or may not include diagnosing sepsis. In some embodiments, the results of a panel for sepsis may indicate that the possibility of sepsis is a concern for the individual and may need further analysis or monitoring, without stating that sepsis is present in the individual. The medical practitioner may then decide, based on the results of the panel, to run additional tests or to proactively start treatment for sepsis. In some cases, the individual may not show any obvious symptoms of sepsis, and the result of the panel may bring the possibility of sepsis to a medical practitioner's attention. For example, an individual admitted to an emergency department may be young (e.g., ages 18-29) and not show any symptoms of sepsis or may present with non-specific complaints, and the panel may indicate sepsis is a concern for the individual.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The panels include components or methods, including measurement devices or techniques, that generate new data. Measurement devices are described below. Measurement techniques include analyzing blood cell parameter data (e.g., leukocyte cell population data (CPD)) in a new way. Conventional panels of analyzing blood cell parameter data do not generate data that is specific for determining sepsis or assessing a suspicion of sepsis or a likelihood of sepsis, and do not analyze or present the data to draw attention to the possibility of sepsis, even if the results indicate a high probability of sepsis.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A suspicion of sepsis is a categorization that sepsis is suspected or cause for concern in a patient. A likelihood of sepsis is a probability that the patient is septic. Sepsis may be suspected in a patient based on physical examination, but not likely in the patient. Conversely, a patient may be septic or may be at high risk of developing sepsis even though sepsis is not suspected based on physical examination. Suspicion of sepsis may be categorized in binary terms&#x2014;either yes or no; sepsis is suspected or it is not. Suspicion of sepsis may then lead to additional tests that may determine the likelihood of sepsis. However, in some embodiments, suspicion may be scaled to the likelihood of sepsis, with a higher likelihood associated with a higher value.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">A. Example Method</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a method <b>200</b> for testing a blood sample for sepsis. Suspicion of sepsis could first arise from or a hypothesis of sepsis could be challenged by testing different kinds of patient samples, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, semen, sputum, sweat, amniotic fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, feces, dialysate, serous fluid, or combinations thereof. Additionally, or alternatively, if a blood sample is tested, the blood may be whole blood, diluted blood, lysed blood (i.e., blood which has been treated to lyse one or more kinds of cells, potentially making it easier to analyze the remaining cells or the contents of the lysed cells), isolated blood cells, blood plasma, or combinations thereof. Different types of samples may be subjected to similar tests, e.g., tests for the presence or level of a particular protein or biomarker, or may be subjected to different tests. For example, a blood sample from a patient may be tested for cell population parameters indicative of sepsis, and a sputum sample from the same patient may be cultured and/or tested to look for pathogens that could be the source of an infection.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At block <b>202</b>, method <b>200</b> may include receiving a blood sample from an individual.

Receiving the instruction may include receiving an input from a medical practitioner to analyze the blood sample for sepsis for the individual. The input may be a computer input indicating that the sample should be analyzed for sepsis for the particular individual. In other embodiments, the input may be a setting that multiple blood samples from multiple individuals, should be analyzed for sepsis. The setting may be the default setting for an analysis system.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, method <b>200</b> may include generating the instruction to analyze the blood sample for sepsis. Method <b>200</b> may include measuring values of a base set of characteristics in a blood sample. The blood sample may be the same or different as the blood sample analyzed for sepsis. The values of the base set of characteristics may be compared with a set of cutoff values. The comparison may be to determine if the value exceeds a cutoff value. The value may be determined to be higher than the cutoff value or lower than the cutoff value. The cutoff values may be determined from control samples from individuals known to not have sepsis or known to have sepsis. The cutoff value may be 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean average measured for the control sample. Based on the comparison, the instruction to analyze the blood sample may be generated. The instruction may include a command to analyze the values of another set of characteristics to produce a representation of suspicion of sepsis.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the instruction to analyze the blood sample for sepsis may be generated after analyzing another blood sample from the individual. In this manner, at least two blood samples from the individual may be analyzed. The same or different set of characteristics may be measured and analyzed from the blood samples.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At block <b>206</b>, method <b>200</b> may include measuring values of a set of characteristics in the blood sample. The set of characteristics being determined prior to measuring the values and may be different from the base set of characteristics. The set of characteristics may be characteristics that are observed to be related to likelihood or suspicion of sepsis. The set of characteristics may include standard deviation of monocyte volume (monocyte distribution width), white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage or amonocyte percentage. The set of characteristics may include any parameter from a complete blood cell count (CBC) module or volume conductivity scatter (VCS) data or any parameter described herein. Measuring the set of characteristics may include performing the tests in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Measuring the values of the set of characteristics may be for a plurality of types of cells in the blood sample and for a number of cells for each type. The types of cells and the number of cells of each type may be determined using the instruction to analyze the blood sample for sepsis. The types of cells and the number of cells of each type may be a custom behavior for a sepsis panel. In some instruments, the number of cells measured may be controlled, e.g., to ensure that a sufficient number of a certain type of cells is tested to get a statistically reliable result. The number of cells to be measured may be confirmed by counting individual cells, or, in some instruments, may be inferred by controlling the volume and dilution (or non-dilution) of the analyzed sample, which will generally be proportionate to the number of cells in the sample. That is, testing a higher volume of blood will generally result in testing more cells.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At block <b>208</b>, method <b>200</b> may further include analyzing the values of the set of characteristics to produce a representation of a suspicion of sepsis. The representation may include a visualization of the values of the set of characteristics for the blood sample and of values for the set of characteristics for a non-septic condition. For example, the visualization may be a graph of values of the set of characteristics for sepsis compared to values of the set of characteristics for non-septic conditions, which may be based, for example, on control samples or a database of values for patients who were determined not to be septic.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Analyzing the values of the set of characteristics to produce the representation may include using a formula to calculate a model value. The formula may include where 1/1+e&#x2212;x is calculated using the values of the set of characteristics. The variable x may be the value of a characteristic (e.g., white blood cell count) or a calculation of multiple values of characteristics (e.g., a linear combination of WBC and SD-V-MO). This formula is exemplary, and one of skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of formulas may be useful, including linear or non-linear mathematical functions. The specific formula used will depend on the characteristics evaluated, both individually and as a group, and may also vary based on institutional preferences (e.g., a hospital's preference to err on the side of incorrectly diagnosing a patient with sepsis versus incorrectly diagnosing a patient as not having sepsis), and, if used, local modifications based on the patient population, user preferences, prevalence of sepsis and related conditions, and the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The representation of the suspicion of sepsis may include a comparison of a likelihood of sepsis to a likelihood of a non-septic condition. The representation may be a word cloud with the font size, color, saturation, transparency, shading, emphasis, and/or other visual presentation of each condition correlated with the likelihood of the condition.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The representation of the suspicion of sepsis may include a value of an index corresponding to a likelihood of sepsis. The value of the index may range from a lower value to a higher value. One end of the range of the value of the index may be zero or low likelihood of sepsis. The other end of the range of the value of the index may be a high likelihood of sepsis. Example ranges include from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 100. The range may scale linearly, logarithmically, or non-linearly with the likelihood of sepsis.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the representation may be displayed against a second representation produced by analyzing second values of the set of characteristics. The second values may be measured from a second, prior blood sample from the individual before analyzing the first, current blood sample. In this manner, the likelihood of sepsis as time progresses may be understood. The time between measuring the first blood sample and the second blood sample may be from 10 minutes to 1 hour, from 1 hour to 2 hours, from 2 hours to 5 hours, from 5 hours to 12 hours, from 12 hours to 24 hours, from 24 hours to 48 hours, or greater than 48 hours.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Method <b>200</b> may include running a panel for a non-septic condition (e.g., malaria, leukemia, anemia, lymphoma, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia).

Various analytical methodologies for counting and/or otherwise characterizing these blood cells are known in the art, including, without limitation, light scatter, fluorescence, image analysis, electrical impedance, flow cytometry, colorimetry, immunoassay, and combinations thereof. These methodologies may, in various embodiments, be performed in whole or in part on whole blood (e.g., a blood sample that has not be diluted, concentrated or otherwise isolated or purified), diluted blood, treated blood (e.g., a blood sample that has been exposed to lysing agents to lyse one or more kinds of cells, or a blood sample that has been treated with a stain or other substance to differentiate different kinds of cells), separate blood fractions (e.g., plasma, serum, various cell fractions), concentrated blood, and the like.

The cutoff value in method <b>200</b> may be set conservatively so that more blood samples should be analyzed further for sepsis even if a specific parameter or set of parameters do not show a presence of sepsis with a first analysis.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0079">Other hematology parameters that may be helpful with evaluating sepsis include hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (HCT), red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil number (NE #), toxic granulation, and platelet (PLT). Exemplary parameters are described in Goyette et al., &#x201c;Hematologic changes in sepsis and their therapeutic implications,&#x201d; <i>Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</i>, Vol. 25, No. 6, pp. 645-659 (2004); Aird, &#x201c;The hematologic system as a marker of organ dysfunction in sepsis,&#x201d; Mayo Clin Proc., 78:869-81 (2003); and Warner, &#x201c;Tips for evaluating a peripheral blood smear for possible sepsis,&#x201d; (2014) available at laboratory-manager.advanceweb.com/signs-of-sepsis/. The entire contents of these references are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Machine learning may further refine these features, both by identifying interactions between parameters and by identifying parameters and/or interactions that may be more or less relevant in a particular patient population. Further, machine learning may refine which parameters for which cell populations are most relevant, for example, absolute cell counts, relative cell counts, distribution measures (e.g., standard deviation, extrema, mode, median, mean, skewness, normality, modality, symmetry, etc.), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0080">A bi-dimensional index mathematical model may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example using an index calculated from MO_NE % and an index calculated from @SD-V-MO and WBC. The index for MO_NE % is shown on the y-axis, and the index for @SD-V-MO and WBC is shown on the x-axis. Data points from individual known to have sepsis are shown with a cross. Data points with those known not to have sepsis are shown with a circle. Line <b>302</b> may be used to help identify sepsis in individuals. Most of the data points from individuals with sepsis are above line <b>302</b>. Data points from individuals known not to have sepsis are also above line <b>302</b>. Line <b>302</b> may therefore not be effective in distinguishing sepsis from non-sepsis. However, line <b>302</b> may capture most patients with sepsis. That is, line <b>302</b> indicates a suspicion of sepsis. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, only three data points showing sepsis lie underneath line <b>302</b>. As a result, a blood sample from an individual that results in a data point above line <b>302</b> may be considered to have suspicion of sepsis, even if sepsis may be unlikely. If several indices or several models indicate a suspicion of sepsis, additional tests may be run, sepsis may be considered likely, and/or treatment may be started. Line <b>502</b> may be defined with respect to one or more parameter-based index. In general, line <b>502</b> should be defined to best separate the two classes (sepsis and non-sepsis). This can be done by regression analysis, but may preferentially be done by machine learning, and may be updated periodically based on local (e.g., specific to one laboratory or to the laboratories in one organization, such as a local health system) or aggregated data (e.g., data collected from a plurality of unaffiliated laboratories).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">C. Example Panel Results</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example user interface <b>400</b> displaying results of a sepsis panel. The left side of the user interface <b>400</b> includes a table <b>404</b> of tests and results. Additional data from tests can be shown, including CBC-PLT <b>408</b> and WBC-DIFF <b>412</b>. CBC-PLT <b>408</b> shows the white blood cell count and the platelet count as histograms. WBC-DIFF <b>412</b> shows the percentage of different white blood cells present. Graphing cell population data provides visual cues about the patient's health. The shape of the histogram may conform to a typical distribution (which might or might not be &#x201c;normal&#x201d; in a statistical sense), or may indicate disturbances in the cell population, and in some cases the nature and/or magnitude of the deviation from a typical histogram may provide clues about the cause or the clinical relevance of the disturbance. User interface <b>400</b> may include different representations of the suspicion of sepsis. A radar plot <b>416</b> shows the values of certain parameters for the current blood sample compared to the normal range (nonagon <b>420</b>). If multiple parameters have values outside the normal range, sepsis may be more likely than if fewer parameters have values outside the normal range. Radar plot <b>416</b> may be a clear visual depiction of many parameters, allowing a medical practitioner to readily identify an abnormal blood sample, which may have sepsis or may need to be tested further for sepsis, or may justify heightened clinical monitoring (for example, keeping a patient overnight in the hospital instead of sending the patient home) and/or the initiation of medical treatment.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">User interface <b>400</b> may include an index <b>424</b>. Index <b>424</b> may represent a suspicion of sepsis or a likelihood of sepsis. Index <b>424</b> may cover a range. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, index <b>424</b> ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being associated with a higher likelihood of sepsis. The index can be any preferred range or scale, for example, 1-10, 1-100, or alternative indicators such as red-yellow-green color-coding with or without a numerical index.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">User interface <b>400</b> may also include word cloud <b>428</b>. Word cloud <b>428</b> may include the results from several panels. The font size of the word may be proportional to the likelihood of the condition or a level of concern regarding the condition. Each condition may have an index associated with it after analysis, similar to index <b>424</b> for sepsis. Word cloud <b>428</b> may be one way to represent index results for different conditions.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">In addition, user interface <b>400</b> may include a plot <b>432</b> of an index for sepsis over time. The trend for sepsis over time may help a medical practitioner determine whether the risk of sepsis is increasing or decreasing. Trending the likelihood of sepsis may be helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, or may be helpful in monitoring patients who present with mild or inconsistent symptoms before they reach organ failure.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">User interface <b>400</b> may include different representations of the suspicion or likelihood of sepsis. The user interface may prompt the medical practitioner if treatment for sepsis is desired. If the medical practitioner indicates treatment is desired, the user interface may send an order to another medical practitioner to prepare a treatment. User interface <b>400</b> may have the look and feel of the host sepsis panel (e.g., the user interface for a particular laboratory instrument), even with individual representations being linked to other panels (which may typically be accessed on other interfaces of the host instrument, or may which may be acquired from other instruments or other data sources), which may be analyzed according to their own models and calculations. In some aspects, an institution, such as a hospital or medical practice group, or an individual user, may be able to turn on or off different indicators on user interface <b>400</b>. For example, a medical practitioner may be able to disable word clouds, test tables, or time indices if the practitioner's preferences, practice or patient population make one or more of the visualizations less helpful or distracting.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">III. Sepsis Learning Models</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">Data collected for sepsis panels may be analyzed for patterns to better develop a model or indicator of sepsis. In some instances, the values of parameters may vary from hospital to hospital. Populations near the hospital may have similar diets, a common water source, a certain ethnic makeup, and/or other similarities. As a result, the analysis for suspicion of sepsis may be refined or improved using data collected at specific site or geographic area. Additionally, panels for sepsis are not common and analyzing data generated by new panels may help arrive at an improved analysis for suspicion of sepsis. Analysis of data may be through a machine learning algorithm.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a method <b>500</b> of training and using machine learning models to estimate a likelihood of sepsis based on test blood sample data sets.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">At block <b>502</b>, method <b>500</b> may include receiving, by a computer system, a training data set including a plurality of data elements.
