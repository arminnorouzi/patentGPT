In particular, the present invention relates to a conveyor system which includes multiple robot singulators for transferring parcels from a bulk flow into a singulated stream of parcels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a sorting facility for parcels, parcels are unloaded from trucks or other vehicles at unloading locations, sorted, and then loaded onto trucks or other vehicles at loading locations for delivery to the intended recipients. Thus, within the sorting facility, there is often a complex system of conveyors and equipment that facilitates transport and sorting of the parcels within the facility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When first introduced into the system of conveyors and equipment, the parcels are randomly positioned on a conveyor in a &#x201c;bulk flow.&#x201d; Thus, within the sorting facility, the first step is often to transform the bulk flow into a singulated flow of parcels in which the parcels are positioned at substantially equal intervals and aligned (i.e., in a single file line) along a conveyor for subsequent processing. A wide variety of singulators exist in the art, many of which employ various combinations of belt conveyors and/or roller conveyors to achieve the desired singulation of the parcels. However, there are certain deficiencies in such prior art systems. For example, a surge in the volume of parcels may overwhelm the mechanical systems, and parcels may not be fully singulated. Non-singulated parcels may then interfere with subsequent processing, including downstream sorting.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 10,646,898, which is incorporated herein by reference, thus describes a system and method for identifying and transferring parcels from a bulk flow of parcels on the first conveyor (or &#x201c;pick conveyor&#x201d;) to a singulated stream of parcels on the second conveyor (or &#x201c;place conveyor&#x201d;). Specifically, a robot singulator (or robot) receives parcels via the pick conveyor, engages each parcel, and then places it onto the place conveyor. However, due to cycle time limitations (i.e., the time required for each iterative transfer of a parcel from the pick conveyor to the place conveyor), conveyor systems including only a single robot singulator may not always be capable of providing the necessary throughput required to efficiently process large parcel volumes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there remains a need for improved systems for transferring parcels from a bulk flow into a singulated stream of parcels.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is a conveyor system, which includes multiple robot singulators (or robots) for transferring parcels from a bulk flow into a singulated stream of parcels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An exemplary conveyor system made in accordance with the present invention includes: a pick conveyor defining a picking area for a bulk flow of parcels; a place conveyor positioned downstream of the picking area; a first robot singulator (or first robot) and a second robot singulator (or second robot), which work in parallel to transfer parcels within the picking area into a singulated stream on the place conveyor; and a vision and control subsystem that is operably connected to the first robot and the second robot, such that the vision and control subsystem can communicate instructions to control operation of such components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The vision and control subsystem includes a first (or target) camera configured to acquire one or more images of a predetermined region of interest (i.e., the picking area) and any parcels located therein. In some embodiments, the target camera is positioned so that that the field of view of the target camera includes the picking area as well as at least a portion of the pick conveyor located upstream of the picking area. Each image acquired by the target camera is processed within the vision and control subsystem to determine the location of parcels positioned within the picking area, if any, and, in some embodiments, the proximity of such parcels relative to each other and/or the position of one or more parcels located upstream of the picking area. Based on the determined location of the parcels within the picking area, the vision and control subsystem communicates instructions which cause the first robot and the second robot to successively transfer the parcels within the picking area to the place conveyor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, following transfer of a parcel from the picking area to the place conveyor, the vision and control subsystem communicates instructions which cause the place conveyor to be indexed, thereby creating room on the place conveyor for other parcels to be delivered. As it is not necessary for one parcel to be fully transferred from the picking area to the place conveyor before the transfer process of another parcel within the picking area commences, the parcel transfer throughput rate exhibited by the system of the present invention is thus improved relative to that of known conveyor systems including only a single robot singulator.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To reduce system downtime associated with parcel transfer from the picking area to the place conveyor, in some embodiments, the system includes a parcel transfer routine, which includes a robot selection subroutine that causes the vision and control subsystem to select either the first robot or the second robot to transfer a parcel within the picking area based on a priority queue including one or more entries assigning priority to either the first robot or the second robot, while also taking into account the availability of the first robot and the second robot. In instances where multiple parcels are positioned in the picking area, the robot selection subroutine may also cause the vision and control subsystem to select one parcel of the multiple parcels for transfer by the selected robot based on the proximity of the parcels within the multiple parcels to the selected robot. To reduce system downtime associated with image acquisition and processing, in some embodiments, the vision and control subsystem limits the number of times the target camera is selectively activated to acquire images of a grouping of multiple parcels located within the picking area at a given time based on the spacing of such parcels relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the parcel transfer routine includes a parcel pick and index subroutine that is selectively executed to reduce system downtime associated with the transfer of parcels positioned upstream of the picking area of the pick conveyor to the picking area. The pick and index subroutine reduces such downtime by causing the pick conveyor to be indexed a calculated distance to move a parcel located upstream of the picking area into the picking area immediately following (i.e. substantially simultaneously with) another parcel being removed from the picking area by either the first robot or the second robot. In some embodiments, the calculated distance is based on image data corresponding to an image acquired by the target camera. In some embodiments, the system may further include a sensor configured to acquire readings regarding the presence of parcels within the picking area of the pick conveyor. In some embodiments, indexing of the pick conveyor may be stopped in response to the sensor obtaining readings which indicate the presence of one or more parcels within the picking area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the vision and control subsystem further includes a second (or confirm camera) configured to acquire images of an area of the place conveyor (or place area) in which parcels transferred from the picking area are delivered.

is not intended to be limiting and can include any form of chute, conveyor, or conveying surface, whether static or moving, that defines a &#x201c;picking area&#x201d; where parcels can be acquired and transferred to the place conveyor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating movement cycles performed by the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> to transfer parcels from the pick conveyor <b>14</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b> of the system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> includes a first (or target) camera <b>34</b> which can be selectively activated to acquire one or more images of a predetermined region of interest (i.e., the picking area) of the pick conveyor <b>14</b> and any parcels located therein (e.g., parcels <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, and <b>50</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In this exemplary embodiment, the target camera <b>34</b> is positioned so that that the field of view of the target camera <b>34</b> includes the picking area <b>15</b> as well as at least a portion of the pick conveyor <b>14</b> located upstream of the picking area <b>15</b>. The picking area <b>15</b> of the pick conveyor <b>14</b>, in this exemplary embodiment, is defined by, and thus can be characterized as including, two separate areas: a first area <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a second area <b>15</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. Each image acquired by the target camera <b>34</b> is processed within the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> to determine the location of parcels positioned within the picking area <b>15</b>, if any. In some embodiments, the proximity of multiple parcels located within the picking area <b>15</b> at a given time relative to each other and/or the distance of parcels located upstream of the picking area <b>15</b> may also be assessed using an image acquired by the target camera <b>34</b>, as further described below. Based on the determined location of the parcels within the picking area <b>15</b>, the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> communicates instructions to either the first robot <b>20</b> or the second robot <b>22</b> to successively transfer the parcels within the picking area <b>15</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b>. Unlike conveyor systems of known construction which employ a single robot singulator, in the system <b>10</b> of the present invention, it is not necessary for one parcel to be fully transferred from the picking area <b>15</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b> before the transfer process of another parcel within the picking area <b>15</b> is commenced. Rather, by utilizing two robots <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, one parcel in the picking area <b>15</b> can be engaged for transfer by one robot (e.g., the second robot <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) while the other robot (e.g., the first robot <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is transferring another parcel to the place conveyor <b>16</b> or returning from such transfer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. The parcel throughput rate (i.e., the rate at which parcels are transferred to the place conveyor <b>16</b> in a singulated stream) is thus improved relative to that of conveyor systems of known construction employing only a single robot singulator simply by virtue of utilizing multiple robot singulators <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. As described in greater detail below, to further improve parcel throughput rate, the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> also utilizes the determined location of the parcels within the picking area <b>15</b> and the proximity of the parcels to each other to selectively activate the target camera <b>34</b>, the first and second robots <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and, in certain embodiments, the pick conveyor <b>14</b> in a manner which reduces downtime associated with image acquisition and processing, parcel transfer to the place conveyor <b>16</b> (i.e., parcel singulation), and parcel delivery to the picking area <b>15</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in this exemplary embodiment the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> further includes a second (or confirm) camera <b>36</b>, which can be selectively activated to acquire one or more images of a place area <b>17</b> of the place conveyor <b>16</b> and any parcels located therein. The place area <b>17</b> of the place conveyor <b>16</b> corresponds to the area of the place conveyor <b>16</b> in which parcels transferred by the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> are delivered. Each image acquired by the confirm camera <b>36</b> is processed within the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> to confirm transfer of a parcel to the place conveyor <b>16</b>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in this exemplary embodiment, the system <b>10</b> includes an upstream conveyor <b>12</b> that includes multiple conveyors, each configured to receive and convey a bulk flow of parcels downstream toward the pick conveyor <b>14</b>.

For each robot determined not to be in the home position, the controller <b>40</b> will communicate instructions (or signals) which cause that robot to perform a homing sequence which returns the robot to its home position, as indicated by block <b>108</b>. Once the homing sequence for each robot initially determined not to be in the home position is completed, the vision and control subsystem <b>30</b> then reassesses the positioning of the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> to determine if both are in the home position, as indicated by decision <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

In this exemplary embodiment, if no parcels are detected within the picking area <b>15</b>, the controller <b>40</b> communicates instructions which cause the upstream conveyor <b>12</b>, which, again, in this case, is defined by the feed conveyor <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the destacking conveyor <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and the pick conveyor <b>14</b> to be indexed a predetermined distance to move parcels located downstream towards the picking area <b>15</b> of the pick conveyor <b>14</b>, as indicated by block <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

To reduce downtime associated with parcel transfer from the picking area <b>15</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b> and thus improve parcel throughput rate, in this exemplary embodiment, the controller <b>40</b> selectively communicates parcel transfer instructions to the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> by following a robot selection subroutine, as indicated by decisions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and blocks <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. When executed, the robot selection subroutine causes the controller <b>40</b> to determine which robot of the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> should be selected for parcel transfer and which parcel within the picking area <b>15</b> should be transferred by the selected robot in instances where multiple parcels are located in the picking area <b>15</b> at a given time. In this exemplary embodiment, the selections resulting from execution of the robot selection subroutine are based on a priority queue, the availability of each robot, and and/or the proximity of the parcels to a selected robot, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>, the robot selection subroutine commences with the controller <b>40</b> determining whether the first robot <b>20</b> or the second robot <b>22</b> has priority to engage and transfer a parcel from the picking area <b>15</b>, as indicated by decision <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In this exemplary embodiment, whether the first robot <b>20</b> or the second robot <b>22</b> has priority to engage and transfer a parcel at a given time is dictated by a priority queue, which, at a given time, contains one or more entries corresponding to the order in which the first robot <b>20</b> and/or the second robot <b>22</b> will be given initial priority to engage and transfer parcels from the pick conveyor <b>14</b>. To reduce processing times, in this exemplary embodiment, at least the initial entry of the priority queue is predetermined and corresponds to which robot will be the first to engage and transfer a parcel within the picking area <b>15</b>.

If the robot with priority is available, the controller <b>40</b> will select that robot to effectuate transfer of a parcel from the picking area <b>15</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b>. However, in the event the robot with priority is busy or otherwise unavailable to transfer a parcel to the place conveyor <b>16</b>, the controller <b>40</b> will assess whether the robot without priority is available to transfer the parcel and instead select that robot to effectuate transfer of the parcel, provided the robot without priority is not also busy or otherwise unavailable. For instance, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as an example, if the first robot <b>20</b> has priority, but is returning from transferring a first parcel <b>50</b><i>a </i>to the place conveyor <b>16</b>, and the second robot <b>22</b> is in the home position, then the controller <b>40</b> will select the second robot <b>22</b> to effectuate transfer of a selected parcel (in this case, parcel <b>50</b><i>b</i>) in the picking area <b>15</b> to the place conveyor <b>16</b>. By determining and selecting the first available robot to effectuate transfer of a parcel, the robot selection subroutine thus effectively reduces or eliminates instances in which a selected parcel is delayed transfer due to the unavailability of a robot singulator, and, in this way, reduces or eliminates downtime associated with transferring parcels from the picking area <b>15</b> of the pick conveyor <b>14</b> to the place area <b>17</b> of the place conveyor <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>, after the first robot <b>20</b> or the second robot <b>22</b> is selected by the controller <b>40</b>, the controller <b>40</b> determines which parcel in the picking area <b>15</b> of the pick conveyor <b>14</b> will be transferred to the place conveyor <b>16</b> by the selected robot. In instances where the image data received from the first vision unit <b>31</b> indicates that only a single parcel is located within the picking area <b>15</b>, the controller <b>40</b> will communicate instructions to the selected robot to engage and transfer that parcel to the place conveyor <b>16</b>. However, in instances where the image data received by the controller <b>40</b> from the first vision unit <b>31</b> indicates multiple parcels are located within the picking area <b>15</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the controller <b>40</b> will, in this exemplary embodiment, select one of the parcels to be transferred to the place conveyor <b>16</b> based on parcel proximity to the selected robot. Specifically, in this exemplary embodiment, the controller <b>40</b> is configured to select the parcel closest to the selected robot for transfer, as indicated by blocks <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In this exemplary embodiment, the location data associated with each respective parcel corresponds to the coordinates (e.g., x-coordinate values and y-coordinate values) of the parcel within the picking area <b>15</b>. In some embodiments, the location data may further include an indication as to whether each respective parcel is located within the first area <b>15</b><i>a </i>or the second area <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the picking area <b>15</b>. In such embodiments, the controller <b>40</b> may thus determine which parcel is closest to the selected robot based on coordinates of each respective parcel, which area of the picking area <b>15</b> the parcels are located, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>, in embodiments, the location data of each respective parcel within the picking area <b>15</b> may be initially generated by the first vision unit <b>31</b> while processing the image acquired by the target camera <b>34</b> and subsequently transmitted to the controller <b>40</b>.

In this regard, the controller <b>40</b> communicates instructions which causes the first vision unit <b>31</b> to assess whether both the selected robot and the selected parcel are out of the field of view of the target camera <b>34</b> and communicate the results of such assessment to the controller <b>40</b>. To initiate this process, in some embodiments, the controller <b>40</b> may communicate instructions which cause the target camera <b>34</b> to acquire another image of the picking area <b>15</b>. In such embodiments, the processor <b>32</b> of the first vision unit <b>31</b> then processes the image and transmits image data to the controller <b>40</b> which indicates whether the selected robot and selected parcel are out of the field of view of the target camera <b>34</b>, thus indicating the selected parcel was successfully engaged and transferred out of the picking area <b>15</b>. If the controller <b>40</b> determines that the selected robot or the selected parcel are not out of the field of view of the target camera <b>34</b>, the foregoing process may be repeated after a predetermined period of time to provide the selected robot with additional time to transfer the selected parcel.

If the controller <b>40</b> does determine a parcel is being held by one of the robots, the controller <b>40</b> then communicates instructions which cause the robot holding the parcel to deliver the parcel onto the place conveyor <b>16</b>, as indicated by blocks <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Following such delivery, the controller <b>40</b> communicates instructions which cause the confirm camera <b>36</b> to acquire another image of the place area <b>17</b> of the place conveyor <b>16</b> and effectively restart the confirmation routine to confirm the delivered parcel is properly oriented. If the place conveyor <b>16</b> is indexed and no parcel is held by the first robot <b>20</b> or the second robot <b>22</b>, the system <b>10</b> will proceed to transfer any remaining parcels in need of transfer to the place conveyor <b>16</b> by executing a parcel assessment subroutine, as indicated by block <b>179</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the parcel assessment subroutine outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is preferably implemented within and defines a portion of the parcel transfer routine described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> that occurs following execution of the above-described confirmation routine.

To this end, the processor <b>42</b> of the controller <b>40</b> assesses whether the latest image data received from the first vision unit <b>31</b> indicates the presence of more than one parcel within the picking area <b>15</b>, as indicated by decision <b>182</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.

If, on the other hand, the controller <b>40</b> determines the first parcel <b>50</b><i>a </i>and the second parcel <b>50</b><i>b </i>were spaced apart the predetermined distance, the system <b>10</b> avoids such additional image acquisition and processing steps.

As a result of such change in direction, parcels offloaded from the first induction conveyor <b>620</b> or the second induction conveyor <b>622</b> onto the pitch and catch conveyor <b>624</b> are automatically reoriented in a manner which may be more amenable for subsequent sorting processes. For example, in some implementations, the pitch and catch conveyor <b>624</b> may serve to reorient parcels offloaded from the first induction conveyor <b>620</b> and the second induction conveyor <b>622</b> in a manner which causes such parcels to more readily fit into a tilt tray conveyor (not shown) positioned downstream of the pitch and catch conveyor <b>624</b>. The automatic reorientation facilitated by the pitch and catch conveyor <b>624</b> may thus serve to reduce or alleviate the need for the first robot <b>20</b> and the second robot <b>22</b> to reorient parcels transferred to the first place conveyor <b>316</b> and the second place conveyor <b>318</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, this conveyor system <b>700</b> (or system <b>700</b>) includes the same conveyor arrangement as the system <b>600</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, except for the conveyors positioned downstream of the first place conveyor <b>316</b> and the second place conveyor <b>318</b>.
