Accordingly, nanofiltration membranes have pores that are smaller than those used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration but larger than those found in reverse-osmosis membranes (typically on the order of about 0.1 nm). Nanofiltration is used in filtration applications involving aqueous liquids for the removal of organic compounds, or in some cases for the selective removal of larger ionic compounds, such as sulfates.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A serial filtration system and methods for its use and fabrication are described herein, where various embodiments of the apparatus and methods may include some or all of the elements, features and steps described below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A serial filtration system for liquid purification includes a preliminary-stage, reverse-osmosis module, including (a) a preliminary-stage chamber including a preliminary-stage inlet; a preliminary-stage, retentate outlet; and a preliminary-stage permeate outlet; (b) at least one preliminary-stage, reverse-osmosis membrane mounted in the preliminary-stage chamber and separating the preliminary-stage chamber into a retentate side, including the preliminary-stage inlet and the preliminary-stage, retentate outlet, on an upstream side of the preliminary-stage reverse-osmosis membrane and a permeate side, including the preliminary-stage permeate outlet, on a downstream side of the preliminary-stage reverse-osmosis membrane. The serial filtration system also includes a first-stage, high-permeability, reverse-osmosis module, including (a) a first-stage chamber including a first-stage inlet; a first-stage retentate outlet; and a first-stage permeate outlet, wherein the first-stage inlet is in fluid communication with the preliminary-stage, retentate outlet; and (b) at least one first-stage, oxidized membrane, comprising an oxidized polyamide active layer coated on a porous support, wherein the oxidized polyamide active layer has an atomic oxygen/nitrogen (O/N) ratio of at least 1.5, and wherein the first-stage, oxidized membrane is mounted in the first-stage chamber and separates the first-stage chamber into a retentate side, including the first-stage inlet and the first-stage, retentate outlet, on an upstream side of the first-stage, oxidized membrane and a permeate side, including the first-stage permeate outlet, on a downstream side of the first-stage oxidized membrane.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a method for serial filtration using a serial filtration system, as described above, a feed liquid comprising a solvent and dissolved ions is fed through the preliminary-stage inlet into the preliminary-stage chamber; and a pressure on the retentate side of the preliminary-stage, reverse-osmosis module is established that is greater than a pressure on the permeate side of the preliminary-stage chamber. A solvent in a preliminary-stage permeate is preferentially passed from the retentate side of the preliminary-stage chamber through the preliminary-stage, reverse-osmosis membrane into the permeate side of the preliminary-stage chamber while retaining a preliminary-stage retentate brine with an increased concentration of the dissolved ions on the retentate side of the preliminary-stage chamber. The preliminary-stage retentate brine is removed through the preliminary-stage, retentate outlet and then directed through the first-stage inlet into the first-stage chamber; and a pressure in the retentate side of the first-stage chamber is established that is greater than a pressure in the permeate side of the first-stage chamber. A solvent in a first-stage permeate is preferentially passed from the retentate side of the first-stage chamber through the first-stage, oxidized membrane into the permeate side of the first-stage chamber while a first-stage retentate brine with a further-increased concentration of the dissolved ions is retained on the retentate side of the first-stage chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for fabricating an oxidized membrane for high-permeability, reverse osmosis includes providing a reverse-osmosis membrane comprising a polyamide layer coated on a porous support. The polyamide layer is exposed to an oxidant to create a chlorine loading of 1-10% in the polyamide layer. Methods described herein combine a process of oxidizing membranes to create pores in the active layer of a reverse-osmosis membrane and successively desalinating water via multi-stage filtration using the oxidized membranes. Additionally, tuning the oxidation process can result in a membrane with appropriate permeability characteristics. Furthermore, fouled membranes can be oxidized to revive permeability. Also disclosed is a method for treating membranes to reduce permeability for use in multi-stage filtration processes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The oxidation process described herein facilitates careful control of the resultant membrane's salt and water permeabilities as well as resulting in a membrane with high water permeability. Existent commercial membranes are not suitable for use in desalination via multi-staged high-permeability reverse osmosis (HiRO) because they lack these properties. Existing reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes are insufficiently permeable to both salts and water, requiring a prohibitively high pressures and/or large membrane areas. Existing nanofiltration (NF) membranes allow too great a proportion of salts to pass, resulting in a need for large numbers of successive stages. Because each stage requires re-pressurization of the permeate, such systems are extremely energy intensive. In addition, existing NF membranes concentrate divalent ions while allowing a high proportion of monovalent ions to permeate, resulting in increased risk of divalent salt precipitation. Accordingly, the membranes described herein can offer substantial advantages over previous membranes and can uniquely enable the practice of the multi-stage desalination methods described herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a multi-stage desalination system employing oxidized membranes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) images of the cross-section of a membrane sample, showing an oxidized polyamide active layer on porous substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are SEM images of the surface of the oxidized active layer on a membrane.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the accompanying drawings, like reference characters refer to the same or similar parts throughout the different views; and apostrophes are used to differentiate multiple instances of the same item or different embodiments of items sharing the same reference numeral.

Both the hydraulic pressure required to desalinate a saline influent stream and the salinity of the resulting permeate can be controlled by manipulating the permeability of the membrane. As described herein, specially engineered desalination membranes with a manipulated permeability are used to partially desalinate an influent saline stream in successive steps. A greater portion of the influent ions pass through these membranes compared to reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes, reducing the hydraulic pressure required to drive the desalination process. A greater portion of the influent ions are rejected by the membrane compared to nanofiltration (NF) membranes, reducing permeate salinity. Highly saline streams can be efficiently desalinated using this process because the higher permeability reduces the required hydraulic pressure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Processes for serial filtration with membranes have been proposed in the past. However, a serial membrane-filtration process is believed to have never been commercialized because a suitable membrane was lacking. A suitable membrane for the serial-filtration process is herein advantageously provided with a carefully selected ion permeability while maintaining the membrane's high permeability to water. If the ion permeability is too great, the resulting permeate will be insufficiently desalinated, requiring an economically prohibitive number of membrane stages. If the ion permeability is too low for a given water permeability, the pressure required to desalinate will be impractically high. Furthermore, low ion permeability will reduce ion permeation into the membrane, thus reducing the osmotic-pressure-reducing effect of the bulk osmotic pressure on the permeate side. High water permeability is advantageous to reduce the required membrane area to an economically feasible quantity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ion permeability can be calculated from the ion flux through the membrane; and the respective concentrations of ions on either side of the membrane can be calculated using equation 1, below:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>J</i><sub>S</sub><i>=B</i>(<i>C</i><sub>F</sub><i>&#x2212;C</i><sub>P</sub>) &#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0025" num="0000">In the above equation, J<sub>s</sub>, represents the ion flux; C<sub>F </sub>represents the concentration of ions on the feed side of the membrane; C<sub>P </sub>represents the concentration of ions on the permeate side of the membrane; and B represents the ion permeability. Ion permeability is highly dependent on the species of ions in the feed stream and on the ion concentrations on either side of the membrane and is thus a property that is a function of the feed stream as well as the membrane</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">Water permeability, A, can be calculated from the water flux, J<sub>w</sub>, through the membrane; the hydraulic pressure differential, &#x394;P, across the membrane; and the osmotic differential, &#x394;&#x3c0;, across the membrane, as shown below in equation 2:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>J<sub>w</sub><i>=A</i>(&#x394;<i>P</i>&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3c0;) &#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">The ratio of ion permeability to water permeability during operation can be particularly important because this ratio determines the salinity of the permeate stream. Thus, the ratio and the magnitude of permeabilities are the parameters on which the suitability of the membrane depends. Commercial nanofiltration membranes have insufficient rejection rates, letting too many ions pass through, while commercial reverse-osmosis membranes have insufficient water permeability. In addition, commercial nanofiltration membranes preferentially reject divalent ions. Divalent ions can form insoluble salts at sufficiently high concentrations. Therefore, the risk of salt precipitation is great with the use of nanofiltration membranes for high-salinity desalination.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025">A typical reverse-osmosis membrane includes a thin polyamide active layer (about 100-200-nm thick and formed, e.g., via a polymerization of acid chloride and diamine) deposited on a polyethersulfone or polysulfone porous layer <b>28</b> (about 50-&#x3bc;m thick), which can be coated on a non-woven fabric support sheet <b>30</b> (about 150-&#x3bc;m thick and formed, e.g., of polyester). The polyamide active layer serves as the main selective barrier to passage of the dissolved salt through the membrane. The membranes used for this process are manufactured by partially oxidizing the polyamide active layer of such a reverse-osmosis membrane, creating pores in the oxidized active layer <b>26</b>, as shown in the SEM images of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">The active layer of a reverse-osmosis membrane faces the retentate side in an RO chamber, while the porous support on which the active layer is deposited faces the permeate side; and the active layer is typically composed of a fully aromatic polyamide, The aromatic polyamide is formed from an interfacial polymerization process in which an aqueous solution of aromatic amine monomers is brought into contact with aromatic acid chloride monomers dissolved in an organic solvent. The reaction resets in a crosslinked polymer. Oxidation of the resulting active layer can have several effects, one of which is reducing this crosslinking by cleavage of C&#x2014;N bonds and formation of COOH&#x2014; groups. This effect of oxidation, which can be measured, can increase the membrane permeability and reduce rejection of solutes. When a polyamide is fully crosslinked, all oxygen and nitrogen in the active layer form amide groups, resulting in a 1:1 atomic oxygen/nitrogen (O/N) ratio, whereas a 2:1 atomic O/N ratio indicates a linear polyamide in which a free carboxyl (COOH&#x2014;) is present for every two amide groups in the polymer. These atomic ratios in the active layer can be measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is a highly surface-sensitive technique capable of detecting the elemental composition of the 1-<sub>5 </sub>nm of the active layer closest to the surface. The pores created by this process may have a molecular weight cutoff (MWC) of 100-200 Daltons</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">The active layers of typical virgin reverse-osmosis membranes have a high degree of crosslinking. In some cases, the unoxidized membrane may have a fully crosslinked active layer, having an atomic O/N ratio of 1:1. In some cases, the unoxidized membrane may have a highly crosslinked active layer, having an atomic O/N ratio, e.g., of 1.1:1, of 1.2:1, of 1.3:1, of 1.4:1, or of another ratio in a range from any of the preceding ratios to another of the preceding ratios. As described above, oxidizing the membrane may decrease the degree of crosslinking in the active layer, resulting in an increased atomic O/N ratio. For example, the quantity of atomic oxygen relative to atomic nitrogen may be increased by at least 0.1, by at least 0.15, by at least 0.2, by at least 0.25, by at least 0.3 or by at least 0.35, or in some cases by at least 0.4. The resulting oxidized polyamide active layer may have a relatively high atomic O/N ratio of 1.5:1, of 1,6:1, of 1.7:1, of 1.8:1, of 1.9:1, or in some cases as high as 1.99:1. In other exemplifications, the atomic O/N ratio of the resulting oxidized polyamide active layer can be at least any of the above ratios; or the resulting oxidized membrane can have an atomic O/N ratio in a range from any of the preceding ratios to another of the preceding ratios. The atomic O/N ratios referenced herein and in the claims are as-measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. If the active layer is coated with another layer, the atomic O/N ratio may be higher than the above ratios for uncoated active layers.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">When the oxidant that is used to create these pores is chlorine-based, for example, sodium hypochlorite, the level of oxidation can be quantified by measuring the chlorine loading of the active layer. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the chlorine-based oxidant (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) interacts with aromatic polyamide to induce hydrolysis of C&#x2014;N bonds to reduce the degree of cross linking and to cause incorporation of chlorine into the membrane matrix. This latter effect, the incorporation of chlorine into the membrane matrix, can be quantified as chlorine loading, defined as the percentage of chlorine content in the oxidized active layer <b>26</b>. Chlorine loading is typically measured by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), for example, by using a Kratos AXIS Ultra XPS spectrometer at 1 eV resolution. The oxidation process is carefully controlled to result in suitable permeabilities. For a membrane with a 100-200-nm-thick active layer, an oxidant concentration-time of 5,000 to 50,000 parts per million (ppm)&#xd7;hours (h) results in a membrane with a water permeability of 1 to 3 (liter/m<sup>2</sup>/hour)/bar (LMH/bar). These permeability properties of the resulting membrane are between those typical of commercial reverse-osmosis membranes and nanofiltration membranes. Divalent-ion permeability is similar to monovalent-ion permeability, such that the composition of the permeate is similar to the composition of the influent and retentate streams. This property is contrasted with typical nanofiltration membranes in which monovalent-ion permeabilities tend to be significantly greater than divalent-ion permeabilities.

The number of RO membranes <b>22</b> is dependent on design criteria, such as influent concentration and flow rate, and hydraulic pressure. The RO membrane modules may have a spiral wound configuration, a hollow fiber configuration, or any other configuration known in the art. In the exemplary system, the membrane area is 89 m<sup>2 </sup>for a 7.7% salinity influent (feed liquid) flowing at 1.2 m<sup>3</sup>/h, and a hydraulic pressure of 69 bar (6.9 MPa). Most commercial reverse-osmosis membranes (e.g., FILMTEC&#x2122; SW30XHR-440i membranes from The Dow Chemical Company, SWC5 MAX membranes from Hydranautics, and AD-440membranes from SUEZ Water Technologies &#x26; Solutions) are suitable for this application.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">Each high-permeability reverse-osmosis (HiRO) stage comprises at least one HiRO membrane module <b>14</b>/<b>16</b>/<b>18</b> arranged in parallel, series, or some combination thereof.

The oxidized membrane <b>24</b> (further discussed, below) of the HiRO membrane module can advantageously have a salt-permeation rate of 15 to 85% for saline streams including 7 to 20% salinity, respectively. Salt permeates by diffusion, and the rate of diffusion depends on the magnitude of the salt concentration. Therefore, the salt-permeation rate of an oxidized membrane <b>24</b> is dependent on the salinity of the feed stream. For example, an oxidized membrane <b>24</b> can have a salt-permeation rate of 33% for a 9% salinity feed stream and a 85% salt-permeation rate for a 20% salinity feed stream at similar hydraulic conditions. Like salt-permeation rate, the water permeability of an oxidized membrane <b>24</b> is also dependent on salinity. However, the rate of water permeation also depends on how much the hydraulic pressure of the feed exceeds the osmotic pressure. An oxidized membrane <b>24</b> operated at a pressure of 69 bar (6.9 MPa) can advantageously have a water-permeation rate of 35 to 15 liters per square meter per hour for saline feed streams including 7 to 20% salinity, respectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">The oxidized membranes <b>24</b> are typically flat sheets wrapped in a spiral around a permeate conducting center tube.

Oxidation of the membranes is allowed to proceed for 1 to 50 hours. It has been found that pH, free-chlorine concentration, and oxidation time determine the characteristics of the oxidized membrane, and at similar pH levels the free-chlorine concentration and time can be adjusted proportionally to achieve similar results.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">After oxidation, the sodium-hypochlorite solution is drained from the vessel, and the membranes are rinsed with a mixture of sodium bisulfate and pure water to remove residual oxidant solution until the chlorine concentration in the rinsate reaches zero mg/l.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">The concentration, pH and time of the oxidation step are optimized for high water permeability and high rejection of a targeted ion or set of ions. As mentioned previously, the permeability of ions through the membrane is highly dependent on the constituent ions in the feed stream. For seawater concentration and other desalination applications, the concentration-time is typically optimized for the rejection of sodium chloride. The membrane oxidation can also be optimized for the rejection of lithium for the purpose of concentrating brines including lithium oxide, which may be advantageous for lithium-salt-production processes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0039">Due to fouling or compaction, the water permeability of the oxidized membranes <b>24</b> described herein may reduce during operation.

This permeability can be reduced by introducing a rejection-enhancement agent to the retentate side of the membrane. Suitable rejection-enhancement agents include polyvinyl methyl ether (PVME), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and/or tannic acid.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">The membrane rejection-restoration process can be performed offline or online (during desalination).

In this optional step, a first solution comprising citric acid and having a pH of about 4 can be recirculated across the retentate side of the membrane for a period up to 1 hour at a pressure similar to the operating pressure. Once the low-pH solution is discharged, a high-pH solution comprising sodium tripolyphosphate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) having a pH of about 10 can be recirculated across the retentate side of the oxidized membrane <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">After the optional cleaning step, a coating step is performed comprising the introduction and recirculation of a solution of rejection-enhancement agents across the retentate side of the oxidized membrane <b>24</b> for a period of 5-30 minutes. Pressures of at least 150 psi (1 MPa) are applied, via the pumps <b>20</b>, to ensure penetration of the rejection-enhancement agent into the oxidized membrane <b>24</b>. The temperature of the solution is maintained so as not to exceed the critical solution temperature (also called the cloud point). For polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol, this limitation is usually beyond the operational limitations of the oxidized membrane <b>24</b> and, therefore, not of much concern; but, for polyvinyl methyl ether, the temperature limitation of about 34 to 37&#xb0; C. is observed. After the coating step is complete, a solution of tannic acid (TA) can be introduced to and recirculated across the retentate side of the oxidized membrane <b>24</b> for a period of 5-30 minutes.
