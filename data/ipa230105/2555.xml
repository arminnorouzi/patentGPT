In one aspect, the polymer is an alternating copolymer, a block copolymer, a random copolymer, a branched copolymer, a crosslinked copolymer, or a copolymer (e.g., a copolymer comprising more than one type of monomer) comprising both. In another aspect, the polymer may be a homopolymer (e.g., a copolymer comprising one monomer).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034">Hereinafter, unless otherwise defined herein, &#x201c;polyamic acid&#x201d; may refer to a polymer comprising a structural unit having an amic acid moiety, and &#x201c;polyimide&#x201d; may refer to a polymer comprising a structural unit having an imide moiety.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">Hereinafter, unless otherwise defined herein, the term &#x201c;mura phenomenon&#x201d; may be interpreted to encompass all distortion phenomena caused by light that may be caused at a specific angle. For example, a display device including a polyimide based film may include distortions by light, such as a blackout phenomenon in which a screen appears black, a hot spot phenomenon, or a rainbow phenomenon having iridescent stains.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">Hereinafter, a polyimide based film for a cover window according to an embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">The polyimide based film is attracting attention as a material to replace expensive tempered glass used as a conventional cover window, but the polyimide based film is distorted by light. However, since a phenomenon generated by light is directly visible to the cover window formed at an outermost part of the display device, it is very important that distortion by light does not occur. Accordingly, there is a need for the polyimide based film capable of fundamentally solving problems caused by the distortion by light.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">The polyimide based film for a cover window according to the embodiment may comprise a structural unit derived from a dianhydride, and a structural unit derived from a diamine, and specifically, the structural unit derived from the dianhydride may comprise a structural unit derived from a compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 below and a structural unit derived from a compound represented by Chemical Formula 2 below, and the structural unit derived from the diamine may comprise a structural unit derived from a compound represented by Chemical Formula 3 below and a structural unit derived from a compound represented by Chemical Formula 4 below. Here, in the polyimide based film, a thickness may be 30 to 150 &#x3bc;m, an absolute value of retardation Rth in a thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm may be 500 nm or less, and a yellow index (YI) according to ASTM E313 may be 3.5 or less. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce a distortion by light of the cover window including the polyimide based film for the cover window by having excellent transparency even in a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m or more and reducing the distortion by light. In addition, when viewed from various angles while being able to replace tempered glass, it is possible to provide better optical physical properties compared to the conventional polyimide based film by remarkably improving rainbow mura which forms iridescent stains.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="168.23mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230002556A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">The retardation value in the thickness direction may be measured at normal temperature before heating the film, and the normal temperature may be a temperature in a state in which temperature control is not artificially performed. For example, the room temperature may be 20&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C., 20&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C., or 23&#xb0; C. to 26&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">As described above, the polyimide based film for a cover window may comprise structural units derived from the compounds represented by the Chemical Formulas 1 to 4, thereby more improving the distortion phenomenon by light compared to a polyimide based film including a polyimide polymer having a rigid structure. For example, in the polyimide based film for a cover window according to the embodiment, the structural unit derived from the dianhydride may not comprise a rigid structural unit, and may not comprise, for example, a structural unit derived from a dianhydride in which two anhydride groups are fused to one ring. The ring may be a single ring or a fused ring, and may be an aromatic ring, an aliphatic ring, or a combination thereof. Specifically, the structural unit derived from the dianhydride may not comprise a structural unit derived from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), a structural unit derived from cyclobutane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (CBDA), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">Accordingly, the polyimide based film for a cover window according to the embodiment may implement a low retardation in the thickness direction while being transparent even at a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m or more, and further improve visibility, thereby further reducing eye fatigue when the cover window including the polyimide based film for a cover window is used. In addition, even if the polyimide based film for a cover window has a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m or more, since the polyimide based film for a cover window may further improve excellent optical characteristics, the polyimide based film may further improve mechanical strength such as modulus, and further improve dynamic bending physical properties, and thus, may be more suitable for application as a cover window of a flexible display device that repeatedly performs a folding and unfolding operation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042">For example, the polyimide based film for a cover window may satisfy Expression 1 below. By satisfying Expression 1, the polyimide based film for a cover window may have positive dispersion characteristics, and may have a substantially constant retardation value in a thickness direction even when moving to a long wavelength region. Accordingly, the polyimide based film for a cover window may provide a better viewing angle and visibility, and minimize wavelength dispersion to further improve a reflective appearance.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1.06&#x2264;<i>R</i>th(450 nm)/<i>R</i>th(550 nm)&#x2264;1.10&#x2003;&#x2003;[Expression 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0049" num="0043">[in the Expression 1 above,</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044">Rth (450 nm) is an absolute value (unit, nm) of retardation in a thickness direction at a wavelength of 450 nm, and</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">Rth (550 nm) is an absolute value (unit, nm) of retardation in a thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm.]</p><p id="p-0052" num="0046">For example, in the Expression 1 above, Rth (450 nm)/Rth (550 nm) may be 1.095 or less, for example, 1.09 or less.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0047">For example, the polyimide based film for a cover window may satisfy Expression 2 below.

By comprising the structural unit derived from the dianhydride as described above, even when the thickness of the polyimide based film for a cover window is 30 &#x3bc;m or more, it is possible to have better mechanical physical properties such as modulus and breaking elongation as well as providing more transparent and low retardation in a thickness direction.

in the polyimide based film for a cover window according to Examples 1 to 9, even at a thickness of 50 m or more, which is sufficient for use as a cover window, the absolute value of the retardation in the thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm is 500 nm or less, and the yellow index (YI) according to ASTM E313 is 3.5 or less. Therefore, the polyimide based film for a cover window according to Examples 1 to 9 has the low retardation Rth in the thickness direction in a wide visible ray region, and thus, has the high breaking elongation with the high strength characteristics while remarkably improving the reflective appearance, so the polyimide based film may be suitable to be applied as a cover window of a foldable display device or a flexible display device.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0131">On the other hand, it could be seen that the polyimide based film for a cover window according to Comparative Example 1 has a low breaking elongation of 5% or less, and thus, has low mechanical physical properties, so the polyimide based film is not suitable for application for a cover window, and the polyimide film for a cover window of Comparative Examples 2 to 4 has the absolute value of the retardation in the thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm as high as 500 nm or more, and thus is not suitable for application for cover windows. In addition, it could be seen that the polyimide based film for a cover window of Comparative Examples 3 and 4 is a colored film with poor visibility since it has very high absolute value of retardation in the thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm as 1800 nm and 2800 nm, and a very high yellow index of 53 and 80, and thus, is not suitable for application as a cover window.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0132">Hereinabove, although one embodiment has been described by limited examples, these are only provided to help a more general understanding of the present disclosure.
