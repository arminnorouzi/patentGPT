It should be noted that the service method for HU software in the embodiments of the disclosure may be applied to a service apparatus for HU software in the embodiments of the disclosure, and the apparatus may be configured in an electronic device. The electronic device may be a mobile terminal, such as a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, and other hardware devices with various operating systems.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the service method for HU software includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>101</b>, software-related operations are obtained.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the embodiment of the disclosure, taking a mobile device terminal being a mobile phone as an example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, mobile phone software may be projected to the HU software, and the software-related operations to the HU software may be performed by the mobile phone software, or the software-related operations may be performed directly on the HU software. In an example, a Carlife communication protocol is used to project an application from a mobile device to the HU, so that their respective advantages may be sufficiently utilized to provide safe and rich information entertainment experiences.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to accurately obtain the software-related operations, when the software-related operations are directly performed on the HU software, the service apparatus for HU software may obtain the software-related operations of the HU software. Alternatively, the software-related operations of the mobile phone software corresponding to the HU software may be obtained by connecting the service apparatus for HU software and the mobile phone software.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>102</b>, service interfaces of operation services corresponding to the software-related operations in HU system software are determined.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be understood that different software-related operations correspond to different operation services, and different operation service correspond to different service interfaces in the HU system software. Therefore, in the embodiment of the disclosure, in order to accurately determine the service interfaces of the operation services corresponding to the software-related operations in the HU system software, the service interfaces of the operation services corresponding to the software-related operations may be determined in the HU system according to the software-related operations. It should be noted that the operation services may include at least one of the following services: video decoding service, in-vehicle data management service, audio focus service and Bluetooth phone service. The service interfaces may include a vehicle control interface and a data forward interface. The vehicle control interface corresponds to the video decoding service, the audio focus service and the Bluetooth phone service. The data forward interface corresponds to the in-vehicle data management service.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step <b>103</b>, the service interfaces are called to obtain an execution result of the software-related operations by the operation services.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The service apparatus for HU software can call the service interfaces of the operation services corresponding to the software-related operations in the HU system software, and the operation services in the HU system software can execute the software-related operations, to generate an execution result.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In conclusion, by calling the service interfaces of the operation services corresponding to the software-related operations in the HU system software, the result of the software-related operations executed by the operation services is obtained, and connection protocols in the HU software and the service interfaces of the HU system software are split. Further, upgrading the HU software does not involve in an illegal call of the service interfaces, which improves the security of the HU system software.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to make the execution result of the software-related operations by the operation services more intuitive, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a second embodiment of the disclosure.

In the embodiment of the disclosure, the service apparatus for HU software can receive software version files sent by the mobile device corresponding to the HU software, and upgrade the HU software according to the software version files. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>401</b>, software-related operations are obtained.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>402</b>, service interfaces of operation services corresponding to the software-related operations in a head unit system software are determined.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>403</b>, the service interfaces are called to obtain an execution result of the software-related operations by the operation services.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step <b>404</b>, software version files sent by the mobile device software corresponding to the HU software are obtained, in which each of version numbers of the software version files is greater than a current version number of the HU software.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, the method includes: starting a receiving operation in response to receiving first command word data sent by the mobile device software; ceasing the receiving operation in response to receiving second command word data sent by the mobile device software; and obtaining the software version files by integrating the received data and performing integrity verification.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">That is, after a connection between the HU software and the mobile device software is established, the mobile device software can send an instruction to obtain HU software version information to the HU software, and the HU software sends the current version information to the mobile device software. In addition, after receiving the current version information sent by the HU software, the mobile device software may send a network request for upgrading the HU software according to the current version number of the HU software in the current version information, so as to obtain the software version files with version numbers greater than the current version number of the HU software. Further, the mobile device software may send the software version files with version numbers greater than the current version number of the HU software to the service apparatus for HU software.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As an example, in order to improve the integrity of the software version files, the mobile device software may send the first command word data to the service apparatus for HU software, and the service apparatus for HU software starts the receiving operation in response to receiving the first command word data sent by the mobile device software. When transmission of the software version files from the mobile device software to the service apparatus for HU software is completed, the mobile device software may send the second command word data to the service apparatus for HU software. When the second command word data sent by the mobile device software is received, the service apparatus for HU software ceases the receiving operation, and integrates the received data and performs integrity verification, to obtain the software version files.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>405</b>, the HU software is upgraded according to the software version files in response to the HU software being not in use.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to improve user experience, in the embodiment of the disclosure, after obtaining the software version files whose version number is greater than the current version number of the HU software, the HU software is upgraded according to the software version files in response to the HU software being not in use.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the specific implementation process of upgrading the HU software according to the software version files can be as follows.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">1. The mobile device software and the HU software establish a connection through an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) protocol in a wired or wireless manner.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">2. After the connection is established, the mobile device software sends an instruction to obtain the HU software version information, and then the HU software returns the version information of the current HU software to the mobile device software.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">3. After the mobile device software obtains the HU software version information, it can send a network request for obtaining version upgrade information.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">4. The cloud returns the current configuration version information, and the contents of the version information include a version number of the current cloud configuration, MD5 value (verification value) of the current file, description contents of new version files, and the uniform resource locator (URL) of the software version files to be downloaded.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">5. The mobile device software compares the version number returned by the cloud with the currently installed version number obtained from the HU software.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">6. If the version number is greater than the current version number of the HU software, the mobile device software requests the cloud to download the software version files according to the URL of the HU software to be upgraded.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">7. The cloud downloads the downloaded software version files to a cache directory specified by the mobile device software.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">8. The downloaded software version files are verified by the mobile device software, to determine the safety of the downloaded files, and save the software version files.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">9. After the verification is completed, the mobile device software starts to send the files to the HU software. Transmission medium can be universal serial bus (USB) wired transmission or wireless fidelity (WiFi) wireless transmission. The design logic of the file transfer protocol is as follows. Before the file transfer starts, the command word data MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_START is sent to inform the HU software to start transferring the files.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">10. After receiving the command word data MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_START, the HU software analyzes the current data packet. The package body data content mainly includes: a MD5 value of a file, a file size, a file name and other related data, mainly used for reliability verification of the transferred file.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">11. The HU software returns a response data packet MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_READY to the mobile device software to declare that the HU software is ready and can accept the software version file data.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">12. After the mobile device software receives a ready instruction, it sends packet header data &#x201c;MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_DATA&#x201d; and package body data to the HU software, and the package body data includes byte content after conversion of the software version files.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">13. When the HU software receives the packet header data &#x201c;MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_DATA&#x201d; and package body data, the package body data may be read and written into the file cache directory named with the transferred file.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">14. The mobile device continuously transmits data until the whole file transmission is completed, then a data packet with a command word of MSG_FILE_TRANSFER_END is sent to inform the HU software that the transmission is completed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">15. The HU software needs to verify the integrity and security of the received files.
