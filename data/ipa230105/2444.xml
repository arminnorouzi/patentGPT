These alterations to biophysical properties may occur at almost any point during and after peptide and protein production. Because these alterations to biophysical characteristics may affect the safety, efficacy, and shelf-life of therapeutic peptides and proteins, it is important to identify different variants for particular therapeutic peptides or proteins, and furthermore to interrogate the modifications responsible for charge variants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Isoelectric focusing (IEF) has become a common tool for separating components of a sample based on charge (pI), thus allowing for the separation of charge variants of a protein.

However, conventional methods are limited in the techniques that can be used in IEF-MS analysis.

Fractions may be collected in a high-throughput fashion such that they represent the entire sample output from the isoelectric focusing step and may comprise narrow intervals, for example, 15 second intervals. Fractions are further processed using desalting size exclusion chromatography, which separates analytes by size in addition to modifying the fraction buffer to be compatible with mass spectrometry analysis. Finally, the eluate from desalting size exclusion chromatography is subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, which can be used to identify specific post-translational modifications corresponding to each fraction and thus to each charge variant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This disclosure provides a method for characterization of charge variants of a protein of interest.

IEF has become a more common approach because of its capacity for high-resolution separation of sample components based on pI, and its ability to take into account both surface-exposed and internal amino acids with no loss of resolution due to hydrophobic interactions. IEF, particularly capillary IEF (cIEF), can also be combined with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to gain further information on a protein sample. However, the buffers used for cIEF and MS are not immediately compatible, which creates difficulties in using the sample separated by cIEF for MS analysis. Two main approaches have been taken to solve this issue, using either offline or online connection to MS.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">When using an offline connection, fractions from cIEF are collected, the buffer is modified to be compatible with MS, and the modified fractions are subjected to MS analysis. However, fraction collection from cIEF has been low-throughput, resulting in few, large fractions being collected, which reduces the resolution and specificity of charge variant analysis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Alternatively, an online connection can be used, outputting the separated sample from cIEF into MS without a fraction collection step. This requires intermediate online steps such as interim chromatography or dialysis to modify the sample buffer between cIEF and MS analysis. While this online connection preserves the high resolution separation of cIEF, it does not allow for alternative processing of cIEF-separated samples, for example digestion or reduction of a protein of interest, and thus is limited to intact mass analysis.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Thus, there exists a need for methods and systems to characterize charge variants of a protein of interest in a flexible and high resolution manner. Particularly, there exists a need for a method to identify site-specific protein modifications associated with charge variants.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">This disclosure sets forth a novel method to identify site-specific protein modifications associated with charge variants of a protein of interest. The method employs cIEF with an offline connection to MS. Unlike previous approaches, cIEF fractions are collected in a comprehensive and high-throughput fashion, for example collecting all output from a cIEF capillary, separated into fractions each representing a 15 second interval. This novel high-throughput fraction collection allows for offline processing of cIEF-separated samples with no substantive loss of pI resolution. Collected fractions may be further processed, for example, by contacting them with hydrolytic agents and/or reducing agents to produce reduced peptides for reduced peptide mapping analysis. Collected fractions may be subjected to a variety of processing steps according to the needs of the user, or no processing steps if used, for example, for intact mass analysis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Collected fractions are then individually subjected to desalting size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as described for example in Yan et al., 2020<i>, J Am Soc Mass Spectrom, </i>31:2171-2179. This high-throughput desalting SEC method allows for efficient processing of fractions, further separating sample components by size as well as modifying the fraction buffer to be compatible with MS. The desalting SEC system may be connected online to a mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Fractions output from desalting SEC are subjected to MS analysis, for example intact mass analysis or reduced peptide mapping analysis. MS analysis creates fragments of analytes and separates them based on mass-to-charge (m z) ratio. This separation allows for the identification of modifications to the protein, such as PTMs. In particular, the resolution of reduced peptide mapping analysis allows for site-specific identification of PTMs, for example identifying a specific chemical change at a specific amino acid residue on the protein of interest. An identified site-specific modification, arising from a known cIEF fraction, can then be associated with a specific charge variant of the protein of interest. This method allows for high-resolution, high-throughput analysis of site-specific protein modifications that give rise to charge variants, allowing for monitoring and improvement of therapeutic protein production processes in order to validate and optimize protein biophysical characteristics and homogeneity.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Unless described otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region comprises one domain (CL1). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. In different embodiments of the invention, the FRs of the anti-big-ET-1 antibody (or antigen-binding portion thereof) may be identical to the human germline sequences or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus sequence may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs. The term &#x201c;antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, also includes antigen-binding fragments of full antibody molecules. The terms &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; of an antibody, &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, for example, from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and optionally constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, for example, commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino acids, etc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">As used herein, an &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; includes a portion of an intact antibody, such as, for example, the antigen-binding or variable region of an antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, a Fab fragment, a Fab&#x2032; fragment, a F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment, a scFv fragment, a Fv fragment, a dsFv diabody, a dAb fragment, a Fd&#x2032; fragment, a Fd fragment, and an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) region, as well as triabodies, tetrabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multi specific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Fv fragments are the combination of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, and ScFv proteins are recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which immunoglobulin light and heavy chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker. In some exemplary embodiments, an antibody fragment comprises a sufficient amino acid sequence of the parent antibody of which it is a fragment that it binds to the same antigen as does the parent antibody; in some exemplary embodiments, a fragment binds to the antigen with a comparable affinity to that of the parent antibody and/or competes with the parent antibody for binding to the antigen. An antibody fragment may be produced by any means. For example, an antibody fragment may be enzymatically or chemically produced by fragmentation of an intact antibody and/or it may be recombinantly produced from a gene encoding the partial antibody sequence. Alternatively, or additionally, an antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a single chain antibody fragment. Alternatively, or additionally, an antibody fragment may comprise multiple chains that are linked together, for example, by disulfide linkages. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a multi-molecular complex. A functional antibody fragment typically comprises at least about 50 amino acids and more typically comprises at least about 200 amino acids.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The term &#x201c;bispecific antibody&#x201d; includes an antibody capable of selectively binding two or more epitopes. Bispecific antibodies generally comprise two different heavy chains with each heavy chain specifically binding a different epitope-either on two different molecules (e.g., antigens) or on the same molecule (e.g., on the same antigen). If a bispecific antibody is capable of selectively binding two different epitopes (a first epitope and a second epitope), the affinity of the first heavy chain for the first epitope will generally be at least one to two or three or four orders of magnitude lower than the affinity of the first heavy chain for the second epitope, and vice versa. The epitopes recognized by the bispecific antibody can be on the same or a different target (e.g., on the same or a different protein). Bispecific antibodies can be made, for example, by combining heavy chains that recognize different epitopes of the same antigen. For example, nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain variable sequences that recognize different epitopes of the same antigen can be fused to nucleic acid sequences encoding different heavy chain constant regions and such sequences can be expressed in a cell that expresses an immunoglobulin light chain.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A typical bispecific antibody has two heavy chains each having three heavy chain CDRs, followed by a CH1 domain, a hinge, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain, and an immunoglobulin light chain that either does not confer antigen-binding specificity but that can associate with each heavy chain, or that can associate with each heavy chain and that can bind one or more of the epitopes bound by the heavy chain antigen-binding regions, or that can associate with each heavy chain and enable binding of one or both of the heavy chains to one or both epitopes. BsAbs can be divided into two major classes, those bearing an Fc region (IgG-like) and those lacking an Fc region, the latter normally being smaller than the IgG and IgG-like bispecific molecules comprising an Fc. The IgG-like bsAbs can have different formats such as, but not limited to, triomab, knobs into holes IgG (kih IgG), crossMab, orth-Fab IgG, Dual-variable domains Ig (DVD-Ig), two-in-one or dual action Fab (DAF), IgG-single-chain Fv (IgG-scFv), or &#x3ba;&#x3bb;-bodies. The non-IgG-like different formats include tandem scFvs, diabody format, single-chain diabody, tandem diabodies (TandAbs), Dual-affinity retargeting molecule (DART), DART-Fc, nanobodies, or antibodies produced by the dock-and-lock (DNL) method (Gaowei Fan, Zujian Wang &#x26; Mingju Hao, Bispecific antibodies and their applications, 8 JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY &#x26; ONCOLOGY 130; Dafne M&#xfc;ller &#x26; Roland E.

Acidic species are typically the variants that elute earlier than the main peak from CEX or later than the main peak from AEX, while basic species are the variants that elute later than the main peak from CEX or earlier than the main peak from AEX. In an exemplary embodiment, basic species may elute earlier than the main peak from cIEF and acidic species may elute later than the main peak from cIEF.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;acidic species,&#x201d; &#x201c;AS,&#x201d; &#x201c;acidic region,&#x201d; and &#x201c;AR,&#x201d; refer to the variants of a protein which are characterized by an overall acidic charge.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In certain embodiments, the sample can comprise more than one type of acidic species variant. For example, but not by way of limitation, the total acidic species can be categorized based on chromatographic retention time of the peaks appearing, or by UV peaks generated using IEF.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Among the chemical degradation pathways responsible for acidic or basic species, the two most commonly observed covalent modifications occurring in proteins and peptides are deamination and oxidation. Methionine, cysteine, histidine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are some of the amino acids that are most susceptible to oxidation: Met and Cys because of their sulfur atoms and His, Trp, and Tyr because of their aromatic rings.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;oxidative species,&#x201d; &#x201c;OS,&#x201d; or &#x201c;oxidation variant&#x201d; refer to the variants of a protein formed by oxidation. Such oxidative species can also be detected by various methods, such as ion exchange, for example, WCX-10 HPLC (a weak cation exchange chromatography), or IEF. Oxidation variants can result from oxidation occurring at histidine, cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and/or tyrosine residues.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;basic species,&#x201d; &#x201c;basic region,&#x201d; and &#x201c;BR,&#x201d; refer to the variants of a protein, for example, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof, which are characterized by an overall basic charge, relative to the primary charge variant species present within the protein. For example, in recombinant protein preparations, such basic species can be detected by various methods, such as ion exchange, for example, WCX-10 HPLC (a weak cation exchange chromatography), or IEF. Exemplary variants can include, but are not limited to, lysine variants, isomerization of aspartic acid, succinimide formation at asparagine, methionine oxidation, amidation, incomplete disulfide bond formation, mutation from serine to arginine, aglycosylation, fragmentation and aggregation. Commonly, basic species elute later than the main peak during CEX or earlier than the main peak during AEX analysis.

For example, but not by way of limitation, the total basic species can be divided based on chromatographic retention time of the peaks appearing, or based on UV peaks generated using IEF. Another example in which the total basic species can be divided can be based on the type of variant&#x2014;variants, structure variants, or fragmentation variant.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">As used herein, &#x201c;sample&#x201d; can be obtained from any step of the bioprocess, such as cell culture fluid (CCF), harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), any step in the downstream processing, drug substance (DS), or a drug product (DP) comprising the final formulated product. In some other specific exemplary embodiments, the sample can be selected from any step of the downstream process of clarification, chromatographic production, viral inactivation, or filtration. In some specific exemplary embodiments, the drug product can be selected from manufactured drug product in the clinic, shipping, storage, or handling.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In some aspects, the method disclosed can include subjecting the sample to a capillary isoelectric focusing to separate charge variants of said protein of interest.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">As used herein, &#x201c;isoelectric focusing&#x201d; or &#x201c;IEF&#x201d;, also known simply as electrofocusing, is a technique for separating charged molecules, usually proteins or peptides, on the basis of their isoelectric point (pI), for example, the pH at which the molecule has no charge. IEF works because in an electric field molecules in a pH gradient will migrate towards their pI. A variety of techniques for conducting IEF exist. For example, in capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF), samples travel through a capillary based on an applied electric field. A UV detector may be used at a point along the capillary to detect the time at which an analyte, such as a protein, traverses that point of the capillary. Because travel time through the capillary is directly related to the charge (pI) of the analyte, UV signal from a point in the capillary over time can be represented as a UV trace, which represents the varying charges (pI) of sample components. In an exemplary embodiment, a UV trace generated by cIEF represents charge variants of a protein of interest, with each UV peak representing a significant charge variant. Variations of cIEF may also be used, for example, imaged cIEF (icIEF).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or gel filtration relies on the separation of components as a function of their molecular size. Separation depends on the amount of time that the substances spend in the porous stationary phase as compared to time in the fluid. The probability that a molecule will reside in a pore depends on the size of the molecule and the pore. In addition, the ability of a substance to permeate into pores is determined by the diffusion mobility of macromolecules which is higher for small macromolecules. Very large macromolecules may not penetrate the pores of the stationary phase at all; and, for very small macromolecules the probability of penetration is close to unity. While components of larger molecular size move more quickly past the stationary phase, components of small molecular size have a longer path length through the pores of the stationary phase and are thus retained longer in the stationary phase.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The chromatographic material can comprise a size exclusion material wherein the size exclusion material is a resin or membrane. The matrix used for size exclusion is preferably an inert gel medium which can be a composite of cross-linked polysaccharides, for example, cross-linked agarose and/or dextran in the form of spherical beads. The degree of cross-linking determines the size of pores that are present in the swollen gel beads. Molecules greater than a certain size do not enter the gel beads and thus move through the chromatographic bed the fastest. Smaller molecules, such as detergent, protein, DNA and the like, which enter the gel beads to varying extent depending on their size and shape, are retarded in their passage through the bed. Molecules are thus generally eluted in the order of decreasing molecular size.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">Porous chromatographic resins appropriate for size-exclusion chromatography of viruses may be made of dextrose, agarose, polyacrylamide, or silica which have different physical characteristics. Polymer combinations can also be also used. Most commonly used are those under the tradename, &#x201c;SEPHADEX&#x201d; available from Amersham Biosciences. Other size exclusion supports from different materials of construction are also appropriate, for example Toyopearl 55F (polymethacrylate, from Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomery Pa.) and Bio-Gel P-30 Fine (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In some exemplary embodiments, SEC can be operated in &#x201c;desalting mode&#x201d; to achieve online buffer exchange prior to native MS detection. Desalting fulfills the goal of removing buffer salts from a sample in exchange for water (with water used to pre-equilibrate the SEC resin). A desalting SEC method suitable for the method of the present invention is described in, for example, Yan et al., 2020<i>, J Am Soc Mass Spectrom, </i>31:2171-2179. Desalting SEC allows for the subsequent MS analysis of samples eluted from cIEF, which otherwise may have incompatible buffer conditions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The protein load of a sample comprising a protein of interest can be adjusted to a total protein load to the column of between about 50 g/L and about 1000 g/L; about 5 g/L and about 150 g/L, between about 10 g/L and about 100 g/L, between about 20 g/L and about 80 g/L, between about 30 g/L and about 50 g/L, or between about 40 g/L and about 50 g/L. In certain embodiments, the protein concentration of the load protein mixture is adjusted to a protein concentration of the material to be loaded onto the column of between about 0.5 g/L and about 50 g/L, or between about 1 g/L and about 20 g/L.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">As used herein, the term &#x201c;mass spectrometer&#x201d; includes a device capable of identifying specific molecular species and measuring their accurate masses. The term is meant to include any molecular detector into which a polypeptide or peptide may be characterized. A mass spectrometer can include three major parts: the ion source, the mass analyzer, and the detector. The role of the ion source is to create gas phase ions. Analyte atoms, molecules, or clusters can be transferred into gas phase and ionized either concurrently (as in electrospray ionization) or through separate processes. The choice of ion source depends on the application. In some exemplary embodiments, the mass spectrometer can be a tandem mass spectrometer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tandem mass spectrometry&#x201d; includes a technique where structural information on sample molecules is obtained by using multiple stages of mass selection and mass separation. A prerequisite is that the sample molecules be transformed into a gas phase and ionized so that fragments are formed in a predictable and controllable fashion after the first mass selection step. Multistage MS/MS, or MS<sup>n</sup>, can be performed by first selecting and isolating a precursor ion (MS<sup>2</sup>), fragmenting it, isolating a primary fragment ion (MS<sup>3</sup>), fragmenting it, isolating a secondary fragment (MS<sup>4</sup>), and so on, as long as one can obtain meaningful information, or the fragment ion signal is detectable. Tandem MS has been successfully performed with a wide variety of analyzer combinations. Which analyzers to combine for a certain application can be determined by many different factors, such as sensitivity, selectivity, and speed, but also size, cost, and availability. The two major categories of tandem MS methods are tandem-in-space and tandem-in-time, but there are also hybrids where tandem-in-time analyzers are coupled in space or with tandem-in-space analyzers. A tandem-in-space mass spectrometer comprises an ion source, a precursor ion activation device, and at least two non-trapping mass analyzers. Specific m/z separation functions can be designed so that in one section of the instrument ions are selected, dissociated in an intermediate region, and the product ions are then transmitted to another analyzer for m/z separation and data acquisition. In tandem-in-time, mass spectrometer ions produced in the ion source can be trapped, isolated, fragmented, and m/z separated in the same physical device. The peptides identified by the mass spectrometer can be used as surrogate representatives of the intact protein and their post translational modifications. They can be used for protein characterization by correlating experimental and theoretical MS/MS data, the latter generated from possible peptides in a protein sequence database. The characterization includes, but is not limited, to sequencing amino acids of the protein fragments, determining protein sequencing, determining protein de novo sequencing, locating post-translational modifications, or identifying post translational modifications, or comparability analysis, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In some exemplary aspects, the mass spectrometer can work on nanoelectrospray or nanospray.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The term &#x201c;nanoelectrospray&#x201d; or &#x201c;nanospray&#x201d; as used herein refers to electrospray ionization at a very low solvent flow rate, typically hundreds of nanoliters per minute of sample solution or lower, often without the use of an external solvent delivery. The electrospray infusion setup forming a nanoelectrospray can use a static nanoelectrospray emitter or a dynamic nanoelectrospray emitter. A static nanoelectrospray emitter performs a continuous analysis of small sample (analyte) solution volumes over an extended period of time. A dynamic nanoelectrospray emitter uses a capillary column and a solvent delivery system to perform chromatographic separations on mixtures prior to analysis by the mass spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In some exemplary embodiments, SEC-MS can be performed under native conditions.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">As used herein, the term &#x201c;native conditions&#x201d; can include performing mass spectrometry under conditions that preserve non-covalent interactions in an analyte.

Overview of the Method of the Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0088">A novel method for characterizing charge variants of a protein of interest is disclosed herein. An exemplary workflow for the method of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A sample, for example a sample from a production step of a therapeutic protein product or any protein of interest, is subjected to capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF). cIEF separates components of the protein sample based on charge (pI), including separating charge variants of the protein of interest. A UV trace of sample components traversing the cIEF capillary is generated, with local maxima of protein concentration considered &#x201c;peaks,&#x201d; and corresponding to protein charge variants. Fractions are serially collected from the capillary. Fractions may be collected in a high-throughput fashion such that all of the cIEF eluate is collected, and fractions represent narrow intervals, for example, 15 second intervals. This high-throughput fraction collection allows for the preservation of the high-resolution separation of cIEF, without requiring an online connection to a mass spectrometer for later MS analysis.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Optionally, fractions may be contacted to hydrolyzing agents, alkylating agents and/or reducing agents to generate reduced peptide fragments of the protein of interest. Fractions may be recombined prior to subsequent analysis depending on the desired concentration and resolution of the analysis.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Fractions are then subjected to desalting size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Desalting SEC serves dual purposes: exchanging the buffer from the collected cIEF fractions with a buffer that is compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, and further separating fraction components based on size.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Finally, eluate from desalting SEC is subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, for example, intact mass analysis or reduced peptide mapping analysis. The desalting SEC may be connected online with a mass spectrometer (desalting SEC-MS). In particular, reduced peptide mapping analysis allows for the identification of site-specific protein modifications that may contribute to charge variation. Because the identified protein modifications arise from a known fraction, and fractions coincide with known portions of the cIEF UV trace, a causal relationship can be drawn between site-specific protein modifications and the protein charge variants.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2. Intact Mass Analysis of Protein Charge Variants</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Using the method of the present invention, a bispecific antibody, bsAb-1, was subjected to the steps of cIEF, fractionation, and desalting SEC-MS. The UV trace generated by cIEF (shown in red) and MS signal generated by desalting SEC-MS (shown in blue) can be correlated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Six UV peaks (corresponding to charge variants) were designated for this UV trace: B2, B1, Main, A1, A2, and A3 (ordered from basic to acidic). Each blue peak represents a desalting SEC-MS analysis of a fraction.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Desalting SEC-MS analysis of cIEF fractions allows for assignment of specific protein modifications to charge variants, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Because each desalting SEC-MS analysis arises from a known fraction, and each fraction represents a known portion of the UV trace, protein modifications detected by MS can be directly associated with charge variants detected by cIEF. In this fashion, the specific causes of charge variants of a protein of interest can be uncovered.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Further analysis is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Reduced Peptide Mapping Analysis of Protein Charge Variants</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The method of the present invention can also be used with reduced peptide mapping analysis to identify protein modifications at specific residues of a protein of interest, and associate these site-specific modifications with charge variants of the protein. A bispecific antibody, bsAb-1, was subjected to the steps of cIEF, fractionation, and desalting SEC-MS as previously described. Fractions were subjected to protein reduction and hydrolysis prior to desalting SEC in order to produce reduced peptide fragments.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Exemplary MS signal corresponding to each charge variant detected by cIEF is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

Specific modified residues are identified across the light chain (LC), first heavy chain (HC) or second heavy chain (HC*) of bsAb-1.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">These experiments demonstrate the capacity of the method of the present invention to provide amino acid residue level-resolution about specific protein modifications that may cause specific charge variants of a protein of interest.
