For example, an aircraft may transmit and/or receive a communication signal via an antenna assembly mounted to the aircraft. This communication signal may be transmitted by way of a directional beam projected from the vehicle antenna toward an external antenna for a ground-based or satellite-based network with which the vehicle is attempting to communicate. Because the vehicle may be moving, and because it may be difficult to precisely and accurately estimate the vehicle's position relative to the external antenna of interest, these vehicle-based communication systems often rely on a beam that is projected in a less than optimal direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described techniques and systems form or implement a first beam, from a set of vehicle-based antennas, for current or future communication with an external antenna of interest (e.g., an antenna of a ground-based base station or of a satellite). A second beam may be implemented to detect or determine a better pointing angle for the first beam, thereby &#x201c;fine tuning&#x201d; the pointing angle for first beam. Specifically, the second beam may be &#x201c;swept&#x201d; through a range of pointing angles while a signal parameter (representing signal quality or strength) is measured, detected, or calculated at each pointing angle. The values for the signal parameter may be evaluated to identify a desired value and the pointing angle at which the desired value was obtained. The first beam may be reoriented or repointed at the desired pointing angle. Advantageously, by using a second beam to discover an improved pointing angle, the first beam can remain in service. Additionally, the disclosed techniques make the selection of the original pointing angle for the first beam less important. That is, because the pointing angle is going to be fine-tuned, it is sufficient to get the original pointing angle roughly right. As a result, the disclosed techniques lessen the need for highly precise and highly accurate data regarding the position of the vehicle (this information can sometimes be imprecise, even if only slightly). This lessened need for highly precise and accurate data can be especially relevant for older aircraft having old avionics and, more specifically, for old aircraft or vehicles relying on old navigation systems. Said another way, the described techniques enable even old vehicles with old navigation systems to determine desirable pointing angles without having to upgrade to newer and more expensive equipment that might provide improved precision and accuracy when estimating a position of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Advantageously, the improved pointing angles provided by the disclosed techniques result in radio frequency (RF) optimization. In some instances, the disclosed techniques can be used to identify an improved pointing angle that may result in a beam having as much as a 3.5 dB stronger signal (e.g., factor of 2&#xd7; vs non-optimized angle). Further, the disclosed techniques can significantly improve link budgets. Moreover, RF optimization resulting from the disclosed techniques enables higher throughput on each beam, reduces interference with other beams, and results in higher aggregate throughput. Higher throughput translates to higher capacity, resulting in more capable and desirable communication systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a vehicle communication system comprises one or more antennas disposed on a vehicle. The antennas may be configured to implement a plurality of beams. The plurality of beams includes a first beam configured to be oriented at a given pointing angle to establish a link with one or more external antennas (e.g., at a satellite or at a ground-based base station) that are external to and not disposed on the vehicle. The one or more antennas may be configured to transmit or receive, via the first beam, data between one or more internal nodes disposed on the vehicle (e.g., passenger devices, avionics nodes, etc.) and the one or more external antennas external to the vehicle. The plurality of beams also includes a second beam that may be used to discover an improved pointing angle for the first beam.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, the system may include a controller configured to be communicatively coupled to the one or more antennas disposed on the vehicle. The controller may be configured to adjust the second beam during a period of time to be oriented at a plurality of pointing angles. The controller may detect a plurality of sets of signal data for a signal from a particular external antenna, wherein each set of signal data is detected at a different one of the plurality of pointing angles. The controller may obtain a plurality of values for a signal parameter for the signal, wherein each value is obtained from a different one of the plurality of sets of signal data and corresponds to a different one of the plurality of pointing angles. The controller may analyze the plurality of values for the signal parameter to identify (a) a desired value for the signal parameter and (b) a particular pointing angle at which the desired value for the signal parameter was obtained. The controller may reorient the first beam from the given pointing angle to the particular pointing angle corresponding to the desired value for the signal parameter. After reorientation, the controller may transmit or receive data, via the first beam while it is oriented at the particular pointing angle, between the particular external antenna and at least one of the one or more internal nodes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Note, this summary has been provided to introduce a selection of concepts further described below in the detailed description.

The vehicle <b>105</b> may include communication equipment, including one or more antennas. Each antenna may have or form, in part or in whole, one or more beamformers. Generally speaking, the term &#x201c;beamformer&#x201d; refers to any suitable technology configured to form one or more beams beam. A beamformer may be any suitable collection of circuitry (analog and/or digital), software, and/or antennas configured to implement a beam. A beamformer may be a transmit beamformer or a receive beamformer. A communication terminal may have two or more transceivers. In a typical example, one is used for connecting to a serving cell, and another one is used to perform measurements on candidate cells to enable handovers. Regarding beamforming, transceivers may perform beamforming functions (digital beamformer) or be associated with a dedicated beamformer (analog beamforming), if desired. In some instances, a first beamformer points to a serving cell, and a second beamformer is used to measure neighbor cells. In some instances, additional beamformers may be used to establish connectivity to other serving cells (e.g., enabling a dual connectivity feature) or to other frequencies.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally speaking, a beam is the realization of a given orientation. In an example, communication with a server station (e.g., on the ground or satellite) may be realized with at least two primary beamformers (one for tx another for rx), and one or more secondary beamformers for handover measurements or for fine tuning the orientation of the primary beamformers. A controller <b>120</b> for the communication system <b>199</b> of the vehicle <b>105</b> may identify a desired pointing angle (e.g., azimuth or elevation) for a first beam used by an antenna or antenna array on the vehicle for communication with external systems (e.g., the first beam being used for communication with a ground-based antenna or a satellite antenna) by implementing a second beam and by testing numerous pointing angles for the second beam. The controller <b>120</b> may test the numerous pointing angles by obtaining a signal measurement at each pointing angle (e.g., signal strength, SNR, etc.). The controller <b>120</b> may determine a given pointing angle with the best signal measurement, and may use the given pointing angle for the first beam. Advantageously, by using the second beam to identify the desired pointing angle, the first beam can remain in service to facilitate communication between the vehicle <b>105</b> and the external systems while the improved pointing angle is detected. Depending on the embodiment, the second beam may be implemented by the same antenna implementing the first beam, or by a different antenna.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Generally speaking, a &#x201c;beam&#x201d; is the radiation pattern for a given antenna, and may be used to refer to the main lobe of the radiation pattern. The half power beam width is the angle between the half-power (&#x2212;3 dB) points of the main lobe, when referenced to the peak effective radiated power of the main lobe. Said another way, the half power beam width is the angle in which relative power is more than 50% of the peak power, in the effective radiated field of the antenna. If one were to draw a line from antenna projecting the beam through the center of the beam, this line would be considered the &#x201c;pointing angle&#x201d; of the beam (e.g., relative to the front of the vehicle <b>105</b> or to the head of the vehicle <b>105</b>). Generally speaking, this line is also the &#x201c;maximum direction&#x201d; of the radiation pattern (i.e., the direction in which the beam extends furthest). Accordingly, by adjust the pointing angle of the beam, one can adjust the &#x201c;maximum direction&#x201d; of the beam, thereby focusing and directing the beam to a desired target, for example. Generally speaking, the pointing angle may be locally referenced to the geographic coordinate system of the antenna. If desired, the pointing angle may be referenced to the geographic coordinate system of the source or receiver of the communication link. Conversion to a respective geographic coordinate system may be accomplished through a coordinate transformation. The pointing angle may be referenced to an azimuth angle (e.g., from True North in the Earth-Center Earth-Fixed coordinate system), as well as an elevation angle (e.g., relative a horizontal or vertical plane of the antenna's or vehicle's geographic coordinate system).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The environment <b>100</b> may include the vehicle <b>105</b>, which may be (i) in communication with a base station <b>145</b> via a communication link <b>130</b> and/or (ii) in communication with a satellite network <b>708</b> via a communication link <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the vehicle <b>105</b> is depicted as an airplane, the vehicle <b>105</b> may be any suitable vehicle, such as an automobile (e.g., bus, a car, a truck, etc.), a rail-based vehicle (e.g., a typical train, a subway, a monorail, etc.), any suitable aircraft (e.g., an airplane, a helicopter, a gyrocopter, an airship or blimp, a balloon, etc.), a watercraft (e.g., a ship, a speedboat, etc.), or a hybrid vehicle (e.g., a flying car, a hovercraft, etc.), etc. Further, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a single vehicle <b>105</b>, in some embodiments, the environment <b>100</b> may include any number of vehicles configured to perform the antenna control techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated, the vehicle <b>105</b> is equipped with the controller <b>120</b> that supports communications external to the vehicle <b>105</b> via the communication link <b>130</b> and/or via the link <b>131</b>.

This first beam may be a widebeam, which may not provide as much bandwidth or data transmission as a narrowbeam, but which allows for a wider range of areas in which the base station <b>145</b>A may be located while still allowing for communication (e.g., it might be said that the widebeam improves the chance that the controller <b>120</b> and antenna <b>108</b>A will discover the base station <b>145</b>A). The controller <b>120</b> may implement this first beam to communicate with the base station <b>145</b>A.

The second beam may be a narrowbeam, which can offer improved throughput relative to a widebeam if properly aimed. By utilizing the second beam to cycle through and evaluate multiple point angles, the controller <b>120</b> can discover a pointing angle better than the original pointing angle (e.g., while using the first beam for communication, even if the first beam is less than ideal).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">After identifying, via the second beam, the pointing angle with the best or most desirable signal measurement, the controller <b>120</b> may &#x201c;fine tune&#x201d; the antenna <b>108</b>A and/or first beam by changing the pointing angle of the first beam to the pointing angle that was discovered to have the most desirable signal parameter value.

The method <b>200</b> may be implemented, in whole or in part, by the systems <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Accordingly, the method <b>200</b> may be saved to a memory as one or more instructions or routines (e.g., the memory <b>152</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For ease of explanation, the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> refers to the system <b>100</b> as implementing the methods <b>200</b>. At a high level, the method <b>200</b> involves forming or implementing a first beam for current or future communication purposes and using a second beam to potentially find a better pointing angle for the first beam, thereby &#x201c;fine tuning&#x201d; the pointing angle for first beam. Depending on the embodiment, the first and second beam may be implemented by the same antenna <b>108</b>/<b>109</b>, or by two different antennas.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>120</b> may implement the first beam (e.g., from the set of antennas <b>108</b>) at a given pointing angle (for example, 60 degrees left of the vehicle's heading) (block <b>205</b>). The given or original pointing angle may be calculated or selected as a &#x201c;best guess&#x201d; as to a &#x201c;best&#x201d; pointing angle for a beam to be used for communicating with a given external antenna (e.g., at a ground-based base station or at a satellite). The given or original pointing angle for the first beam may be calculated by the controller <b>120</b> based on: (i) a known position (e.g., X, Y, and Z coordinates) of an external antenna with which it intends to communicate via the first beam (e.g., the antenna <b>142</b>A of the base station <b>145</b>A); and (ii) a known or estimated position of the vehicle <b>105</b> (e.g., X, Y, and Z coordinates). The estimated position of the vehicle <b>105</b> may be calculated based on data from avionics in the vehicle <b>105</b> (e.g., from any desired combination of an EFIS or electronic flight instrument system, a heading indicator, a navigation unit, an altimeter, etc.). The position of the external antenna may be determined based on data stored at the database <b>122</b>. Note, due to the speed of the vehicle <b>105</b>, the position of the vehicle <b>105</b> may be rapidly changing at any given time. Thus, the controller <b>120</b> may estimate a future position of the vehicle <b>105</b> (e.g., based on a previously estimated or detected current position and based on a rate of travel) and may estimate a &#x201c;best guess&#x201d; pointing angle for the first beam at the future position. The controller <b>120</b> may then implement the first beam at the &#x201c;best guess&#x201d; pointing angle when it gets within a certain range of the future position (e.g., within 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 miles).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the first beam is an &#x201c;active&#x201d; beam when the original pointing angle is used. That is, the controller <b>120</b> and/or other nodes of the system <b>199</b> may be in communication with an external network (e.g., a ground-based network) via the first beam before any &#x201c;fine tuning&#x201d; has occurred. In an embodiment, the first beam is implemented while another beam (e.g., a third beam) is active. To this end, the method <b>200</b> may be implemented to &#x201c;fine tune&#x201d; the first beam before a handoff procedure during which communications are transitioned from the third beam to the first beam (e.g., after discovering an optimal or desirable pointing angle for the first beam). In some instances, handoff between the third beam and the first beam may occur before the first beam is fully fine tuned (e.g., when the third beam has significantly degraded).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In any event, the controller <b>120</b> may form or otherwise adjust the second beam to be oriented at a plurality of pointing angles (block <b>210</b>). That is, the second beam may &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; through a plurality of pointing angles. In one example, the second beam begins the sweep at a certain offset from the pointing angle of the first beam (e.g., 10 degrees clockwise from the pointing angle of the first beam) and finishes the sweep at the opposite offset (e.g., 10 degrees clockwise from the point angle of the first beam). In various embodiments, a first beamformer is used for the &#x201c;active beam&#x201d; and one or more &#x201c;other&#x201d; beamformers (e.g., for a second or more beams) are used for handover measurements. These other beamformers may be time multiplexed between uses for handover measurements and fine-tuning the direction of the first beam.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At each of the pointing angles for the second beam, the controller <b>120</b> may obtain a set of signal data for a signal transmitted via the second beam (e.g., the set of signal data being data representing the detected signal), and may measure or detect, from the set of signal data, a value for a signal parameter (block <b>215</b>) for each of the plurality of pointing angles. Said another way, for each pointing angle of interest, the controller <b>120</b> may obtain a set of signal data and may determine a signal parameter value of interest from the set of signal data.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Example signal parameters include a signal strength parameter, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), a reference signal received power (RSRP), or a reference signal received quality (RSRQ). Each value may be detected from a set of signal data.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The exact signal parameter or set of signal parameters used may depend on the implementation, and may depend on a number of factors. For example, a first set of signal parameters may be used when the vehicle <b>105</b> is near or over an urban environment (e.g., SINR, which may be more appropriate for the case of 2.4 GHz unlicensed, where interference tends to correlate with population density) and a second set of signal parameters when the vehicle <b>105</b> is not over the urban environment (e.g., signal strength).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As another example, the signal parameter may differ depending on whether the first beam is a receive beam or a transmit beam. For example, signal strength may be more relevant or important for a transmit beam, but SNR or SINR may be more relevant or important for a receive beam.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In any event, the controller <b>120</b> may obtain the measurements at a defined interval (e.g., 2 degrees) as the second beam is sweeping, and may detect a value for the signal parameter at every interval until the sweep is finished. To illustrate, if the original pointing angle of the first beam is 60 degrees left of the vehicle's heading, the controller <b>120</b> may sweep the second beam at pointing angles of 70 degrees to 50 degrees, obtaining measurements every two degrees (e.g., at 70, 68, 66, . . . 52, 50). It will be appreciated that any desired size or range of sweep may be used (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, 20, or 30 degree sweeps), and that any desired interval may be used for obtaining values for the one or more signal parameters of interest (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 degree intervals). Depending on the configuration, the controller <b>120</b> may obtain values for a plurality of signal parameters at each interval. For example, the controller <b>120</b> may obtain at each interval any one or more of: signal strength, SNR, SINR, RSRP, RSRQ, or an index representing some combination thereof (e.g., with any desired weighting for each individual parameter).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The controller <b>120</b> may determine or identify a desired value (e.g., the highest or best value) from the plurality of values for the signal parameter, and may determine or identify the pointing angle that resulted in the desired signal measurement (block <b>220</b>). For example, the controller <b>120</b> may determine that a pointing angle of 64 degrees resulted in the highest signal strength, and may therefore choose a pointing angle of 64 degrees. As noted, the desired pointing angle may be selected based on an index calculated at each pointing angle, wherein each index represents a &#x201c;score&#x201d; that accounts for multiple signal parameters. Such an index may be calculated based on whether each signal parameter is graded as &#x201c;excellent,&#x201d; &#x201c;good,&#x201d; &#x201c;fair,&#x201d; or &#x201c;poor,&#x201d; for example. To illustrate, for signal strength or RSSI (received signal strength indicator), a &#x201c;good&#x201d; value may be between &#x2212;65 and &#x2212;75 dB, and an &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; value may be greater than &#x2212;65 dB. For RSRP, a &#x201c;good&#x201d; value may be between &#x2212;80 and &#x2212;90 dB, and an &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; value may be greater than &#x2212;80 dB. For RSRQ, a &#x201c;good&#x201d; value may be between &#x2212;10 and &#x2212;15 dB, and an &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; value may be greater than &#x2212;10 dB. For SINR and/or SNR, a &#x201c;good&#x201d; value may be between 13 and 20 dB, and an &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; value may be greater than 20 dB. Note, any number of range and range values may be used. Those ranges and ranges values described above are merely illustrative.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>120</b> may reorient the first beam from the given pointing angle to the pointing angle that resulted in the desired signal measurement for the second beam (block <b>225</b>). This may involve physically reorienting an antenna. In some instances, the pointing angle of the first beam is changed without physically reorienting the antenna.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The controller <b>120</b> may transmit or receive data via the first beam after reorientation (block <b>230</b>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the first beam is formed or otherwise implemented at the given pointing angle while another beam is &#x201c;active.&#x201d; For example, during a handoff process, nodes of the system <b>199</b> may communicate with external networks via an &#x201c;active&#x201d; third beam establishing connect between the antenna <b>108</b>B and the ground station <b>145</b>B.

Nodes of the described networks may be inter-connected in a wired or wireless manner, and may have different routing and transfer capabilities.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Regarding the term &#x201c;node,&#x201d; this generally refers to a connection point, redistribution point, or a communication endpoint. A node may be any device or system (e.g., a computer system) capable of sending, receiving or forwarding information. For example, end-devices or end-systems that originate or ultimately receive a message are nodes. Intermediary devices that receive and forward the message (e.g., between two end-devices) are also generally considered to be &#x201c;nodes.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Regarding the term &#x201c;link,&#x201d; this generally refers to a pathway or medium connecting two or more nodes. A link may be a physical link or a logical link. A physical link is the interface or medium(s) over which information is transferred, and may be wired or wireless in nature. Example physicals links include (i) wired links such as cables with a conductor for transmission of electrical energy or a fiber optic connections for transmission of light and (ii) wireless links such as wireless electromagnetic signals that carry information via changes made to one or more properties of electromagnetic waves. A logical link between two or more nodes represents an abstraction of the underlying physical links or intermediary nodes connecting the two or more nodes. For example, two or more nodes may be logically coupled via a logical link. The logical link may be established via any combination of physical links and intermediary nodes (e.g., routers, switches, or other networking equipment).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The phrase &#x201c;wherein the system includes at least one of X, Y, or Z&#x201d; means the system includes an X, a Y, a Z, or some combination thereof.
