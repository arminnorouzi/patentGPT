Each level of the multi-level transport system having a corresponding independent asynchronous level transport system separate and distinct from the asynchronous level transport system corresponding to each other level of the multi-level transport system. Each independent lift axis of the lifting transport system being configured to independently hold at least one case and being communicably coupled to each asynchronous level transport system so as to provide for exchange of the at least one case between each asynchronous level transport system and each independent lift axis. Each independent lift axis is communicably coupled to each other independent lift axis of the more than one lift axis and forms a common output of mixed cases so as to create an ordered sequence of mixed cases in accordance to a predetermined case out ordered sequence.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="234.95mm" wi="143.00mm"

Brief Description of Related Developments</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, in storage and retrieval systems case units or items are picked and transported to an outbound packaging cell (e.g., a human picking cell and/or an automated palletizer). These picked case units are sequenced according to a product order for placement on a pallet or other shipping container.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The case units output from the multilevel storage and retrieval systems are transferred to a packing station where the case units are placed on pallets for shipping. Generally the pallets include case units of similar size and shape so that stable case levels, sometimes with paperboard sheets disposed between the levels, are formed on the pallets. In some instances each level of tier of the pallet is separately formed and then placed on the pallet to form stacked tiers. Mixed pallets are also possible. Generally when forming a pallet layer cases are placed in a buffer station or other location at the palletizing station so that the dimensions of the case are measured. A computer or other processor determines an arrangement (e.g., sequence) of the cases based on the dimensions and instructs a robot to pick the cases for placement in the pallet layer. In other instances, the sequencing of the items is performed by automation or humans picking the items from storage shelves where the items are transferred from storage to outbound conveyors in a sequenced order. This sequencing generally occurs during horizontal transfer of the items and at rates that are generally slower than rates at which the items can be palletized or packed into other shipping containers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be advantageous to sort case units for placement on a pallet during vertical transport of the case units out of the storage and retrieval system storage structure to increase throughput of the storage and retrieval system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

should be understood that the aspects of the disclosed embodiment can be embodied in many forms. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustration of an automated storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> including a multi-level transport system <b>190</b> in accordance with aspects of the disclosed embodiment. Each level <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b> includes an asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b> that is separate and distinct from the asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b> at each other level <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b>. The multi-level transport system <b>190</b> is coupled to and feeds an infeed order sequence <b>173</b> of mixed cases to a lifting transport system <b>500</b> that connects each asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b> to a case output having a predetermined mixed case out order sequence. As shown, the lifting transport system <b>500</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) may have separate inbound and outbound transport sections <b>500</b>A, <b>500</b>B. The outbound transport section <b>500</b>B has one or more lift transport cells <b>150</b>CEL (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), each or at least one of which has more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) coupled to each other and controlled in a cooperative manner as will be described herein. Each of the independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn of the lift transport cell <b>150</b>CEL (also referred to herein as &#x201c;cell&#x201d; <b>150</b>CEL) independently feeds cases, from any of the asynchronous level transport systems <b>191</b>, through a common output <b>300</b> of the cell <b>150</b>CEL that creates an ordered sequence of mixed cases <b>171</b> from the common output <b>300</b> in accordance with the predetermined mixed case out order sequence. The output of a cell <b>150</b>CEL generates a predetermined case our order sequence of mixed cases <b>172</b> for a corresponding order fill station <b>16</b>OUT. In other aspects, the output of the more than one cell are superposed or aggregated to generate the predetermined case our order sequence of mixed cases <b>172</b> for the order fill station <b>16</b>OUT. The inbound transport section <b>500</b>A may be similar to the outbound transport section <b>500</b>B, or may have any suitable number of independent lift axes that may be coupled or uncoupled with respect to an inbound flow of cases to the storage structure <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ordered sequence of mixed cases <b>171</b> from the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn, of the lifting transport system <b>500</b>, is decoupled from the infeed order sequence <b>173</b> of each asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b>, and effects a resequencing of cases, along the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn, between infeed to the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Nx and the output <b>300</b> of the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn so that the output ordered sequence of cases <b>171</b> has a superior sequence order relative to the predetermined case out order sequence of mixed cases <b>172</b> than the infeed order sequence <b>173</b> of cases at each level <b>130</b>L; and so that in one aspect, outfeed transport work, outputting cases through the multi-level transport system <b>190</b> and the lifting transport system <b>500</b> is optimally distributed (e.g., in desired optimization strategies of one or more transactions) over the levels <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the aspects of the disclosed embodiment are described herein with respect to the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b>, it should be understood that the aspects of the disclosed embodiment are equally applicable to any suitable material handling center(s) including, but not limited to, warehouses, distribution centers, cross-docking facilities, order fulfillment centers/facilities, packaging facilities, shipping facilities, or other suitable facility or combination of facilities for performing one or more functions of material or inventory handling. In accordance with aspects of the disclosed embodiment the automated storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> may operate in a retail distribution center or warehouse to, for example, fulfill orders received from retail stores for case units (for simplicity and ease of explanation the term &#x201c;case unit(s)&#x201d; or the synonymous term &#x201c;case&#x201d; is generally used herein for referring to both individual case units and pickfaces, where a pickface is formed of multiple case units that are moved as a unit) such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/326,674 filed on Dec. 15, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For example, the case units are cases or units of goods not stored in trays, on totes or on pallets (e.g. uncontained). In other examples, the case units are cases or units of goods that are contained in any suitable manner such as in trays, on totes or on pallets. In still other examples, the case units are a combination of uncontained and contained items. It is noted that the case units, for example, include cased units of goods (e.g. case of soup cans, boxes of cereal, etc.), individual goods that are adapted to be taken off of or placed on a pallet, a product, a package, a box, a tote, a mailer, a bucket and/or other types of containers. In accordance with the aspects of the disclosed embodiment, shipping cases for case units (e.g. cartons, barrels, boxes, crates, jugs, or any other suitable device for holding case units) may have variable sizes and may be used to hold case units in shipping and may be configured so they are capable of being palletized for shipping. It is noted that when, for example, bundles or pallets of case units arrive at the storage and retrieval system the content of each pallet may be uniform (e.g. each pallet holds a predetermined number of the same item&#x2014;one pallet holds soup and another pallet holds cereal) and as pallets leave the storage and retrieval system the pallets may contain any suitable number and combination of different case units (e.g. a mixed pallet where each mixed pallet holds different types of case units&#x2014;a pallet holds a combination of soup and cereal) that are provided to, for example the palletizer in a sorted arrangement for forming the mixed pallet. In the embodiments the storage and retrieval system described herein may be applied to any environment in which case units are stored and retrieved.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, it is noted that when, for example, incoming bundles or pallets (e.g. from manufacturers or suppliers of case units arrive at the storage and retrieval system for replenishment of the automated storage and retrieval system <b>100</b>, the content of each pallet may be uniform (e.g. each pallet holds a predetermined number of the same item&#x2014;one pallet holds soup and another pallet holds cereal). As may be realized, the cases of such pallet load may be substantially similar or in other words, homogenous cases (e.g. similar dimensions), and may have the same SKU (otherwise, as noted before the pallets may be &#x201c;rainbow&#x201d; pallets having layers formed of homogeneous cases). As pallets PAL leave the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b>, with cases filling replenishment orders, the pallets PAL may contain any suitable number and combination of different case units CU (e.g. each pallet may hold different types of case units&#x2014;a pallet holds a combination of canned soup, cereal, beverage packs, cosmetics and household cleaners). The cases combined onto a single pallet may have different dimensions and/or different SKU's. In one aspect of the exemplary embodiment, the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> may be configured to generally include an in-feed section, a multi-level transport system <b>190</b>, and an output and resequencing section <b>199</b> (where, in one aspect, storage of items is optional) as will be described in greater detail below. As may be realized, in one aspect of the disclosed embodiment the system <b>100</b> operating, for example, as a retail distribution center may serve to receive uniform pallet loads of cases, breakdown the pallet goods or disassociate the cases from the uniform pallet loads into independent case units handled individually by the system, retrieve and sort the different cases sought by each order into corresponding groups, and transport and assemble the corresponding groups of cases into what may be referred to as mixed case pallet loads MPL. The in-feed section may generally be capable of resolving the uniform pallet loads to individual cases, and transporting the cases via suitable transport, for input to the storage and resequencing section <b>199</b>. In other aspects the output section assembles the appropriate group of ordered case units, that may be different in SKU, dimensions, etc. into bags, totes or other suitable containers according to the predetermined order sequence of picked items at the operator station <b>160</b>EP (such as to fill a customer order).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As may also be realized, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, in one aspect of the disclosed embodiment the system <b>100</b> operating for example as a retail distribution center may serve to receive uniform pallet loads of cases, breakdown the pallet goods or disassociate the cases from the uniform pallet loads into independent case units handled individually by the system, retrieve and sort the different cases sought by each order into corresponding groups, and transport and sequence the corresponding groups of cases (in the manner described herein) at an operator station <b>160</b>EP where items are picked from the different case units CU, and/or the different case units CU themselves, are placed in one or more bag(s), tote(s) or other suitable container(s) TOT by an operator <b>1500</b>, or any suitable automation, in a predetermined order sequence of picked items according to, for example, an order, fulfilling one or more customer orders, in which the case units CU are sequenced at the operator station <b>160</b>EP in accordance with the predetermined order sequence, noting that the sequencing of the case units CU as described herein effects the sequencing of the case units CU at the operator station <b>160</b>EP.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref>, the output and resequencing section <b>199</b> includes, at least a lifting transport system <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) with more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, where in one aspect each lift axis is a lift <b>150</b>B, while in other aspects each lift axis may be any suitable lifting device as described herein with respect to lifts <b>150</b>) that are coupled or uncoupled so as to form a common infeed interface <b>555</b> frame <b>777</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, e.g., so that the infeed interface <b>555</b> frame <b>777</b> is common to each lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn) and couple the multi-level transport system <b>190</b> to the output stations(s) <b>16</b>OUT through a common output <b>300</b>. Each of the lift axes <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn is configured to independently hold at least one case unit and reciprocate along a vertical axis (i.e., the Z axis or lift travel axis) of the lift axis independently raising and lowering the at least one case unit (singly or in groups, or in pickfaces) to provide lifting transport of mixed cases between more than one level <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the exemplary embodiment, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the output and resequencing section <b>199</b> generates the pallet load MPL in what may be referred to as a structured architecture of mixed case stacks. The structured architecture of the pallet load MPL described herein is representative and in other aspects the pallet load MPL may have any other suitable configuration. For example, the structured architecture may be any suitable predetermined configuration such as a truck bay load or other suitable container or load container envelope holding a structural load. The structured architecture of the pallet load MPL may be characterized as having several flat case layers L<b>121</b>-L<b>125</b>, L<b>12</b>T, at least one of which is formed of non-intersecting, free-standing and stable stacks of multiple mixed cases. The mixed case stacks of the given layer have substantially the same height, to form as may be realized substantially flat top and bottom surfaces of the given layer, and may be sufficient in number to cover the pallet area, or a desired portion of the pallet area. Overlaying layer(s) may be orientated so that corresponding cases of the layer(s) bridge between the stacks of the supporting layer. Thus, stabilizing the stacks and correspondingly the interfacing layer(s) of the pallet load. In defining the pallet load into a structured layer architecture, the coupled 3-D pallet load solution is resolved into two parts that may be saved separately, a vertical (1-D) part resolving the load into layers, and a horizontal (2-D) part of efficiently distributing stacks of equal height to fill out the pallet height of each layer. As will be described below, the output and resequencing section <b>199</b> outputs case units so that the two parts of the 3-D pallet load solution are resolved. The predetermined structure of the mixed pallet load MPL defines an order of case units, whether the case units are a singular case unit pickface or a combined case unit pickface provided by the output and resequencing sections <b>199</b> to a load construction system (which may be automated or manual loading). As may be realized, separate portions of the predetermined structure of the mixed pallet load MPL (e.g., a separate layer, or a portion of the layer) may each define the output case units desired for sequencing by the output and resequencing section(s) <b>199</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with aspects of the disclosed embodiment, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the automated storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> includes input stations <b>1601</b>N (which include depalletizers <b>160</b>PA and/or conveyors <b>160</b>CA for transporting items to lift modules <b>150</b>A for entry into storage) and output stations <b>16</b>OUT (which include palletizers <b>160</b>PB, operator stations <b>160</b>EP and/or conveyors <b>160</b>CB for transporting case units from lift modules <b>150</b>B for removal from storage), input and output vertical lift modules <b>150</b>A, <b>150</b>B (generally referred to as lift modules <b>150</b>&#x2014;it is noted that while input and output lift modules are shown, a single lift module may be used to both input and remove case units from the storage structure), a storage structure <b>130</b>, and a number of autonomous rovers/vehicles or transport vehicles <b>110</b> (referred to herein as &#x201c;bots&#x201d;). It is noted that the depalletizers <b>160</b>PA may be configured to remove case units from pallets so that the input station <b>1601</b>N can transport the items to the lift modules <b>150</b> for input into the storage structure <b>130</b>.

In other aspects, the storage spaces <b>130</b>S formed by the rack modules may include slots, receptacle, stalls, cribs, cordoned areas, hooks, racks, or other suitable locations with a configuration that allows the bots to pick and place case units to and from the storage spaces. In one aspect, the shelves of the rack modules RM are arranged as multi-level shelves that are distributed along the picking aisles <b>130</b>A. As may be realized the bots <b>110</b> travel on a respective storage level <b>130</b>L along the picking aisles <b>130</b>A and the transfer deck <b>130</b>B for transferring case units between any of the storage spaces <b>130</b>S of the storage structure <b>130</b> (e.g. on the level which the bot <b>110</b> is located) and any of the lift modules <b>150</b> (e.g. each of the bots <b>110</b> has access to each storage space <b>130</b>S on a respective level and each lift module <b>150</b> on a respective storage level <b>130</b>L). The transfer decks <b>130</b>B are arranged at different levels (corresponding to each level <b>130</b>L of the storage and retrieval system) that may be stacked one over the other or horizontally offset, such as having one transfer deck <b>130</b>B at one end or side RMAE<b>1</b> of the storage rack array RMA or at several ends or sides RMAE<b>1</b>, RMAE<b>2</b> of the storage rack array RMA as described in, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/326,674 filed on Dec. 15, 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In other aspects, the storage structure may not have transfer decks on one or more of the level <b>130</b>L, where the picking aisles may extend so that the bots <b>110</b> have access to one or more lifts disposed on a side of the picking aisle in a manner similar to that described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,974,168 issued on Mar. 10, 2015, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one aspect of the disclosed embodiment, the transfer decks <b>130</b>B are substantially open and configured for the undeterministic traversal of bots <b>110</b> along multiple travel lanes (e.g. along an asynchronous X transport axis with respect to the bot frame of reference REF illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) across and along the transfer decks <b>130</b>B. As may be realized, the transfer deck(s) <b>130</b>B at each storage level <b>130</b>L communicate with each of the picking aisles <b>130</b>A on the respective storage level <b>130</b>L. Bots <b>110</b> bi-directionally traverse between the transfer deck(s) <b>130</b>B and picking aisles <b>130</b>A on each respective storage level <b>130</b>L so as to travel along the picking aisles (e.g. along the asynchronous X transport axis with respect to the bot frame of reference REF illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) and access the storage spaces <b>130</b>S disposed in the rack shelves alongside each of the picking aisles <b>130</b>A (e.g. bots <b>110</b> may access, along an asynchronous Y transport axis (with respect to the bot frame of reference REF illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>), storage spaces <b>130</b>S distributed on both sides of each aisle such that the bot <b>110</b> may have a different facing when traversing each picking aisle <b>130</b>A, for example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, drive wheels <b>202</b> leading a direction of travel or drive wheels trailing a direction of travel). As may be realized, throughput outbound from the storage array in the horizontal plane corresponding to a predetermined storage or deck level <b>130</b>L is effected by and manifest in the combined or integrated throughput along both the asynchronous X and Y transport axes. As noted above, the transfer deck(s) <b>130</b>B also provides bot <b>110</b> access to each of the lifts <b>150</b> on the respective storage level <b>130</b>L where the lifts <b>150</b> feed and remove case units (e.g. along the Z throughput axis, see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B</figref>) to and/or from each storage level <b>130</b>L and where the bots <b>110</b> effect case unit transfer between the lifts <b>150</b> and the storage spaces <b>130</b>S.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other aspects, of the disclosed embodiments, the transfer decks <b>130</b>B may be deterministic, in a manner substantially similar to that of the picking aisles. For example, the transfer decks <b>130</b>B may include any suitable number of guide features <b>130</b>BS<b>1</b>, <b>130</b>BS<b>2</b>, such as rails, guides, tracks, etc., which form one or more travel paths HSTP<b>1</b>, HSTP<b>2</b> for the bots <b>110</b> and providing access to the lifts <b>150</b> (e.g., along the asynchronous X transport axis with respect to the bot frame of reference REF illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) across and along the transfer decks <b>130</b>B. The deterministic travel paths HSTP<b>1</b>, HSTP<b>2</b> of the transfer decks <b>130</b>B may be arranged transverse to the picking aisles <b>130</b>A of a respective level <b>130</b>L. The bots <b>110</b> may be suitably configured to transition between rails <b>1200</b>S of the deterministic picking aisle <b>130</b>A (e.g., along the asynchronous Y transport axis with respect to the bot frame of reference REF illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) and a deterministic travel path HSTP<b>1</b>, HSTP<b>2</b> in any suitable manner. For example, the bots <b>110</b> may include sets of substantially orthogonal wheels as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,492, issued on Dec. 6, 1994 and/or U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,981, issued on May 21, 2002, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In still other aspects, the bots <b>110</b> may include separable traversal unit(s) that roll on and roll off of a bot main frame. For example, the bot main frame traverses the one of the deterministic picking aisle <b>130</b>A and the deterministic travel path(s) HSTP<b>1</b>, HSTP<b>2</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B (e.g., along one of the asynchronous X and Y axes) and the separable unit traverses another of the deterministic picking aisle <b>130</b>A and the deterministic travel path(s) HSTP<b>1</b>, HSTP<b>2</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B (e.g., along another of the asynchronous X and Y axes). Suitable examples of autonomous transports having a main frame and a separable traversal unit can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,078, issued Jul. 10, 1984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in one aspect the storage structure <b>130</b> includes multiple storage rack modules RM that are configured in a three dimensional array RMA, where the racks are arranged in aisles <b>130</b>A and the aisles <b>130</b>A are configured for bot <b>110</b> travel within the aisles <b>130</b>A. In this aspect, the transfer deck <b>130</b>B has an undeterministic transport surface on which the bots <b>110</b> travel where the undeterministic transport surface <b>130</b>BS has more than one juxtaposed travel lane (e.g. high speed bot travel paths HSTP) connecting the aisles <b>130</b>A (in other aspects, each high speed bot travel path may be deterministic as noted above). As may be realized, the juxtaposed travel lanes are juxtaposed along a common undeterministic (or deterministic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) transport surface <b>130</b>BS between opposing sides <b>130</b>BD<b>1</b>, <b>130</b>BD<b>2</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in one aspect the aisles <b>130</b>A are joined to the transfer deck <b>130</b>B on one side <b>130</b>BD<b>2</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B but in other aspects, the aisles are joined to more than one side <b>130</b>BD<b>1</b>, <b>130</b>BD<b>2</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B in a manner substantially similar to that described in U.S. patent application Ser.

The deck storage racks are arranged along the other side <b>130</b>BD<b>1</b> of the transfer deck <b>130</b>B so that the deck storage racks communicate with the bots <b>110</b> from the transfer deck <b>130</b>B and with the lift modules <b>150</b> (e.g. the deck storage racks are accessed by the bots <b>110</b> from the transfer deck <b>130</b>B and by the lifts <b>150</b> for picking and placing pickfaces so that pickfaces are transferred between the bots <b>110</b> and the deck storage racks and between the deck storage racks and the lifts <b>150</b> and hence between the bots <b>110</b> and the lifts <b>150</b>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, each storage level <b>130</b>L may also include charging stations <b>130</b>C for charging an on-board power supply of the bots <b>110</b> on that storage level <b>130</b>L such as described in, for example, U.S. Pat.

The bots <b>110</b> (described in greater detail below) may be configured to place case units, such as the above described retail merchandise, into picking stock in the one or more levels of the storage structure <b>130</b> and then selectively retrieve ordered case units.

The pickfaces/case units are transported between an inbound section of the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b>, where pickfaces inbound to the array are generated (such as, for example, input station <b>1601</b>N) and a load fill section of the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> (such as for example, output station <b>16</b>OUT), where outbound pickfaces from the array are arranged to fill a load in accordance with a predetermined load fill order sequence of mixed cases.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As will be described herein, the transport of mixed case(s)/pickfaces coincident with transport on at least one of (or in other aspects on at least one of each of the more than one of) the array of level asynchronous transport axes X and Y is based on an infeed order sequence <b>173</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) to the lifting transport system <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>5</b></figref>) that may be freely selected based any suitable optimization strategy of one or more transactions of the respective asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b>, a desired optimal transaction/action (e.g., pickface and/or traverse along one or more level asynchronous transport axes X and Y), a distribution of case unit(s) within the storage structure <b>130</b> (e.g., on each storage level <b>130</b>L, one or more desired levels, and/or a desired portion of one or more storage levels <b>130</b>L), availability of a bot <b>110</b>, and/or an availability of a lift <b>150</b>.

At least one side of at least one of the picking aisles <b>130</b>A of at least one storage level <b>130</b>L may have one or more storage shelves (e.g. formed by rails <b>1210</b>, <b>1200</b> and slats <b>1210</b>S or other suitable case supports) provided at differing heights so as to form multiple shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> between the storage or deck levels <b>130</b>L defined by the transfer decks <b>130</b>B (and the rails <b>1200</b>S which form an aisle deck).

Dynamic allocation of the pickfaces and case units that make up the pickfaces is provided, for example, in the manner described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,594,835 issued on Nov. 26, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For example, the controller, such as control server <b>120</b> monitors the case units stored on the shelves and the empty spaces or storage locations between the case units. The empty storage locations are dynamically allocated such that, for exemplary purposes only, one case having a first size is replaced by three cases each having a second size which when combined fits into the space previously reserved for the first size case, or vice versa. Dynamic allocation substantially continuously resizes the empty storage locations as case units are placed on and removed from the storage shelves (e.g. the storage locations do not have a predetermined size and/or location on the storage shelves). As such, case unit (or tote) pickfaces of variable lengths and widths are positioned at each two dimensional storage location on the storage shelves (e.g. on each storage shelf level <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b>) with minimum gaps G (e.g. that effect picking/placing of case units free from contact with other case units stored on the shelves, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) between adjacent stored case units/storage spaces.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described above, the spacing between the rails <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b> (e.g. storage shelves) is a variable spacing so as to minimize (e.g. provide only sufficient clearance for insertion and removal of case units from a respective storage location) the vertical gap VG between vertically stacked case units. As will be described below (e.g., with respect to sections SECA, SECB in, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>), in one aspect the vertical spacing between rails <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b> varies along a length of a respective picking aisle <b>130</b>A while in other aspects the spacing between rails or horizontal support members <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b> may be substantially continuous along a picking aisle <b>130</b>A. As may be realized and as described in greater detail below, the spacing between the rails <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b> on one side PAS<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of a picking aisle <b>130</b>A may be different than the spacing between rails <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b> on an opposite side PAS<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the same picking aisle <b>130</b>A.

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, minimizing the gaps G, VG in both the horizontal and vertical directions results in a densely packed case unit arrangement within the storage shelves so as to form the high density three dimensional rack array RMA where, for example, the high density multi-level shelving aisles increases throughput along the X throughput axis and enables an ordered/sorted (e.g. according to the predetermined load out sequence) multi-pick of two or more case units from a common picking aisle in one common pass of the picking aisle as will be described below. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, one section SECB of the storage level <b>130</b>L includes two storage shelves (e.g., formed by rails <b>1200</b>, <b>1210</b>) where one shelf has a pitch of Z<b>1</b>A and the other shelf has a pitch of Z<b>1</b>B where Z<b>1</b>A and Z<b>1</b>B are different from each other.

In this aspect the storage level <b>130</b>L includes another storage section SECA that has three storage shelves where one shelf has a pitch of Z<b>1</b>E, one storage shelf has a pitch of Z<b>1</b>D and the other storage shelf has a pitch of Z<b>1</b>C where Z<b>1</b>E, Z<b>1</b>D and Z<b>1</b>C are different from each other. In other aspects at least two of the pitches Z<b>1</b>E, Z<b>1</b>D and Z<b>1</b>C are substantially the same. In one aspect the pitch between the shelves is arranged so that larger and/or heavier case units CUC, CUE are arranged closer to the deck/rail <b>1200</b>S than smaller and/or lighter case units CUD, CUA, CUB.

In still other aspects, the pitch of rack shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> on one storage level is a constant pitch (e.g. the rack shelf levels are substantially equally spaced in the Z direction) while the pitch of rack shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> on a different storage level is a different constant pitch.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one aspect, the storage space(s) <b>130</b>S defined by the storage shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> between the storage or deck levels <b>130</b>L accommodates case units of different heights, lengths, widths and/or weights at the different shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,884,719 issued on Feb. 6, 2018, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> the storage level <b>130</b>L includes storage sections having at least one intermediate shelf <b>1210</b>.

In one aspect the pitch Z<b>1</b> between storage levels <b>130</b>L may be any suitable pitch such as, for example, about 32 inches to about 34 inches while in other aspects the pitch may be more than about 34 inches and/or less than about 32 inches. Any suitable number of shelves may be provided between the decks/rails <b>1200</b>S of adjacent vertically stacked storage levels <b>130</b>L where the shelves have the same or differing pitches between the shelves.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one aspect of the disclosed embodiment the storage or deck levels <b>130</b>L (e.g. the surface on which the bots <b>110</b> travel) are arranged at any suitable predetermined pitch Z<b>1</b> that is not, for example, an integer multiple of the intermediate shelf pitch(es) Z<b>1</b>A-Z<b>1</b>E. In other aspects the pitch Z<b>1</b> may be an integer multiple of the intermediate shelf pitch, such as for example, the shelf pitch may be substantially equal to the pitch Z<b>1</b> so that the corresponding storage space has a height substantially equal to the pitch Z<b>1</b>. As may be realized, the shelf pitch Z<b>1</b>A-Z<b>1</b>E is substantially decoupled from the storage level <b>130</b>L pitch Z<b>1</b> and corresponds to general case unit heights as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. In one aspect of the disclosed embodiment case units of different heights are dynamically allocated or otherwise distributed along each aisle within a storage space <b>130</b>S having a shelf height commensurate with the case unit height. The remaining space between the storage levels <b>130</b>L, both along the length of the aisle coincident with the stored case unit (e.g. in the X direction with respect to the rack frame of reference REF<b>2</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) where the X direction is the same in the bot frame of reference REF (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) as the bot travels through a picking aisle <b>130</b>A) and alongside the stored case unit, being freely usable for dynamic allocation for cases of a corresponding height. As may be realized, the dynamic allocation of case units having different heights onto shelves having different pitches provides for stored case layers of different heights, between storage levels <b>130</b>L on both sides of each picking aisle <b>130</b>A, with each case unit being dynamically distributed along a common picking aisle <b>130</b>A so that each case unit within each stored case layer being independently accessible (e.g. for picking/placing) by the bot in the common aisle. This high density placement/allocation of case units and the arrangement of the storage shelves provides maximum efficiency of storage space/volume use between the storage levels <b>130</b>L, and hence of maximum efficiency of the rack module array RMA, with optimized distribution of case unit SKU's, as each aisle length may include multiple case units of different heights, yet each rack shelf at each shelf level may be filled by dynamic allocation/distribution (e.g. to fill the three dimensional rack module array RMA space in length, width and height, to provide a high density storage array).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one aspect, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b>B</figref> each of the storage levels <b>130</b>L includes a single level of storage shelves to store a single level of case units (e.g. each storage level includes a single case unit support plane CUSP) and the bots <b>110</b> are configured to transfer case units to and from the storage shelves of the respective storage level <b>130</b>L. For example, the bot <b>110</b>&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is substantially similar to bot <b>110</b> described herein however, the bot <b>110</b>&#x2032; is not provided with sufficient Z-travel of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA for placing case units on the multiple storage shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b> (e.g. accessible from a common rail <b>1200</b>S as shown in, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) as described above. Here the transfer arm drive <b>250</b> (which may be substantially similar to one or more of drive <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B) includes only sufficient Z-travel for lifting the case units from the case unit support plane CUSP of the single level of storage shelves, for transferring the case units to and from the payload area <b>110</b>PL and for transferring the case units between the fingers <b>273</b> of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA and the payload bed <b>110</b>PB. Suitable examples of bots <b>110</b>&#x2032; can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat.

The aisle shelf sections SECA, SECB are ordered/matched to each other based on, for example, a pick sequence of a bot <b>110</b> traversing the aisle in a common pass picking case units destined for a common order fill (e.g. based on the order out sequence). In other words, a bot <b>110</b> makes a single pass (e.g. traversal in a single direction) down a single or common picking aisle while picking one or more case units from aisle shelf sections SECA, SECB on a common side of the picking aisle <b>130</b>A to build a pickface on the bot <b>110</b> where the pickface includes case units that are arranged on the bot according to, for example, the infeed order sequence <b>173</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) to the lifting transport system <b>500</b>. Each of the aisle rack sections SECA, SECB includes intermediate shelves in the manner described above. In other aspects some of the aisle shelves do not include intermediate shelves while others do include intermediate shelves.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one aspect, the ordered aisle rack sections SECA, SECB include shelf pitches that are different between sections SECA, SECB. For example, aisle rack section SECA has shelves with one or more pitches while aisle rack section SECB has shelves with one or more different pitches (e.g. different than the pitches of the shelves in section SECA). In accordance with the aspects of the disclosed embodiment, the pitch of at least one intermediate shelf of one aisle rack section SECA, SECB is related to the pitch of at least one intermediate shelf of another of the ordered aisle rack sections SECA, SECB of the common picking aisle <b>130</b>A. The different pitches of the intermediate shelves/rails <b>1210</b> in the ordered aisle rack section SECA, SECB are selected so as to be related and to effect multiple (at least two) ordered picks (i.e. picks in an ordered sequence) with a bot <b>110</b>, in accordance with a mixed SKU load out sequence (e.g. palletizing to a common pallet load), from shelves of different pitches, from a common pass of a common picking aisle <b>130</b>A. As may be realized, the mixed load output from the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> (e.g. to fill a truck loadport/pallet load) is sequenced in a predetermined order according to various load out picking aisles (e.g. aisles from which case units are picked for transfer to an outgoing pallet) and the shelf pitch in the ordered sections SECA, SECB facilitates a bot <b>110</b> pick of more than one case unit in ordered sequence according to an order of the load out sequence in a common picking aisle pass (e.g. more than one case unit is picked in a predetermined order from a common picking aisle in one pass of the common picking aisle). The different aisle shelf pitches of the ordered rack sections SECA, SECB are so related to increase the probability of such an ordered multi-pick (the picking of two or more case units from a single aisle with a single pass of the aisle as described above) so that the multi-pick is performed by each bot order fulfillment pass along each aisle, and so related such that more than a majority of cases picked in the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b> by the bots <b>110</b> and destined for a common load out (e.g. a common pallet load) are picked by a common bot <b>110</b> according to the infeed order sequence <b>173</b> to the lifting transport system <b>500</b> (e.g. the two or more cases picked by the bot <b>110</b> are picked from the same picking aisle in a single pass, e.g. the bot travels in a single direction once through the picking aisle). As may be realized, in one aspect of the disclosed embodiment both sides PAS<b>1</b>, PAS<b>2</b> of the picking aisle <b>130</b>A have ordered aisle rack sections SECA, SECB where one ordered section may be matched with one or more sections on the same side PAS<b>1</b>, PAS<b>2</b> of the common picking aisle <b>130</b>A.

In one aspect the buffer stations BS on one or more of the stacked levels TL<b>1</b>, TL<b>2</b> also serve as a handoff/interface station with respect to the load handling device LHD of the lift <b>150</b>. In one aspect, where the bots, such as bots <b>110</b>&#x2032;, are configured for the transfer of case units to a single level <b>130</b>L of storage shelves, the interface stations TS and/or buffer stations BS also include a single level of transfer rack shelves (which are substantially similar to the storage rack shelves of the storage levels <b>130</b>L described above with respect to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). As may be realized, operation of the storage and retrieval system with bots <b>110</b>&#x2032; serving the single level storage and transfer shelves is substantially similar to that described herein. As may also be realized, load handling device LHD handoff (e.g. pick and place) of case units (e.g. individual case units or pickfaces) and totes to the stacked rack shelves RTS (and/or the single level rack shelves) occurs in a passive manner substantially similar to that between the bot <b>110</b> and the storage spaces <b>130</b>S (as described herein) where the case units or totes are transferred to and from the shelves.

Any suitable wheels <b>201</b> are mounted to the frame on opposite sides of the bot <b>110</b> at end <b>110</b>E<b>2</b> (e.g. second longitudinal end) of the bot <b>110</b> for supporting the bot <b>110</b> on the drive surface. In one aspect the wheels <b>201</b> are caster wheels that freely rotate allowing the bot <b>110</b> to pivot through differential rotation of the drive wheels <b>202</b> for changing a travel direction of the bot <b>110</b>. In other aspects the wheels <b>201</b> are steerable wheels that turn under control of, for example, a bot controller <b>110</b>C (which is configured to effect control of the bot <b>110</b> as described herein) for changing a travel direction of the bot <b>110</b>. In one aspect the bot <b>110</b> includes one or more guide wheels <b>110</b>GW located at, for example, one or more corners of the frame <b>110</b>F. The guide wheels <b>110</b>GW may interface with the storage structure <b>130</b>, such as with guide rails <b>1200</b>S (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) within the picking aisles <b>130</b>A, on the transfer deck <b>130</b>B and/or at interface or transfer stations for interfacing with the lift modules <b>150</b> for guiding the bot <b>110</b> and/or positioning the bot <b>110</b> a predetermined distance from a location to/from which one or more case units are placed and/or picked up as described in, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/326,423 filed on Dec. 15, 2011 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As noted above, the bots <b>110</b> may enter the picking aisles <b>130</b>A having different facing directions for accessing storage spaces <b>130</b>S located on both sides of the picking aisles <b>130</b>A. For example, the bot <b>110</b> may enter a picking aisle <b>130</b>A with end <b>110</b>E<b>2</b> leading the direction of travel or the bot may enter the picking aisle <b>130</b>A with end <b>110</b>E<b>1</b> leading the direction of travel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The payload section <b>110</b>PL of the bot <b>110</b> includes a payload bed <b>110</b>PB, a fence or datum member <b>110</b>PF, a transfer arm <b>110</b>PA and a pusher bar or member <b>110</b>PR. In one aspect the payload bed <b>110</b>PB includes one or more rollers <b>110</b>RL that are transversely mounted (e.g. relative to a longitudinal axis LX of the bot <b>110</b>) to the frame <b>110</b>F so that one or more case units carried within the payload section <b>110</b>PL can be longitudinally moved (e.g. justified with respect to a predetermined location of the frame/payload section and/or a datum reference of one or more case units) along the longitudinal axis of the bot, e.g., to position the case unit at a predetermined position within the payload section <b>110</b>PL and/or relative to other case units within the payload section <b>110</b>PL (e.g. longitudinal forward/aft justification of case units). In one aspect the rollers <b>110</b>RL may be driven (e.g. rotated about their respective axes) by any suitable motor for moving the case units within the payload section <b>110</b>PL. In other aspects the bot <b>110</b> includes one or more longitudinally movable pusher bar (not shown) for pushing the case units over the rollers <b>110</b>RL for moving the case unit(s) to the predetermined position within the payload section <b>110</b>PL. The longitudinally movable pusher bar may be substantially similar to that described in, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/326,952 filed on Dec. 15, 2011, the disclosure of which was previously incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is movable in the Y direction, relative to the bot <b>110</b> reference frame REF to effect, along with the fence <b>110</b>PF and or pick head <b>270</b> of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA, a lateral justification of case unit(s) within the payload area <b>110</b>PL in the manner described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/107,135 filed on Jan. 23, 2015, previously incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the case units are placed on the payload bed <b>110</b>PB and removed from the payload bed <b>110</b>PB with the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA along the Y transport axis. The transfer arm <b>110</b>PA includes a lift mechanism or unit <b>200</b> located substantially within the payload section <b>110</b>PL as described in, for example, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/107,135 filed on Jan. 23, 2015, previously incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The lift mechanism <b>200</b> provides both gross and fine positioning of pickfaces carried by the bot <b>110</b> which are to be lifted vertically into position in the storage structure <b>130</b> for picking and/or placing the pickfaces and/or individual case units to the storage spaces <b>130</b>S (e.g. on a respective storage level <b>130</b>L on which the bot <b>110</b> is located). For example, the lift mechanism <b>200</b> provides for picking and placing case units at the multiple elevated storage shelf levels <b>130</b>LS<b>1</b>-<b>130</b>LS<b>4</b>, TL<b>1</b>, TL<b>2</b> accessible from the common picking aisle or interface station deck/rail <b>1200</b>S (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>5</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The lift mechanism <b>200</b> is configured so that combined robot axis moves are performed (e.g. combined substantially simultaneous movement of the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR, lift mechanism <b>200</b>, pick head extension and fore/aft justification mechanism(s) such as, e.g., the longitudinally movable pusher bar described above), so that different/multi-sku or multi-pick payloads are handled by the bot. In one aspect, the actuation of the lifting mechanism <b>200</b> is independent of actuation of the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR as will be described below. The decoupling of the lift mechanism <b>200</b> and pusher bar <b>110</b>PR axes provides for combined pick/place sequences effecting a decreased pick/place cycle time, increased storage and retrieval system throughput and/or increased storage density of the storage and retrieval system as described above. For example, the lift mechanism <b>200</b> provides for picking and placing case units at multiple elevated storage shelf levels accessible from a common picking aisle and/or interface station deck <b>1200</b>S as described above.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The lifting mechanism may be configured in any suitable manner so that a pick head <b>270</b> of the bot <b>110</b> bi-directionally moves along the Z axis (e.g. reciprocates in the Z direction&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In one aspect, the lifting mechanism includes a mast <b>200</b>M and the pick head <b>270</b> is movably mounted to the mast <b>200</b>M in any suitable manner. The mast is movably mounted to the frame in any suitable manner so as to be movable along the lateral axis LT of the bot <b>110</b> (e.g. in the Y direction so as to define the Y transport axis). In one aspect the frame includes guide rails <b>210</b>A, <b>210</b>B to which the mast <b>200</b>M is slidably mounted. A transfer arm drive <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B may be mounted to the frame for effecting at least movement of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA along the lateral axis LT (e.g. Y axis) and the Z axis. In one aspect the transfer arm drive <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B includes an extension motor <b>301</b> and a lift motor <b>302</b>. The extension motor <b>301</b> may be mounted to the frame <b>110</b>F and coupled to the mast <b>200</b>M in any suitable manner such as by a belt and pulley transmission <b>260</b>A, a screw drive transmission (not shown) and/or a gear drive transmission (not shown). The lift motor <b>302</b> may be mounted to the mast <b>200</b>M and coupled to pick head <b>270</b> by any suitable transmission, such as by a belt and pulley transmission <b>271</b>, a screw drive transmission (not shown) and/or a gear drive transmission (not shown). As an example, the mast <b>200</b>M includes guides, such as guide rails <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B, along which the pick head <b>270</b> is mounted for guided movement in the Z direction along the guide rails <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B. In other aspects the pick head is mounted to the mast in any suitable manner for guided movement in the Z direction. With respect to the transmissions <b>271</b>, a belt <b>271</b>B of the belt and pulley transmission <b>271</b> is fixedly coupled to the pick head <b>270</b> so that as the belt <b>271</b>B moves (e.g. is driven by the motor <b>302</b>) the pick head <b>270</b> moves with the belt <b>271</b>B and is bi-directionally driven along the guide rails <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B in the Z direction. As may be realized, where a screw drive is employed to drive the pick head <b>270</b> in the Z direction, a nut may be mounted to the pick head <b>270</b> so that as a screw is turned by the motor <b>302</b> engagement between the nut and screw causes movement of the pick head <b>270</b>. Similarly, where a gear drive transmission is employed a rack and pinion or any other suitable gear drive may drive the pick head <b>270</b> in the Z direction. In other aspects any suitable linear actuators are used to move the pick head in the Z direction. The transmission <b>260</b>A for the extension motor <b>301</b> is substantially similar to that described herein with respect to transmission <b>271</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> the pick head <b>270</b> of the bot <b>110</b> transfers case units between the bot <b>110</b> and a case unit pick/place location such as, for example, the storage spaces <b>130</b>S, peripheral buffer stations BS, BSD and/or interface stations TS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B</figref>) and in other aspects substantially directly between the bot <b>110</b> and a lift module(s) <b>150</b>. In one aspect, the pick head <b>270</b> includes a base member <b>272</b>, one or more tines or fingers <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E and one or more actuators <b>274</b>A, <b>274</b>B. The base member <b>272</b> is mounted to the mast <b>200</b>M, as described above, so as to ride along the guide rails <b>280</b>A, <b>280</b>B. The one or more tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E are mounted to the base member <b>272</b> at a proximate end of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E so that a distal end of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E (e.g. a free end) is cantilevered from the base member <b>272</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E are configured for insertion between slats <b>1210</b>S that form the case unit support plane CUSP of the storage shelves.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">One or more of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E is movably mounted to the base member <b>272</b> (such as on a slide/guide rail similar to that described above) so as to be movable in the Z direction. In one aspect any number of tines are mounted to the base member <b>272</b> while in the aspect illustrated in the figures there are, for example, five tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E mounted to the base member <b>272</b>. Any number of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E are movably mounted to the base member <b>272</b> while in the aspect illustrated in the figures, for example, the outermost (with respect to a centerline CL of the pick head <b>270</b>) tines <b>273</b>A, <b>273</b>E are movably mounted to the base member <b>272</b> while the remaining tines <b>273</b>B-<b>273</b>D are immovable relative to the base member <b>272</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this aspect the pick head <b>270</b> employs as few as three tines <b>273</b>B-<b>273</b>D to transfer smaller sized case units (and/or groups of case units) to and from the bot <b>110</b> and as many as five tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E to transfer larger sized case units (and/or groups of case units) to and from the bot <b>110</b>. In other aspects, less than three tines are employed (e.g. such as where more than two tines are movably mounted to the base member <b>272</b>) to transfer smaller sized case units. For example, in one aspect all but one tine <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E is movably mounted to the base member so that the smallest case unit being transferred to and from the bot <b>110</b> without disturbing other case units on, for example, the storage shelves has a width of about the distance X<b>1</b> between slats <b>1210</b>S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The immovable tines <b>373</b>B-<b>373</b>D define a picking plane SP of the pick head <b>270</b> and are used when transferring all sizes of case units (and/or pickfaces) while the movable tines <b>373</b>A, <b>373</b>E are selectively raised and lowered (e.g. in the Z direction with the actuators <b>274</b>A, <b>274</b>B) relative to the immovable tines <b>373</b>B-<b>373</b>D to transfer larger case units (and/or pickfaces). Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> an example is shown where all of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E are positioned so that a case unit support surface SF of each tine <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E is coincident with the picking plane SP of the pick head <b>270</b> however, as may be realized, the two end tines <b>273</b>A, <b>273</b>E are movable so as to be positioned lower (e.g. in the Z direction) relative to the other tines <b>273</b>B-<b>273</b>D so that the case unit support surface SF of tines <b>273</b>A, <b>273</b>E is offset from (e.g. below) the picking plane SP so that the tines <b>273</b>A, <b>273</b>E do not contact the one or more case units carried by the pick head <b>270</b> and do not interfere with any unpicked case units positioned in storage spaces <b>130</b>S on the storage shelves or any other suitable case unit holding location.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The movement of the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E in the Z direction is effected by the one or more actuators <b>274</b>A, <b>274</b>B mounted at any suitable location of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA. In one aspect, the one or more actuators <b>274</b>A, <b>274</b>B are mounted to the base member <b>272</b> of the pick head <b>270</b>. The one or more actuators are any suitable actuators, such as linear actuators, capable of moving one or more tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E in the Z direction. In the aspect illustrated in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> there is one actuator <b>274</b>A, <b>274</b>B for each of the movable tines <b>273</b>A, <b>273</b>E so that each moveable tine is independently movable in the Z direction. In other aspects one actuator may be coupled to more than one movable tine so that the more than one movable tine move as a unit in the Z direction.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As may be realized, movably mounting one or more tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E on the base member <b>272</b> of the pick head <b>270</b> provides for full support of large case units and/or pickfaces on the pick head <b>270</b> while also providing the ability to pick and place small case units without interfering with other case units positioned on, for example, the storage shelves, interface stations and/or peripheral buffer stations. The ability to pick and place variably sized case units without interfering with other case units on the storage shelves, interface stations and/or peripheral buffer stations reduces a size of a gap GP (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) between case units on the storage shelves. As may be realized, because the tines <b>273</b>B-<b>273</b>D are fixed to the base member <b>272</b> there is no duplicative motion when picking/placing case units as the lifting and lowering of case units and/or pickfaces to and from the case unit holding location is effected solely by the lift motor <b>301</b>, <b>301</b>A.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, it is again noted that the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is movable independent of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is movably mounted to the frame in any suitable manner such as by, for example, a guide rod and slide arrangement and is actuated along the Y direction (e.g. in a direction substantially parallel to the extension/retraction direction of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA). In one aspect at least one guide rod <b>360</b> is mounted within the payload section <b>110</b>PL so as to extend transversely relative to the longitudinal axis LX of the frame <b>110</b>F. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR may include at least one slide member <b>360</b>S configured to engage and slide along a respective guide rod <b>360</b>. In one aspect, at least the guide rod/slide arrangement holds the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR captive within the payload section <b>110</b>PL. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is actuated by any suitable motor and transmission, such as by motor <b>303</b> and transmission <b>303</b>T. In one aspect the motor <b>303</b> is a rotary motor and the transmission <b>303</b>T is a belt and pulley transmission. In other aspects the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR may be actuated by a linear actuator having substantially no rotary components.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is arranged within the payload section <b>110</b>PL so as to be substantially perpendicular to the rollers <b>110</b>RL and so that the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR does not interfere with the pick head <b>270</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, the bot <b>110</b> is in a transport configuration where at least one case unit would be supported on the rollers <b>110</b>RL (e.g. the rollers collectively form the payload bed). In the transport configuration the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E of the pick head <b>270</b> are interdigitated with the rollers <b>110</b>RL and are located below (along the Z direction) a case unit support plane RSP of the rollers <b>110</b>RL. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is configured with slots <b>351</b> into which the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E pass where sufficient clearance is provided within the slots <b>351</b> to allow the tines to move below the case unit support plane RSP and to allow free movement of the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR without interference from the tines <b>273</b>A-<b>273</b>E. The pusher bar <b>110</b>PR also includes one or more apertures through which the rollers <b>110</b>RL pass where the apertures are sized to allow free rotation of the rollers about their respective axes. As may be realized, the independently operable pusher bar <b>110</b>PR does not interfere with the rollers <b>110</b>RL, extension of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA in the transverse direction (e.g. Y direction) and the lifting/lowering of the pick head <b>270</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As noted above, because the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR is a separate, standalone axis of the bot <b>110</b> that operates free of interference from the pick head <b>270</b> extension and lift axes, the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR can be operated substantially simultaneously with the lifting and/or extension of the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA. The combined axis moves (e.g. the simultaneous movement of the pusher bar <b>110</b>PR with the transfer arm <b>110</b>PA extension and/or lift axes) provides for increased payload handling throughput in along the Y transport axis and effects the ordered (e.g. according to a case transfer sequence of the respective asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b>) multi-pick of two or more case units from a common picking aisle, in one common pass of the picking aisle as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,856,083 issued on Jan. 2, 2018, the disclosure of which was previously incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref>, as noted above, the lifts <b>150</b> forming the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn is controlled by control server <b>120</b> so that when picking and placing case unit(s) the pick head is raised and/or lowered to a predetermined height corresponding to, for example, an interface station TS at a predetermined storage level <b>130</b>L and/or the traverse <b>550</b> (e.g., to at least in part resequence the mixed cases). In one aspect, the control server <b>120</b> also controls the traverse <b>550</b> so that the traverse transfer case units, not only to the output station <b>16</b>OUT, but also between the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn. Here the more than one independent lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn resequences inferior ordered sequence of mixed cases <b>170</b> alone or in conjunction with the traverse <b>550</b> in any suitable manner, such as described below.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one aspect, as described herein, the more than one lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn forms a bypass or pass through (on the fly or in motus) in the lift transport stream. As described herein, each level <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b> has an asynchronous level transport system (where, e.g., asynchronous may refer to the bots <b>110</b> being undeterministic, and, at least in part, the transfer deck <b>130</b>B being undeterministic so that each aisle/storage location communicates with the input/output stations at each level <b>130</b>L). Each asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b> has a level transport rate TXR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that may be optimized in any suitable manner for load balancing. The level transport rate TXR produces or otherwise defines load spreading so each bot <b>110</b> may effect a similar number (e.g., average number) of transactions (e.g., moving cases from storage to the input/output stations). In other aspects the level transport rate TXR may be time optimized to minimize transaction time to and from the storage racks for one or more cases, via one or more bots <b>110</b>/asynchronous level transport axes X, Y of at least part of one or more asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b>. In still other aspects, the level transport rate TXR may be a combination of load balancing and time optimization. As may be realized, the level transport rate TXR promotes a rate of optimization, for the asynchronous level transport system <b>191</b> (e.g., by load balancing and/or time optimization) over the sequence of mixed cases in the level transport transactions. In one aspect, at least some sequencing may be performed by the asynchronous level transport system(s) <b>191</b> in a manner similar to that described in, for example, United States pre-grant publication number 2016/0207711 published on Jul. 21, 2016 (application Ser.

No. 15/003,983), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties; however, in other aspects the sequencing of cases by the asynchronous level transport system(s) <b>191</b> may be a secondary consideration and be based on, for example, opportunity via level transfer rate optimization. The level transport rate produces or otherwise defines the available sequence of mixed cases (also referred to as the inferior ordered sequence of mixed cases <b>170</b>) defined and effected by the level transport rate TXR at the infeed interface <b>555</b>, see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and equation [1] below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one aspect, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>5</b>A, and <b>7</b></figref>, the control server <b>120</b> may control the more than one lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn to sequence the cases (e.g., multi-lift case sequencing) so that the case units are picked by the more than one lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn in an inferior manner, from any of level <b>130</b>L of the multi-level transport system <b>190</b>, where the case units are transported to the traverse <b>550</b> in the superior ordered sequence of mixed cases <b>171</b>S. By way of example, the control server <b>120</b> may include a system model <b>128</b> and a state maintenance and estimation module <b>129</b> substantially similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,733,638 issued on Aug. 15, 2017 (application Ser. No. 14/229,004) the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The system model <b>128</b> may model performance aspects, and constraints of components (e.g., the lift axes <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn, the storage structure <b>130</b>, bots <b>110</b>, input and output stations, etc.) of the storage and retrieval system <b>100</b>. The system model solution may explore state trajectories for action, such as transportation of cases in an order list by the more than one lift axis <b>150</b>X<b>1</b>-<b>150</b>Xn.
