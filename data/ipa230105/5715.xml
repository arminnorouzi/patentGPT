splash in a rotary-type plasma head, which prevents secondary contamination of a plasma device or a workpiece from occurring due to oil leakage from the rotating head of a plasma device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The &#x201c;plasma&#x201d; refers to a collection of particles comprised of ion nuclei and free electrons that are generated when the temperature is increased by continuous application of heat to a gaseous substance. This state of matter is called the &#x201c;plasma state&#x201d;, and is called the fourth state of matter, after the states of matter of solid, liquid and gas. The plasma state is electrically neutral, and when used as a coating on a surface of a material, it can prevent abrasion or corrosion, and thus provide the effect of enhancing the state of the material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, an atmospheric pressure plasma generator includes a tube configured to generate plasma when compressed air or plasma generating gas is collided with high-frequency, high-voltage electric charges. The atmospheric pressure plasma device may be applied to various materials and substrates with low-temperature process, and since it does not require a vacuum container or a vacuum evacuation device, fast and economic treatment is provided. In addition, when used, a deposition method using the atmospheric pressure plasma provides good adhesion and low deposition temperature, and thus, it is used in relatively various industries by utilizing the advantages such as reduction in deformation or denaturation that accompanies high temperature heating in the related surface treatment process, semiconductor process, and display process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the atmospheric pressure plasma device may use a fixed plasma head to perform surface treatment on a specific area of the workpiece, or a rotary-type plasma header to perform surface treatment on a relatively large surface area by uniformly spraying a plasma beam of constant intensity thereon. In the rotary-type plasma generator, by the characteristic in which the nozzle for radiating plasma is rotated, a bearing may be used for smooth operation of a mechanical configuration that rotates the nozzle. In such a rotary-type plasma head, the bearing oil may leak outside through the joint of a body which is rotated under high temperature and high speed conditions. The oil leaking outside while the plasma nozzle is rotating is problematic, since it can contaminate other parts of the plasma generator or cause secondary contamination of the workpiece.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to address the problems occurring in the related art described above, the present disclosure provides a system and a method for preventing oil splash in a rotary-type plasma head, which prevents secondary contamination from occurring due to oil leakage of the rotating head of a plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a system and a method for preventing oil splash in a rotary-type plasma head are provided, which may include: a nozzle unit through which plasma is discharged;

The system <b>100</b> may use the generated plasma for surface treatment of a workpiece made of an organic polymer material, and in this case, it is possible to improve hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, dyeability, adhesiveness, and the like of the polymer material. In another example, the system <b>100</b> may be used for surface treatment of a workpiece made of a metal material, and in this case, it is possible to improve the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the surface by coating the surface of the metal with a carbide film such as TiN/C, CrN/C, AIN, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the system <b>100</b> is an atmospheric pressure plasma generator, the system <b>100</b> may include a generator, a high voltage transformer, electrodes (not illustrated) for generating plasma discharge, and the like, so as to be driven in a normal room temperature and normal pressure environment. The high frequency high voltage generated by the high voltage transformer is applied to the electrodes installed inside the system <b>100</b>, and a high frequency discharge in the form of an electric arc is generated between the electrodes by the applied voltage. As described above, in a state that the generated electric arc is inside the system <b>100</b>, the working gas is contacted with the electric arc and converted into the plasma state. The plasma beam generated in the system <b>100</b> is discharged through the nozzle unit <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The nozzle unit <b>200</b> includes a nozzle <b>210</b>, a nozzle detaching unit <b>220</b> formed at one side to attach and detach the nozzle <b>210</b>, and a nozzle body unit <b>230</b> formed at the other side and coupled to one side of the rotating body unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The nozzle body unit <b>230</b> may form a space in which electrons generated from the electrode is discharged through the working gas. Meanwhile, the nozzle <b>210</b> may be designed to have various shapes such that the area in which the plasma beam spreads, its intensity, and the like can be adjusted. According to positions and sizes of nozzle holes formed in the nozzle <b>210</b>, the direction of injection and diameter of the plasma beam discharged through this may be determined, and the radius and length of injection of the plasma beam may be determined according to shapes of the nozzle holes. The main material of the nozzle <b>210</b> may be a metal material such as aluminum, brass, stainless steel, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The nozzle detaching unit <b>220</b> may be manufactured in compliance with standard specifications for compatibility with nozzles of various shapes. Various depths and sizes of nozzle holes may be formed in the nozzle <b>210</b> as need arises according to the plasma surface treatment operation. In addition, the operator is able to easily replace only the nozzle <b>210</b> from the nozzle detaching unit <b>220</b> in accordance with the type of operation and perform the operation with precision, and also quickly cope with diverse variables.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an embodiment, the rotating body unit <b>300</b> includes a cylindrical rotating body <b>310</b> formed at one side, and a rotating support <b>320</b> connected to one side of a housing unit <b>400</b> formed at the other side.

As described above, the rotating body unit <b>300</b> is configured such that it <b>300</b> is connected to the nozzle unit <b>200</b> and the housing unit <b>400</b> on both sides so as to serve as a frame containing therein the rotation support <b>320</b>, the oil hose unit <b>330</b>, and the bearing unit <b>340</b>, while also playing a role of transmitting the rotational force transmitted from a rotation power unit <b>600</b> to the nozzle unit <b>200</b> to rotate the nozzle unit <b>200</b>. The rotating body unit <b>300</b> may be manufactured by precision processing a rigid material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to an embodiment, in the rotary-type plasma generator, by the structural characteristic in which the nozzle for radiating the plasma is rotated, a bearing may be used for smooth operation of a mechanical configuration that rotates the nozzle. Specifically, the bearing unit <b>340</b> may be configured inside the rotating body unit <b>300</b> to allow smooth rotation of the rotating body unit <b>300</b>, and may include bearing oil therein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the rotating body unit <b>300</b> of the rotary-type plasma head is rotated under high temperature and high speed conditions, the bearing oil of the bearing unit <b>340</b> may be vaporized or micro-dropletized and leak outside through the joints of the components of the rotating body unit <b>300</b>. There is a problem that the oil vapor and oil micro-droplets leaking outside during the rotation of the plasma head contaminate the other parts of the plasma generator or cause secondary contamination of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to address the problems mentioned above, the oil cover unit <b>500</b> according to the present disclosure includes a suction fan <b>510</b> formed inside and an oil cover <b>520</b> formed outside. The suction fan <b>510</b> may be fixed to one side of the rotating body unit <b>300</b> with a screw. The suction fan <b>510</b> may be configured to move a flow of air inside the oil cover unit <b>500</b> toward the housing unit <b>400</b> through the oil hose unit <b>330</b> formed inside the rotating body unit <b>300</b> so as to discharge the oil vapor and oil micro-droplets outside. In addition, the oil cover <b>520</b> is configured to prevent the oil vapor and oil micro-droplets from splashing out of the nozzle unit <b>200</b> and the rotating body unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to an embodiment, the housing unit <b>400</b> includes a housing cap <b>410</b>, a front partition wall <b>420</b>, a rear partition wall <b>430</b>, and a housing bottom part <b>440</b>.

Specifically, during an operation of the plasma head that is rotated with high speed, if the bearing oil used in the bearing unit <b>340</b> is vaporized and micro-dropletized, the oil vapor and oil micro-droplets are prevented from leaking out, by the oil cover unit <b>500</b> attached to the one side of the nozzle unit <b>200</b> and the outer side of the rotating body unit <b>300</b>. That is, the oil cover <b>520</b> formed outside the oil cover unit <b>500</b> can prevent the oil vapor and oil micro-droplets discharged out of the nozzle unit <b>200</b> and the rotating body unit <b>300</b> from splashing. Meanwhile, the suction fan <b>510</b> formed inside the oil cover unit <b>500</b> may be rotated integrally with the rotating body unit <b>300</b>, moving the air flow inside the oil cover unit <b>500</b> toward the housing unit <b>400</b> through the oil hose unit <b>330</b> formed inside the rotating body unit <b>300</b>, and thereby sucking and moving oil vapor and oil micro-droplets contained in the oil cover unit <b>500</b> to the housing unit <b>400</b>.
