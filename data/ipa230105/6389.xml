The devices may have input/output (I/O) connectors for connecting with plug connectors terminating the ends of the cable. The cable may be constructed to carry electrical or optical signals. For transmitting optical signals, a transceiver is provided at one end of the cable for converting the optical signals to electrical signals. A transceiver may also be provided for a cable that carries electrical signals, as the signals may be amplified or converted between a signal format used on the cable and a signal format used within a device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The plugs and I/O connectors may be constructed according to standards that enable components from different manufacturers to mate. For example, the Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP) standard defines a compact, hot-pluggable transceiver used for data communications applications. The form factor and electrical interface are specified by a multi-source agreement (MSA) under the auspices of the Small Form Factor (SFF) Committee. Components made according to the QSFP standard is widely used to interface networking hardware (such as servers and switches) to fiber optic cables or active or passive electrical connections.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A QSFP plug mates with a receptacle, which is typically mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB). To block electromagnetic interference (EMI), the receptacle may be located within a metal cage also mounted to the PCB. The receptacle is typically set back from the edge of the PCB and located at the back portion of the cage. The front portion of the cage usually extends through a panel of an electronic device and has an opening for receiving the QSFP transceiver. A channel extends from the opening at the front portion of the cage toward the rear portion to guide the transceiver into engagement with the receptacle. Such an arrangement may be used to connect a circuit board inside an electronic device to an external device using a cable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A transceiver for converting optical signals to electrical signals may consume a lot of power, and therefore generate a lot of heat. A QSFP transceiver might consume 12 Watts (W) of power, for example. Transceivers that process more signals, such as transceivers made according to a QSFP-DD standard, may consume up to 15 W. Large amounts of heat may cause the temperature around electronic, optical, or other components to exceed the rated operating temperature, contributing to errors during operation or reducing the lifetime of the components. Heat generated by a transceiver may be dissipated through the use of a cooling fan that flows air over the metal cage. Heat sinks may be mounted to the outside of the cage to further dissipate heat from the transceiver.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similar issues of high heat generation within a small area arise with other form factors, such as OSFP, which is expected to generate heat in the range of 7.5 to 15 W per transceiver.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some systems, two or more transceivers are disposed in close proximity to each other. I/O connectors may be configured in a &#x201c;stacked&#x201d; configuration to support use of multiple transceivers. For example, an upper transceiver and lower transceiver may be stacked within one cage to make a double stacked connector.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention relates to an I/O connector, including one or more features to provide thermal and/or electrical performance when used with a OSFP or similar transceiver.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, a stacked connector may comprise a housing and a plurality of conductive elements. The housing may have a first sidewall and a second sidewall, opposite the first sidewall; a mating face extending between the first sidewall and the second sidewall, the mating face comprising a first slot and a second slot; a mounting face, perpendicular to the mating face and extending between the first sidewall and the second sidewall; a top face, opposite the mounting face and extending between the first sidewall and the second sidewall. Each of the plurality of conductive elements may comprise a mating contact portion, a contact tail and an intermediate portion joining the mating contact portion and the contact tail. The mating contact portions may be exposed within the first slot and the second slot. The contact tails may be exposed at the mounting face. At least one of the first sidewall or the second sidewall may comprise a segment adjacent the mounting face and a portion extending from the segment to the top face. The portion may comprise at least one airflow opening therethrough.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect relates to a method of operating an electronic device comprising an enclosure comprising a panel having an opening therethrough; an I/O connector assembly comprising a connector and a cage mounted to a printed circuit board exposed through an opening in the panel, wherein the cage comprises at least one channel; and a transceiver positioned within a channel of the at least one channel. The method may comprise operating the transceiver at a data rate in excess of 110 Gbps; and expelling air from the enclosure so as to cause a flow of air along a path through the cage, the path comprising a segment through openings in sidewalls of the connector and through a channel between the sidewalls of the connector and sidewalls of the cage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment, a stacked connector of the type having a mounting face and a mating face perpendicular to the mounting face and sides perpendicular to both the mating face and the mounting face may comprise a housing and a plurality of lead assemblies. The housing may comprise at least a first slot portion and a second slot portion, wherein each of the first and second slot portions comprises a slot passing therethrough and walls bounding the slot. Opposing first and second side walls may bound a cavity within the housing. The first and second sidewalls may support the first slot portion and the second slot portion at the mating face such that at least 50% of the mating face of the housing between the first slot portion and the second slot portion is open to the passage of air into the cavity. The plurality of lead assemblies may be within the cavity, and each of the plurality of lead assemblies may comprise a plurality of conductive elements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing is a non-limiting summary of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a simplified sketch of an electronic device including a stacked I/O connector within a cage;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of a cage for a stacked I/O connector;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a perspective view of a transceiver with integrated heat sink that may be inserted into a channel of cage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a rear, side perspective view of a stacked I/O connector;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a front, side perspective view of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partially exploded view of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, with lead frame assemblies removed from the housing;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear, side perspective view of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, illustrating the angle, A, of the intermediate portions of upper lead frame assemblies relative to a plane of the mounting interface;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a rear, side view of the lead frame assemblies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a rear, side view of the housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, without the lead frame assemblies;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a front view of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a front view of the lead frame assemblies of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, without the housing;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view of the lead frame assemblies of the stacked I/O connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> without the housing;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of the lead frame assemblies of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, with the outer, upper lead frame assembly and the outer, lower lead frame assembly removed;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of a member that is at least partially conductive with projections configured to project towards ground conductors of the outer, upper lead frame assembly;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of two members that are at least partially conductive with projections configured to project towards ground conductors of the outer, upper lead frame assembly and the inner, upper lead frame assembly;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> is a perspective view of conductive elements of the inner, upper lead frame assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is a front, right side perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a stacked 2&#xd7;1 cage;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is a rear, right side perspective view of the stacked 2&#xd7;1 cage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> is a rear, bottom, right side perspective view of the stacked 2&#xd7;1 cage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a front, right side perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a ganged 2&#xd7;4 cage;

The inventors have recognized and appreciated I/O designs that provide both thermal and electrical properties that support operation with high speed transceivers, including at data rates above 110 GBps, even in a stacked configuration. The inventors have recognized and appreciated that an increased density of I/O connections may require improved heat dissipation when using I/O connectors that are conventionally positioned in a flow path for air cooling a transceiver.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Increased density may arise from transceivers that process more signals in the same space, such as may arise in transceivers compliant with the OSFP specification. Additionally, increased density may result from &#x201c;stacking&#x201d; connectors, which results in transceivers one above the other with only a small space between them. Connector designs may provide improved heat dissipation even for stacked connectors.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Those techniques may entail forming a connector with a web-like housing over all or portions of the exterior surfaces of the housing. A back wall, for example, may be opening, and there may be openings over a large portion, such as at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75% or at least 80%, of portions of the mating face, top, and sides other than support members. Lead assemblies, inserted into the housing, may similarly be formed with openings to enable air to flow through the connector. That air may flow with relatively low resistance from front to back to align with the flow of cooling air in many electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, metal members, or members that are at least partially conductive, may be attached to leads to improve signal integrity. These members may be positioned at locations where they provide a suitable improvement in signal integrity to support high data rates without providing an unacceptable resistance to airflow.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the members that are at least partially conductive include projections that are electrically and mechanically coupled to select conductive elements in the connector. The select conductive elements, for example, may be ground conductors and electrical and mechanical coupling may be achieved by welding a metal member and/or metal portions of a member comprising both metal and lossy portions to the ground conductors. Connection of such members may increase signal integrity at higher frequencies, enabling the connector to carry high speed signals.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Such connectors may be used in devices such as switches, routers, servers and other high-performance electronic devices, for example.

Openings <b>352</b> may enable air to flow from the interior of cavity <b>360</b> to the exterior of the housing through the top face.

Further, central member <b>350</b> may be shaped to engage with complementary features on lead subassembly <b>310</b>A.

For example, the number and spacing of conductive elements may be selected such that the maximum spacing between conductive elements is less than one half of the wavelength of the highest frequency in the designed operating range of the connector. The conductive element may also positioned so as not to block air flow through the lead assembly. The positioning of these members may be a compromise between meeting the goals of improving signal integrity and not blocking airflow. The members may be positioned for example so as not to be evenly spaced along the length of the conductive elements to avoid a member in the intermediate portions aligned with openings <b>530</b>, for example. Exemplary positions that meet these criteria are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Likewise, lead subassembly <b>318</b> is shown without lead assembly <b>316</b> such that members that are at least partially conductive (not numbered) positioned to make contact with selected conductive elements in lead assembly <b>316</b> are visible.

In such a configuration, the members that contact selective ones of the conductive elements in a row may have the same configuration. For example, the conductive elements in a row may be configured in a repeating signal-signal-ground (S-S-G) arrangement, and each member may be configured to contact grounds. In such a configuration, the members may have projections that align with the ground conductors. The members may be attached to a lead assembly with the projections contacting or extending towards and in close proximity with the ground conductors. In the illustrated embodiment, the projections may be welded to the ground conductors.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary member <b>810</b>C.

Such a configuration enables the body to be electrically connected to multiple ones of the conductive elements in the row. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> illustrates conductive elements before being inserted molded into lead assembly <b>312</b>. In this example, there are two groups of conductive elements, each with a first type of conductive element and a second type of conductive element.

The projections <b>912</b> may be welded to the wider portion <b>940</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Welding may provide for low inductance connections between ground conductors, which may increase the frequency of ground system resonances within the connector, thereby enabling high frequency operation of the connector. Relatively wide and long welded joints may be formed between projections <b>912</b> and the ground conductors, which contribute to low inductance connections. The joints may be, for example, greater than 0.4 mm long, such as between 0.4 and 1 mm long, and greater than 0.2 mm wide, such as between 0.2 and 0.4 mm wide.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Low inductance may also be provided by relatively wide conducting paths between adjacent ground conductors. In the illustrated embodiment, adjacent ground conductors are coupled through bar <b>910</b> as well as side strips <b>914</b>A and <b>914</b>B.

In the illustrated embodiment, those members are conductive, being made from metal. In other embodiments, the members may be or include lossy material such that the members are partially conductive. In some embodiments, lossy material may be used instead of or in addition to metal to form members such as <b>810</b>A, <b>810</b>B, <b>810</b>C and <b>810</b>D. Lossy material, such as lossy plastic, for example, may be molded over or otherwise adhered to metal members. Alternatively, lossy material may be mechanically fixed to the metal members, such as by pressing barbs from the metal members into the lossy material.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Materials that conduct, but with some loss, or material which by another physical mechanism absorbs electromagnetic energy over the frequency range of interest are referred to herein generally as &#x201c;lossy&#x201d; materials. Electrically lossy materials can be formed from lossy dielectric and/or poorly conductive and/or lossy magnetic materials. Magnetically lossy material can be formed, for example, from materials traditionally regarded as ferromagnetic materials, such as those that have a magnetic loss tangent greater than approximately 0.05 in the frequency range of interest. The &#x201c;magnetic loss tangent&#x201d; is the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part of the complex electrical permeability of the material. Practical lossy magnetic materials or mixtures containing lossy magnetic materials may also exhibit useful amounts of dielectric loss or conductive loss effects over portions of the frequency range of interest.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Electrically lossy material can be formed from material traditionally regarded as dielectric materials, such as those that have an electric loss tangent greater than approximately 0.05 in the frequency range of interest. The &#x201c;electric loss tangent&#x201d; is the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part of the complex electrical permittivity of the material. Electrically lossy materials can also be formed from materials that are generally thought of as conductors, but are either relatively poor conductors over the frequency range of interest, contain conductive particles or regions that are sufficiently dispersed that they do not provide high conductivity or otherwise are prepared with properties that lead to a relatively weak bulk conductivity compared to a good conductor such as copper over the frequency range of interest.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Electrically lossy materials typically have a bulk conductivity of about 1 Siemen/meter to about 10,000 Siemens/meter and preferably about 1 Siemen/meter to about 5,000 Siemens/meter. In some embodiments material with a bulk conductivity of between about 10 Siemens/meter and about 200 Siemens/meter may be used. As a specific example, material with a conductivity of about 50 Siemens/meter may be used. However, it should be appreciated that the conductivity of the material may be selected empirically or through electrical simulation using known simulation tools to determine a suitable conductivity that provides a suitably low crosstalk with a suitably low signal path attenuation or insertion loss.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Electrically lossy materials may be partially conductive materials, such as those that have a surface resistivity between 1 &#x3a9;/square and 100,000 &#x3a9;/square. In some embodiments, the electrically lossy material has a surface resistivity between 10 &#x3a9;/square and 1000 &#x3a9;/square. As a specific example, the material may have a surface resistivity of between about 20 &#x3a9;/square and 80 &#x3a9;/square.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, electrically lossy material is formed by adding to a binder a filler that contains conductive particles. In such an embodiment, a lossy member may be formed by molding or otherwise shaping the binder with filler into a desired form. Examples of conductive particles that may be used as a filler to form an electrically lossy material include carbon or graphite formed as fibers, flakes, nanoparticles, or other types of particles. Metal in the form of powder, flakes, fibers or other particles may also be used to provide suitable electrically lossy properties. Alternatively, combinations of fillers may be used. For example, metal plated carbon particles may be used. Silver and nickel are suitable metal plating for fibers. Coated particles may be used alone or in combination with other fillers, such as carbon flake. The binder or matrix may be any material that will set, cure, or can otherwise be used to position the filler material. In some embodiments, the binder may be a thermoplastic material traditionally used in the manufacture of electrical connectors to facilitate the molding of the electrically lossy material into the desired shapes and locations as part of the manufacture of the electrical connector. Examples of such materials include liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and nylon. However, many alternative forms of binder materials may be used. Curable materials, such as epoxies, may serve as a binder. Alternatively, materials such as thermosetting resins or adhesives may be used.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also, while the above described binder materials may be used to create an electrically lossy material by forming a binder around conducting particle fillers, the techniques described herein are not so limited. For example, conducting particles may be impregnated into a formed matrix material or may be coated onto a formed matrix material, such as by applying a conductive coating to a plastic component or a metal component. As used herein, the term &#x201c;binder&#x201d; encompasses a material that encapsulates the filler, is impregnated with the filler or otherwise serves as a substrate to hold the filler.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Preferably, the fillers will be present in a sufficient volume percentage to allow conducting paths to be created from particle to particle. For example, when metal fiber is used, the fiber may be present in about 3% to 40% by volume. The amount of filler may impact the conducting properties of the material.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Filled materials may be purchased commercially, such as materials sold under the trade name Celestran&#xae; by Celanese Corporation which can be filled with carbon fibers or stainless steel filaments. A lossy material, such as lossy conductive carbon filled adhesive preform, such as those sold by Techfilm of Billerica, Mass., US may also be used. This preform can include an epoxy binder filled with carbon fibers and/or other carbon particles. The binder surrounds carbon particles, which act as a reinforcement for the preform. Such a preform may be inserted in a connector wafer to form all or part of the housing. In some embodiments, the preform may adhere through the adhesive in the preform, which may be cured in a heat treating process. In some embodiments, the adhesive may take the form of a separate conductive or non-conductive adhesive layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive in the preform alternatively or additionally may be used to secure one or more conductive elements, such as foil strips, to the lossy material.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Various forms of reinforcing fiber, in woven or non-woven form, coated or non-coated may be used. Non-woven carbon fiber is one suitable material. Other suitable materials, such as custom blends as sold by RTP Company, can be employed, as the present invention is not limited in this respect.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, a lossy portion may be manufactured by stamping a preform or sheet of lossy material. For example, a lossy portion may be formed by stamping a preform as described above with an appropriate pattern of openings. However, other materials may be used instead of or in addition to such a preform. A sheet of ferromagnetic material, for example, may be used.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">However, lossy portions also may be formed in other ways. In some embodiments, a lossy portion may be formed by interleaving layers of lossy and conductive material such as metal foil. These layers may be rigidly attached to one another, such as through the use of epoxy or other adhesive, or may be held together in any other suitable way. The layers may be of the desired shape before being secured to one another or may be stamped or otherwise shaped after they are held together. As a further alternative, lossy portions may be formed by plating plastic or other insulative material with a lossy coating, such as a diffuse metal coating.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In yet other embodiments, lossy material may be integrated with lossy members <b>810</b>A, <b>810</b>B, <b>810</b>C, <b>810</b>D, as are shown attached to lead assembly <b>312</b>, and other similar members attached to other lead assemblies, by coating lossy material on the members. The coating may be applied as an adhesive. The adhesive may serve as a binder and may be filled with particles that make the adhesive lossy. Alternatively, other binders may alternatively or additionally be used. Similarly, lossy material may be applied as an ink or may be applied as a preform that is adhered to the metal member. Alternatively, a lossy structure may be mechanically attached to the metal member, such as via a snap fit, interference fit or other suitable type of mechanical connection. The lossy structure may be formed separately, such as via molding, and then mechanically attached to the metal member.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">For purposes of this patent application and any patent issuing thereon, the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d; The phrase &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean &#x201c;either or both&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases.
