Electronic document editors (e.g., word processors) typically provide various document operations, such as opening a document, saving a document, changing regular fonts to bold fonts, printing a document, etc. However, with the existing electronic document editors, finding and performing relevant document operations among numerous document operations often requires extra time and efforts. In some cases, the existing electronic document editors create a significant cognitive burden on a user when finding and performing relevant document operations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for a new method and system for finding and performing document operations in an electronic document editor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of embodiments (e.g., of server systems, client systems or devices, and methods of operating such systems or devices) that overcome the limitations and disadvantages described above are presented in more detail below. These embodiments provide methods, systems, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for finding and performing a document operation in an electronic document editor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described in more detail below, some embodiments described herein involve a computer-implemented method performed by a computer system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors. The method includes concurrently displaying at least a portion of a document and a document operation search region for receiving one or more search terms, and detecting user activation of the document operation search region. The method includes, in response to detecting the activation of the document operation search region, displaying a plurality of document operation labels that includes multiple document operation labels corresponding to popular document operations. Each document operation label corresponds to a respective document operation. The method also includes detecting user selection of a respective document operation label of the plurality of document operation labels, and performing the respective document operation that corresponds to the respective document operation label.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with some embodiments, a computer-implemented method is performed by a computer system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors. The method is performed at the computer system, prior to a respective user of the computer system signaling completion of a search query. The method includes receiving a partial search query, and predicting from the partial search query one or more document operation labels. Each document operation label corresponds to a respective document operation. The method also includes displaying at least a subset of the one or more document operation labels, and receiving user selection of a respective document operation label from the displayed subset of the one or more document operation labels. The method furthermore includes, in response to detecting the user selection, performing the respective document operation that corresponds to the respective document operation label.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with some embodiments, a computer-implemented method is performed by a computer system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors. The method includes concurrently displaying at least a portion of a document and a document operation search region for receiving a search query, receiving the search query in the document operation search region, and identifying one or more document operation labels that correspond to the search query. Each document operation label corresponds to a respective document operation. The method also includes displaying at least a subset of the one or more document operation labels, receiving user selection of a respective document operation label from the displayed subset of the one or more identified document operation labels, and in response to detecting the user selection, performing the respective document operation that corresponds to the respective document operation label.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with some embodiments, a computer-implemented method for providing document operation labels for use with a respective document is performed at a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors. The method includes displaying at least a portion of the respective document, and while displaying at least the portion of the respective document, receiving a request for document operation labels. The document operation labels correspond to respective document operations. The method also includes, in response to receiving the request for document operation labels, selecting a plurality of document operation labels at least in accordance with user data and user-interface data corresponding to a respective user of the computer system, and providing the plurality of document operation labels for display to the respective user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with some embodiments, a system includes one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
