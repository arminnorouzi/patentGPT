Such storage racks typically have a plurality of shelves horizontally arranged and supported by a frame assembly. In many applications multiple rack units are arranged next to each other. In order to maximize storage space within warehouses these storage racks are commonly arranged very close to each other such that a worker cannot easily walk between adjacent storage racks to observe and/or gain access to the items on the shelves of the storage racks.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A track system configured for use with a storage rack assembly is provided. The storage rack assembly has a frame assembly including first and second forward leg members, first and second rearward leg members and at least one shelf supported generally horizontally by the frame assembly. The track system comprises first and second forward wheel assemblies, first and second rearward wheel assemblies and a forward axle assembly. The first and second forward wheel assemblies are configured to be disposed on the respective first and second forward leg members. The first and second rearward wheel assemblies are configured to be disposed on the respective first and second rearward leg members. The forward axle assembly is coupled between the first and second forward wheel assemblies in an operating position. The forward axle assembly comprises, a first intermediate member, a first forward axle member and a second forward axle member. The first intermediate member extends along a first intermediate axis. The first forward axle member extends along a first forward axle axis.

The second forward axle member extend along a second forward axle axis. The second forward axle member has a first end coupled to the second forward wheel assembly and a second end slidably coupled to the first intermediate member. In the operating position, the first intermediate member inhibits rotation of the first and second forward axle members along their respective axes and maintains the first and second forward axle members in an orientation whereby the first and second forward axle axes are collinear with the first intermediate axis facilitating parallel rolling of the first and second forward wheel assemblies during movement of the storage rack assembly from a storage position to an access position.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to additional features, the track system further comprises a rearward axle assembly coupled between the first and second rearward wheel assemblies in an operating position.

The first and second rearward axle members define first and second respective outer diameters. The second intermediate member defines an inner diameter. The second ends of the respective first and second rearward axle members are at least partially received by the second intermediate member such that the first and second outer diameters oppose the inner diameter of the second intermediate member. The first forward axle member defines a threaded end that receives complementary threads on a first fastener coupled to the first wheel assembly in the operating position. The second forward axle member defines a threaded end that receives complementary threads on a second fastener coupled to the second wheel assembly in the operating position. The first rearward wheel assembly comprises a first rearward bracket that supports a first rearward wheel for rotation. The second rearward wheel assembly comprises a second rearward bracket that supports a second rearward wheel for rotation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to additional features, the track system further comprises a first track and a second track. The first track is configured for placement on a floor. The first track defines a first groove therein. The second track is configured for placement on the floor in an orientation generally parallel to the first track. The second track defines a second groove therein. The first and second rearward wheels are configured to be guided for rolling movement within the respective first and second grooves during movement of the storage rack assembly from the storage position to the access position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other features, the track system further comprises a first magnet and a second magnet. The first magnet is disposed on the first track. The first magnet has a forward facing magnetic surface and a rearward facing magnetic surface. The second magnet is disposed on the second track.
