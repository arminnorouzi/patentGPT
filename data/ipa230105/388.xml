It is also thought to be a major contributor to the proportional increased breathing in response to exertion in patients with heart failure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is difficult to measure precisely VDalv. However, it can be measured in combination with anatomical dead space (VDanat) as the &#x201c;physiological dead space&#x201d; (V<sub>Dphys</sub>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The volume of the physiological dead space (VDphys) can be calculated from how much it dilutes carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the perfused alveoli in a collection of exhaled gas. To do this, all the gas expired in, say, one minute is collected in a bag and then the fractional partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(FCO<sub>2</sub>) in the bag is measured by measuring the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PCO<sub>2</sub>) specific to the barometric pressure (P<sub>B</sub>), where:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>FCO<sub>2</sub>=PCO<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>B </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the bag comes from all parts of the lung, so it is called the &#x201c;mixed expired concentration&#x201d; (F&#x112;CO<sub>2</sub>). The volume of the dead space (VD) can be measured or estimated based on comparing the mixed expired concentration (F&#x112;CO<sub>2</sub>) to the concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the inspired gas (FICO<sub>2</sub>, 0%) and to the concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the alveoli (FACO<sub>2</sub>), which is assumed to be the concentration measured from the end of a breath, i.e., the end tidal concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>(F<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>). Note that the end tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) cannot be equal to the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the alveoli (PACO<sub>2</sub>) as it is a mixture of the PACO<sub>2 </sub>and inspired gas coming out of the alveolar dead space (VDalv). However, as the PACO<sub>2 </sub>is not otherwise measurable using conventional methodologies, this simplifying assumption is made. Another approximation of PACO<sub>2 </sub>is the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Two currently accepted ways of calculating physiological dead space (VDphys) are the Bohr method (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and the Enghoff method (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). The subject inhales air and exhales into a container for multiple breaths. The volume of the bag is the sum of the volume of inspired gas or tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>). The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>) in the bag is a mixture of PCO<sub>2 </sub>from alveoli and all of the dead space, and is called mixed expired PCO<sub>2 </sub>(P&#x112;CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>V<sub>T</sub>F&#x112;CO<sub>2</sub>=(V<sub>T</sub>&#x2212;VDphys)&#xd7;FACO<sub>2 </sub>(Bohr dead space)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0033" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>V<sub>T</sub>&#xd7;F&#x112;CO<sub>2</sub>=(V<sub>T</sub>&#x2212;VDphys)&#xd7;FaCO<sub>2 </sub>(Enghoff dead space)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">For the Bohr dead space, the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PACO<sub>2</sub>) is assumed to be that corresponding to halfway along the expiratory plateau (Phase III). For the Enghoff dead space, PACO<sub>2 </sub>is assumed to be equal to the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show that PaCO<sub>2 </sub>is usually greater than the end tidal partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) resulting in the calculation of a larger physiological dead space (VDphys) (VDaw is the volume of the airways, or VDanat). In addition, the substitution of PaCO2 for PACO2 by Enghoff produces confusion in the interpretation of the mechanisms of dead space production. The substitution is only valid in an ideal lung, one with perfect ventilation to perfusion ({dot over (V)}/{dot over (Q)}) matching for all units, which cannot be expected in practice.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">If physiological dead space (VDphys) can be determined, as above, then alveolar dead space (VDalv) can be computed as VDphys&#x2212;VDanat, provided that anatomical dead space (VDanat) can also be determined.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">As mentioned, anatomical dead space (VDanat) consists of the volume of the conducting airways, such as the trachea and bronchi. During inhalation, gas flows along the trachea, bronchi and eventually (mostly by diffusion) into the alveoli. The first gas inhaled during a breath reaches the alveoli. In the alveoli, it undergoes gas exchange with capillary blood to the point of equilibration so that the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>and the partial pressure of O<sub>2 </sub>of gas in the alveoli and capillary blood are the same. At the end of the expiration, the last approximately 150 ml of the breath remains in the anatomical dead space (VDanat). At the beginning of the next inspiration, the gas of the VDanat is the first to enter into the alveoli and joins with the gas in the functional residual capacity (FRC).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">The traditional way to measure anatomical dead space (VDanat) is to take a breath of pure oxygen and exhale while measuring flow and nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen concentration rises when the VDanat flow passes the sensor measuring nitrogen concentration. This is the Fowler dead space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows Fowler's illustration of the measurement of anatomical dead space, plotting exhaled concentration of nitrogen (C) following an inspired breath of 100% oxygen against exhaled volume (Vexp), where Cinsp represents the inspired nitrogen concentration (0%) and Calv represents the alveolar concentration of nitrogen. The vertical dashed line is positioned so that a and b subsume equal areas, and the intersection of the dashed line with the exhaled volume axis defines Vds, the anatomical dead space volume. Fowler noted that V<sub>Danat </sub>was very close to 1 ml/lb in both men and women. With deep breaths, V<sub>Danat </sub>may enlarge a little.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">The Fowler method is but one example and other methods are suggested. However, many of such methods of measuring anatomical dead space (VDanat) have poor rationale and have not&#x2014;indeed, cannot&#x2014;be validated against any standard. Moreover, these measures become less accurate the more mixing there is of the alveolar gas with gas in the alveolar dead space (VDalv) and anatomical dead space (VDanat).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">The conductive airway-alveolar interface constitutes the limit between the convective and diffusive transports of CO<sub>2 </sub>within the lungs. As each terminal bronchial cluster has its own interface due to the asymmetry of airways, and due to mixing and diffusion of gas between that from the bronchi and that in the alveoli, there has to be a broad (as opposed to an abrupt) transition of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PCO<sub>2</sub>) as measured at the sensor during an expiration. This gives rise to the slope in the transition from anatomical dead space gas to alveolar gas (also called Phase II slope). As a result, the airway-alveolar interface and thus the measure of the anatomical dead space (VDanat) is placed, merely by convention and for convenience (i.e., not by scientifically verified methods), at the midpoint of this Phase II. Engel and Paiva have provided theoretical evidence for this assumption, using mathematical simulation, yet it remains an assumption and not a measurement. The same extent of uncertainty applies to the calculation of alveolar dead space (VDalv).

An adequate partial pressure of O<sub>2 </sub>in arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is required to provide a partial pressure gradient for diffusion of O<sub>2 </sub>into the tissues. An optimal partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PCO<sub>2</sub>) is required to maintain pH in the blood and intracellular fluid for enzymes to work at optimal efficiency. The latter is controlled by feedback loops between blood partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PaCO<sub>2</sub>) as sensed by the carotid bodies, and tissue partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PCO<sub>2</sub>) in the medulla of the brain and the consequent adjustment of minute ventilation ({dot over (V)}<sub>E</sub>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">In the perfused alveoli, the partial pressures of CO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>(PCO<sub>2 </sub>and PO<sub>2</sub>) equilibrate with the blood, resulting PCO<sub>2 </sub>equal to that in the arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), say, about 40 mmHg The PCO<sub>2 </sub>in the alveoli is termed alveolar PCO<sub>2 </sub>and designated PACO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">If there were no blood that crossed from mixed venous side to the arterial side without undergoing gas exchange (i.e., shunt flow Qs), the arterial and alveolar partial pressures of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PaCO<sub>2 </sub>and PACO<sub>2</sub>) would be equal. To the extent that there is Qs, PaCO<sub>2 </sub>may exceed PACO<sub>2</sub>. As Qs is almost always small, and the CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the mixed venous blood is very close to that in the arterial blood, despite the difference in PCO<sub>2</sub>, except for very large shunt flow, there is very little difference between PaCO<sub>2 </sub>and PACO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">If blood flow is reduced to a part of the lung, for example by blockage of branches of the pulmonary artery such as by blood clot embolization (e.g., blocking off a major blood vessel to a part of the lung), the ventilation to that part of the lung is wasted (i.e., that part of the lung has high {dot over (V)}/{dot over (Q)}). The blood that would have perfused that lung is redistributed to other parts of the lung where ventilation is intact. In these alveoli, where perfusion and ventilation are intact, the alveolar gas equilibrates with the capillary blood such that the alveolar partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PACO<sub>2</sub>) is normal, as then is the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(PaCO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">In the alveoli that are not perfused, PCO<sub>2 </sub>remains a function of the gas that was left in that space at the end of exhalation, plus what was inhaled. The latter consists of an initial volume of equilibrated gas left in the anatomical dead space (VDanat) from the previous breath, and room air with a partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>of 0 mmHg. At end inhalation, these gases mix, but no equilibration takes place. On exhalation, the end tidal partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) consists of a mixture of alveolar gas from perfused alveoli (PCO<sub>2 </sub>is about 40 mmHg) and gas from the alveolar dead space (VDalv), PCO<sub>2 </sub>of about 0 mmHg, mixed together. The greater the contribution from the alveolar dead space (VDalv), the lower the P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, and the less the measured P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2 </sub>reflects the actual PACO<sub>2 </sub>or PaCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">Discussed herein are techniques to directly measure the fractional alveolar partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(FACO<sub>2</sub>) by reducing or eliminating the dilution effect of the alveolar dead space (VDalv) on the end tidal partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), thus making the end tidal partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) about equal to FACO<sub>2</sub>.
