Accordingly, the fuel cell has advantages of being environmentally friendly and alleviating concern over resource depletion caused by increased energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A stack that actually generates electricity in the fuel cell has a stacked structure of several to dozens of unit cells, each including a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) and a separator (also referred to as a &#x201c;bipolar plate&#x201d;). The membrane-electrode assembly generally includes an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte membrane interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fuel cell may be classified into an alkaline electrolyte fuel cell, a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC), and the like, depending on the state and type of the electrolyte. Among them, the polymer electrolyte fuel cell is receiving attention as a portable, vehicular or domestic power supply due to the advantages of a low operating temperature of less than 100&#xb0; C., quick start-up, rapid response, and excellent durability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typical examples of the polymer electrolyte fuel cell include a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which uses hydrogen gas as a fuel, a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), which uses liquid methanol as a fuel, and the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The reaction occurring in the polymer electrolyte fuel cell will be briefly described.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">First, when a fuel such as hydrogen gas is supplied to an anode, the hydrogen is oxidized to produce a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) and an electron (e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). The produced proton is transferred to the cathode through the polymer electrolyte membrane, whereas the produced electron is transferred to the cathode through an external circuit. Oxygen supplied to the cathode is bonded to the proton and the electron and is thus reduced, thereby producing water.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to realize the commercialization of fuel cells (particularly fuel cells for transportation), it is most important to secure mechanical durability during long-term operation. In general, the mechanical durability of a fuel cell greatly depends on the mechanical durability of a polymer electrolyte membrane, which repeatedly swells and contracts in response to changes in humidity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A redox flow battery (RFB) is a secondary battery that can be used for a long time by being repeatedly charged and discharged through a reversible electrochemical reaction involving an electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The redox flow battery (RFB) generally includes two types of liquid electrolytes, which are isolated from each other via a polymer electrolyte membrane. A first liquid electrolyte reaction at an anode is different from a second liquid electrolyte reaction at a cathode, causing a difference in pressure. In order to overcome this pressure difference and exhibit excellent battery performance even after repeated charging and discharging, the polymer electrolyte membrane requires high ionic conductivity and excellent mechanical durability.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an attempt to improve the mechanical durability of the polymer electrolyte membrane, a reinforced composite membrane-type polymer electrolyte membrane produced by impregnating a porous support with an ion conductor dispersion has been proposed. However, as the thickness of the porous support increases, the electrical performance of the polymer electrolyte membrane, such as ion conductivity thereof, deteriorates, so the thickness of the porous support cannot be increased indefinitely. Therefore, there is a limitation to the improvement in mechanical durability of the polymer electrolyte membrane that can be achieved by controlling the thickness of the porous support.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an attempt to increase mechanical durability by reducing swelling and contraction of the polymer electrolyte membrane caused by humidity changes by lowering the solubility of the ion conductor in water, it has been suggested to induce a crosslink structure of the ion conductor through addition of metal ions. However, a plurality of ion exchange groups of the ion conductor binds to one metal ion, and loses hydrogen and thus ion-transport ability thereof when binding thereto, so the number of ion exchange groups capable of performing ion transport greatly decreases. As a result, the electrical performance of the polymer electrolyte membrane is deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another attempt to increase the mechanical durability of the polymer electrolyte membrane, it has been suggested to use an ion conductor having an intramolecular crosslink structure. However, such an ion conductor is inapplicable to a reinforced composite membrane-type polymer electrolyte membrane including a porous support impregnated with an ion conductor because (i) separate complicated processes are required in order to manufacture the ion conductor having an intramolecular crosslink structure, and (ii) the ionic conductor having an intra-molecular crosslink structure has relatively low fluidity, and (iii) causes deterioration in the flexibility of the polymer electrolyte membrane.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">US Patent No. 2005/004834 A1 proposes improving the mechanical durability of a polymer electrolyte membrane by inducing a crosslink structure by a covalent bond through polycondensation between an ion exchange group of an ion conductor and a hydroxyl group or an amine group of a crosslinking agent. However, since the ion exchange group of the ion conductor loses hydrogen and thus ion transport ability is lost when the polycondensation reaction is performed, a decrease in the ion conductivity of the polymer electrolyte membrane cannot be avoided.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore,

Therefore, the polymer electrolyte membrane of the present disclosure has much better ion conductivity than the polymer electrolyte membrane of the prior art, in which the ion exchange group loses hydrogen when forming a covalent crosslink with the crosslinking agent, and consequently also loses ion transport ability.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">The polymer electrolyte material of the present disclosure, having an ionic crosslink structure or a hydrogen-bond crosslink structure, is different from a polymer electrolyte material having a covalent crosslink structure in that it is soluble in a dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">In the present disclosure, whether the polymer electrolyte material is soluble or insoluble in the DMAc solvent is determined as follows.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">0.1 g of the polymer electrolyte material is added to 10 g of a 99.5% DMAc solvent and stirred at 70&#xb0; C. for 40 hours at 240 rpm, and the resulting mixture is filtered using filter paper (No. 2) from ADVANTEC.

That is, in Comparative Example 3, the ion exchange group of the ion conductor lost hydrogen while binding to metal ions and lost ion transport ability, so the number of ion exchange groups capable of performing ion transport decreased, and the ion conductivity of the polymer electrolyte membrane also decreased. On the other hand, in Examples 1 to 5 of the present disclosure, ion transport ability was not lost, so the polymer electrolyte membrane had relatively high ionic conductivity (i.e., ionic conductivity the same as or similar to that of the polymer electrolyte membrane of Comparative Example 1, in which no material for forming a crosslink structure was added to the PFSA).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0124">In addition, the hydrocarbon ion conductor as well as the fluorinated ion conductor had the above-described advantageous effects due to the addition of the organic compound of the present disclosure.
