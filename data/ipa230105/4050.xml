Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a liquid crystal display device, and an electronic appliance including them. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a liquid crystal display device in which an electric field generally parallel to a substrate is generated to control liquid crystal molecules, and an electronic appliance including the semiconductor device or the liquid crystal display device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As one of plans for technical development of a liquid crystal display device, to widen a viewing angle can be given. As a technique for realizing a wide viewing angle, a mode in which an electric field generally parallel to a substrate is generated and liquid crystal molecules are moved in a plane parallel to the substrate to control grayscale is employed. As such a mode, IPS (In-Plane Switching) and FFS (Fringe-Field Switching) are given. In these modes, a first electrode (such as a pixel electrode with which voltage is controlled for each pixel) having a slit (an opening pattern) is located under a liquid crystal and a second electrode (such as a common electrode with which common voltage is applied to all pixels) is located under the first electrode. An electric field is applied between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, so that the liquid crystal is controlled. With such layout, an electric field in a direction parallel to a substrate is applied to the liquid crystal. Therefore, the liquid crystal molecules can be controlled with the electric field. That is, the liquid crystal molecules which are aligned parallel to the substrate (so called homogeneous alignment) can be controlled in a direction parallel to the substrate; therefore, viewing angle is increased.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, both common electrode and pixel electrode are formed of ITO (indium tin oxide) (Patent Document 1: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2000-89255 (FIGS. 5 and 14th paragraph)).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, in the case of employing a structure in which the second electrode (such as the common electrode) is located under the first electrode (such as the pixel electrode), both the common electrode and the pixel electrode are formed of ITO conventionally. Accordingly, the numbers of manufacturing steps and masks, and manufacturing cost have been increased. The present invention is made in view of the foregoing, and an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device and an electronic appliance with wide viewing angle, having less numbers of manufacturing steps and masks and low manufacturing cost compared with a conventional device; and to provide a manufacturing method of the liquid crystal display device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the aforementioned problems, a liquid crystal display device according to the present invention includes a first electrode formed over a substrate, an insulating film formed over the first electrode, a second electrode formed over the insulating film, and a liquid crystal provided over the second electrode; in which the second electrode has an opening pattern and the first electrode has a semiconductor film containing silicon.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A semiconductor device according to the present invention includes a first electrode formed over a substrate, an insulating film formed over the first electrode, and a second electrode formed over the insulating film; in which the second electrode has an opening pattern and the first electrode has a semiconductor film containing silicon</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A liquid crystal display device according to the present invention includes a first electrode formed over a substrate, an insulating film formed over the first electrode, a second electrode formed over the insulating film, a liquid crystal provided over the second electrode, and a transistor formed over the substrate; in which the second electrode has an opening pattern, the first electrode has a semiconductor film containing silicon, the transistor has a semiconductor film containing silicon, and the semiconductor film included in the first electrode is formed at the same time as the semiconductor film included in the transistor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A semiconductor device according to the present invention includes a first electrode formed over a substrate, an insulating film formed over the first electrode, a second electrode formed over the insulating film, and a transistor formed over the substrate; in which the second electrode has an opening pattern, the first electrode has a semiconductor film containing silicon, the transistor has a semiconductor film containing silicon, and the semiconductor film included in the first electrode is formed at the same time as the semiconductor film included in the transistor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the liquid crystal display device and the semiconductor device, the first electrode and the semiconductor film included in the transistor are formed at the same time, and then, etched and patterned at the same time. Accordingly, the first electrode and the semiconductor film included in the transistor contain the same material. In addition, an n-type impurity or a p-type impurity is introduced thereto at the same time in some cases. In such a case, they have a portion with approximately the same concentration of the impurity. Note that the transistor includes a portion to which the impurity is introduced, a portion to which the impurity is slightly introduced, a portion to which the impurity is hardly introduced, and the like. The first electrode is generally in the same states as the portion in the semiconductor film included in the transistor, to which the impurity is introduced in many cases. Thus, the first electrode can be formed at the same time as the transistor. Therefore, an additional step is not required to form the first electrode. In addition, a liquid crystal display device with wide viewing angle and low manufacturing cost compared with a conventional device can be provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Note that the opening pattern includes not only a closed opening pattern such as a slit, but also a space which is located between the conductive patterns and in which the conductive pattern is not formed, such as a space between the comb-teeth of a comb-shaped electrode. The same can be applied to description hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Note that in the aforementioned liquid crystal display device and the semiconductor device, a portion in which first and second interlayer insulating films are provided between the first electrode and the second electrode, and the second electrode and the first electrode except for the opening pattern are overlapped each other the first electrode; the first interlayer insulating film, and the second electrode can function as a capacitor.

That is, as long as current flow can be controlled, any type of switch can be used without being limited to a particular type. For example, a transistor, a diode (such as a PN diode, a PIN diode, a Schottky diode, or a diode-connected transistor), or a logic circuit that is a combination thereof may be used. In the case of using a transistor as a switch, a polarity (conductivity) type of the transistor is not particularly limited because it operates as a mere switch. However, when off current is preferred to be small, a transistor of a polarity with smaller off current is desirably used. As a transistor with small off current, a transistor having an LDD region, a transistor having a multigate structure, and the like are given. Further, an N channel transistor is desirably used when a potential of a source terminal of the transistor functioning as a switch is close to a low potential side power source (Vss, GND, 0V, or the like). On the other hand, a P-channel transistor is desirably used when the potential of the source terminal is close to a high potential side power source (Vdd or the like). This is because it is easy for a transistor to function as a switch when an absolute value of a gate-source voltage is increased. Note that a CMOS switch can also be applied by using both N-channel and P-channel transistors. With a CMOS switch, an operation can be appropriately performed even when the situation changes such that a voltage outputted through the switch (that is, an input voltage) is higher or lower than an output voltage. Although as a switch in the present invention, a TFT controlling a pixel electrode, a switch element used in a driver circuit portion, and the like are given; a switch can be employed in another part, if current flow is required to be controlled.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present invention, &#x201c;being connected&#x201d; includes &#x201c;being electrically connected&#x201d; and &#x201c;being directly connected&#x201d;. Here, &#x201c;being electrically connected&#x201d; refers to a state in which an element capable of electric connection (such as a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor a resistor, or a diode) may be interposed in the predetermined connection. In addition, &#x201c;being directly connected&#x201d; refers to only a specific case of &#x201c;being electrically connected&#x201d;, where no element capable of electric connection is interposed and direct connection is achieved. That is, &#x201c;being directly connected&#x201d; specifically refers to &#x201c;being electrically connected&#x201d; without another element interposed in the predetermined connection. Note that the description &#x201c;being directly connected&#x201d; means the same as &#x201c;being connected in a direct manner&#x201d; is also used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that a display element, a display device, and a light emitting device can employ various modes or can include various elements. For example, a display medium whose contrast varies by an electromagnetic action can be used, such as an EL element (an organic EL element, an inorganic EL element, or an EL element including organic and inorganic substances), an electron emitting element, a liquid crystal element, electron ink, a grating light valve (GLV), a plasma display panel (PDP), a digital micromirror device (DMD), a piezoceramic display, or a carbon nanotube. Note that a display device using an EL element includes an EL display; a display device using an electron emitting element includes a field emission display (FED), an SED flat panel display (SED: Surface-conduction Electron-emitter Display), and the like; a display device using a liquid crystal element includes a liquid crystal display, a transmissive liquid crystal display, a transflective liquid crystal display, and a reflective liquid crystal display; and a display device using electronic ink includes electronic paper. As an application of the present invention other than a liquid crystal element, for example, an electrode containing silicon is used for an electrode in an EL element and the like. Therefore, an element such as an EL element can be manufactured at low cost. In this case, an electrode may have an opening pattern, but not necessarily. When an electrode containing silicon of the present invention is used in an organic EL element, a structure in which a layer containing an organic compound is interposed between electrodes is favorably employed, but not necessarily. On the other hand, when the electrode containing silicon of the present invention is used in an inorganic EL element, a structure in which a layer containing an inorganic compound is interposed between electrodes may be employed, or a structure in which a layer containing an inorganic compound is formed over the electrode may be employed; since AC drive is possible in the inorganic EL element. In the latter structure, light emission can be carried out with use of a lateral electric field formed by a first electrode and a second electrode. With such a structure, a component which attenuates light from the electrode or the like is not necessarily provided on a light emitting side, accordingly, luminance of the EL display device is improved and deterioration of the EL display device is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Note that various types of transistors can be applied to the present invention and an applicable type of the transistor is not limited. Accordingly, the present invention can employ a thin film transistor (TFT) using a non-single crystalline semiconductor film typified by amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon, a transistor using a semiconductor substrate or an SOI substrate, a MOS transistor, a junction transistor, a bipolar transistor, a transistor using a compound semiconductor such as ZnO or a-InGaZnO, a transistor using an organic semiconductor or a carbon nanotube, and the like. In addition, a type of substrate on which a transistor is provided is not particularly limited. The transistor can be formed on a single crystalline substrate, an SOI substrate, a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a paper substrate, a cellophane substrate, a stone substrate, or the like. In addition, after forming a transistor over a substrate, the transistors may be transposed to another substrate to be located thereon.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Note that as described above, in the present invention, various types of transistor can be used and can be formed over any substrate. Therefore, all circuits may be formed over a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a single crystalline substrate, an SOI circuit, or any other circuit. When all circuits are formed on one substrate, the cost can be reduced by reducing the number of components and the reliability can be improved by reducing the number of connection to components in the circuits. Alternatively, it is possible that some circuits are formed on a substrate and some other circuits are formed on another substrate. That is, all of the circuits are not necessarily formed over one substrate. For example, some circuits are formed over a glass substrate with a use of a transistor while some other circuits are formed over a single crystalline substrate, and the IC chip may be connected to the glass substrate by COG (Chip On Glass) to be located thereover. Alternatively, the IC chip may be connected to the glass substrate by TAB (Tape Auto Bonding) or by using a printed board. In this manner, when some circuits are formed over one substrate, the cost can be reduced by reducing the number of components and the reliability can be improved by reducing the number of connection to components in the circuits. Further, when portions with high drive voltage or high drive frequency, which consume more power, are not formed on one substrate, increase in power consumption can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is to be noted that a transistor can have various structures and modes, and is not limited to a specific structure. For example, a multigate structure which has two or more gates may be employed as well. With a multigate structure, off current can be reduced and reliability can be improved by improving the pressure resistance of a transistor, and flat characteristics can be obtained such that a drain-source current hardly changes even when a drain-source voltage changes in operation in a saturation region. Alternatively, a structure in which gate electrodes may be provided over and under a channel may be employed. With such a structure in which gate electrodes are provided over and under a channel, a current value can be easily increased since a channel forming region increases, an S value (sub-threshold coefficient) can be reduced since a depletion layer is easily formed. Further alternatively, a structure in which a gate electrode is provided over a channel or under the channel may be employed. Also, a forward staggered structure or an inversed staggered structure may be employed. A channel forming region may be divided into a plurality of regions, connected in parallel, or connected in series. Further, a source electrode or a drain electrode may overlap with a channel (or a part thereof). Accordingly, with such a structure in which a source electrode or a drain electrode overlaps with a channel (or a part of thereof), charges are accumulated in a part of the channel and an unstable operation can be prevented. Further, an LDD region may be provided. By providing an LDD region, off current can be reduced and reliability can be improved by improving the withstand voltage of a transistor, and flat characteristics can be obtained such that a drain-source current hardly changes even when a drain-source voltage changes in operation in a saturation region.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Note that in the present invention, one pixel corresponds to one element which can control brightness. Therefore, for example, one pixel shows one color element by which brightness is expressed. Accordingly, in the case of a color display device formed of color elements of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), the smallest unit of an image includes three pixels of an R pixel, a G pixel, and a B pixel. Note that color elements are not limited to three colors and may be more colors, and RGBW (W is white) or RGB to which another color such as yellow, cyan, or magenta is introduced may be used, for example. Further, when one color element is controlled by using a plurality of regions, one of the regions corresponds to one pixel. For example, in the case of performing an area gray scale display, a plurality of regions are provided for one color element to control the brightness, which express gray scale as a whole. One of the regions to control the brightness corresponds to one pixel. Therefore, in that case, one color element includes a plurality of pixels. In that case, a region which contributes to display an image may differ in size depending on the pixels. Further, in a plurality of regions controlling the brightness which are provided for one color element, that is, in a plurality of pixels included in one color element, signals provided to each pixel may slightly differ from one another so that the viewing angle is expanded. Note that the description &#x201c;one pixel (for three colors)&#x201d; corresponds to three pixels of R, G, and B which are considered as one pixel; while &#x201c;one pixel (for one color)&#x201d; corresponds to a plurality of pixels provided for one color element which are collectively considered as one pixel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that in the present invention, there is a case where pixels are arranged in matrix. The case where pixels are arranged in matrix includes not only to a case where the pixels are arranged in a stripe pattern, which is a so-called grid configuration where longitudinal stripes and lateral stripes cross each other, but also to a case where three color elements are arranged in a so-called delta pattern when a full color display is performed using three color elements (for example, RGB). Further, a Bayer arrangement is also included. Note that the color element is not limited to three colors and may have more colors, for example, RGBW (W is white) or RGB to which yellow, cyan, or magenta is added. The size of a light emission area may be different depending on color elements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A transistor is an element including at least three terminals of a gate, a drain, and a source. A channel forming region is provided between a drain region and a source region. Here, it is difficult to determine which of two terminals is a source or a drain since it depends on a structure, operating condition, and the like of the transistor. Therefore, in the present invention, regions which function as a source and a drain are referred to as a first terminal and a second terminal, respectively.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that a gate includes a gate electrode and a gate wiring (also referred to as a gate line, a gate signal line, or the like) or a part thereof. A gate electrode corresponds to a conductive film a part of which overlaps with a semiconductor forming a channel forming region, an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) region, or the like, with a gate insulating film interposed therebetween. A gate wiring corresponds to a wiring for connecting gate electrodes of each pixel and a wiring for connecting a gate electrode and another wiring.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">However, there is a part which functions as a gate electrode and also as a gate wiring. Such a region may be referred to as a gate electrode or a gate wiring. That is, there is a region which cannot be distinguished as a gate electrode or a gate wiring. For example, in a case where a channel forming region overlaps with a gate wiring which is extended, the overlapped region functions both as a gate wiring and as a gate electrode. Therefore, such a region may be referred to as a gate electrode or a gate wiring.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, a region which is formed of the same material as a gate electrode and connected to the gate electrode may be referred to as a gate electrode as well. Similarly, a region which is formed of the same material as a gate wiring and connected to the gate wiring may be referred to as a gate wiring. In a strict sense, such a region does not overlap with a channel forming region or does not have a function to connect to another gate electrode in some cases. However, there is a region which is formed of the same material as a gate electrode or a gate wiring and connected to the gate electrode or the gate wiring due to manufacturing cost, reduction of steps, layout, and the like. Therefore, such a region may also be referred to as a gate electrode or a gate wiring.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, in a multigate transistor, gate electrodes of one transistor and another transistor are often connected through a conductive film formed of the same material as the gate electrode. Such a region for connecting the gate electrodes may be referred to as a gate wiring, or may be referred to as a gate electrode when a multigate transistor is considered as one transistor. That is, a component which is formed of the same material as a gate electrode or a gate wiring and connected to the gate electrode or the gate wiring may be referred to as a gate electrode or a gate wiring. Moreover, for example, a portion of a conductive film which connects a gate electrode and a gate wiring may also be referred to as a gate electrode or a gate wiring.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that a gate terminal corresponds to a part of a region of a gate electrode or a region electrically connected to the gate electrode.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that a source includes a source region, a source electrode, and a source wiring (also referred to as a source line, a source signal line, or the like) or a part thereof. A source region corresponds to a semiconductor region which contains a large amount of p-type impurities (boron, gallium, or the like) or n-type impurities (phosphorus, arsenic, or the like). Therefore, a region containing a small amount of p-type impurities or n-type impurities, that is, an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) region is not included in a source region. A source electrode corresponds to a conductive layer a part of which is formed of a different material from a source region and electrically connected to the source region. Note that a source electrode including a source region is sometimes referred to as a source electrode. A source wiring corresponds to a wiring for connecting source electrodes of each pixel and a wiring for connecting a source electrode and another wiring.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, there is a part which functions as a source electrode and also as a source wiring. Such a region may be referred to as a source electrode or a source wiring. That is, there is a region which cannot be distinguished as a source electrode or a source wiring. For example, when there is a source region overlapping with a source wiring which is extended, the region functions as a source wiring and also as a source electrode. Therefore, such a region may be referred to as a source electrode or a source wiring.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, a region which is formed of the same material as a source electrode and connected to the source electrode; or a part which connects one source electrode and another source electrode may also be referred to as a source electrode. Further, a part overlapping with a source region may be referred to as a source electrode. Similarly, a region which is formed of the same material as a source wiring and connected to the source wiring may be referred to as a source wiring. In a strict sense, there is a case where such a region does not have a function to connect one source electrode to another source electrode. However, there is a region which is formed of the same material as a source electrode or a source wiring and connected to the source electrode or the source wiring due to manufacturing cost, reduction of steps, layout, and the like. Therefore, such a region may also be referred to as a source electrode or a source wiring.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, a conductive film a part of which connects a source electrode and a source wiring may be referred to as a source electrode or a source wiring.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Note that a source terminal corresponds to a part of a source region, a source electrode, or a region electrically connected to a source electrode.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Note that a drain is similar to a source.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that in the present invention, a semiconductor device corresponds to a device including a circuit having a semiconductor element (a transistor, a diode, or the like). Further, a semiconductor device may correspond to a general device which functions by utilizing semiconductor characteristics. A display device corresponds to a device including a display element (a liquid crystal element, a light emitting element, or the like). Note that a display device may correspond to a display panel itself in which a plurality of pixels including display elements such as a liquid crystal element or an EL element and a peripheral driver circuit for driving the pixels are formed over a substrate. Moreover, a display device may include a device provided with a flexible printed circuit (FPC) or a printed wiring board (PWB). Further, a light emitting device corresponds to a display device including a self-luminous light emitting element such as an EL element or an element used for an FED, in particular. A liquid crystal display device corresponds to a display device including a liquid crystal element.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present invention, an expression that an object is formed on or formed over a different object does not necessarily mean that the object is in direct contact with the different object. The expression may include a case where two objects are not in direct contact with each other, that is, a case where another object is interposed therebetween. Accordingly, for example, when it is described that a layer B is formed on (or over) a layer A, it means either case where the layer B is formed on and in direct contact with the layer A, or where another layer (for example, a layer C or a layer D) is formed on and in direct contact with the layer A and the layer B is formed on and in direct contact with the layer C or D. Similarly, when it is described that an object is formed above a different object, it does not necessarily mean that the object is in direct contact with the different object, and another object may be interposed therebetween. Accordingly, for example, when it is described that a layer B is formed above a layer A, it means either case where the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer A, or where another layer (for example, a layer C or a layer D) is formed in direct contact with the layer A and the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer C or D. Similarly, when it is described that an object is formed below or formed under a different object, it means either case where the objects are in direct contact with each other or not in contact with each other. In addition, if not specifically limited, one surface of a substrate is referred to as an upper direction, and the other surface of the substrate is referred to as a lower direction. That is, in a case where a layer B is formed over a layer A in manufacturing steps, its structure can be considered as a structure where the layer B is formed over the layer A, even when a completed product is turned upside down. That is, an expression over or under only refers to a side of an object to which another object is formed, and does not have a general meaning of over or under, which is &#x201c;a direction with respect to gravity&#x201d;. Needless to say, similar description can be applied to other directions such as left or light. Note that it is not limited thereto when it is particularly specified, and the direction of gravity or the like may be employed as a standard.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the present invention, a semiconductor film in a transistor and a first electrode for driving a liquid crystal can be formed in the same step. As a result, the first electrode can be manufactured without increasing the numbers of masks (reticles) and manufacturing steps.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, a liquid crystal display device with wide viewing angle and low manufacturing cost compared with a conventional device can be provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention can be carried out with many different modes and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be modified in various ways without departing from the purpose and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the description of the embodiment modes and embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate a basic example of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a plan view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A first electrode <b>102</b> is formed over a substrate <b>100</b>. The first electrode <b>102</b> is formed with use of ITO (indium tin oxide) conventionally.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the present invention, the first electrode <b>102</b> is formed of, for example, a semiconductor material containing silicon, although not limited thereto. Alternatively, amorphous silicon may be used but in order to enhance conductivity, polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon), single crystalline silicon, and the like may be used. Further, in many cases, the first electrode contains an impurity (a p-type impurity or an n-type impurity) such as phosphorus, boron, gallium, or arsenic to further enhance the conductivity.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The reason of using a semiconductor material containing silicon for the first electrode <b>102</b> is that silicon has high transmittance. In addition, since the first electrode <b>102</b> is thin, it can transmit light. The transmittance is preferably 50% or more, more preferably, 80% or more, so that higher visibility can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Note that an insulating layer or a conductive layer may be provided between the substrate <b>100</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b>. For example, an insulating layer for blocking an impurity intruding from the substrate <b>100</b>, a gate electrode, a gate wiring, a gate insulating film, and the like may be provided.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">An insulating film <b>106</b> is formed over the first electrode <b>102</b>. Note that the insulating film <b>106</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">An inorganic material or an organic material can be used for the insulating film <b>106</b>. As an organic material, polyimide, acrylic, polyamide, polyimide amide, resist, siloxane, polysilazane, or the like can be used. As an inorganic material, an insulating substance containing oxygen or nitrogen, such as silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>), silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>: x&#x3e;y), or silicon nitride oxide (SiN<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>: x&#x3e;y) can be used. Alternatively, a stacked-layer film in which a plurality of these films are stacked may be used. Further alternatively, a stacked-layer film in which an organic material and an inorganic material are combined may be used.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Note that when an inorganic material is used for the insulating film, intrusion of moisture or an impurity can be prevented. In particular, a layer containing nitrogen can block moisture or an impurity efficiently.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that when an organic material is used for the insulating film, a surface thereof can be planarized. Accordingly, the insulating film can have a good effect on a layer provided thereover. For example, the layer formed over the organic material can be planarized, so that disturbance of orientation of the liquid crystal can be prevented, cutting of a wiring can be prevented, and a resist can be formed with accuracy.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A second electrode <b>108</b> is formed overt the insulating film <b>106</b>. The second electrode <b>108</b> may be formed of a material with a high light-transmitting property. For example, one or more elements selected from indium (In), tin (Sn), and oxygen (O); or a compound or an alloy material containing one or more of the aforementioned elements as a component (such as indium tin oxide (TO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), or indium tin oxide doped with silicon oxide (ITSO)) are desirable. In particular, IZO is preferable since it is easy to be patterned and formed into a minute shape with accuracy, although it is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Note that the second electrode <b>108</b> has an opening pattern (slit). The opening pattern is for generating an electric field in a direction generally parallel to the substrate, between the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>. Accordingly, as long as an electric field having a part which is generally parallel to the substrate can be generated, the opening pattern can have various shapes. Here, &#x201c;generally parallel&#x201d; refers to a parallel direction with small deviation. Therefore, the direction may be deviated from the parallel direction as long as the display is not disturbed. The direction may have a deviation of, for example, approximately &#xb1;10&#xb0;, or desirably, approximately &#xb1;5&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The opening pattern includes not only a closed opening pattern such as a slit, but also a space which is located between conductive patterns and in which the conductive pattern is not formed, such as a space between comb-teeth of a comb-shaped electrode. In other words, a gap or an interspace is needed between portions functioning as an electrode.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As described above, the electric field is generated between the second electrode <b>108</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b>, so that an alignment state of liquid crystal molecules can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Note that in a case where electrodes are provided in each pixel, an electrode to which a signal different among pixels depending on an image signal is provided, that is, a pixel electrode can be either the second electrode <b>108</b> or the first electrode <b>102</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to set the second electrode <b>108</b> to be the pixel electrode and the first electrode <b>102</b> to be a common electrode. Alternatively, it is possible to set the second electrode <b>108</b> to be the common electrode and the first electrode <b>102</b> to be the pixel electrode.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Since the pixel electrode is connected to a source or drain of a transistor in many cases, when the first electrode <b>102</b> or the second electrode <b>108</b> functions as the pixel electrode, the structure can be simplified. Further, since the common electrodes in all pixels are connected to one another in many cases, when the first electrode <b>102</b> or the second electrode <b>108</b> functions as the common electrode, the structure can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a plan view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a case where a transistor <b>201</b> is provided. The transistor <b>201</b> is located near the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this case, a film in the transistor <b>201</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b> can be formed at the same time. As a result, the first electrode can be manufactured without increasing the numbers of masks (reticles) and manufacturing steps.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, a semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b> can be formed at the same time. The semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b> can be formed at the same time and etched at the same time, whereby patterning can be carried out at the same time. Further, in the case where the semiconductor layer is formed of polysilicon, the semiconductor layer and the first electrode <b>102</b> are crystallized at the same time.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Accordingly, the semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b> contain the same material.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Note that in a case of adding an impurity (a p-type impurity or an n-type impurity) such as phosphorus, boron, gallium, or arsenic to a part of the semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b>, it is desirable that the impurity is also introduced to the first electrode <b>102</b> at the same time. In a case of adding the impurity at the same time to portions, the concentration thereof is influenced by a thickness and a quality of a material of a film over the portions. When being formed under the similar layer structures, the semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> and the first electrode <b>102</b> have the impurity (a p-type impurity or an n-type impurity) at approximately the same concentration, at least partially. For example, a layer forming a source region or a drain region in the semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> and a semiconductor layer forming the first electrode <b>102</b> have impurity regions at approximately the same concentration.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Note that the semiconductor layer in the transistor <b>201</b> has a channel forming region in many cases. A gate electrode is located over the channel forming region with a gate insulating film therebetween.

Alternatively, a compound (silicide) of silicon and the aforementioned material (such as aluminum silicon, molybdenum silicon, or nickel silicide) or a compound of nitride and the aforementioned material (such as titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, or molybdenum nitride) can be used. Note that silicon (Si) may contain a large amount of n-type impurities (phosphorus or the like) or p-type impurities (boron or the like). When such an impurity is contained, conductivity of silicon is improved and silicon functions similarly to normal conductor, so that it becomes easy to use silicon as a wiring or an electrode. Silicon may be single crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon), or amorphous silicon. When single crystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon is used, resistance can be reduced. When amorphous silicon is used, a manufacturing process can be simplified. Aluminum and silver have high conductivity, so that signal delay can be reduced, and minute processing is possible since they are easy to be etched and patterned. Copper has high conductivity, so that signal delay can be reduced. Molybdenum is desirable because it can be manufactured without a problem such as a defect of a material, even if molybdenum is in contact with an oxide semiconductor such as ITO or IZO, or silicon; and because it is easily patterned and etched, and has high heat resistance. Titanium is desirable because it can be manufactured without a problem such as a defect of a material, even if titanium is in contact with an oxide semiconductor such as ITO or IZO, or silicon; and it is easily patterned and etched, and has high heat resistance. Tungsten is desirable because it has high heat resistance. Neodymium is desirable because it has high heat resistance. In particular, an alloy of neodymium and aluminum is desirable because heat resistance is improved and hillocks of aluminum are hardly generated. Silicon is desirable because it can be manufactured at the same time as the semiconductor layer in the transistor and has high heat resistance. Indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium tin oxide doped with silicon oxide (ITSO), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silicon (Si) are desirable because they have a light-transmitting property and can be used for a portion which is required to transmit light, such as the pixel electrode and the common electrode.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Note that a wiring or an electrode may have a single layer or a multilayer structure of these materials. If a single-layer structure is employed, the manufacturing process can be simplified and the number of steps can be reduced; which leads to reduction in cost. If a multilayer structure is employed, advantage of a material can be derived and disadvantage of the material can be reduced, so that a wiring and an electrode with favorable characteristics can be formed. For example, when a material with low resistance (such as aluminum) is included in the multilayer structure, the resistance of the wiring can be reduced. In addition, if a material with high heat resistance is used, for example, to be interposed between a material with low heat resistance and another advantage in a stacked-layer structure, the heat resistance of wiring or electrode as a whole can be improved. For example, a stacked-layer structure in which a layer containing aluminum is interposed between layers containing molybdenum or titanium is desirable. In addition, there is a case in which a material is directly in contact with another wiring or another electrode of another material, so that the materials are adversely affected. For example, a material may enter another material and change its characteristics; therefore, the material cannot serve its original purpose or a problem occurs in manufacturing and the material cannot be manufactured normally. In such a case, a problem can be solved when the layer is interposed between or covered with another layer. For example, if indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum are required to be in contact with each other, it is desirable that titanium or molybdenum is interposed therebetween. Also, if silicon and aluminum are required to be in contact with each other, it is desirable that titanium or molybdenum is interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Note that it is desirable that the material of the gate wiring <b>104</b><i>c </i>and the auxiliary wiring <b>104</b><i>b </i>have heat resistance higher than that of the source wiring <b>107</b><i>a</i>.

Alternatively, a compound (silicide) of silicon and the aforementioned material (such as aluminum silicon, molybdenum silicon, or nickel silicide) or a compound of nitride and the aforementioned material (such as titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, or molybdenum nitride) can be used. Note that silicon (Si) may contain a large amount of n-type impurities (phosphorus or the like) or p-type impurities (boron or the like).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Note that the wiring or the electrode may have a single layer or a multilayer structure of these materials. If a single-layer structure is employed, the manufacturing process can be simplified and the number of steps can be reduced; which leads to reduction in cost. If a multilayer structure is employed, advantage of a material can be derived and disadvantage of the material can be reduced, so that a wiring and an electrode with favorable characteristics can be formed. For example, when a material with low resistance (such as aluminum) is included in the multilayer structure, the resistance of the wiring can be reduced. In addition, if a material with high heat resistance is used, for example, to be interposed between a material with low heat resistance and another advantage in a stacked-layer structure, the heat resistance of the whole wiring or electrode can be improved. For example, a stacked-layer structure in which a layer containing aluminum is interposed between layers containing molybdenum or titanium is desirable. In addition, there is a case in which a material is directly in contact with another wiring or another electrode of another material, so that the materials are adversely affected. For example, a material may enter another material and change its characteristics; therefore, the material cannot serve its original purpose or a problem occurs in manufacturing of the material and the material cannot be manufactured normally. In such a case, a problem can be solved when the layer is interposed between or covered with another layer. For example, if indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum are in contact with each other, it is desirable that titanium or molybdenum is interposed therebetween. Also, if silicon and aluminum are in contact with each other, it is desirable that titanium or molybdenum is interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Next, an impurity is injected into the semiconductor film <b>102</b><i>f </i>with use of the gate electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a resist pattern (not shown) as a mask.

Accordingly, the injected amount of the impurity is decreased, so that the LDD region can be easily formed.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Note that the resist pattern may be used as a mask in this step.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In addition, in a step of forming the impurity region, an impurity element may be injected into the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c</i>. In such a manner, the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c </i>can be formed at the same time as the impurity regions <b>102</b><i>b </i>and <b>102</b><i>d</i>.

In that case, the impurity element is injected with use of the resist pattern as a mask. At this time, the impurity element may be injected into the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c</i>. Also in this case, the step of forming the impurity region in the transistor and the step of injecting the impurity element into the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c </i>can be the same step.

The film is selectively etched with use of a resist pattern. Thus, the second electrode <b>108</b> is formed.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Note that the contact hole in which a part of the drain wiring <b>107</b><i>b </i>is embedded and the contact hole in which a part of the second electrode <b>108</b> is embedded are different from each other in location. Thus, even if the drain wiring <b>107</b><i>b </i>and the second electrode <b>108</b> have depressions in portions located over the contact holes, the depressions are not overlapped with each other. Therefore, a deep depressed portion is not formed in the second electrode <b>108</b>, so that generation of a defect in shape of the aforementioned resist pattern can be suppressed.

The gate insulating film <b>103</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b>, the gate electrode <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the auxiliary wiring <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and the gate wiring <b>104</b><i>c</i>.

Note that as the conductive film, a film formed of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), tantalum (Ta), neodymium (Nd), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), or the like; a film formed of an alloy thereof; or a stacked-layer film thereof can be used. Alternatively, silicon (Si) in which an n-type impurity is introduced may be used. Next, the gate insulating film <b>103</b> is formed.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">Next, a polysilicon film is formed over the gate insulating film <b>103</b>, and a resist pattern is formed over the polysilicon film. Next, the polysilicon film is etched with use of the resist pattern as a mask. In this manner, the semiconductor film <b>102</b><i>f </i>and the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c </i>are formed in the same step. Thereafter, the resist pattern is removed.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Next, a mask pattern is formed over the semiconductor film <b>102</b><i>f</i>, and an impurity is injected into the semiconductor film <b>102</b><i>f </i>with use of the mask pattern as a mask. Therefore, the impurity regions <b>102</b><i>b </i>and <b>102</b><i>d </i>and an impurity region between the gate electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>are formed. Note that by this treatment, the impurity is also injected into the first electrode <b>102</b><i>c</i>. In a case where the substrate <b>100</b> is formed using a light-transmitting material such as glass, a mask may be formed by light exposure from a rear face of the substrate <b>100</b> with use of the gate wiring as a light exposure pattern, without using a light exposure mask. In this case, the number of steps can be reduced since a light exposure mask is not used, so that manufacturing cost can be reduced. Further, there is an advantage in that a mask pattern can be formed in a self-aligned manner, so that deviation of a mask pattern is reduced and the deviation is not required to be considered. Subsequent steps are similar to those in Embodiment Mode 1.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">According to this embodiment mode, an effect similar to Embodiment Mode 1 can be obtained.

Therefore, manufacturing cost can be lowered as compared with a conventional device.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>, a base film <b>802</b> is formed over a substrate <b>801</b>. The substrate <b>801</b> is a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a substrate formed of an insulator such as alumina, a plastic substrate with enough heat resistance to withstand a processing temperature of subsequent steps, a silicon substrate, or a metal plate. Further, the substrate <b>801</b> may be a substrate in which an insulating film of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or the like is formed over a surface of a metal substrate such as a stainless steel substrate or a surface of a semiconductor substrate. Note that when a plastic substrate is used for the substrate <b>801</b>, plastic with a comparatively high glass transition point, such as PC (polycarbonate), PES (polyethersulfone), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) is preferably used.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0363">The base film <b>802</b> has a stacked-layer structure where a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>) film is formed over a silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>) film, for example; other insulators (such as silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0) or silicon nitride oxide (SiN<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0)) may also be used. Alternatively, the base film <b>802</b> may be formed by high-density plasma treatment on a surface of the substrate <b>801</b>. High-density plasma is generated by using a microwave at, for example, 2.45 GHz, and has electron density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, electron temperature of 2 eV or less, and ion energy of 5 eV or less. Such high-density plasma has low kinetic energy of active species, and a film with less plasma damage and fewer defects compared with conventional plasma treatment can be formed. The distance between the substrate <b>801</b> and an antenna for generating the microwave is set to 20 to 80 mm, preferably 20 to 60 mm.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0364">The surface of the substrate <b>801</b> can be nitrided by performing the aforementioned high-density plasma treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere, for example, in an atmosphere including nitrogen and a rare gas, an atmosphere including nitrogen, hydrogen, and a rare gas, or an atmosphere including ammonia and a rare gas. When a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a silicon wafer, or the like is used as the substrate <b>801</b> and nitriding treatment is performed by the aforementioned high-density plasma, a nitride film formed on the surface of the substrate <b>801</b> contains silicon nitride as its main component, so that the nitride film can be used as the base film <b>802</b>. A silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film may be formed over the nitride film by a plasma CVD method so that the base film <b>802</b> includes a plurality of layers.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0365">In addition, a nitride film can be formed on a surface of the base film <b>802</b> including a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or the like by similarly performing nitriding treatment with high-density plasma on the surface of the base film <b>802</b>. The nitride film can suppress diffusion of impurities from the substrate <b>801</b> and can be formed to be very thin; therefore, influence of stress upon a semiconductor layer to be formed thereover can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>, a crystalline semiconductor film (such as a polysilicon film) is formed over the base film <b>802</b>. As a forming method of the crystalline semiconductor film, a method in which the crystalline semiconductor film is formed directly on the base film <b>802</b>, and a method in which an amorphous semiconductor film is formed over the base film <b>802</b> and subsequently crystallized can be taken as an example.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">As a method of crystallizing the amorphous semiconductor film, the following can be used: a crystallization method by laser light irradiation; a crystallization method by heating using an element (for example, a metal element such as nickel) which promotes crystallization of the semiconductor film; or a crystallization method by heating using an element which promotes crystallization of the semiconductor film and subsequently irradiating the semiconductor film with laser light. Needless to say, a method of thermally crystallizing the amorphous semiconductor film without using the aforementioned element can be used as well. However, in this case, the substrate is required to be a quartz substrate, a silicon wafer, or the like which can withstand the high temperature.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">When laser irradiation is used, a continuous wave laser beam (CW laser beam) or a pulsed laser beam (pulse laser beam) can be used. Here, a laser beam emitted from one or plural kinds of a gas laser such as an Ar laser, a Kr laser, or an excimer laser; a laser using, as a medium, single crystalline YAQ YVO<sub>4</sub>, forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4</sub>, or polycrystalline (ceramic) YAG, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, YVO<sub>4</sub>, YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4 </sub>doped with one or more of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Er, Tm, and Ta as a dopant; a glass laser; a ruby laser; an alexandrite laser; a Ti:sapphire laser; a copper vapor laser; and a gold vapor laser can be used. By irradiation with a laser beam having a fundamental wave of such laser beams or one of the second to fourth harmonics of the fundamental wave, a crystal with a large grain size can be obtained. For example, the second harmonic (532 nm) or the third harmonic (355 nm) of an Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser (fundamental wave of 1064 nm) can be used. In this case, the energy density of approximately 0.01 to 100 MW/cm<sup>2 </sup>(preferably, 0.1 to 10 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>) is required for the laser. The scanning rate is set at approximately 10 to 2000 cm/sec to irradiate the semiconductor film.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0369">Note that a laser using, as a medium, single crystalline YAG, YVO<sub>4</sub>, forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4</sub>, or polycrystalline (ceramic) YAG, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, YVO<sub>4</sub>, YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4 </sub>doped with one or more of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Er, Tm, and Ta as a dopant; an Ar ion laser; and a Ti:sapphire laser are capable of continuous oscillation. Further, pulse oscillation thereof can be performed at a repetition rate of 10 MHz or more by carrying out Q switch operation or mode locking. When a laser beam is emitted at a repetition rate of 10 MHz or more, a semiconductor film is irradiated with a next pulse after being melted by the laser beam and before being solidified. Therefore, unlike a case of using a pulsed laser with a low repetition rate, a solid-liquid interface can be continuously moved in the semiconductor film; therefore, crystal grains which continuously grow in a scanning direction can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0370">When ceramic (polycrystal) is used as a medium, the medium can be formed to have a desired shape for a short time and at low cost. When a single crystalline is used, a columnar medium with several mm in diameter and several tens of mm in length is used. When the ceramic is used, a medium larger than the case of using the single crystalline can be formed.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">A concentration of a dopant such as Nd or Yb in a medium, which directly contributes to light emission, cannot be changed largely in either case of the single crystalline or the polycrystal; therefore, there is some limitation on improvement in output of a laser by increasing the concentration of the dopant. However, in the case of ceramic, the size of a medium can be significantly increased as compared with the case of the single crystalline; therefore, drastic improvement in output of a laser can be expected.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">Further, in the case of ceramic, a medium with a parallelepiped shape or a rectangular parallelepiped shape can be easily formed. When a medium having such a shape is used and oscillated light is made travel in a zigzag manner inside the medium, a path of the oscillated light can be made long. Therefore, amplification is increased and a laser beam can be oscillated at high output. Furthermore, since a cross section of a laser beam emitted from the medium having such a shape has a quadrangular shape, it has an advantage over a circular beam in being shaped into a linear beam. By shaping a laser beam emitted in the aforementioned manner by using an optical system, a linear beam having a length of 1 mm or less on a lateral side and a length of several mm to several m on a longitudinal side can be easily obtained. In addition, when a medium is uniformly irradiated with excited light, energy distribution of a linear beam becomes uniform in a longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0373">A semiconductor film is irradiated with this linear beam, so that the whole surface of the semiconductor film can be annealed more uniformly. When uniform annealing is required from one end to the other end of the linear beam, ingenuity such as arrangement in which slits are provided in ends of the linear beam to shield light at a portion where energy is attenuated is required.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0374">When a semiconductor film is annealed using the thus obtained linear beam having uniform intensity and an electronic appliance is manufactured by using this semiconductor film, characteristics of the electronic appliance are good and uniform.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0375">As the method for crystallizing the amorphous semiconductor film by heating with an element which promotes crystallization of the semiconductor film, a technique described in Japanese Published Patent Application No. H8-78329 can be used. In the technique in the patent application publication, an amorphous semiconductor film (also referred to as an amorphous silicon film) is doped with a metal element which promotes crystallization of the semiconductor film, and then heat treatment is performed so that the amorphous semiconductor film is crystallized with the doped region as a nucleus.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0376">Alternatively, an amorphous semiconductor film can be crystallized by performing irradiation with strong light instead of heat treatment. In this case, one of or a combination of infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light can be used. Typically, light emitted from a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp is used. A lamp light source is lighted for 1 to 60 seconds, preferably 30 to 60 seconds, and such lighting is repeated 1 to 10 times, preferably 2 to 6 times. The light emission intensity of the lamp light source is arbitrary, but the semiconductor film is required to be instantaneously heated up to approximately 600 to 1000&#xb0; C. Note that if necessary, heat treatment may be performed in order to discharge hydrogen contained in the amorphous semiconductor film having an amorphous structure before the irradiation with the strong light. Alternatively, crystallization may be performed by both heat treatment and irradiation with strong light.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0377">After the heat treatment, in order to increase the degree of crystallinity of the crystalline semiconductor film (rate of area occupied by crystalline components against the whole volume of the film) and to correct defects which remain in crystalline grains, the crystalline semiconductor film may be irradiated with the laser light in the atmospheric air or an oxygen atmosphere. The laser light may be selected from the aforementioned laser light.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0378">The doped elements are required to be removed from the crystalline semiconductor film, and the method is described below. First, a surface of the crystalline semiconductor film is treated with a solution containing ozone (typically, ozone water), so that a barrier layer formed of an oxide film (called chemical oxide) is formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film to have a thickness of 1 to 10 nm. The barrier layer functions as an etching stopper when only a gettering layer is selectively removed in a subsequent step.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0379">Then, a gettering layer containing a rare gas element is formed as a gettering site over the barrier layer. Here, a semiconductor film containing a rare gas element is formed as the gettering layer by a CVD method or a sputtering method. When the gettering layer is formed, the sputtering conditions are controlled as appropriate so that a rare gas element is added to the gettering layer. The rare gas element may be one or more of helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), or xenon (Xe).</p><p id="p-0381" num="0380">Note that when the gettering layer is formed by using a source gas containing phosphorus which is an impurity element or by using a target containing phosphorus, gettering can be performed by utilizing the coulomb force of phosphorus in addition to the gettering using the rare gas element. In gettering, a metal element (such as nickel) tends to move to a region having a high concentration of oxygen; therefore, the concentration of oxygen contained in the gettering layer is preferably set at, for example, 5&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>/cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or higher.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0381">Next, the crystalline semiconductor film, the barrier layer, and the gettering layer are subjected to thermal treatment (such as heat treatment or irradiation with strong light), and thereby the metal element (such as nickel) is gettered, so that the metal element in the crystalline semiconductor film is lowered in concentration or removed.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0382">Next, a known etching method is performed using the barrier layer as an etching stopper so that only the gettering layer is selectively removed. After that, the barrier layer formed of an oxide film is removed, for example, using an etchant containing hydrofluoric acid.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0383">Here, impurity ions may be added in consideration of threshold characteristics of a TFT to be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0384">Next, a photo resist film (not shown) is applied over the crystalline semiconductor film, and is exposed to light and developed. Therefore, a resist pattern is formed over the crystalline semiconductor film. Next, the crystalline semiconductor film is etched using the resist pattern as a mask. Therefore, a crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b> to be included in a thin film transistor and a crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b><i>a </i>to be a common electrode are formed over the base film <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0385">Next, after surfaces of the crystalline semiconductor films <b>803</b> and <b>803</b><i>a </i>are cleaned with an etchant containing hydrofluoric acid, a gate insulating film <b>804</b> is formed to have a thickness of 10 to 200 nm over the crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b>. The gate insulating film <b>804</b> is formed of an insulating film containing silicon as a main component, such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film. Further, the gate insulating film may have a single layer or a stacked-layer film. Note that the gate insulating film <b>804</b> is also formed over the crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b><i>a </i>and the base film <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>C</figref>, after the gate insulating film <b>804</b> is cleaned, a first conductive film and a second conductive film are formed in this order over the gate insulating film <b>804</b>. For example, the first conductive film is a tungsten film and the second conductive film is a tantalum nitride film.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">Next, a photo resist film (not shown) is applied over the second conductive film, and is exposed to light and developed. Therefore, a resist pattern is formed over the second conductive film. Next, by using the resist pattern as a mask, the first conductive film and the second conductive film are etched under a first condition, and further, the second conductive film is etched under a second condition. Thus, first gate electrodes <b>805</b><i>a </i>and <b>805</b><i>b </i>and second gate electrodes <b>806</b><i>a </i>and <b>806</b><i>b </i>are formed over the crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b>.

The second gate electrode <b>806</b><i>a </i>is provided over the first gate electrode <b>805</b><i>a</i>, and the second gate electrode <b>806</b><i>b </i>is provided over the first gate electrode <b>806</b><i>b</i>. Inclined angles of side surfaces of each of the first gate electrodes <b>805</b><i>a </i>and <b>805</b><i>b </i>are more moderate than inclined angles of side surfaces of each of the second gate electrodes <b>806</b><i>a </i>and <b>806</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0389" num="0388">By the etching treatment, a first wiring <b>807</b> and a second wiring <b>808</b> provided over the first wiring <b>807</b> are formed near the crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b><i>a</i>. Here, each of the aforementioned gate electrodes and wirings is preferably led so as to have a round corner when seen from a direction perpendicular to the substrate <b>801</b>. By making the corners round, dust or the like can be prevented from remaining at the corners of the wiring; therefore, the number of defects generated due to dust can be reduced and yield can be improved. Thereafter, the photo resist film is removed.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0389">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>D</figref>, a first conductivity type (for example, n-type) impurity element (for example, phosphorus) is injected into the crystalline semiconductor film <b>803</b> by using the first gate electrodes <b>805</b><i>a </i>and <b>805</b><i>b </i>and the second gate electrodes <b>806</b><i>a </i>and <b>806</b><i>b </i>as masks.
