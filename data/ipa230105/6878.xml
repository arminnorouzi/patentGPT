For the purposes of this disclosure, a northbound APIs will mean those APIs that are logically positioned between the orchestrator and a SDN controller and southbound APIs will mean those APIs that are logically positioned between the SND controller and virtual network elements. Based on manual input or automatic configurations based on business rules, orchestrators typically command the SDN controller, to implement network configurations on network elements such as routers and switches. The APIs used to do so are often encrypted using transport layer security (&#x201c;TLS&#x201d;) making the contents unreadable to entities other than the intended recipients. This creates a challenge to monitor the content of the APIs while in use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are several scenarios in which the lack of insight into the content of the APIs may present a risk to the integrity of the network. For example, the SDN controller may be compromised by hackers. This may manifest itself by having the SDN controller manipulate the southbound APIs by deliberately misinterpreting the commands from the orchestrator coming through the northbound API. For example, the orchestrator may want to block certain ports or protocols on the network element such as a router for security reason, but the compromised SDN controller may maliciously not block those vulnerable ports or protocols.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A hacked SDN controller may also manipulate the northbound API by deliberately misinterpreting the commands from the network element coming through the southbound API. For example, the network element such as a router wants to report that a certain port is open, or protocol is allowed/disallowed, the compromised SDN controller may alter this information, before it is passed to the orchestrator and the orchestrator may then will forward this misinformation to other network elements which may cause security breaches or network failures or other undesired scenarios.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another unwanted scenario, a network element could be hacked to ignore the information coming from the SDN controller through the southbound API and run its own malicious code. If the orchestrator is compromised, it may ignore the business policies or needs and, using its malicious code, could send commands to the SDN controller through the northbound API creating unwanted or dangerous network configurations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need to create a system and method which will provide an additional security check in a SDN to ensure that the business policies are being implemented correctly and to uncover potential failures in the API's.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a method including receiving a request to instantiate a network element, instantiating the network element in accordance with the request, configuring a mutable network element to simulate at least one other network element based on the receiving step, and receiving a confirmation that the network element is configured in accordance with the request.

The present disclosure includes a new and novel mutable network element (MNE), a separate dedicated network element that reads the business request and becomes a node with appropriate identifiers to communicate with the recently configured or modified network element to verify the business input is properly implemented prior to the network element going online. The system and method disclosed herein are a practical application of telecommunications technology and advance the state of the art in that telecommunications technology.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The MNE may be a generic network element that can function, for example, as a server or router with a configurable structure. An MNE may connect to all network elements to verify the business request has been correctly implemented. Once verified, the MNE will then allow the traffic flow from orchestrator back to the higher layer and permit the implementation of the desired configuration for the newly configured or modified network element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The MNE may assume the identify of any network element. For example, the business input may request that the orchestrator configure a new network element NE X1 to allow connectivity to server having an external IP address 135.122.10.14 on a specified port using a specified protocol coming from the Internet and that the port should be set to 10 Gbps. The orchestrator will communicate this to the SDN controller via the northbound API which in turn will communicated this to the network element NE XI through the southbound API. Network element NE X1 will then implement the configuration. Before going live, the MNE will assume the personality of the server with IP address: 135.122.10.14 and will attempt to communicate with this newly configured network element NE X1 using the specified protocols with the specified port and with the specified bandwidth of 10 Gbps from the Internet to make sure the exact configuration that was requested has in fact been implemented.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an aspect, the MNE may also host a database for security policies, for example, policies that prohibit certain configurations for a network element. The MNE may also attempt to communicate with the newly configured network element NE X1 via prohibited protocols, ports, and/or speeds and using nonwhite-listed IP addresses. These communication attempts should fail to ensure that nothing prohibited has been implemented. Thus, the MNE may perform a two-stage verification to ensure the configuration as requested is implemented and alternative configurations not requested are not implemented.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">After the verification process is complete, the orchestrator may then report back to higher layers that newly requested configuration has been implemented and the newly configured network element is now active.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The MNE may be activated every time the orchestrator receives a request. If the MNE reports a discrepancy or detects a disallowed configuration, the system may generate an alert and may further isolate the system until it is checked and cleared for operation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Operating Environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a representation of an exemplary network <b>100</b>.

An orchestrator is generally known in the art and may include the process of automatically programming the behavior of a network in accordance with a set of rules, policies and business requirements, so that the network smoothly coordinates with the hardware and the software elements to further support applications and services, in this case in a software-defined network. The orchestrator <b>22</b> may operate based on input business requests or policies, represented by input arrow <b>20</b>, associated with the business operations, network operations, security, quality of service, or any of a plurality of needs of the business.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">There is also shown an SDN controller <b>26</b> and networking elements <b>30</b>. The SDN controller <b>26</b> may direct traffic according to policies that a network operator puts in place to automatically configure individual network devices. In a software defined network, the SDN controller <b>26</b> may facilitate automated network management and enable the integration and administration of network and business applications.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">There may be one or more APIs. For example, there may be one or more a northbound APIs <b>24</b> between the orchestrator <b>22</b> and the SDN controller <b>26</b> and one or more southbound APIs between the SDN controller <b>26</b> and networking elements <b>30</b>. The SDN controller communicates with applications&#x2014;such as firewalls or load balancers&#x2014;through the orchestrator via northbound interfaces. The SDN controller talks with individual network elements <b>30</b> using a southbound interface which may, for example, use the OpenFlow protocol. These southbound protocols allow the controller to configure network elements <b>30</b> and choose the optimal network path for application traffic.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The network elements <b>30</b> may include VM functions which may, for example, include the establishment of virtual machines implementing a variety of processing, memory or connectivity applications, including software implementation of a variety of network elements, such as gateways, RAN interface support, routers, switches, and other network elements, some of which are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also shown is a new and novel element we named the mutable network element (MNE) <b>32</b>. The MNE <b>32</b> may be a generic network element that can function as a server or router with a configurable structure. The MNE <b>32</b> may be a separate dedicated virtual network element that reads the business request <b>20</b> and in response thereto, becomes a temporary node in the network with appropriate identifiers. The MNE <b>32</b> may then communicate with the recently instantiated or modified networking element <b>30</b> to verify that business request <b>20</b> has been properly implemented.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The MNE <b>32</b> may connect to any or all network elements <b>30</b> or assume the identify of one or more network elements <b>30</b> to verify the configuration. Once the configuration is verified, the MNE <b>32</b> will inform the orchestrator <b>22</b> which may then report back to the higher layer(s) for implementation of the requested configuration. The MNE <b>32</b> may assume the identity of any network element <b>30</b>.

There is shown an upstream interface <b>25</b> for communicating with the orchestrator <b>22</b> and to access the business rules <b>20</b>. There is also shown a network element interface <b>27</b> which permits interaction with the networking elements <b>30</b>. There is also shown a policy database <b>29</b> that may host a database for security policies. Such security policies may, for example, included permitted and prohibited configurations with each type and instance of a network element. The policies may also include permitted and prohibited protocols, ports, and speeds associated with the network elements. There may also be white-listed and nonwhite-listed IP addresses. Such policies may be pre-defined by an administrator on a per network element basis.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also shown is a mini orchestrator <b>23</b>. The mini orchestrator may configure the MNE <b>32</b> or other MNEs as off-line instantiations of the surrounding network elements. For example, a newly configured router may be instructed to communicate with two servers that may already exist in the network. The mini orchestrator may configure and instantiate copies of the two servers and then verify the communications between the newly configured router and the two servers is proper and consistent with the policies. The mini orchestrator may also configure and instantiate a third server which is not part of the network and then verify that the newly configured router is prohibited from communicating with the third server.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Operations. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is shown an exemplary flow chart describing a method in accordance with the present disclosure. At <b>34</b>, the orchestrator <b>22</b> receives a request from the business through the business request input <b>20</b>. The request may, for example, be for the instantiation of a newly configured SDN network element such as a router, gateway or other network element. At <b>35</b>, a mutable network element <b>32</b> is activated and a network element <b>30</b> is configured in accordance with the business request. At <b>36</b>, the mutable network element <b>32</b> is configured to operate as if it is any network element currently operational in order to test the network element <b>30</b> instantiated by the orchestrator <b>22</b> based on the business request.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">However, the newly configured network element <b>30</b> may remain isolated from the operational network until the network element <b>30</b> configuration is verified. At <b>37</b>, the first step of that verification is completed in determining whether the network element <b>30</b> is operating correctly in view of the mutable network element <b>32</b> mimicking other relevant portions of the network to test the network element. This may include the testing of the network element <b>30</b> to ensure that the ports, speeds, and interconnections have been set up correctly. If the network element <b>30</b> is not operating correctly, then an alert to the system or system operator is generated at <b>39</b>. If the network element <b>30</b> is operating correctly at <b>37</b>, a second verification step may be performed at <b>38</b> to determine whether the security policies are implemented correctly. The security policies may test for negative situations, for example, the case in which a port is closed for security reasons may in fact be open, thereby increasing the risk of a security breach. If the security policies are not implemented correctly, then the alert to the system or system operator is generated at <b>39</b>. If the security policies are implemented correctly, the newly configured network element <b>30</b> is permitted to go on-line and operational in the network and the successful instantiation is sent back to the orchestrator <b>22</b> for further reporting up the business chain.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The verification steps at <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> are described above and including an example in the section labeled &#x201c;System Overview&#x201d;. The alerts generated at <b>39</b> may include a warning that the orchestrator is not functioning properly or that the northbound APIs or southbound APIs are corrupted.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The system and methods of the present disclosure provide a practical application that advances the state of the telecommunications technology. The system and method provide a soft quarantine of newly configured network elements <b>30</b> to reduce the risk that the network is exposed to potential security breaches. In view of the nature of the mutable network elements, it is possible to scale the configuration of software defined networks based on the business requests quickly and efficiently while at the same time reducing the risk of a security breach and thereby increase speed and reliability. The system and method permit orchestration validation within the network stream and at the same time temporarily extracting orchestration validation to the MNEs.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Device and Network Description. The characteristics of each chassis <b>110</b> and each server <b>112</b> may differ. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates that the number of servers <b>112</b> within two chasses <b>110</b> may vary. Additionally, or alternatively, the type or number of resources <b>110</b> within each server <b>112</b> may vary. In an aspect, chassis <b>110</b> may be used to group servers <b>112</b> with the same resource characteristics. In another aspect, servers <b>112</b> within the same chassis <b>110</b> may have different resource characteristics.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Given hardware platform <b>106</b>, the number of sessions that may be instantiated may vary depending upon how efficiently resources <b>108</b> are assigned to different VMs <b>104</b>. For example, assignment of VMs <b>104</b> to particular resources <b>108</b> may be constrained by one or more rules. For example, a first rule may require that resources <b>108</b> assigned to a particular VM <b>104</b> be on the same server <b>112</b> or set of servers <b>112</b>. For example, if VM <b>104</b> uses eight vCPUs <b>108</b><i>a, </i>1 GB of memory <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and 2 NICs <b>108</b><i>c</i>, the rules may require that all these resources <b>108</b> be sourced from the same server <b>112</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, VM <b>104</b> may require splitting resources <b>108</b> among multiple servers <b>112</b>, but such splitting may need to conform with certain restrictions. For example, resources <b>108</b> for VM <b>104</b> may be able to be split between two servers <b>112</b>. Default rules may apply. For example, a default rule may require that all resources <b>108</b> for a given VM <b>104</b> must come from the same server <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An affinity rule may restrict assignment of resources <b>108</b> for a particular VM <b>104</b> (or a particular type of VM <b>104</b>). For example, an affinity rule may require that certain VMs <b>104</b> be instantiated on (that is, consume resources from) the same server <b>112</b> or chassis <b>110</b>. For example, if VNF <b>102</b> uses six MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a</i>, an affinity rule may dictate that those six MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a </i>be instantiated on the same server <b>112</b> (or chassis <b>110</b>). As another example, if VNF <b>102</b> uses MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a</i>, ASM VMs <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and a third type of VMs <b>104</b>, an affinity rule may dictate that at least the MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the ASM VMs <b>104</b><i>b </i>be instantiated on the same server <b>112</b> (or chassis <b>110</b>). Affinity rules may restrict assignment of resources <b>108</b> based on the identity or type of resource <b>108</b>, VNF <b>102</b>, VM <b>104</b>, chassis <b>110</b>, server <b>112</b>, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An anti-affinity rule may restrict assignment of resources <b>108</b> for a particular VM <b>104</b> (or a particular type of VM <b>104</b>). In contrast to an affinity rule&#x2014;which may require that certain VMs <b>104</b> be instantiated on the same server <b>112</b> or chassis <b>110</b>&#x2014;an anti-affinity rule requires that certain VMs <b>104</b> be instantiated on different servers <b>112</b> (or different chasses <b>110</b>). For example, an anti-affinity rule may require that MCM VM <b>104</b><i>a </i>be instantiated on a particular server <b>112</b> that does not contain any ASM VMs <b>104</b><i>b</i>. As another example, an anti-affinity rule may require that MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a </i>for a first VNF <b>102</b> be instantiated on a different server <b>112</b> (or chassis <b>110</b>) than MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a </i>for a second VNF <b>102</b>. Anti-affinity rules may restrict assignment of resources <b>108</b> based on the identity or type of resource <b>108</b>, VNF <b>102</b>, VM <b>104</b>, chassis <b>110</b>, server <b>112</b>, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Within these constraints, resources <b>108</b> of hardware platform <b>106</b> may be assigned to be used to instantiate VMs <b>104</b>, which in turn may be used to instantiate VNFs <b>102</b>, which in turn may be used to establish sessions. The different combinations for how such resources <b>108</b> may be assigned may vary in complexity and efficiency. For example, different assignments may have different limits of the number of sessions that can be established given a particular hardware platform <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, consider a session that may require gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>and PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b</i>. Gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>may require five VMs <b>104</b> instantiated on the same server <b>112</b>, and PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b </i>may require two VMs <b>104</b> instantiated on the same server <b>112</b>. (Assume, for this example, that no affinity or anti-affinity rules restrict whether VMs <b>104</b> for PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b </i>may or must be instantiated on the same or different server <b>112</b> than VMs <b>104</b> for gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a</i>.) In this example, each of two servers <b>112</b> may have sufficient resources <b>108</b> to support 10 VMs <b>104</b>. To implement sessions using these two servers <b>112</b>, first server <b>112</b> may be instantiated with 10 VMs <b>104</b> to support two instantiations of gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and second server <b>112</b> may be instantiated with 9 VMs: five VMs <b>104</b> to support one instantiation of gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>and four VMs <b>104</b> to support two instantiations of PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b</i>. This may leave the remaining resources <b>108</b> that could have supported the tenth VM <b>104</b> on second server <b>112</b> unused (and unusable for an instantiation of either a gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>or a PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b</i>). Alternatively, first server <b>112</b> may be instantiated with 10 VMs <b>104</b> for two instantiations of gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>and second server <b>112</b> may be instantiated with 10 VMs <b>104</b> for five instantiations of PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b</i>, using all available resources <b>108</b> to maximize the number of VMs <b>104</b> instantiated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Consider, further, how many sessions each gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>and each PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b </i>may support. This may factor into which assignment of resources <b>108</b> is more efficient. For example, consider if each gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>supports two million sessions, and if each PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b </i>supports three million sessions. For the first configuration&#x2014;three total gateway VNFs <b>102</b><i>a </i>(which satisfy the gateway requirement for six million sessions) and two total PCRF VNFs <b>102</b><i>b </i>(which satisfy the PCRF requirement for six million sessions)&#x2014;would support a total of six million sessions. For the second configuration&#x2014;two total gateway VNFs <b>102</b><i>a </i>(which satisfy the gateway requirement for four million sessions) and five total PCRF VNFs <b>102</b><i>b </i>(which satisfy the PCRF requirement for 15 million sessions)&#x2014;would support a total of four million sessions. Thus, while the first configuration may seem less efficient looking only at the number of available resources <b>108</b> used (as resources <b>108</b> for the tenth possible VM <b>104</b> are unused), the second configuration is more efficient from the perspective of being the configuration that can support more the greater number of sessions.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">To solve the problem of determining a capacity (or, number of sessions) that can be supported by a given hardware platform <b>105</b>, a given requirement for VNFs <b>102</b> to support a session, a capacity for the number of sessions each VNF <b>102</b> (e.g., of a certain type) can support, a given requirement for VMs <b>104</b> for each VNF <b>102</b> (e.g., of a certain type), a give requirement for resources <b>108</b> to support each VM <b>104</b> (e.g., of a certain type), rules dictating the assignment of resources <b>108</b> to one or more VMs <b>104</b> (e.g., affinity and anti-affinity rules), the chasses <b>110</b> and servers <b>112</b> of hardware platform <b>106</b>, and the individual resources <b>108</b> of each chassis <b>110</b> or server <b>112</b> (e.g., of a certain type), an integer programming problem may be formulated.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">First, a plurality of index sets may be established. For example, index set L may include the set of chasses <b>110</b>. For example, if a system allows up to 6 chasses <b>110</b>, this set may be:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">L={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, where l is an element of L.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another index set J may include the set of servers <b>112</b>. For example, if a system allows up to 16 servers <b>112</b> per chassis <b>110</b>, this set may be:</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">J={1, 2, 3, . . . , 16}, where j is an element of J.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As another example, index set K having at least one element k may include the set of VNFs <b>102</b> that may be considered. For example, this index set may include all types of VNFs <b>102</b> that may be used to instantiate a service. For example, let K={GW, PCRF} where GW represents gateway VNFs <b>102</b><i>a </i>and PCRF represents PCRF VNFs <b>102</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another index set I(k) may equal the set of VMs <b>104</b> for a VNF <b>102</b> k. Thus, let I(GW)={MCM, ASM, TOM, WSM, CCM, DCM} represent VMs <b>104</b> for gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a</i>, where MCM represents MCM VM <b>104</b><i>a</i>, ASM represents ASM VM <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and each of IOM, WSM, CCM, and DCM represents a respective type of VM <b>104</b>. Further, let</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">I(PCRF)={DEP, DIR, POL, SES, MAN} represent VMs <b>104</b> for PCRF VNF <b>102</b><i>b</i>, where DEP represents DEP VM <b>104</b><i>c </i>and each of DIR, POL, SES, and MAN represent a respective type of VM <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Another index set V may include the set of possible instances of a given VM <b>104</b>. For example, if a system allows up to 20 instances of VMs <b>102</b>, this set may be: V={1, 2, 3, . . . , 20}, where v is an element of V.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition to the sets, the integer programming problem may include additional data. The characteristics of VNFs <b>102</b>, VMs <b>104</b>, chasses <b>110</b>, or servers <b>112</b> may be factored into the problem. This data may be referred to as parameters. For example, for given VNF <b>102</b> k, the number of sessions that VNF <b>102</b> k can support may be defined as a function S(k). In an aspect, for an element k of set K, this parameter may be represented by S(k)&#x3e;=0; is a measurement of the number of sessions k can support. Returning to the earlier example where gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>may support 2 million sessions, then this parameter may be S(GW)=2,000,000.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">VM <b>104</b> modularity may be another parameter in the integer programming problem. VM <b>104</b> modularity may represent the VM <b>104</b> requirement for a type of VNF <b>102</b>. For example, fork that is an element of set K and i that is an element of set I, each instance of VNF k may require M(k, i) instances of VMs <b>104</b>. For example, recall the example where I(GW)={MCM, ASM, IOM, WSM, CCM, DCM}.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0000">In an example, M(GW, I(GW)) may be the set that indicates the number of each type of VM <b>104</b> that may be required to instantiate gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a</i>. For example, M(GW, I(GW))={2, 16, 4, 4, 2, 4} may indicate that one instantiation of gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>may require two instantiations of MCM VMs <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b> instantiations of ACM VM <b>104</b><i>b</i>, four instantiations of TOM VM <b>104</b>, four instantiations of WSM VM <b>104</b>, two instantiations of CCM VM <b>104</b>, and four instantiations of DCM VM <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Another parameter may indicate the capacity of hardware platform <b>106</b>. For example, a parameter C may indicate the number of vCPUs <b>108</b><i>a </i>required for each VM <b>104</b> type i and for each VNF <b>102</b> type k. For example, this may include the parameter C(k, i). For example, if MCM VM <b>104</b><i>a </i>for gateway VNF <b>102</b><i>a </i>requires 20 vCPUs <b>108</b><i>a</i>, this may be represented as C(GW, MCM)=20.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">However, given the complexity of the integer programming problem&#x2014;the numerous variables and restrictions that must be satisfied&#x2014;implementing an algorithm that may be used to solve the integer programming problem efficiently, without sacrificing optimality, may be difficult.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a functional block diagram depicting one example of an LTE-EPS network architecture <b>400</b> that may be at least partially implemented as an SDN.

Bearers can be classified in at least two different categories: (i) minimum guaranteed bit rate bearers, e.g., for applications, such as VoIP; and (ii) non-guaranteed bit rate bearers that do not require guarantee bit rate, e.g., for applications, such as web browsing.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In one embodiment, the core network <b>404</b> includes various network entities, such as MME <b>418</b>, SGW <b>420</b>, Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>422</b>, Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) <b>424</b> and PGW <b>426</b>. In one embodiment, MME <b>418</b> comprises a control node performing a control signaling between various equipment and devices in access network <b>402</b> and core network <b>404</b>. The protocols running between UE <b>414</b> and core network <b>404</b> are generally known as Non-Access Stratum (NAS) protocols.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">For illustration purposes only, the terms MME <b>418</b>, SGW <b>420</b>, HSS <b>422</b> and PGW <b>426</b>, and so on, can be server devices, but may be referred to in the subject disclosure without the word &#x201c;server.&#x201d; It is also understood that any form of such servers can operate in a device, system, component, or other form of centralized or distributed hardware and software. It is further noted that these terms and other terms such as bearer paths and/or interfaces are terms that can include features, methodologies, and/or fields that may be described in whole or in part by standards bodies such as the 3GPP. It is further noted that some or all embodiments of the subject disclosure may in whole or in part modify, supplement, or otherwise supersede final or proposed standards published and promulgated by 3GPP.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">According to traditional implementations of LTE-EPS architectures, SGW <b>420</b> routes and forwards all user data packets. SGW <b>420</b> also acts as a mobility anchor for user plane operation during handovers between base stations, e.g., during a handover from first eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>to second eNB <b>416</b><i>b </i>as may be the result of UE <b>414</b> moving from one area of coverage, e.g., cell, to another. SGW <b>420</b> can also terminate a downlink data path, e.g., from external network <b>406</b> to UE <b>414</b> in an idle state and trigger a paging operation when downlink data arrives for UE <b>414</b>. SGW <b>420</b> can also be configured to manage and store a context for UE <b>414</b>, e.g., including one or more of parameters of the IP bearer service and network internal routing information. In addition, SGW <b>420</b> can perform administrative functions, e.g., in a visited network, such as collecting information for charging (e.g., the volume of data sent to or received from the user), and/or replicate user traffic, e.g., to support a lawful interception. SGW <b>420</b> also serves as the mobility anchor for interworking with other 3GPP technologies such as universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">At any given time, UE <b>414</b> is generally in one of three different states: detached, idle, or active. The detached state is typically a transitory state in which UE <b>414</b> is powered on but is engaged in a process of searching and registering with network <b>402</b>. In the active state, UE <b>414</b> is registered with access network <b>402</b> and has established a wireless connection, e.g., radio resource control (RRC) connection, with eNB <b>416</b>. Whether UE <b>414</b> is in an active state can depend on the state of a packet data session, and whether there is an active packet data session. In the idle state, UE <b>414</b> is generally in a power conservation state in which UE <b>414</b> typically does not communicate packets. When UE <b>414</b> is idle, SGW <b>420</b> can terminate a downlink data path, e.g., from one peer entity <b>406</b>, and triggers paging of UE <b>414</b> when data arrives for UE <b>414</b>. If UE <b>414</b> responds to the page, SGW <b>420</b> can forward the IP packet to eNB <b>416</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">HSS <b>422</b> can manage subscription-related information for a user of UE <b>414</b>. For example, tHSS <b>422</b> can store information such as authorization of the user, security requirements for the user, quality of service (QoS) requirements for the user, etc. HSS <b>422</b> can also hold information about external networks <b>406</b> to which the user can connect, e.g., in the form of an APN of external networks <b>406</b>. For example, MME <b>418</b> can communicate with HSS <b>422</b> to determine if UE <b>414</b> is authorized to establish a call, e.g., a voice over IP (VoIP) call before the call is established.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">PCRF <b>424</b> can perform QoS management functions and policy control. PCRF <b>424</b> is responsible for policy control decision-making, as well as for controlling the flow-based charging functionalities in a policy control enforcement function (PCEF), which resides in PGW <b>426</b>. PCRF <b>424</b> provides the QoS authorization, e.g., QoS class identifier and bit rates that decide how a certain data flow will be treated in the PCEF and ensures that this is in accordance with the user's subscription profile.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">PGW <b>426</b> can provide connectivity between the UE <b>414</b> and one or more of the external networks <b>406</b>. In illustrative network architecture <b>400</b>, PGW <b>426</b> can be responsible for IP address allocation for UE <b>414</b>, as well as one or more of QoS enforcement and flow-based charging, e.g., according to rules from the PCRF <b>424</b>. PGW <b>426</b> is also typically responsible for filtering downlink user IP packets into the different QoS-based bearers. In at least some embodiments, such filtering can be performed based on traffic flow templates. PGW <b>426</b> can also perform QoS enforcement, e.g., for guaranteed bit rate bearers. PGW <b>426</b> also serves as a mobility anchor for interworking with non-3GPP technologies such as CDMA2000.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Within access network <b>402</b> and core network <b>404</b> there may be various bearer paths/interfaces, e.g., represented by solid lines <b>428</b> and <b>430</b>. Some of the bearer paths can be referred to by a specific label. For example, solid line <b>428</b> can be considered an S1-U bearer and solid line <b>432</b> can be considered an S5/S8 bearer according to LTE-EPS architecture standards. Without limitation, reference to various interfaces, such as S1, X2, S5, S8, S11 refer to EPS interfaces. In some instances, such interface designations are combined with a suffix, e.g., a &#x201c;U&#x201d; or a &#x201c;C&#x201d; to signify whether the interface relates to a &#x201c;User plane&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Control plane.&#x201d; In addition, the core network <b>404</b> can include various signaling bearer paths/interfaces, e.g., control plane paths/interfaces represented by dashed lines <b>430</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>436</b>, and <b>438</b>. Some of the signaling bearer paths may be referred to by a specific label. For example, dashed line <b>430</b> can be considered as an S1-MME signaling bearer, dashed line <b>434</b> can be considered as an S11 signaling bearer and dashed line <b>436</b> can be considered as an S6a signaling bearer, e.g., according to LTE-EPS architecture standards. The above bearer paths and signaling bearer paths are only illustrated as examples and it should be noted that additional bearer paths and signaling bearer paths may exist that are not illustrated.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Also shown is a novel user plane path/interface, referred to as the S1-U+ interface <b>466</b>. In the illustrative example, the S1-U+ user plane interface extends between the eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and PGW <b>426</b>. Notably, S1-U+ path/interface does not include SGW <b>420</b>, a node that is otherwise instrumental in configuring and/or managing packet forwarding between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and one or more external networks <b>406</b> by way of PGW <b>426</b>. As disclosed herein, the S1-U+ path/interface facilitates autonomous learning of peer transport layer addresses by one or more of the network nodes to facilitate a self-configuring of the packet forwarding path. In particular, such self-configuring can be accomplished during handovers in most scenarios so as to reduce any extra signaling load on the S/PGWs <b>420</b>, <b>426</b> due to excessive handover events.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In some embodiments, PGW <b>426</b> is coupled to storage device <b>440</b>, shown in phantom. Storage device <b>440</b> can be integral to one of the network nodes, such as PGW <b>426</b>, for example, in the form of internal memory and/or disk drive. It is understood that storage device <b>440</b> can include registers suitable for storing address values. Alternatively, or in addition, storage device <b>440</b> can be separate from PGW <b>426</b>, for example, as an external hard drive, a flash drive, and/or network storage.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Storage device <b>440</b> selectively stores one or more values relevant to the forwarding of packet data. For example, storage device <b>440</b> can store identities and/or addresses of network entities, such as any of network nodes <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, and <b>426</b>, eNBs <b>416</b> and/or UE <b>414</b>. In the illustrative example, storage device <b>440</b> includes a first storage location <b>442</b> and a second storage location <b>444</b>. First storage location <b>442</b> can be dedicated to storing a Currently Used Downlink address value <b>442</b>. Likewise, second storage location <b>444</b> can be dedicated to storing a Default Downlink Forwarding address value <b>444</b>. PGW <b>426</b> can read and/or write values into either of storage locations <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>, for example, managing Currently Used Downlink Forwarding address value <b>442</b> and Default Downlink Forwarding address value <b>444</b> as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">In some embodiments, the Default Downlink Forwarding address for each EPS bearer is the SGW S5-U address for each EPS Bearer. The Currently Used Downlink Forwarding address&#x201d; for each EPS bearer in PGW <b>426</b> can be set every time when PGW <b>426</b> receives an uplink packet, e.g., a GTP-U uplink packet, with a new source address for a corresponding EPS bearer. When UE <b>414</b> is in an idle state, the &#x201c;Current Used Downlink Forwarding address&#x201d; field for each EPS bearer of UE <b>414</b> can be set to a &#x201c;null&#x201d; or other suitable value.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">In some embodiments, the Default Downlink Forwarding address is only updated when PGW <b>426</b> receives a new SGW S5-U address in a predetermined message or messages. For example, the Default Downlink Forwarding address is only updated when PGW <b>426</b> receives one of a Create Session Request, Modify Bearer Request and Create Bearer Response messages from SGW <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">As values <b>442</b>, <b>444</b> can be maintained and otherwise manipulated on a per bearer basis, it is understood that the storage locations can take the form of tables, spreadsheets, lists, and/or other data structures generally well understood and suitable for maintaining and/or otherwise manipulate forwarding addresses on a per bearer basis.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">It should be noted that access network <b>402</b> and core network <b>404</b> are illustrated in a simplified block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In other words, either or both of access network <b>402</b> and the core network <b>404</b> can include additional network elements that are not shown, such as various routers, switches and controllers. In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates only a single one of each of the various network elements, it should be noted that access network <b>402</b> and core network <b>404</b> can include any number of the various network elements. For example, core network <b>404</b> can include a pool (i.e., more than one) of MMEs <b>418</b>, SGWs <b>420</b> or PGWs <b>426</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">In the illustrative example, data traversing a network path between UE <b>414</b>, eNB <b>416</b><i>a</i>, SGW <b>420</b>, PGW <b>426</b> and external network <b>406</b> may be considered to constitute data transferred according to an end-to-end IP service. However, for the present disclosure, to properly perform establishment management in LTE-EPS network architecture <b>400</b>, the core network, data bearer portion of the end-to-end IP service is analyzed.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">An establishment may be defined herein as a connection set up request between any two elements within LTE-EPS network architecture <b>400</b>. The connection set up request may be for user data or for signaling. A failed establishment may be defined as a connection set up request that was unsuccessful. A successful establishment may be defined as a connection set up request that was successful.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In one embodiment, a data bearer portion comprises a first portion (e.g., a data radio bearer <b>446</b>) between UE <b>414</b> and eNB <b>416</b><i>a</i>, a second portion (e.g., an <b>51</b> data bearer <b>428</b>) between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and SGW <b>420</b>, and a third portion (e.g., an S5/S8 bearer <b>432</b>) between SGW <b>420</b> and PGW <b>426</b>. Various signaling bearer portions are also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. For example, a first signaling portion (e.g., a signaling radio bearer <b>448</b>) between UE <b>414</b> and eNB <b>416</b><i>a</i>, and a second signaling portion (e.g., S1 signaling bearer <b>430</b>) between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and MME <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In at least some embodiments, the data bearer can include tunneling, e.g., IP tunneling, by which data packets can be forwarded in an encapsulated manner, between tunnel endpoints. Tunnels, or tunnel connections can be identified in one or more nodes of network <b>100</b>, e.g., by one or more of tunnel endpoint identifiers, an IP address and a user datagram protocol port number. Within a particular tunnel connection, payloads, e.g., packet data, which may or may not include protocol related information, are forwarded between tunnel endpoints.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">An example of first tunnel solution <b>450</b> includes a first tunnel <b>452</b><i>a </i>between two tunnel endpoints <b>454</b><i>a </i>and <b>456</b><i>a</i>, and a second tunnel <b>452</b><i>b </i>between two tunnel endpoints <b>454</b><i>b </i>and <b>456</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrative example, first tunnel <b>452</b><i>a </i>is established between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and SGW <b>420</b>. Accordingly, first tunnel <b>452</b><i>a </i>includes a first tunnel endpoint <b>454</b><i>a </i>corresponding to an S1-U address of eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>(referred to herein as the eNB S1-U address), and second tunnel endpoint <b>456</b><i>a </i>corresponding to an S1-U address of SGW <b>420</b> (referred to herein as the SGW S1-U address). Likewise, second tunnel <b>452</b><i>b </i>includes first tunnel endpoint <b>454</b><i>b </i>corresponding to an S5-U address of SGW <b>420</b> (referred to herein as the SGW S5-U address), and second tunnel endpoint <b>456</b><i>b </i>corresponding to an S5-U address of PGW <b>426</b> (referred to herein as the PGW S5-U address).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">In at least some embodiments, first tunnel solution <b>450</b> is referred to as a two-tunnel solution, e.g., according to the GPRS Tunneling Protocol User Plane (GTPv1-U based), as described in 3GPP specification TS 29.281, incorporated herein in its entirety. It is understood that one or more tunnels are permitted between each set of tunnel end points. For example, each subscriber can have one or more tunnels, e.g., one for each PDP context that they have active, as well as possibly having separate tunnels for specific connections with different quality of service requirements, and so on.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">An example of second tunnel solution <b>458</b> includes a single or direct tunnel <b>460</b> between tunnel endpoints <b>462</b> and <b>464</b>. In the illustrative example, direct tunnel <b>460</b> is established between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and PGW <b>426</b>, without subjecting packet transfers to processing related to SGW <b>420</b>. Accordingly, direct tunnel <b>460</b> includes first tunnel endpoint <b>462</b> corresponding to the eNB S1-U address, and second tunnel endpoint <b>464</b> corresponding to the PGW S5-U address. Packet data received at either end can be encapsulated into a payload and directed to the corresponding address of the other end of the tunnel. Such direct tunneling avoids processing, e.g., by SGW <b>420</b> that would otherwise relay packets between the same two endpoints, e.g., according to a protocol, such as the GTP-U protocol.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">In some scenarios, direct tunneling solution <b>458</b> can forward user plane data packets between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and PGW <b>426</b>, by way of SGW <b>420</b>. That is, SGW <b>420</b> can serve a relay function, by relaying packets between two tunnel endpoints <b>416</b><i>a</i>, <b>426</b>. In other scenarios, direct tunneling solution <b>458</b> can forward user data packets between eNB <b>416</b><i>a </i>and PGW <b>426</b>, by way of the S1 U+ interface, thereby bypassing SGW <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Generally, UE <b>414</b> can have one or more bearers at any one time. The number and types of bearers can depend on applications, default requirements, and so on. It is understood that the techniques disclosed herein, including the configuration, management and use of various tunnel solutions <b>450</b>, <b>458</b>, can be applied to the bearers on an individual basis. That is, if user data packets of one bearer, say a bearer associated with a VoIP service of UE <b>414</b>, then the forwarding of all packets of that bearer are handled in a similar manner. Continuing with this example, the same UE <b>414</b> can have another bearer associated with it through the same eNB <b>416</b><i>a</i>. This other bearer, for example, can be associated with a relatively low rate data session forwarding user data packets through core network <b>404</b> simultaneously with the first bearer. Likewise, the user data packets of the other bearer are also handled in a similar manner, without necessarily following a forwarding path or solution of the first bearer. Thus, one of the bearers may be forwarded through direct tunnel <b>458</b>; whereas, another one of the bearers may be forwarded through a two-tunnel solution <b>450</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an exemplary diagrammatic representation of a machine in the form of a computer system <b>500</b> within which a set of instructions, when executed, may cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methods described above.

The various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. Thus, the methods and devices may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in concrete, tangible, storage media having a concrete, tangible, physical structure. Examples of tangible storage media include floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, DVDs, hard drives, or any other tangible machine-readable storage medium (computer-readable storage medium). Thus, a computer-readable storage medium is not a signal. A computer-readable storage medium is not a transient signal. Further, a computer-readable storage medium is not a propagating signal. A computer-readable storage medium as described herein is an article of manufacture. When the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes a device for telecommunications. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device will generally include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile or nonvolatile memory or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. The program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. The language can be a compiled or interpreted language and may be combined with hardware implementations.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">The methods and devices associated with a telecommunications system as described herein also may be practiced via communications embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as an EPROM, a gate array, a programmable logic device (PLD), a client computer, or the like, the machine becomes an device for implementing telecommunications as described herein. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique device that operates to invoke the functionality of a telecommunications system.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">While a telecommunications system has been described in connection with the various examples of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar implementations may be used, or modifications and additions may be made to the described examples of a telecommunications system without deviating therefrom. For example, one skilled in the art will recognize that a telecommunications system as described in the instant application may apply to any environment, whether wired or wireless, and may be applied to any number of such devices connected via a communications network and interacting across the network. Therefore, a telecommunications system as described herein should not be limited to any single example, but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
