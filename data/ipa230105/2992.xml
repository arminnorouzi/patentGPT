More particularly, the invention describes an artificially built water reservoir built along a water surface or a large body of water with external walls extending higher than a high tide water level and configured to accept large volumes of water pumped therein. Stored water may be released by flowing through electricity-generating turbines so as to convert the potential energy of a water column to electrical energy, which can then be directed to satisfy the demands of the electrical grid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Renewable sources of electrical energy are getting more and more popular as an alternative to traditional methods and systems to produce electricity. Solar, wind, and tidal wave power plants of various sizes and capacities are being implemented in various countries and this trend is expected to continue and expand over at least the next decade or more. The growth of renewable energy sources in the global production of electricity is accelerating. Renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydropower plants, increased worldwide by an unparalleled 184 GW in 2019. This was 20 GW more than in 2018. It is worth mentioning that the global capacity in renewable power was 414 GW in 2009, and only ten years later it was around 1627 GW, i.e., it grew more than 3.9 times. Experts further predict that the share of renewable energy sources in the global electrical power generation industry can grow from 15% in 2015 to 63% in 2050. Using wind power as an example, as much as 60 GW of wind energy capacity was installed and placed in service globally in 2019, an increase of 19% as compared to the previous year.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One critical limitation of electricity generation using most types of renewable energy systems is fluctuating nature of produced power: wind power generators depend on the direction and strength of the wind; solar panels are dependent on the availability of direct sunshine, tidal wave power plants depend on the times of high and low tides for their operation. Once produced, electrical energy needs to be consumed right away or stored in some highly efficient form suitable for easy retrieval at a later time. Fluctuating energy voltage and frequency variations put additional stress on power transmission lines, endangering the power grid.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Uneven energy production is only one part of the problem. Varying electricity demand also makes it difficult for power producers to accurately predict and satisfy the energy demands of their customers. In addition to daily, weekly, and monthly fluctuations in power demand levels, seasonal and global fluctuations play a significant role in defining how much energy is needed at a certain time and day.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Balancing fluctuating demand and fluctuating and at times uncertain supply of electricity is not a simple task. Overproduction of electricity, for example, causes significant difficulties with efficient energy storage. Conventional batteries are not very efficient for coping with substantial power production spikes. The need exists therefore for more economical and ecologically friendly methods of storing electrical energy when it is overproduced and releasing this electrical energy to satisfy peak market demands when needed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Previous attempts to use existing hydroelectric plants are known in the art. During a time of low demand, excess electricity may be used to pump water from low levels back to high levels so it can be used to generate more electricity when needed. These systems have a major limitation of only being available at locations where hydroelectric plants are located, usually in places of high elevations or mountains. For relatively flat locations, which are predominant around the world, these methods of storing energy are not suitable. In addition, renewable wind and solar energy sources are typically deployed in flat areas, such as along a coastline next to a sea or an ocean, and so they may be located far away from existing hydroelectrical plants.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other known methods used for the storage of produced electricity include electrochemical batteries, flywheel energy storage systems, supercapacitors, and compressed air plants. These technologies did not find widespread use because of their costs, difficulty with deployment on a large scale, environmental risks, and low energy conversion efficacy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The need, therefore, exists for an efficient and ecologically friendly solution to the problem of balancing the unpredictable production of electrical energy from wind and solar power plants against the varying energy demands of modern cities, especially those located in flat areas along the coastal line.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to overcome these and other drawbacks of the prior art by providing a novel water reservoir system configured for generating, accumulating, storing, and releasing electrical energy&#x2014;to act as a component of the electrical power grid designed to smooth over peak energy supply as well as peak energy demand.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel water reservoir-based system designed to use water from an abundant body of water to allow accumulating, storing, and releasing of electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a water reservoir system for smoothing over the peaks of energy supply and demand using readily available components and in an environmentally conscious and safe manner.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a method of reducing electrical energy peaks in supply and demand and therefore promote the global use of renewable power sources, in particular, using wind and solar power to generate electricity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet another object of the present invention to supplement accumulating, storing, and releasing electrical energy by generating additional electrical energy using the facilities of the novel water reservoir system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The water reservoir system of the invention generally includes a water reservoir with an interior section surrounded by a wall built in an abundant body of water, such as a large lake, a sea, or an ocean.

The first novel step in the building of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> is a selection of an appropriate location. As compared to the use of open water reservoirs located at a considerable height above sea level for use at traditional hydropower stations, the present invention teaches to position the water reservoir at the water level associated with an abundant body of water <b>10</b>. The term &#x201c;abundant body of water&#x201d; is used to define a large body of water with easy access to sufficient water volume so as to fill the water reservoir <b>125</b> of the invention&#x2014;all without appreciably changing the water level of the abundant body of water. The abundant body of water may be defined as holding at least 10 times, at least 50 times, at least 100 times, or more water than that needed to fill the water reservoir <b>125</b> to the maximum water level. A large lake, a sea, or an ocean are all examples of a suitable abundant body of water.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be entirely located within the abundant body of water <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the water reservoir wall <b>110</b> may be partially located within the abundant body of water <b>10</b>. In further embodiments, the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be located close to an abundant body of water <b>10</b> and comprise a suitably large water pipe system to connect the components thereof and the abundant body of water, so as to provide a low-resistance flow of water in and out of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> and the abundant body of water <b>10</b>. Therefore, for the purposes of this description, the term &#x201c;a water reservoir with an interior surrounded by a wall built in an abundant body of water&#x201d; is used to mean a variety of situations where the water reservoir <b>125</b> has easy access to the abundant body of water allowing practical movement of large volumes of water between the water reservoir <b>125</b> and the body of water <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">As already evident from the above discussion, the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be built at or close to sea level so as to assure ease of flowing of large volumes of water in and out of the water reservoir. When used with large lakes, the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be built at or near the water level in the lake for similar reasons.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">As one of the main objectives of the invention is to smooth out peak power fluctuations in an electrical power grid, another consideration for the location of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> of the present invention is to be situated with suitable access to the electrical power grid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically the presence of the electrical power line <b>14</b> leading to the electrical power grid.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">A critical component of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> is a computerized controller <b>130</b> configured to have electrical communication <b>132</b> with all components of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> as well as an electrical connection to the electrical power grid. In addition, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may be equipped with various sensors required to monitor the operation of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> as well as, optionally, the level of electrical power in the electrical power grid. In some embodiments, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may be equipped with one or more sensors indicating the level of water inside water reservoir <b>125</b>, and outside the water reservoir <b>125</b>, as well as the electrical activity of all major components of the system of the present invention. The computerized controller <b>130</b> may be further equipped to receive signals from the electrical power grid indicating the level of the electrical energy supply and demand therein, for example, to receive a call for using excess electrical energy to pump water into the water reservoir, or a signal to release electrical energy to supplement electrical energy available in the power grid from other sources when the demand level for electrical power is high.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows an exemplary wall <b>110</b> erected within the abundant body of water <b>10</b> close to the shoreline of the shore area <b>12</b>. Reservoir wall <b>110</b> may be built on the bottom of the body of water <b>10</b> and extend to a height exceeding the normal water level of the body of water. This allows separation of the water inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> from the water outside the wall <b>110</b>, accumulation and storage of the water inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> at a water level exceeding the water level in the surrounding waters of the abundant body of water <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">The bottom of the body of water <b>10</b> located within the boundaries of the water reservoir <b>125</b> needs to have sufficiently low water permeability so as to not allow water to passively drain from the water reservoir <b>125</b> to the outside body of water <b>10</b>, which may be caused by a difference in water levels inside and outside the water reservoir <b>125</b>. In the case of sandy sediment covering the bottom of the water reservoir <b>125</b>, there may not be a need to take any measures to seal the bottom. Water seepage through the bottom of the reservoir is governed by the Darcy law. With an exemplary radius of the water reservoir <b>125</b> at one or several kilometers, the size of the grain of sand of about 1-2 mm, and the depth of sediment at about 100 meters, calculations show that the rate of leakage would not exceed about 1% of the volume of the water reservoir per day, making additional sealing efforts unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">Still, in other circumstances, bottom sealing may be advisable or even required. The present invention may take advantage of the plastic waste recovered from the body of water <b>10</b> as a base material for making the sealing cover. Since the quality of the plastic film does not need to be exceptional and the only requirement is to reasonably seal the bottom surface of the water reservoir, a bottom film made from a composite recycled waste plastic material may be advantageously used to accomplish that objective.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">One or more reversible water turbines <b>120</b> may be positioned across the wall <b>110</b> to direct water in and out of the water reservoir <b>125</b>. Any suitable designs may be used for this purpose, for example, axial flow water turbines. Each turbine may be equipped with or otherwise associated with an electrical motor/generator. When the motor is powered up with electrical power, the water turbine may act as a water pump to pump water from the body of water <b>10</b> into the water reservoir <b>125</b>. In reversed conditions, when the water is drained from the water reservoir to the outside body of water <b>10</b> (based on a higher water level inside the water reservoir as compared to the water level outside thereof), the water turbines may be configured to be rotated by the water draining and cause the motor/generators to generate electrical power, which can be directed to supplement the electrical power in the electrical power grid.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">In some embodiments, water turbines <b>120</b> may be placed directly across the wall <b>110</b> at a level at or lower than the water level of the body of water <b>10</b>. A plurality of such water turbines <b>120</b> may be located throughout the periphery of the reservoir wall <b>110</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">The shape of the reservoir wall <b>110</b> may be selected to be appropriate for local conditions. It may be preferable to build it using as many straight sections as possible to reduce the cost of construction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">In other special situations, the shape of the reservoir wall may be selected to serve additional purposes. In one example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the wall <b>110</b> is extended to connect two higher points of the shoreline and protect the local area <b>12</b> from flooding, for example as a result of global warming causing a rise in water levels. In such situations, the construction of a protective wall is necessary to protect local areas. Building the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may cause only a small increase in the budget as compared to building a conventional protective wall, but with an additional evergreen benefit of facilitating the use of renewable energy sources. Water turbines <b>120</b> may be located along the outer portion of the wall facing the open body of water so as to not cause additional water inflow into the protected areas <b>11</b> with a lower level of the water therein. A water lock system <b>20</b> may be also provided to allow ships to enter the local ports if needed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">A general perspective view of the first embodiment of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The reservoir wall <b>110</b> may be erected in a shape of a polygon with sections <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, and so on. Generally speaking, the shape of the water reservoir <b>125</b> close to that of a circle may be preferable as it encloses the most inner area for a minimal length of the wall, therefore minimizing construction costs. As constructing straight walls is more economical than curved walls, a form of a polygon may offer the advantages of surrounding the most area for the lowest cost of construction. Individual sections of the polygon may not be of even length so as to accommodate local conditions, as may be understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">The wall <b>110</b> may be built in a relatively shallow and flat area of the body of water <b>10</b> and close to the shore, such as a bay area for example. Building the wall <b>110</b> exposed at least along a portion thereof to ocean water and on top of a reasonably flat seafloor is advantageous as there will be required only minimal preparation work on the floor of the water reservoir <b>125</b> (such as smoothing uneven surfaces) so the cost of construction of the entire system is dictated primarily by the linear (per kilometer) cost of the wall, in addition to all equipment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">Location of the water reservoir <b>125</b> may be selected to account for water level and low tide and high tide if the water reservoir is constructed at the sea or an ocean. The wall <b>110</b> may be constructed to exceed the high tide level <b>30</b> by a predetermined difference so as to store a sufficient volume of water to operate efficiently as a buffer for power fluctuations of the electrical power grid. In embodiments, the wall height may exceed the high tide water level <b>30</b> by at least 1 m, at least 2 m, at least 3 m, at least 4 m, at least 5 m, at least 6 m, at least 7 m, at least 8 m, at least 9 m, at least 10 m, at least 15 m, at least 20 m, at least 25 m, at least 30 m, at least 40 m, or even higher depending on other factors, as the invention is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">The overall height of the wall <b>110</b> defines the range of the water level <b>31</b> that may be utilized for pumping water into the reservoir or draining water out of the reservoir. The minimal level of water may be designated to be at or above the low tide water level <b>30</b> outside the wall <b>110</b>. In further embodiments, the minimal water level <b>31</b> may be designated to be slightly above the water level <b>30</b>, such as above by at least 10 cm, at least 30 cm, at least 50 cm, at least 70 cm, at least 100 cm, or another distance as appropriate for local conditions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">The maximum level of water <b>31</b> may be designated to be below the top of the wall <b>115</b> by at least 30 cm, at least 50 cm, at least 70 cm, at least 100 cm, or by another appropriate distance. The distance between the maximum level of water <b>31</b> at the top of the wall <b>115</b> may be necessary to avoid flooding of the top 115 due to waves inside the reservoir which may be caused by strong winds. In other circumstances, spillover protection may be necessary to avoid uncontrolled excessive pumping of water into the reservoir in case of equipment malfunction. To assure safety, one or many passive spillover openings <b>122</b> may be located at one or at several places along the wall <b>110</b> and configured to direct spillover water back to the body of water <b>10</b> outside the water reservoir <b>125</b>. The size of these openings may be selected to assure sufficient draining capacity to safely relieve any unanticipated overflow conditions.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">Further safety provisions may include one or more spill gates <b>123</b>, which may be opened or closed by the computerized controller <b>130</b>. These spill gates are intended to be closed all the time, except in emergency conditions, such as an upcoming hurricane or an unavoidable collision with a large ship, which may cause a breach in the wall, or for maintenance purposes. Safe and rapid reduction in water level <b>31</b> to that close to or at the level <b>30</b> outside the wall by dumping water outside the water reservoir <b>125</b> may be used to avoid abrupt and uncontrolled spillage of large volumes of water in case of an unanticipated event that poses a risk of a wall breach.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">One, two, or a plurality of water turbines such as reversible water turbines <b>120</b> may be positioned to direct the flow of water across the wall <b>110</b>. The water reservoir system <b>100</b> may include more than one turbine <b>120</b>, such as at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, or even more of the water turbines, as the invention is not limited in this regard. In some embodiments, water turbines <b>120</b> may be positioned directly across the wall <b>110</b> and below the water level <b>30</b> of the body of water <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the water turbines <b>120</b> may be positioned inside the water reservoir or outside thereof and provided with a water pipe to expose one side thereof to the water inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> and the other side thereof to the water outside thereof, depending on local conditions and preferences. In further yet embodiments, the water turbine <b>120</b> may be positioned at or even above the water level <b>30</b> and be equipped with a water-filled conduit to connect the water turbine to water on both sides of the wall <b>110</b>, as the invention is not limited in this regard. Suitable screens may be installed at the outlet of water turbines <b>120</b> to avoid local fish and other living organisms or other objects from being sucked into the turbines when operating in a water pumping mode.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058">Each water turbine <b>120</b> may be equipped with an electrical motor/generator, which operates either as a motor or a generator depending on the mode of operation of the water turbine. When the water turbine <b>120</b> is used as a water pump, the motor is operated by supplied electrical power, and the water turbine is rotated in a manner to direct water to raise the water level inside the water reservoir <b>125</b>. When the water is drained from the water reservoir, the water turbine may be used in reverse, namely to be driven by the water flow and to rotate the shaft of the motor/generator to cause the generation of electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">Water flowing into and out of the water turbines <b>120</b> may be controlled by at least one electrically operated sluice <b>121</b>, which may be located either at the entrance of the water flow into the water turbine or at its exit. More than one sluice may be used, for example, to completely isolate the water turbine from operation at both the entrance and the exit of the water flow&#x2014;such as to allow a repair or maintenance to be performed from time to time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060">As a substantial portion of wall <b>110</b> is expected to be above a normal water level, it will be visible from a shoreline. The exterior of the wall may be painted or otherwise colored in neutral or water-like colors so as to diminish the contrast between wall <b>110</b> and the surrounding water. In other embodiments, the exterior of wall <b>110</b> may be pained as an island to better blend with the local environment. In further yet embodiments, the exterior of wall <b>110</b> may include locations designated for advertisement or other visual messaging to the observers from the shore or from a watercraft passing along the wall.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061">Various materials may be used for the construction of wall <b>110</b>, as known by those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the entirety of wall <b>110</b> may be made from the same materials, while in other embodiments, wall <b>110</b> may be constructed by connecting existing sections and repurposed structures as may be available with intermediate portions of the wall made from various available local materials. Importantly, the structural integrity of wall <b>110</b> must be sufficient to hold the water inside the reservoir at a height exceeding the water level outside the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062">The top edge <b>115</b> of the wall <b>110</b> may be enlarged and converted to be a boardwalk, a path for walking or bicycling along thereof, a road for vehicles such as technical service vehicles, or for another useful recreational activity. Trees may be placed along the wall <b>110</b> to further improve the appearance of the water reservoir system <b>100</b> as a stand-alone island.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">In operation, the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be used in an energy-generating mode or a water-pumping mode. The computerized controller <b>130</b> may be configured to select the mode of operation depending on the balance of the electrical energy supply and demand in the electrical power grid. In particular, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may detect the condition or receive a first signal from the electrical power grid indicating that the electrical energy supply is exceeding the demand for such energy and that excess electrical power is available and in need of accumulating and storing until the demand for electrical energy increases. Alternatively, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may be able to receive the signal or detect the condition of the electrical power grid when the electrical energy in the electrical power grid is exceeding a predetermined peak supply threshold. In either one of these cases, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may be configured to initiate the operation of the system of the invention in the water pumping mode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">The objective of operating the system of the invention in the water pumping mode is to utilize an excess of electrical power to pump water into the water reservoir, assuming that the current water level <b>31</b> at that point is below the maximum safe level. If this is the case, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may activate one, two, or more of the available water turbines to start pumping water from the body of water into the water reservoir <b>125</b> with the aim of increasing the water level in the water reservoir <b>125</b>. The excess electrical power is directed from the electrical power grid to operate the motors/generators of any suitable number (from one to all) of the water turbines to achieve a higher water level <b>31</b> inside the water reservoir <b>125</b>. The computerized controller <b>130</b> may be used to continuously monitor the conditions of the electrical power grid and receive signals from the electric grid. When the appropriate signal is received or the excess in electrical power is detected as subsiding, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may stop the operation of some or all of the water turbines <b>120</b> in the water pumping mode. The water turbines <b>120</b> may also be slowed down or stopped as the water in the water reservoir <b>125</b> reaches the maximum level.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">Once the computerized controller <b>130</b> receives the appropriate signal or detects that the power balance at the electrical power grid is stabilized (for example by detecting that the electrical energy levels are above the predetermined peak demand threshold and below the predetermined peak supply threshold), it may be configured to stop all water pumping, close all sluices, and operate the system of the invention in a simple water storing mode for subsequent generating of electrical energy when the need for electrical energy is identified. In other embodiments, if there is an expectation of further spikes in the supply of electricity, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may initiate partial drainage or complete drainage of water in the energy generating mode if it is desirable to supplement the electrical power grid with the electrical energy generated by the water reservoir system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">The energy generating mode is aimed to produce electrical energy by electrical motors/generators when the water turbines <b>120</b> are driven to rotate by water draining from the water reservoir <b>125</b> to the body of water <b>10</b> outside thereof. High demand for electrical power may be predictable and repeatable such as electricity consumption by air conditioning systems connected to the power grid during hot summer months. In this case, the computerized controller <b>130</b> may be configured to operate the water reservoir system <b>100</b> in the energy-generating mode based on a certain schedule. In other cases, such a spike in demand may not be predictable. In these cases, the computerized controller may initiate the operation of the system <b>100</b> in the energy generating mode upon receiving a corresponding request such as a second signal from the electrical power grid or upon detection of electrical energy in the electrical power grid falling below a predetermined peak demand threshold. The predetermined peak demand threshold may be lower than the predetermined peak supply threshold when characterizing and monitoring the electrical power grid or receiving appropriate signals.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">The energy generating mode may be characterized by opening the respective sluices to cause one, two, or more turbines <b>120</b> as appropriate to rotate based on the water level difference between the water in the reservoir <b>125</b> and outside the wall <b>110</b>. The computerized controller <b>130</b> may be configured to optimize the number of operating water turbines <b>120</b> depending on the demand for electrical power from the electrical power grid and the water level <b>31</b> available in the water reservoir <b>125</b>, as not all water turbines <b>120</b> may be operated at all times. All electrical power generated by the motors/generators of the water turbines <b>120</b> may be directed to supplement the electrical power in the electrical power grid and satisfy an increased demand for electrical power. Generation of electrical power may continue until either there is no more water available to be drained from the water reservoir <b>125</b> or until the conditions in the electrical power grid are changed and the electrical energy from the water reservoir system <b>100</b> is no longer required.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">The water reservoir system <b>100</b> may also be operated as a tidal wave basin electrical generator by allowing water to passively enter the water reservoir at high tides and drawing the water to operate the water turbines <b>120</b> in the energy generation mode during low tides.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">In addition to providing supplemental electrical energy to reduce fluctuations of demand and supply for the electrical power grid, the electrical energy developed by the present invention may be directed to other useful local purposes, for example, to energize a local desalinization plant, which may be located within the boundaries of the wall <b>110</b> or somewhere else nearby. The generation of fresh potable water may be used to send the water via a suitable pipeline to feed the local area residents with high-quality freshwater. This alternative use of electrical energy generated by the water reservoir system <b>100</b> may be activated when excessive electrical energy consistently exceeds the supply needs and too much water is accumulated in the water reservoir <b>125</b>. Another alternative use of excess electrical energy may include generating hydrogen from the water taken from the body of water <b>10</b>. Hydrogen produced in a nearby plant may be used to power automobiles or for other useful purposes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a second embodiment of the present invention aimed at using the top water surface inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> as a basis for floating solar panels in order to generate additional electrical power independent of the excessive power which may or may not be available from the electrical power grid. As the area of the water inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> is expected to be substantial, and the water inside the reservoir is not subject to high and low tides or waves and other ocean disturbances, it may offer an advantageous flat surface to locate one or more floating solar panels <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">Any suitable design of a solar panel may be used for the purposes of the invention. The solar panels <b>140</b> may be mounted on floating bases and arranged to cover as much of the area inside the water reservoir <b>125</b> as desired. The panels may be inclined at a consistent angle selected to maximize solar exposure in a given area. In other embodiments, the solar panels may be adjusted throughout the day to maximize solar exposure even further.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">A system of flexible cables may be used to electrically connect individual solar panels <b>140</b>. Since the water level <b>31</b> is expected to fluctuate between the minimum level and the maximum level, the cables may be selected to allow for the level change for at least some or all of the solar panels <b>140</b> not only in between these water levels but also in a broader range to further increase the safety of their operation, such as from the bottom of the water reservoir to the top of the wall <b>115</b>. This may be done to avoid damage to the solar panels in case the water level accidentally goes outside its designed and predicted limits and provide uninterrupted electrical connections for one or more solar panels regardless of water levels.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">As with other solar panel systems, the generation of electrical power may not be entirely consistent and predictable when using solar panels <b>140</b>.

Archimedes screw rotary pumps may be advantageously used for this purpose although other water pump designs may be used as well depending on local circumstances. One advantage of the Archimedes type axial flow rotary pumps is the broad range of rotational speeds that these pumps may operate in, which is useful for driving these pumps using wind turbines.

The water pipe <b>155</b> may further include a one-way valve <b>156</b> at the exit port or at other locations in the water pathway. This is designed to preclude a reversal of water flow direction when the pump <b>150</b> is stopped or slowed down.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">Once the water path is completely filled with water (for example using a top access and vent opening <b>165</b>, a one-way siphon system may be formed between the water level <b>30</b> outside the water reservoir <b>125</b> and the interior water level <b>31</b>. Rotation of the water pump <b>150</b> causes the water to be pumped from the body of water to fill the water reservoir <b>125</b>. This happens at all times when the wind is blowing in any direction with at least some minimal speed. Importantly, the process of operating the water pumps is independent of the process of operating the water turbines <b>120</b>, in other words, the water is being pumped into the reservoir regardless of whether the water turbines <b>120</b> are operated in the energy generating mode or in the water pumping mode. This approach further increases the efficacy of the entire water reservoir system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088">Another advantage of forming a siphon system is that it will work independently of the water levels <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. Furthermore, as the tide rises, the pressure head for pumping water decreases making the water pump more productive. At the same time, as the water level <b>31</b> inside the water reservoir changes up or down, the water pumps <b>150</b> use only the necessary energy to lift the water from the body of water <b>10</b> into the water reservoir <b>125</b> and not waste any energy as with other open-ended axial flow pumps.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows one wind turbine <b>160</b> operating one water pump <b>150</b>, the invention is not limited to this configuration. Depending on local conditions, one wind turbine <b>160</b> may be adapted to cause the operation of more than one water pump, for example by using another gearbox configured to drive more than one water pump shafts. In other embodiments, energy from more than one wind turbine may be combined to operate a single large water pump, as the invention is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0090">Operation of the water pumps <b>150</b> may continue independent of the use of water turbines <b>120</b> as mentioned above. The computerized controller <b>130</b> may be used to monitor the performance of the water pumps <b>150</b> and the wind turbines <b>160</b> by detecting the wind strength and detecting water production from the water pumps <b>150</b> but since there is no electricity directly produced between the wind turbines <b>160</b> and the water pumps <b>150</b>, the computerized controller <b>130</b> does not have any further involvement in their operation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0091">In further embodiments, various elements of all the previous embodiments may be combined together to achieve the highest efficacy of the operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a block diagram of energy flow of various types through the system comprising the water reservoir <b>125</b>, water turbines <b>120</b> with associated electrical motors/generators, solar panels <b>140</b>, as well as wind turbines <b>160</b> operating water pumps <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0092">In a broad sense, the invention is an integrator of various energy sources available from an abundant body of water such as an ocean. In a typical example, tidal, wind, and solar energy are used to provide supplemental electrical power. Other sources of energy available in the ocean can also be used with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">One additional source of energy in locations with high and low tides is a wave energy converter. If the wind speed exceeds the speed of a water wave, more energy is transformed into wave energy. Capturing this energy for the purposes of pumping more water into the reservoir or directly producing electricity may be done using one of several approaches utilized by various wave energy converters, namely via point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, or overtopping devices. In addition, wave concentrators may be used in the shape of long floating arms extended at an angle outward of the reservoir wall <b>110</b> and designed to reflect and concentrate ocean waves from a broad area around the wall towards one or more specific wave energy concentrators that may be attached to or incorporated with the water reservoir wall <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">In a broad sense, the water reservoir system of the present invention has a number of important advantages as follows:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0095">provides a consistent output of electrical energy</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0096">provides a missing component to enable broad use of renewable energy sources</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0097">simple to build, operate, and maintain</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0098">works at high efficacy over a broad range of wind speeds</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0099">provides independent operation for water pumping into the water reservoir and electricity generation by the water draining therefrom</li>        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0100">safe in operation</li>        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0101">can be built practically anywhere along the shoreline, does not need special natural conditions</li>        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0102">can be operated as a stand-alone renewable source of electricity or as a part of a broader electrical power grid.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0084" num="0103">The present invention will therefore support increased integration of renewable electric power (mostly solar and wind) and will enable the provision of additional ancillary services to the electric grid that will increase in value as more renewable sources of electricity generation become deployed and connected to the existing electrical power grid.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0104">Importantly, there is no need for large-scale use of batteries for storing excess electrical energy, which are expensive, have poor storage and release efficiency, and have significant environmental risks if damaged.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0105">In addition, by smoothing out peaks and valleys of energy consumption, the system of the invention would provide an instant economic benefit, since an output of consistent electrical power supply can be offered at a higher price than excessive peaks and valleys of electrical power production that can be purchased for the input to the system of the present invention at much lower prices.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0106">It is contemplated that any embodiment discussed in this specification can be implemented with respect to any method of the invention, and vice versa.
