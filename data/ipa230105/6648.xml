An arrangement direction of the electrode fingers is an X direction, an extension direction of the electrode fingers is a Y direction, and a stacking direction of a support substrate and a piezoelectric layer is a Z direction. The X, Y, and Z directions do not necessarily correspond to the X and Y axis directions of a crystal orientation of the piezoelectric layer. If the piezoelectric layer is a rotary Y-cut X propagation substrate, the X direction is the X axis direction of the crystallographic orientation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is provided on a support substrate <b>10</b>.

A boundary layer <b>11</b> is provided between the support substrate <b>10</b> and the temperature compensation film <b>12</b>. An acoustic wave resonator <b>26</b> is provided on the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>. The acoustic wave resonator <b>26</b> has an IDT <b>22</b> and reflectors <b>24</b>. The reflectors <b>24</b> are provided on both sides of the IDT <b>22</b> in the X direction. The IDT <b>22</b> and the reflectors <b>24</b> are formed by a metal film <b>16</b> on the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The IDT <b>22</b> includes a pair of opposed interdigital electrodes <b>20</b>. The interdigital electrode <b>20</b> includes a plurality of electrode fingers <b>18</b> and a bus bar <b>19</b> to which the plurality of electrode fingers <b>18</b> are connected. A region where the electrode fingers <b>18</b> of the pair of interdigital electrodes <b>20</b> intersect when viewed from the X direction is an intersection region <b>25</b>. The length of the intersection region <b>25</b> is an aperture length. In the pair of interdigital electrodes <b>20</b>, the electrode fingers <b>18</b> are alternately provided in at least a part of the intersection region <b>25</b>. The acoustic waves mainly excited by the plurality of electrode fingers <b>18</b> in the intersection region <b>25</b> propagate mainly in the X direction. A pitch between the electrode fingers <b>18</b> in one of the pair of interdigital electrodes <b>20</b> is substantially a wavelength &#x3bb; of the acoustic wave. If a pitch between the plurality of electrode fingers <b>18</b> (the pitch between the centers of the electrode fingers <b>18</b>) is D, the pitch between the electrode fingers <b>18</b> of one interdigital electrode <b>20</b> is twice the pitch D between the electrode fingers <b>18</b>. The reflector <b>24</b> reflects the acoustic waves (surface acoustic waves) excited by the electrode fingers <b>18</b> of the IDT <b>22</b>. This confines the acoustic waves within the intersection region <b>25</b> of the IDT <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is a single-crystal lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) layer or a single-crystal lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>) layer, for example, a rotary Y-cut X propagation lithium tantalate layer or a rotary Y-cut X propagation lithium niobate layer. For the Y-cut X propagation lithium tantalate layer with a rotation of 36&#xb0; or more and 48&#xb0; or less, the SH (Shear Horizontal) wave becomes the acoustic wave in the main mode. A thickness T<b>4</b> of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is equal to or less than the wavelength &#x3bb; of the acoustic wave (that is, twice the pitch D).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The support substrate <b>10</b> is, for example, a sapphire substrate, an alumina substrate, a silicon substrate, a spinel substrate, a crystal substrate, a quartz substrate, or a silicon carbide substrate. The sapphire substrate is a single crystal Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>substrate, and the alumina substrate is a polycrystalline or amorphous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>substrate. The silicon substrate is a single crystal or polycrystalline silicon substrate, the spinel substrate is a polycrystalline or amorphous MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>substrate, and the crystal substrate is a single crystal SiO<sub>2 </sub>substrate. The quartz substrate is a polycrystalline or amorphous SiO<sub>2 </sub>substrate, and the silicon carbide substrate is a polycrystalline or single crystal SiC substrate. A linear expansion coefficient in the X direction of the support substrate <b>10</b> is smaller than the linear expansion coefficient in the X direction of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>. This makes it possible to reduce a frequency-temperature dependence of the acoustic wave resonator.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The temperature compensation film <b>12</b> has a temperature coefficient of an elastic constant having a symbol opposite to that of the temperature coefficient of the elastic constant of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>. For example, the temperature coefficient of the elastic constant of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is negative, and the temperature coefficient of the elastic constant of the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> is positive. The temperature compensation film <b>12</b> is an insulating film containing silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) as a main component, and is, for example, a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) film containing no additive or an additive element such as fluorine, and is, for example, polycrystalline or amorphous. This makes it possible to reduce the temperature coefficient of frequency of the acoustic wave resonator. When the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> is a silicon oxide film, an acoustic velocity of the bulk wave propagating through the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> is slower than the acoustic velocity of the bulk wave propagating through the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order for the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> to have a temperature compensation function, it is required that the energy of the acoustic wave in the main mode exists in the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> to some extent. Although the range in which the energy of the surface acoustic wave is concentrated depends on the type of surface acoustic wave, the energy of the surface acoustic wave is typically concentrated in the range of 2&#x3bb; (&#x3bb; is the wavelength of the acoustic wave) from an upper surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>, and particularly in the range of &#x3bb; from the upper surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>. Therefore, a distance (thickness T<b>2</b>+T<b>4</b>) from a lower surface of the temperature compensation film <b>12</b> to the upper surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is preferably 2&#x3bb; or less, more preferably 1&#x3bb; or less, and further preferably 0.6&#x3bb; or less.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The acoustic velocity of the bulk wave in the boundary layer <b>11</b> is faster than the acoustic velocity of the bulk wave in the temperature compensation film <b>12</b>. The boundary layer <b>11</b> is a polycrystalline film or an amorphous film such as aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon, silicon nitride or silicon carbide. By providing the boundary layer <b>11</b>, the acoustic wave in the main mode can be confined in the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> and the temperature compensation film <b>12</b>, and an unwanted wave such as a bulk wave can be attenuated in the boundary layer <b>11</b>. Therefore, the spurious due to the unwanted wave can be suppressed. A thickness T<b>1</b> of the boundary layer <b>11</b> is, for example, 1&#x3bb; to 5&#x3bb;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The metal film <b>16</b> is, for example, a film containing aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) or molybdenum (Mo) as a main component. An adhesive film such as a titanium (Ti) film or a chromium (Cr) film may be provided between the electrode finger <b>18</b> and the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>. The adhesive film is thinner than the electrode finger <b>18</b>. An insulating film thinner than the electrode finger <b>18</b> may be provided so as to cover the electrode finger <b>18</b>. The insulating film functions as a protective film.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">(High Frequency Spurious)</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">High frequency spurious will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating acoustic wave resonators R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>.

In the acoustic wave resonator R<b>2</b>, since the linear expansion coefficient of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is large, the temperature coefficient of frequency at the resonance frequency or the like is large. In the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>, since the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is bonded on the support substrate <b>10</b> having a linear expansion coefficient smaller than that of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b>, the temperature coefficient of frequency is small.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, in the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b> in which the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is bonded on the support substrate <b>10</b>, a spurious response Sp<b>0</b> is observed at a frequency higher than the antiresonance frequency fa. The spurious response Sp<b>0</b> is observed over a wide frequency range. The spurious response Sp<b>0</b> is generated because the unwanted waves such as bulk waves are confined in the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> together with the acoustic waves in the main mode.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, in the acoustic wave resonator R<b>1</b> in which the thickness T<b>4</b> of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is equal to or less than the wavelength &#x3bb; of the acoustic wave, a difference between the resonance frequency fr and the antiresonance frequency fa is larger than that of the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>. This indicates that the acoustic wave resonator R<b>1</b> has a larger electromechanical coupling coefficient than the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>. Further, the resonance frequency fr and the antiresonance frequency fa are steeper than those of the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>. This indicates that the acoustic wave resonator R<b>1</b> has a higher Q value than the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>. The spurious response Sp is observed at frequencies in the frequency range narrower than that of the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>. The magnitude of the spurious response Sp is larger than the spurious response Sp<b>0</b> of the acoustic wave resonator R<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, when the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is bonded onto the support substrate <b>10</b>, the temperature coefficient of frequency is small, but the spurious responses Sp<b>0</b> and Sp occur at frequencies higher than the antiresonance frequency fa. When the thickness T<b>4</b> of the piezoelectric layer <b>14</b> is set to the wavelength &#x3bb; or less of the acoustic wave as in the acoustic wave resonator R<b>1</b>, the Q value and the electromechanical coupling coefficient become large.

An attenuation region on a low frequency side of the pass band Pass is formed by a resonance frequency frp of the parallel resonator P, and an attenuation region on a high frequency side of the pass band Pass is formed by an antiresonance frequency fas of the series resonator S. The spurious response Sp due to the high frequency spurious response occurs in the vicinity of 3500 MHz to 4200 MHz. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref>, the spurious response Sp of the filter F is formed at frequencies corresponding to the spurious response of the series resonator S and the parallel resonator P.
