id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A prosthetic heart valve can include an outer support assembly, an inner valve assembly, which define between them an annular space, and a pocket closure that bounds the annular space to form a pocket in which thrombus can be formed and retained. Alternatively, or additionally, the outer support assembly and the inner valve assembly can be coupled at the ventricle ends of the outer support assembly and the inner valve assembly, with the outer support assembly being relatively more compliant in hoop compression in a central, annulus portion than at the ventricle end, so that the prosthetic valve can seat securely in the annulus while imposing minimal loads on the inner valve assembly that could degrade the performance of the valve leaflets.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

Accordingly, there is still a need for a prosthetic heart valve that can address some or all of these problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A prosthetic heart valve can include an outer support assembly, an inner valve assembly, which define between them an annular space, and a pocket closure that bounds the annular space to form a pocket in which thrombus can be formed and retained. A prosthetic heart valve can alternatively, or additionally, include an outer support assembly and an inner valve assembly, coupled at the ventricle ends of the outer support assembly and the inner valve assembly, with the outer support assembly being relatively more compliant in hoop compression in a central, annulus portion than at the ventricle end, so that the prosthetic valve can seat securely in the annulus while imposing minimal loads on the inner valve assembly that could degrade the performance of the valve leaflets.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. Prosthetic heart valve <b>100</b> is designed to replace a damaged or diseased native heart valve such as a mitral valve. Valve <b>100</b> includes an outer frame assembly <b>110</b> and an inner valve assembly <b>140</b> coupled to the outer frame assembly.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although not separately shown in the schematic illustration of outer frame assembly <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, outer fame assembly <b>110</b> may be formed of an outer frame <b>120</b>, covered on all or a portion of its outer face with an outer covering <b>130</b>, and covered on all or a portion of its inner face by an inner covering <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Outer frame <b>120</b> can provide several functions for prosthetic heart valve <b>100</b>, including serving as the primary structure, as anchoring mechanism and/or an attachment point for a separate anchoring mechanism to anchor the valve to the native heart valve apparatus, a support to carry inner valve assembly <b>140</b>, and/or a seal to inhibit paravalvular leakage between prosthetic heart valve <b>100</b> and the native heart valve apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Outer frame <b>120</b> is preferably formed so that it can be deformed (compressed and/or expanded) and, when released, return to its original (undeformed) shape. To achieve this, outer frame <b>120</b> is preferably formed of materials, such as metals or plastics, that have shape memory properties. With regards to metals, Nitinol&#xae; has been found to be especially useful since it can be processed to be austenitic, martensitic or super elastic. Other shape memory alloys, such as Cu&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Ni alloys, and Cu&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Ni alloys, may be used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Outer frame <b>120</b> is preferably formed from a laser cut, thin-walled tube of Nitinol&#xae;. The laser cuts form regular cutouts in the thin Nitinol&#xae; tube. The tube can be expanded radially, placed on a mold or mandrel of the desired shape, heated to the martensitic temperature, and quenched. The treatment of the frame in this manner will form an open lattice frame structure, and may have a flared end or cuff at the atrium end portion <b>126</b> of outer frame <b>120</b>. Outer frame <b>120</b> thus has shape memory properties and will readily revert to the memory shape at the calibrated temperature. Alternatively, outer frame <b>120</b> may be constructed from braided wire or other suitable material.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Inner valve assembly <b>140</b> is shown schematically in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>. Inner valve assembly <b>140</b> can include an inner frame <b>150</b>, an outer covering <b>160</b>, and leaflets <b>170</b>. In the simplified form shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, inner frame <b>150</b> includes six axial posts or frame members that support outer covering <b>160</b> and leaflets <b>170</b>. Leaflets <b>170</b> are attached along three of the posts, shown as commissure posts <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, and outer covering <b>160</b> is attached to the other three posts, <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, and optionally to commissure posts <b>152</b>. In the simplified form illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each of outer covering <b>160</b> and leaflets <b>170</b> are formed of approximately rectangular sheets of material, which are joined together at their upper, or atrium end. The lower, ventricle end of outer covering <b>160</b> may be joined to inner covering <b>132</b> of outer frame assembly <b>110</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), and the lower, ventricle end of leaflets <b>170</b> may form free edges, though coupled to the lower ends of commissure posts <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, leaflets <b>170</b> are movable between an open configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and a closed configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) in which the leaflets coapt, or meet in sealing abutment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At the lower, or ventricle end, leaflets <b>170</b> may have a smaller perimeter than outer covering <b>160</b>. Thus, the free lower edges of the leaflets, between commissure posts <b>152</b> (each portion of leaflets <b>170</b> between adjacent commissure posts being referred to as a &#x201c;belly&#x201d; of leaflets <b>170</b>) are spaced radially from the lower edge of outer covering <b>160</b>. This radial spacing facilitates movement of the leaflets from the open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> to the closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, as the counter flow of blood from the ventricle to the atrium during systole can catch the free edges of the bellies and push the leaflets closed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Outer covering <b>130</b> and inner covering <b>132</b> of outer frame <b>120</b>, outer covering <b>160</b> and leaflets <b>170</b> may be formed of any suitable material, or combination of materials. In some embodiments, the tissue is optionally a biological tissue, such as a chemically stabilized tissue from a heart valve of an animal, such as a pig, or pericardial tissue of an animal, such as cow (bovine pericardium) or sheep (ovine pericardium) or pig (porcine pericardium) or horse (equine pericardium). Preferably, the tissue is bovine pericardial tissue. Examples of suitable tissue include that used in the products Duraguard&#xae;, Peri-Guard&#xae;, and Vascu-Guard&#xae;, all products currently used in surgical procedures, and which are marketed as being harvested generally from cattle less than 30 months old. Alternatively, valve leaflets <b>170</b> may optionally be made from pericardial tissue or small intestine submucosal tissue.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Synthetic materials, such as polyurethane or polytetrafluoroethylene, may also be used for valve leaflets <b>170</b>. Where a thin, durable synthetic material is contemplated, e.g. for outer covering <b>130</b> or inner cover <b>132</b>, synthetic polymer materials such expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester may optionally be used. Other suitable materials may optionally include thermoplastic polycarbonate urethane, polyether urethane, segmented polyether urethane, silicone polyether urethane, silicone-polycarbonate urethane, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Additional biocompatible polymers may optionally include polyolefins, elastomers, polyethylene-glycols, polyethersulphones, polysulphones, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylchlorides, other fluoropolymers, silicone polyesters, siloxane polymers and/or oligomers, and/or polylactones, and block co-polymers using the same.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, valve leaflets <b>170</b> may optionally have a surface that has been treated with (or reacted with) an anti-coagulant, such as, without limitation, immobilized heparin. Such currently available heparinized polymers are known and available to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b>A</figref>, inner valve assembly <b>140</b> may be substantially cylindrical, and outer frame assembly <b>110</b> may be tapered, extending from a smaller diameter (slightly larger than the outer diameter of inner valve assembly <b>140</b>) at a lower, ventricle portion <b>112</b> (where it is coupled to inner valve assembly <b>140</b>) to a larger diameter, atrium portion <b>116</b>, with an intermediate diameter, annulus portion <b>114</b> between the atrium and ventricle portions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A tapered annular space or pocket <b>185</b> is thus formed between the outer surface of inner valve assembly <b>140</b> and the inner surface of outer frame assembly <b>110</b>, open to the atrium end of valve assembly <b>100</b>. When valve assembly <b>100</b> is disposed in the annulus of a native heart valve, blood from the atrium can move in and out of pocket <b>185</b>. The blood can clot, forming thrombus, and the thrombus can be washed out by the flow of blood during the cyclic pumping of the heart, which is undesirable. To inhibit such washout of thrombus, and to enhance clotting, ingrowth of tissue into the surfaces of valve <b>100</b>, and produce other benefits, the pocket can be covered, or enclosed, by a pocket closure <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Pocket closure <b>180</b> can be formed at least in part of any suitable material that is sufficiently porous to allow blood, including particularly red blood cells, to enter pocket <b>185</b>, but is not so porous as to allow undesirably large thrombi to leave the pocket <b>185</b>, or to allow washout of thrombus formed in the pocket <b>185</b>. For example, pocket closure <b>180</b> may be formed at least in part from a woven or knit polyester fabric with apertures less than 160&#x3bc;, and preferably between 90&#x3bc; and 120&#x3bc;. It is not necessary for the entirety of pocket closure <b>180</b> to be formed of the same material, with the same porosity. For example, some portions of pocket closure <b>180</b> may be formed of a less porous, or blood impermeable, material and other portions formed of material of the porosity range noted above. It is also contemplated that a portion of the outer frame assembly <b>110</b> or the inner valve assembly <b>140</b> may be formed with an aperture that communicates with pocket <b>180</b>, covered by a closure formed of material having the desired porosity, thus providing another path by which blood may enter, but thrombi are prevented from leaving, atrial pocket <b>185</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The outer surface of inner valve assembly <b>110</b>, and/or the inner surface of outer frame assembly <b>140</b>, need not be circular in cross-section as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, but may be of non-constant radius at a given location along the central axis of valve <b>100</b>. Thus, pocket <b>185</b> may not be of constant cross-section, and may not be continuous, but rather may be formed in two or more fluidically isolated, partially annular volumes. Similarly, pocket closure <b>180</b> need not be shaped as a ring with constant width as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, but rather than be a continues ring of varying with, a more complicated continuous shape, or may be formed in multiple, discrete sections.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Pocket closure <b>180</b> serves to trap and/or slow the flow of blood within pocket <b>185</b>, reducing hemodynamic washout and increasing formation of thrombus in pocket <b>185</b>. It also promotes active in-growth of native tissue into the several coverings of prosthetic heart valve <b>100</b>, further stabilizing valve <b>100</b> in the native heart valve. The material forming the outer covering of inner valve assembly <b>140</b> can also be hardened or stiffened, providing better support for leaflets <b>170</b>. Also, a mass of thrombus filling pocket <b>185</b> can serve as potting for inner valve assembly <b>140</b>, further stabilizing the valve assembly. Greater stability for inner valve assembly <b>140</b> can provide more reliable coaption of valve leaflets <b>170</b>, and thus more effective performance. The mass of thrombus can also stabilize the outer frame assembly <b>110</b> after it has been installed in, and flexibly conformed to, the native valve apparatus. This can provide a more effective seal between prosthetic heart valve <b>100</b> and the native valve apparatus, and reduce perivalvular leakage.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One possible implementation of the prosthetic heart valve shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> is prosthetic heart valve <b>200</b>, shown in top view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Prosthetic heart valve <b>200</b> includes an outer frame assembly <b>210</b> and an inner valve assembly <b>240</b> coupled to the outer frame assembly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The outer frame assembly <b>210</b> includes an outer frame <b>220</b>, covered on all or a portion of its outer face with an outer covering <b>230</b> (not visible), and covered on all or a portion of its inner face by an inner covering <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The inner valve assembly <b>240</b> includes an inner frame <b>250</b>, an outer covering <b>260</b> (not visible), and leaflets <b>270</b>. Inner frame <b>250</b> includes six axial posts or frame members that support outer covering <b>260</b> and leaflets <b>270</b>. The inner valve assembly <b>240</b> may be substantially cylindrical, and outer frame assembly <b>210</b> may be tapered, extending from a smaller diameter (slightly larger than the outer diameter of inner valve assembly <b>240</b>) at a lower, ventricle portion (where it is coupled to inner valve assembly <b>240</b>) to a larger diameter, atrium portion, with an intermediate diameter, annulus portion between the atrium and ventricle portions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A tapered annular space or pocket <b>285</b> (e.g., atrial thrombogenic sealing pocket) is thus formed between the outer surface of inner valve assembly <b>240</b> and the inner surface of outer frame assembly <b>210</b>, open to the atrium end of valve assembly <b>200</b>. The pocket closure <b>280</b> can, for example, be formed from a circular piece of wire, or halo, with a permeable mesh fabric or tissue, that is sewn and thereby connected to the inner frame <b>250</b> and/or to the leaflets <b>170</b>. The inner frame <b>250</b> has an inner wireframe structure (e.g., made of Nitinol wire) that supports the leaflets <b>270</b> sewn to the inner frame <b>250</b> and functions as a valve. The inner frame <b>250</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes three U-shaped wire components joined at their opened ends to form junctions. Leaflets <b>270</b> are sewn to these components to form articulating leaflets <b>170</b> creating and functioning as a prosthetic valve (e.g., prosthetic tricuspid valve; prosthetic mitral valve; prosthetic aortic valve, etc.).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Moreover, the inner frame <b>250</b> has (tether) attachment apertures <b>211</b> (not shown), for attaching tether assembly <b>290</b> (not shown). Tether assembly <b>290</b> is connected to epicardial securing pad <b>254</b> (not shown).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In operation, the inner valve assembly <b>240</b> is disposed within and secured within the outer frame assembly <b>210</b>. Outer frame assembly <b>210</b> may also have in various embodiments an outer stent tissue material. Outer frame assembly <b>210</b> includes an articulating collar <b>246</b> which has a collar cover <b>248</b>. Articulating collar <b>246</b> is specifically shaped to solve leakage issues arising from native structures. In particular, collar <b>246</b> is composed of an A2 segment <b>247</b>, a P2 segment <b>249</b>, and two commissural segments, the A1-P1 segment <b>251</b>, and the A3-P3 segment <b>253</b>. The collar <b>246</b> may also have in preferred embodiments a shortened or flattened or D-shaped section <b>262</b> of the A2 segment in order to accommodate and solve left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction issues.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation, the prosthetic heart valve <b>200</b> may be deployed (e.g., as a prosthetic mitral valve) using catheter delivery techniques. The prosthetic heart valve <b>200</b> is compressed within a narrow catheter and delivered to the annular region of the native valve (e.g., the left atrium) with a pre-attached tether assembly <b>290</b>. There, the valve <b>200</b> is pushed out of the catheter where it springs open into its pre-formed functional shape without the need for manual expansion (e.g., manual expansion using an inner balloon catheter). When the valve <b>200</b> is pulled into place, the outer frame assembly <b>210</b> is seated in the native mitral annulus, leaving the articulating collar <b>246</b> to engage the atrial floor and prevent pull-thru (where the valve <b>200</b> is pulled into the ventricle). In such embodiments, it is not necessary to cut-away the native leaflets, as has been taught in prior prosthetic efforts. Instead, the native leaflets can be used to provide a tensioning and/or sealing function around the outer frame assembly <b>210</b>. It is advantageous for the valve <b>200</b> to be asymmetrically deployed in order to address LVOT problems where non-accommodating prosthetic valves push against the A2 anterior segment of the valve (e.g., mitral valve) and close blood flow through the aorta, which anatomically sits immediately behind the A2 segment of the mitral annulus. Thus, D-shaped section <b>262</b> is deployed substantially immediately adjacent/contacting the A2 segment since the flattened D-shaped section <b>262</b> is structurally smaller and has a more vertical profile (closer to paralleling the longitudinal axis of the outer frame assembly <b>212</b>) and thereby provides less pressure on the A2 segment. Once the valve <b>200</b> is properly seated, tether assembly <b>290</b> may be extended out through the apical region of the left ventricle and secured using an epicardial pad <b>254</b> or similar suture-locking attachment mechanism (not shown).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternate embodiment, the tether assembly <b>290</b> is on the outer frame assembly <b>210</b>, which would then have (tether) attachment apertures <b>213</b> for attaching tether assembly <b>290</b> to epicardial securing pad <b>254</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top, or atrial, view of another embodiment of a prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>, illustrated without pocket closure <b>380</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the top of the junction tip <b>302</b> of the three U-shaped wire components of inner frame <b>350</b> joined at their opened ends to form junctions <b>302</b>. Leaflets <b>370</b> are sewn to these components to form articulating leaflets <b>370</b> creating and functioning as a prosthetic valve (e.g., prosthetic tricuspid valve, prosthetic mitral valve, prosthetic aortic valve, etc.).

The inner valve assembly <b>440</b> includes the leaflets <b>470</b>. The leaflets <b>470</b> include articulating leaflets that define a valve function. The leaflets <b>470</b> are sewn to the inner frame <b>450</b>. The inner frame <b>450</b> also has (tether) attachment apertures <b>411</b> for attaching tether assembly <b>490</b>.

The valve <b>400</b> is compressed within a narrow catheter and delivered to the annular region of the native valve (e.g., the left atrium) with a pre-attached tether assembly <b>490</b>. There, the valve <b>400</b> is pushed out of the catheter where it springs open into its pre-formed functional shape without the need for manual expansion (e.g., manual expansion using an inner balloon catheter). When the valve <b>400</b> is pulled into place, the outer frame assembly <b>410</b> is seated in the native annulus (e.g., native mitral annulus), leaving the articulating collar <b>446</b> to engage the atrial floor and prevent pull-thru (where the valve is pulled into the ventricle). In such embodiments, it is not necessary to cut-away the native leaflets, as has been taught in prior prosthetic efforts. Instead, the native leaflets can be used to provide a tensioning and/or sealing function around the valve <b>400</b> (e.g., around the outer frame assembly <b>410</b>). It is advantageous for the valve <b>400</b> to be asymmetrically deployed in order to address LVOT problems where non-accommodating prosthetic valves push against the A2 anterior segment of the valve (e.g., the mitral valve) and close blood flow through the aorta, which anatomically sits immediately behind the A2 segment of the annulus (e.g., mitral annulus).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, D-shaped section <b>462</b> is deployed substantially immediately adjacent/contacting the A2 segment since the flattened D-shaped section <b>462</b> is structurally smaller and has a more vertical profile (closer to paralleling the longitudinal axis of the outer frame assembly <b>410</b>) and thereby provides less pressure on the A2 segment. Once the valve <b>400</b> is properly seated, tether assembly <b>490</b> may be extended out through the apical region of the left ventricle and secured using an epicardial pad <b>454</b> or similar suture-locking attachment mechanism.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref> are front, bottom, and top views, respectively, of a prosthetic heart valve <b>500</b> according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Prosthetic heart valve <b>500</b> is designed to replace a damaged or diseased native heart valve such as a mitral valve.

Thus, disposing halo <b>655</b> above the native valve annulus can provide for and/or promote complete coaptation.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Halo <b>655</b> can be formed from any suitable method and material. For example, in some embodiments, halo <b>655</b> can be formed from a substantially circular piece of wire. In such embodiments, halo <b>655</b> can be coupled to (e.g., sewn) to inner frame <b>650</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Outer covering <b>630</b> and inner covering <b>632</b> of outer frame <b>620</b>, outer covering <b>660</b> and leaflets <b>670</b> may be formed of any suitable material, or combination of materials, such as those discussed above in connection with other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, inner valve assembly <b>640</b> may be substantially cylindrical, and outer frame assembly <b>610</b> may be tapered, extending from a smaller diameter (slightly larger than the outer diameter of inner valve assembly <b>640</b>) at a lower, ventricle portion <b>612</b> (where it is coupled to inner valve assembly <b>640</b>) to a larger diameter, atrium portion <b>616</b>, with an intermediate diameter, annulus portion <b>614</b> between the atrium and ventricle portions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the outer surface of inner valve assembly <b>610</b>, and/or the inner surface of outer frame assembly <b>640</b>, need not by circular in cross-section as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, but may be of non-constant radius at a given location along the central axis of valve <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The atrial halo <b>655</b> functions by extending the inner frame of an inner valve assembly above the plane of atrial floor in an improved prosthetic heart valve that includes an inner frame that holds the leaflets and which is disposed within an outer frame for reducing or preventing leaking when the prosthetic heart valve is disposed within a heart valve (e.g., mitral valve, tricuspid valve).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A benefit to having leaflets within a raised leaflet silo or cylinder (e.g., halo <b>650</b>) is improved blood flow and leaflet closure. It has been observed that where the leaflet cylinder is at the atrial floor, leaflet coaptation is incomplete and can result in hemodynamic leakage.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Accordingly, by providing an atrial halo or ring structure that is raised above the plane of the native annulus or atrial floor, complete leaflet coaptation is encouraged. During ventricular contraction or systole, the blood is ejected towards aortic valve to exit the heart but is also ejected towards the prosthetic mitral valve, which needs to remain closed during systole. Retrograde blood hitting the prosthetic valve leaflets cause the leaflets to close, preventing regurgitation into the left atrium. During diastole or ventricular filling, the blood needs to flow from the atrium into the ventricle without obstruction. However, when prosthetic leaflets are not properly placed or properly aligned, the leaflets can obstruct efficient filling of the ventricle or cause uneven ventricular output.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is a top-view of a prosthetic heart valve <b>700</b> according to an embodiment that is one possible implementation of the prosthetic heart valve shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>.

When the valve <b>700</b> is pushed and/or pulled into place, the outer frame assembly <b>710</b> is seated in the native valve annulus (e.g., native mitral annulus), leaving the articulating collar <b>746</b> to engage the atrial floor and prevent pull-through (where the valve is pulled into the ventricle). In such embodiments, it is not necessary to cut-away the native leaflets, as has been taught in prior prosthetic efforts.

Thus, D-shaped section <b>762</b> is deployed substantially immediately adjacent/contacting the A2 segment since the flattened D-shaped section <b>762</b> is structurally smaller and has a more vertical profile (closer to paralleling the longitudinal axis of the outer stent) and thereby provides less pressure on the A2 segment.

The structural features are discussed below with reference to prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b>, illustrated schematically in perspective and side views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown, the outer frame <b>820</b> has an atrium portion <b>826</b>, a ventricle portion <b>822</b>, and an annulus portion <b>824</b> disposed between the atrium portion <b>826</b> and the ventricle portion <b>822</b>. The inner frame <b>850</b> of the inner valve assembly <b>840</b> has a first end and a second end. The inner valve assembly <b>840</b> can be coupled to the outer frame <b>820</b> by a connection between the first end of the inner frame <b>850</b> and the ventricle portion <b>812</b> of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b>. The inner frame assembly <b>840</b> can extend from the connection towards the atrium portion <b>816</b> of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b>. The inner frame assembly <b>840</b> and the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> can diverge from the connection towards the atrium portion <b>816</b> of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b>. The annulus portion <b>814</b> of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> can be spaced radially from the inner valve assembly <b>840</b> and radially inwardly deflectable towards the inner valve assembly <b>840</b> to accommodate a natural heart valve annulus in the annulus portion <b>814</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The outer frame assembly <b>810</b> can be shaped and sized in any suitable manner to facilitate a proper fit into a native heart valve. For example, as shown, the outer frame <b>820</b> can be shaped and sized to resemble, at least in part, an hourglass shape. Specifically, the annulus portion <b>814</b> of outer frame assembly <b>810</b> varies from an intermediate diameter (or perimeter) near ventricle portion <b>812</b> to a smaller diameter (or perimeter) near the middle of annulus portion <b>814</b>, to a larger diameter (or perimeter) near atrium portion <b>816</b>. Thus, annulus portion <b>814</b> has an hourglass shape. Ventricle portion <b>812</b> has a maximum diameter larger than a maximum diameter of annulus portion <b>814</b>. The ventricle portion has a minimum diameter smaller than a minimum diameter of the annulus portion <b>814</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The diameters and/or perimeters for each portion of the outer frame <b>820</b> can be selected based on the size and/or shape of a native heart valve into which prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b> is to be implanted. For example, the minimum diameter of the annulus portion <b>824</b> of the outer frame <b>820</b> can be smaller than that of the native valve annulus. Thus, in such a configuration, the diameters of the ventricle portion <b>822</b>, annulus portion <b>824</b>, and atrium portion <b>826</b> can collectively promote a suitable fit (e.g., a snug, secure fit) of the prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b> in a native heart valve. In this manner, the outer frame <b>820</b> can be configured to optimize securement and sealing between the prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b> (particularly outer frame assembly <b>810</b>) and a native valve annulus of a native heart valve. Thus, such a configuration minimizes the likelihood of paravalvular leaks.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although the outer frame <b>820</b> is shown to have a circular cross-section, in some embodiments, the outer frame <b>820</b> can by any suitable shape or size. For example, in some embodiments, the outer frame <b>820</b> can have a D-shape cross-section. In this manner, the outer frame <b>820</b> can have a shape configured to correspond to (e.g., mate with) a native heart valve annulus.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In addition to, or instead of, outer frame <b>820</b> and/or outer frame assembly <b>810</b> with the hourglass shape described above, valve <b>800</b>, or in some instances, outer frame <b>820</b> and/or outer frame assembly <b>810</b>, in particular, can be formed to provide stiffness, such as resistance to hoop compression, that is varied spatially, i.e., axially and/or circumferentially.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this manner, a suitable stiffness profile can be arranged such that the valve <b>800</b> promotes a desirable shape and sealing region when disposed in a native heart valve, thus minimizing the likelihood of paravalvular leaks and undesired movement of the valve. Similarly stated, valve <b>800</b> can be configured to have a stiffness profile suitable to cause desirable deformation of the native heart valve annulus (i.e., the sealing region), and thus, proper implantation of valve <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A desired stiffness profile of prosthetic valve <b>800</b> can be achieved by varying properties, characteristics, and/or the arrangement of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> and the inner valve assembly <b>840</b>. For example, the outer frame <b>820</b> and/or the inner frame <b>850</b> can contain portions of varying material states. For example, a first portion of outer frame <b>820</b> can be in an elastic state, while a second portion of outer frame <b>820</b> is in a super-elastic state. Similarly, for example, portions of the outer frame <b>820</b> and/or the inner frame <b>850</b> can be in an austenitic state and/or a martensitic state (e.g., a stress induced martensitic state). In this manner, portions of valve <b>800</b> can be configured to suitably mate with a native valve annulus, thus improving sealing and limiting paravalvular leaks.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> and/or inner valve assembly <b>840</b> can have varying widths, thicknesses, shapes (e.g., longitudinal shape), angles (e.g., angle of attachment between inner valve assembly <b>840</b> and outer frame assembly <b>810</b>), and the like. In some embodiments, the outer covering <b>830</b>, inner covering <b>832</b>, outer covering <b>860</b>, and/or pocket closure <b>880</b> can be configured to determine, at least in part, the stiffness profile and/or shape of valve <b>800</b> (e.g., based on sewing pattern).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>B, and <b>29</b>C and <b>29</b>D</figref> illustrate axial and circumferential stiffness profiles, respectively, of prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>) according to an embodiment. The stiffness of heart valve <b>800</b> can vary axially and/or circumferentially in any suitable manner. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref> represents an axial stiffness profile of valve <b>800</b>. Specifically, as shown, the Z-axis represents an axial location on valve <b>800</b> (e.g., a location of the stiffness value). The S-axis represents a range of stiffness (or range of stiffness values), increasing from left (starting at origin O) to right.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further to this example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, locations near the ventricle portion <b>822</b> (e.g., indicated as B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>) of the outer frame <b>822</b> can have a larger stiffness value, locations near the annulus portion <b>824</b> of the outer frame <b>820</b> can have a smaller stiffness value relative to the ventricle portion <b>822</b> (e.g., to facilitate cooperation with the native valve annulus), and locations near the atrium portion <b>826</b> (e.g., indicated as A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>) of the outer frame <b>820</b> can have a smaller, the same, or larger stiffness value (illustrated by the dotted line) than the stiffness value near the annulus portion <b>824</b>. In this manner, the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> can be relatively more compliant in hoop compression in a central, annulus portion <b>814</b>, than at the ventricle portion <b>812</b>. Thus, in use, the prosthetic valve <b>800</b> can seat securely in the annulus of the native heart valve while imposing minimal loads on the inner valve assembly <b>840</b> that could degrade the performance of the valve leaflets <b>870</b>. Although, for ease of illustration, the stiffness profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref> includes linear portions, in some embodiments, the stiffness profile can include non-linear portions instead of or in addition to the linear portions as shown.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Similarly, the stiffness of heart valve <b>800</b>, or portions of heart valve <b>800</b>, can have varying degrees of stiffness circumferentially, as illustrated by the stiffness profiles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>C and <b>29</b></figref> D. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>C</figref> illustrates a circumferential stiffness profile at axial location A (as shown by reference &#x2018;A&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>). Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>D</figref> illustrates a circumferential stiffness profile at axial location B (as shown by reference &#x2018;B&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>). As the profile extends radially from the origin (indicated as &#x2018;O&#x2019;), the stiffness value increases.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>C</figref>, the stiffness at S<b>1</b> (90 degrees) is greater than the stiffness at S<b>2</b> (270 degrees). Further to this example, in some embodiments, the circumferential portion from zero to 180 degrees can represent a relatively flat portion of an outer frame <b>820</b> of the outer frame assembly <b>810</b> having a D-shape configuration, and 180 to 360 degrees can represent a relatively curved portion of the outer frame <b>820</b> having the D-shape configuration.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In a similar fashion, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>D</figref> illustrates a circumferential stiffness profile at axial location B (as shown by reference &#x2018;B&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>). As shown, axial location B has a different stiffness profile than axial location A. Such variability in design, as discussed above, can provide for advantageous customization of heart valve <b>800</b>, and cooperation of heart valve <b>800</b> with a native heart valve. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>D</figref> illustrates the stiffness at one side of valve <b>800</b> being be greater than a stiffness at another side of the valve <b>800</b>. In this manner, in some instances, a portion of valve <b>800</b> that will experience greater forces from the native heart valve annulus can have a smaller stiffness value (e.g., more compliant) than a portion of the valve <b>800</b> that will experience smaller or fewer forces, thus optimizing the cooperation of the prosthetic heart valve <b>800</b> with the native heart (particularly the native heart valve annular region).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation, and as such, various changes in form and/or detail may be made.
