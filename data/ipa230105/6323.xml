For example, in quantum computation, superconducting resonators have been used to detect the state of qubits.

In both cases, many resonators (used as detectors or in detectors) can be coupled to a common transmission line and integrated through frequency domain multiplexing. Frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) is a technique in which a communication bandwidth is divided into a number of non-overlapping sub-bands, each sub-band used to carry a separate signal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Using FMR technology, superconducting resonators of different resonant frequencies can be used for readout of multiple qubits.

A shortcoming of this approach can be that it may be necessary to provide an in-situ calibration of each resonator's coupling to the transmission line, by sweeping through power levels, and looking for an onset of resonator nonlinearity. An in-situ calibration can be time-consuming, and it may be necessary for the system to include a generator with a wider dynamic range.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0126">The value of Q<sub>EXT </sub>can vary along the length of a transmission line, and can depend on a number of factors including the number of superconducting resonators coupled to the transmission line, the values of the coupling capacitances, and the spacing between superconducting resonators.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0127">Another approach for mitigating the effect of an impedance change on the strength of coupling is to spread out the additional coupling capacitance along the transmission line to minimize, or at least reduce, the additional coupling capacitance per unit length. One example implementation is to use &#x3bb;/4 distributed-element resonators capacitively coupled to the transmission line over a distance of a few hundred microns.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0128">In one scenario, distributed-element coupling can be implemented using a high-quality silicon substrate for a capacitor dielectric. In the case of a multi-layer fabrication stack, where circuit elements are overlaid by a dielectric such as silicon dioxide, distributed-element coupling can be lossy.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0129">A distributed readout resonator design can have a larger footprint than a lumped-element design.

A desire for a smaller footprint can drive a lumped-element implementation of shunt-coupled resonators strongly-coupled to a transmission in a multi-layer stack.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0130">An interaction between a transmission line and a resonator, as described above, can be more important for more strongly-coupled resonators. While weaker coupling allows more resonators to be packed into a given bandwidth, and weaker coupling may be sufficient for slower readout times, commercial applications where readout speed is important (such as commercial quantum computing applications) may advantageously employ stronger coupling.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0131">Higher readout speed may also be achieved by including additional resonators. A data rate of N weakly-coupled resonators, each with linewidth W, can be at least similar to a data rate of a strongly-coupled resonator with line width N&#xd7;W. The N weakly-coupled resonators may advantageously spatially distribute a perturbation to the transmission line.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0132">Coupling strength may advantageously be selected based at least in part on topological considerations and/or to at least attempt to match clock domains. For example, it can be advantageous to end each shift register with a detector which makes the number of resonators equal to twice the sum of the number of rows and the number of columns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example topology.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0133">The coupling of a resonator to a transmission depends at least in part on the linewidth of a resonator. The linewidth can be determined by dividing the available bandwidth by the linewidth and by an additional factor selected to provide enough room between resonances in the frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0134">In one example implementation, the available bandwidth is 2.5 GHz. In one example implementation, the additional factor is 4.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0135">A shift register can operate at a speed set by driving electronics. It can be advantageous for the detectors to match or exceed the speed set by the driving electronics. If, for example, the detector is faster than the shift register, it can be an inefficient use of available bandwidth. In an example implementation, a shift register delivers data every 100 ns, and resonances are copuled to provide a response time of 20 ns. Coupling them twice as strongly may reduce a full duty cycle time from 120 ns to 110 ns. The reduction in full duty cycle time is only a marginal improvement yet requires twice the FMRR bandwidth. At least for this reason, it can be advantageous for the detector to match the shift register speed.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0136">As described above, proximity of resonators to a superconducting transmission line can cause an undesirable level of ripple when measured in transmission, and can have an undesirable variation in the coupling strength of resonators as a function of the position of the resonators along the transmission line. The impact can include a limit on the number of usable resonators in a frequency-multiplexed resonant readout system, with a concomitant slowdown in readout speed and less redundancy. Distributed-element approaches typically rely on a single metal-layer fabrication stack and use a large footprint.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0137">The systems and methods described in the present application support a smaller, and more flexible footprint, and a multi-layer fab stack. In one approach, at least one inductance is introduced into the center line of the transmission line. The inductance can modify a characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

Each lumped-element inductor can be selected to compensate for a local change in impedance caused by a respective coupled resonator.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0139">In some implementations, it can be beneficial to have a pair of inductors introduced into the center line of the transmission line, one on each side of the resonator, and such that the transmission line appears to have an impedance of 50 &#x3a9; when seen from upstream and downstream of the resonator.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0140">A configuration of one or more inductances added to the transmission line can depend on a position of the resonator along the transmission line and a spacing of resonators in an array of superconducting resonators. A value of the one or more inductances can be selected to compensate for a local perturbation to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. The arrangement of inductances can be symmetric or asymmetric.

The effect of a compensating inductance for a superconducting resonator on the characteristic impedance of the transmission line can vary with a position of the superconducting resonator along the length of the transmission line e.g. whether the superconducting resonator is close to one end of the transmission line or near the middle of the transmission line. For example, a symmetric configuration of a pair of inductances may provide a preferred level of compensation in the middle of a transmission line, and an asymmetric configuration of inductances may provide a preferred level of compensation near an end of the transmission line.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0142">Any suitable method can be used to estimate the preferred values and arrangement of compensating inductances for an array of superconducting resonators.
