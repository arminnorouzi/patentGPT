id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a system for detecting an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand utilizing signal transduction of a receptor protein with a purinergic receptor ligand used as a ligand, and a genetically modified non-human animal having the system introduced thereinto. Besides, it relates to monitoring of a disease condition, a compound evaluation method and the like using a genetically modified non-human animal into which a system for detecting an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand has been introduced.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Purinergic receptors are a group of cell surface receptors using nucleotides such as adenosine and ATP as ligands. It has been reported that purinergic receptors are involved in various diseases including immune disorder, and purinergic receptor inhibitors and purinergic receptor agonists targeting purinergic receptors have been developed. As purinergic receptor ligands, nucleotides such as ATP, adenosine and metabolites thereof are known, and it has been reported that signaling pathways formed by these purinergic receptor ligands and purinergic receptors are involved in various physiological phenomena such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, a sense of pain, a sense of taste, and an inflammatory reaction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The purinergic receptor ligands such as ATP and adenosine function as signal transducers in a living body, and hence attempts have been made to verify their behaviors such as production and decomposition in a living body, and to measure their concentrations. As an example, it is known that a large amount of intracellular ATP is leaked out of cells along with cell death, which has been reported to play a role as a significant danger signal in inflammatory process. Besides, in a cancer tissue, a large amount of intracellular ATP is leaked out of cells when cancer cells die, and it has been reported that an ATP concentration in a cancer tissue is higher than in a normal tissue (Non Patent Literatures 1, 3 and 4).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of a method for measuring an intravital substance including an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand of a living body includes a microdialysis method. In this method, a tissue liquid or an extracellular liquid collected from a tissue is analyzed by using HPLC or the like. When a measurement target is ATP, a measurement method by luciferin-luciferase assay may be employed apart from the analysis method by HPLC or the like. Even when this method is employed, however, it is difficult to definitely determine whether a detected/measured purinergic receptor ligand is of intracellular origin or extracellular origin, and a purinergic receptor ligand concentration in a living body cannot be measured in real time. Besides, in the microdialysis method, a tissue liquid is collected by inserting a needle into a tissue, and at this point, cell death or tissue necrosis may occur in the insertion site. In such a case, there arises a problem that an artifact derived from the measurement method affects a measurement result. When a substance to be measured is ATP, it is known to be secreted along with cell death or a cell inflammatory reaction, and hence the measurement by this method is more unsuitable. Patent Literature 2 reports a method for observing an ATP distribution and variation in a living body by using a non-human mammal expressing a fusion protein in which two fluorescent proteins workable as a donor and an acceptor in fluorescence resonance energy transfer are respectively bound on an amino terminal side and a carboxy terminal side of c subunit of ATP synthase. This method, however, focuses on intracellular ATP, and cannot evaluate extracellular ATP.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides, as an attempt to measure extracellular ATP in a living body, a method using a genetically modified cell having luciferase extracellularly expressed has been reported (Non Patent Literatures 1 and 2, and Patent Literature 1). In this method, the genetically modified cell emits a signal through a luciferin-luciferase reaction when exposed to an environment having a high concentration of extracellular ATP, and the signal is detected for measuring extracellular ATP in a living body. In this method, however, it is necessary to transfer the cell in a living body, and it is difficult to distribute the transferred cell systemically over the living body, and there remains a problem that if it is unknown when ATP is extracellularly released, it is difficult to determine when the cell should be transferred. The method also has a problem that it cannot be employed if the transferred cell is eliminated by the host immune system. Besides, it is only ATP that can be measured through the luciferin-luciferase reaction, and other purinergic receptor ligands cannot be measured.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although not only ATP but also the other purinergic receptor ligands have been reported to be involved in various diseases as extracellular signal transducers, there are many unclear points about which extracellular purinergic receptor ligand functions how and for which disease at which timing. Therefore, for evaluation of the function of an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand in a living body and in a disease condition, an evaluation system capable of detecting an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand minimally invasively, chronologically and systemically is necessary, but such an evaluation system does not still exist.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[Patent Literature 1] WO 2006/126231</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">[Patent Literature 2] WO 2015/108102</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">[Non Patent Literature 1] Patrizia et. al., (2008) PLoS One. 3, e2599</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">[Non Patent Literature 2] Francesco Di Virgilio et. al., (2016), Methods Mol Biol. 1417, 115-29</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">[Non Patent Literature 3] Idzko M et. al., (2007) Nat Med.

More specifically, objects of the present invention are to provide a genetically modified non-human animal systemically expressing a reporter protein for detecting/evaluating an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand, and to construct an evaluation system for detecting an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, using the evaluation system for detecting an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand using the genetically modified non-human animal and the reporter protein, for detecting various diseases and monitoring disease conditions of the various diseases, and for screening for therapeutic agents for these diseases.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0014">The present inventors made earnest studies to solve the above-described problems, and have found as a result that a P2Y purinergic receptor and &#x3b2;-Arrestin which intracellularly binds thereto are fused with respective subunit proteins of split luciferase to produce a genetically modified mouse systemically expressing these, and thus, extracellular ATP can be detected. In other words, according to this genetic modification, when extracellular ATP binds to the P2Y receptor, the P2Y receptor binds to &#x3b2;-Arrestin in a cell, and the subunit proteins fused thereto are appropriately assembled to reconstruct/generate luciferase. Luciferase can express a luminescent signal in the presence of an appropriate substrate, and extracellular ATP can be detected by detecting this signal. Besides, it was confirmed that when ATP measurement is performed using a cell isolated from the genetically modified mouse, a luminescent signal intensity thus detected is concentration dependent, and thus an ATP concentration can be quantitatively measured. Therefore, the present invention is also applicable to ATP concentration measurement and screening in vitro. Besides, detection of extracellular ATP in a living body of the genetically modified mouse was examined, and as a result, it was found that the luminescent signal can be detected in a concentration dependent manner, and hence systemic extracellular ATP can be thus detected non-invasively and chronologically.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The present invention was accomplished based on these

In one aspect, the membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand and the first reporter protein can be linked in the stated order from the N-terminal.

In the present invention, the membrane protein is not particularly limited as long as it can bind to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand, and a G protein-coupled receptor (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;GPCR&#x201d;) that is a purinergic receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel receptor, or a portion of these can be suitably used. The membrane protein is preferably a GPCR that is a purinergic receptor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">A GPCR is mainly a seven transmembrane receptor, and has a structure in which seven a helix structures penetrate cytoplasm membrane, the N-terminal region is extracellularly positioned, and the C-terminal region is intracellularly positioned. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region, the GPCR is activated to be changed in the structure, and the intracellular region is phosphorylated owing to the action of G protein-coupled receptor kinase.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">Examples of the GPCR that is a purinergic receptor include, but are not limited to, a P1 receptor and a P2 receptor. The membrane protein is preferably a P1 receptor and a P2 receptor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">The P1 receptor that is a purinergic receptor is a GPCR using adenosine, AMP, ADP, or ATP as a ligand, and can be classified into A1 receptors, A2A receptors, A2B receptors and A3 receptors. In the present invention, one of or a plurality of receptors selected from these can be used as the membrane protein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">The P2 receptor that is a purinergic receptor is a GPCR using AMP, ADP, ATP, UTP, UDP, or UDP glucose as a ligand, and is preferably a P2Y receptor. The P2Y receptor can be classified into P2Y1 receptors, P2Y2 receptors, P2Y4B receptors, P2Y6 receptors, P2Y11 receptors, P2Y12 receptors, P2Y13 receptors, and P2Y14 receptors. In the present invention, one of or a plurality of receptors selected from these can be used as the membrane protein. The P2Y2 receptors and the P2Y11 receptors having higher specificity to ATP are more preferred, and the P2Y11 receptors are particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">In the present invention, as the membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand, any of known ones can be used, and known ones registered in public database such as NCBI and GenBank can be used. For example, as for the A1 receptors belonging to P1 receptor family, one derived from a human is registered as NP_000665.1, and one derived from a mouse is registered as NP_001008533.1, as for the P2Y2 receptors, one derived from a human is registered as NP_002555.3, and one derived from a mouse is registered as NP_001289275.1, and as for the P2Y11 receptors, one derived from a human is registered as NP_002557.2. The membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand is preferably derived from an animal of the same species as a host. In the present invention, for example, a P2Y<sub>11 </sub>receptor represented by an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 can be used as the membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">In the present invention, as the &#x201c;membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand&#x201d;, analogs and variants thereof can be used as long as they can bind to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand. The analogs and variants of the &#x201c;membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand&#x201d; means (i) a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence of the &#x201c;membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand&#x201d; in which 1 to 50, for example, 1 to 20, or 1 to 10 amino acids are deleted, substituted, added or inserted, and capable of binding to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand, or (ii) a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence having a sequence identity of 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, and still further preferably 99% or more with the amino acid sequence of the &#x201c;membrane protein that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand&#x201d;, and capable of binding to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand. The sequence identity of an amino acid sequence can be calculated based on a known method, and can be obtained by, for example, employing default settings of BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at the National Center for Biological Information) or the like. The sequence identity of an amino acid sequence may be calculated based on the entire protein capable of binding to a purinergic receptor ligand, or may be calculated based on a binding domain having binding activity with a purinergic receptor ligand. For example, when a specific binding domain in a receptor that binds to a purinergic receptor ligand has a high sequence homology, it is understood that the specific binding domain has a high sequence homology even if the homology as the entire membrane protein is not high because a domain different from the binding domain, such as a transmembrane domain, has a low sequence homology.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">The terms &#x201c;portion of these&#x201d; and &#x201c;portion thereof&#x201d; used in relation to the membrane protein in the present invention mean a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence of a part of the membrane protein, and capable of binding to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand. An example of such a protein includes one containing at least a part of domains of the amino acid sequence of the membrane protein, such as a domain necessary for binding to at least an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand (such as a binding domain in a receptor binding to a specific purinergic receptor ligand) or a domain necessary for binding to a cell membrane (such as a transmembrane domain). Respective domains of the membrane protein can be determined based on amino acid sequence information and genetic information registered in public database such as NCBI and GenBank.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">(1-1-2) First Reporter Protein</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">In the present invention, the &#x201c;first reporter protein&#x201d; means a protein functioning as a reporter protein together with the second reporter protein of the second fusion protein described below.

Examples of such a protein &#x201c;functioning as a reporter protein together&#x201d; include a split reporter protein, and a combination of proteins causing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">A &#x201c;split reporter protein&#x201d; refers to a reporter protein split into two or more subunits, and when the respective subunits are present to be away from one another, a function as a reporter protein is not exhibited, but when the split two or more subunits are close or bound to one another, a reporter protein is reconstructed and thus can exhibit the function. Regarding a &#x201c;reporter protein split into subunits&#x201d;, a protein originally containing two or more subunits can be split into the respective subunits, and even a reporter protein originally containing one protein may be artificially split into a plurality of subunits. Examples of the reporter protein include, but are not limited to, green, red, blue or yellow fluorescent proteins, and enzymes such as luciferase, &#x3b2;-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, &#x3b2;-glucuronidase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, invertase, dihydrofolate acid reductase, and &#x3b2;-lactamase. A specific example of the split reporter protein includes split luciferase. Other specific examples include, but are not limited to, split fluorescent proteins such as split GFP, split YFP, and split CYP. Besides, it goes without saying that previously reported split reporter proteins can be used, and a specific reporter protein can be artificially split for use.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">&#x201c;FRET&#x201d; means a phenomenon that when two fluorescent proteins, that is, a first fluorescent protein (donor) and a second fluorescent protein (acceptor) having a spectrum of a fluorescence wavelength of the former overlapping a spectrum of a wavelength of excitation light of the latter, are close to each other, energy absorbed through excitation of the first fluorescent protein is used as energy for excitation of the second fluorescent protein to cause the second fluorescent protein to emit fluorescence. Besides, &#x201c;BRET&#x201d; refers to a phenomenon that a bioluminescent protein is used instead of the first fluorescent protein (donor) of FRET, and when the bioluminescent protein and the second fluorescent protein are close to each other, energy generated at the time of bioluminescence of the bioluminescent protein is used as energy for excitation of the second fluorescent protein to cause the second fluorescent protein to emit fluorescence. An example of the bioluminescent protein include luciferase.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">Accordingly, as the &#x201c;first reporter protein&#x201d; in the present invention, one subunit of a split reporter protein, one fluorescent protein in a combination of fluorescent proteins capable of causing FRET, or either protein of a combination of a bioluminescent protein and a fluorescent protein capable of causing BRET can be used.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">(1-2) Second Fusion Protein</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">In the present invention, the &#x201c;second fusion protein&#x201d; comprises or consists of a protein capable of binding to the membrane protein bound to an extracellular purinergic receptor ligand (hereinafter sometimes referred to simply as the &#x201c;protein capable of binding to the membrane protein bound to a ligand&#x201d;) and a second reporter protein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">In the second fusion protein, the protein capable of binding to the membrane protein bound to a ligand and the second reporter protein may be directly linked to each other, or may be linked via a linker.

In one aspect, the second reporter protein and the protein capable of binding to the membrane protein bound to a ligand can be linked in the stated order from the N-terminal.
