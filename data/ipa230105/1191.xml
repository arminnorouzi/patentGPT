The respiratory waveform may include a plurality of respiratory cycles each corresponding to at least one of a breath and an attempted breath of the subject. The method may also include identifying a breathing pattern within the respiratory waveform over a period of time. The breathing pattern may include a repeating pattern of a plurality of respiratory cycles followed by at least one respiratory cycle corresponding to a disordered breathing event. The method may also include generating a series of stimulation pulses with an implantable nerve stimulator configured for coupling to a hypoglossal nerve of the subject. The series of stimulation pulses may be coordinated with the breathing pattern.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="88.90mm"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments described herein relate to devices, systems and associated methods for treating sleeping disorders. More particularly, the embodiments described herein relate to devices, systems and methods for treating obstructive sleep apnea.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent, affecting one in five adults in the United States. One in fifteen adults has moderate to severe OSA requiring treatment. Untreated OSA results in reduced quality of life measures and increased risk of disease including hypertension, stroke, heart disease, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a standard treatment for OSA. While CPAP is non-invasive and highly effective, it is not well tolerated by patients. Patient compliance for CPAP is often reported to be between 40% and 60%. Surgical treatment options for OSA are available too. However, they tend to be highly invasive (result in structural changes), irreversible, and have poor and/or inconsistent efficacy. Even the more effective surgical procedures are undesirable because they usually require multiple invasive and irreversible operations, they may alter a patient's appearance (e.g., maxillo-mandibulary advancement), and/or they may be socially stigmatic (e.g., tracheostomy).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) has been proposed for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. An example of an implantable hypoglossal nerve stimulation system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,809,442 to Bolea et al. Published data suggest that response to hypoglossal nerve stimulation varies across subjects. Before undergoing a surgical procedure to implant a hypoglossal nerve stimulation system, it would be desirable to understand the likelihood of therapeutic success, and make clinical judgments accordingly. It would also be desirable to consider various stimulation methodologies and adjunct therapies to hypoglossal nerve stimulation to improve outcomes thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address these and other unmet needs, the present disclosure provides, in exemplary non-limiting embodiments, systems, devices, and methods for effective detection and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. In particular, the present disclosure is directed to, among other things, implantable devices that stimulate the hypoglossal nerve to improve the function of the upper airway during sleep. The present disclosure is also directed to analysis techniques and the use of those techniques to identify and treat sleep apnea. Some of those techniques include analyzing a respiratory waveform to identify features and characteristics of multiple respiratory waveforms, individual respiratory waveforms, and portions of respiratory waveforms to identify the presence of airway obstruction and the presence of an obstructive sleep apnea event.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure further provides, in one example embodiment, a method for treating obstructive sleep apnea by first performing an assessment of the patient that involves observing the patient's upper airway during a tongue protrusion maneuver. The assessment may, for example, be done using endoscopy to observe the upper airway while the patient is awake in the supine position. The tongue protrusion maneuver may, for example, involve the patient volitionally protruding the tongue to its maximal extent with the mouth open or the lips loosely touching the tongue. The tongue protrusion maneuver may mimic the effect of genioglossus activation by hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS). Thus, an adequate increase in airway size during the tongue protrusion maneuver may be indicative of likely therapeutic success with HGNS.

The implanted components of the system <b>10</b> may generally include an implanted neurostimulator (INS) <b>50</b> (a.k.a., an implanted pulse generator (IPG)), an implanted stimulation lead (or leads) <b>60</b>, and an implanted respiration sensing lead (or leads) <b>70</b>. The INS <b>50</b> generally includes a header <b>52</b> for connection of the leads <b>60</b>/<b>70</b>, and a hermetically sealed housing <b>54</b> for the associated electronics and long-life or rechargeable battery (not visible). The stimulation lead <b>60</b> generally includes a lead body <b>62</b> with a proximal connector and a distal nerve electrode cuff <b>64</b>. The respiration sensing lead <b>70</b> generally includes a lead body <b>72</b> with a proximal connector and one or more sensors <b>74</b> disposed on or along a distal portion thereof. Suitable designs of the INS <b>50</b>, stimulation lead <b>60</b> and respiration sensing lead <b>70</b> are described in more detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and by way of example, not limitation, the implanted components <b>20</b> of the neurostimulator system <b>10</b> are implanted in a patient P with the INS <b>50</b> disposed in a subcutaneous pocket, the stimulation lead body <b>62</b> disposed in a subcutaneous tunnel, the nerve cuff electrode <b>64</b> disposed on a nerve (e.g., hypoglossal nerve (HGN)) innervating a muscle (e.g., genioglossus muscle, not shown) controlling the upper airway, the respiration sensing lead body <b>72</b> disposed in a subcutaneous tunnel, and the respiration sensors <b>74</b> disposed adjacent lung tissue and/or intercostal muscles outside the pleural space. It should be appreciated that the nerve cuff electrode <b>64</b> may be replaced with another type of stimulation electrode assembly, such as a stimulation electrode assembly with a cylindrical lead having one or more stimulation electrodes positioned close to the HNG.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Generally, electrical stimulus is delivered by the INS <b>50</b> via the stimulation lead <b>60</b> to a nerve innervating a muscle controlling upper airway patency to mitigate obstruction thereof. To reduce nerve and muscle fatigue, the stimulus may be delivered for only a portion of the respiratory cycle, such as during inspiration which corresponds to negative pressure in the upper airway. Stimulation may be thus triggered as a function of respiration as detected by respiration sensing lead <b>70</b> in a closed-loop feedback system. By way of example, the stimulus may be triggered to turn on at the end of expiration (or at the beginning of inspiration), and triggered to turn off at the beginning of expiration (or at the end of inspiration). Triggering the stimulus as a function of expiration improves capture of the entire inspiratory phase, including a brief pre-inspiratory phase of about 300 milliseconds, thus more closely mimicking normal activation of upper airway dilator muscles. Over-stimulation may cause nerve and/or muscle fatigue, but a 40% to 50% duty cycle may be safely tolerated, thus enabling limited over-stimulation. As an alternative, stimulus may be delivered independent of actual respiration wherein the stimulus duty cycle is set for an average inspiratory duration at a frequency approximately equal to an average respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Stimulus may be delivered to one or more of a variety of nerve sites to activate one muscle or muscle groups controlling patency of the upper airway. For example, stimulation of the genioglossus muscle via the hypoglossal nerve moves or otherwise stiffens the anterior portion of the upper airway, thereby decreasing the critical pressure at which the upper airway collapses during inspiration and reducing the likelihood of an apnea or hypopnea event occurring during sleep. Because the systems described herein work at the level of the tongue, it may be desirable to combine this therapy with a therapy (e.g., UPPP or palatal implant) that work at the level of the soft palate, thus increasing efficacy for a broader range of patients.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the physician programmer <b>30</b> may comprise a computer <b>32</b> configured to control and program the INS <b>50</b> via a wireless link to a programming wand <b>34</b>. The physician programmer <b>30</b> may be resident in a sleep lab where the patient undergoes a polysomnographic (PSG) study during which the patient sleeps while the INS <b>50</b> is programmed to optimize therapy.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The patient controller <b>40</b> may comprise control circuitry and an associated user interface to allow the patient to control the system via a wireless link while at home, for example. The patient controller <b>40</b> may include a power switch <b>42</b> to turn the system on and slowly ramp up when the patient goes to sleep at night, and turn it off when the patient wakes in the morning. A snooze switch <b>44</b> may be used to temporarily put the INS <b>50</b> in a standby mode for a preprogrammed period of time to allow the patient to temporarily wake, after which the INS <b>50</b> turns back on and ramps up to the desired stimulus level. Display <b>46</b> may be configured to be a dash-board-like display, and may be any suitable display available to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as, for example, an LED or LCD display. Furthermore, information may be communicated to the patient controller <b>40</b> for display purposes by any suitable means known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

A library of electrical stimulation parameter settings can be programmed into the INS. These settings listed in the library may be selected by the patient manually using the patient programmer based on, for example: (1) direct patient perception of comfort during stimulation; (2) a log of the most successful settings compiled by the software in the INS (assumes apnea/hypopnea detection capability); (3) a sleep physician's or technician's assessment of the most effective stimulation as determined during a sleep study; and/or (4) a list of the most effective parameters produced for a particular class of patient or other.

In addition to the upper airway which generally includes the pharyngeal space, other nerves and dilator muscles of the nasal passage and nasopharyngeal space may be selectively targeted for stimulation. A general description of the muscles and nerves suitable for stimulation follows, of which the pharyngeal nerves and muscles are shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Airway dilator muscles and associated nerves suitable for activation are described in the following text and associated drawings. The dilator naris muscle functions to widen the anterior nasal aperture (i.e., flares nostrils) and is innervated by the buccal branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The tensor veli palatine muscle functions to stiffen the soft palate and is innervated by the medial (or internal) pterygoid branch of the mandibular nerve. The genioglossus muscle is an extrinsic pharyngeal muscle connecting the base of the tongue to the chin and functions to protrude the tongue. The genioglossus muscle is typically innervated by a distal or medial branch (or branches) of the right and left hypoglossal nerve. The geniohyoid muscle connects the hyoid bone to the chin and the sternohyoid muscle attaches the hyoid bone to the sternum. The geniohyoid muscle functions to pull the hyoid bone anterosuperiorly, the sternohyoid muscle functions to pull hyoid bone inferiorly, and collectively (i.e., co-activation) they function to pull the hyoid bone anteriorly. The geniohyoid muscle is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve, and the sternohyoid muscle is innervated by the ansa cervicalis nerve.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">By way of example, a nerve electrode may be attached to a specific branch of the hypoglossal nerve innervating the genioglossus muscle (tongue protruder), or may be attached to a more proximal portion (e.g., trunk) of the hypoglossal nerve in which a specific fascicle innervating the genioglossus muscle is targeted by steering the stimulus using an electrode array. Activating the genioglossus muscle causes the tongue to protrude thus increasing the size of anterior aspect of the upper airway or otherwise resisting collapse during inspiration.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As an alternative to activation of any or a combination of the airway dilator muscles, co-activation of airway dilator and airway restrictor or retruder muscles may be used to stiffen the airway and maintain patency. By way of example, a nerve electrode may be attached to specific branches of the hypoglossal nerve innervating the genioglossus muscle (tongue protruder), in addition to the hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles (tongue retruders), or may be attached to a more proximal portion (e.g., trunk) of the hypoglossal nerve in which specific fascicles innervating the genioglossus, hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles are targeted by steering the stimulus using an electrode array. Activating the hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles causes the tongue to retract, and when co-activated with the genioglossus, causes the tongue to stiffen thus supporting the anterior aspect of the upper airway and resisting collapse during inspiration. Because the tongue retruder muscles may overbear the tongue protruder muscle under equal co-activation, unbalanced co-activation may be desired. Thus, a greater stimulus (e.g., longer stimulation period, larger stimulation amplitude, higher stimulation frequency, etc.) or an earlier initiated stimulus may be delivered to the portion(s) of the hypoglossal nerve innervating the genioglossus muscle than to the portion(s) of the hypoglossal nerve innervating the hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, examples of suitable nerve stimulation sites include B; A+C; A+C+D; B+D; C+D; and E.

It is believed that stimulating less than 30% or more than 50% prior to the next expiratory phase may result in an inadequate stimulation period and muscle fatigue, respectively.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the respiratory waveform <b>5500</b> can be defined by a number of respiratory cycles measured over time, such as a respiratory cycle A RC<sub>A </sub>and/or a respiratory cycle B RC<sub>B </sub>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. The respiratory cycles A and B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> represent one or more such cycles distributed over a time period. The respiratory cycles A and B can be obtained by measurements of respiration movements, such as those described previously, and can be determined by calculations based on earlier measured respiratory cycles. For clarity, the respiratory cycles A and B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> are presented as two subsequent measured respiratory cycles to illustrate certain respiratory waveform features described in detail below. However, in some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> is to be understood to illustrate a respiratory cycle A that represents a measured respiratory cycle and to illustrate a respiratory cycle B that represents a future calculated respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The respiratory waveform <b>5500</b> can be defined in several ways: by a series of measured respiratory cycles A (with only one shown in full in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>), by one or more measured respiratory cycles A and one or more measured respiratory cycles B over time, and/or by one or more measured respiratory cycle(s) A followed by a respiratory cycle B that is calculated from data obtained from the one or more preceding respiratory cycle(s) A. In an exemplary embodiment, the respiratory cycles A and/or B can be selected so as to place the two cycles adjacent to each other, as illustrated, or selected to place the two cycles farther apart in time with the inclusion of one or more additional respiratory cycles disposed between multiple respiratory cycles A, or after respiratory cycle A and before respiratory cycle B. For clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, a single respiratory cycle A and a single respiratory cycle B are illustrated adjacent to each other in time, with features shown for one exemplary respiratory cycle being applicable to any other respiratory cycle. Accordingly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, features that are applicable to respiratory cycle A are shown on respiratory cycle B for clarity in the illustration. As can be appreciated, the features of respiratory cycle B should be transposed to respiratory cycle A when respiratory cycle A is a measured respiratory cycle and respiratory cycle B is a predicted respiratory cycle based on the measurements obtained with regard to one or more respiratory cycle(s) A.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The respiratory cycles (A or B) can be defined by the identification of peaks M within the waveform <b>5500</b> that can indicate the maximization of lung air intake for that respiration cycle and also indicate the end of inspiration and/or the beginning of expiration. As can be appreciated, the end of inspiration and the beginning of expiration may be separated from each other by an insignificant time when exhalation immediately follows inhalation, or be separated by a longer time corresponding to the holding of a breath or the obstruction of an exhalation. The waveform <b>5500</b> can also define an expiration period or phase EP which is a time period over which air exits the lungs, with the boundaries of the expiration period EP defined by an expiration start EP1 (or M) and an expiration end (EP2). Likewise, the waveform <b>5500</b> can define an inspiration period or phase IP which is a time period over which air enters the lungs and includes attempts to bring air into the lungs (such as during obstructed or disordered breathing events), with the boundaries of the inspiration period IP defined by an inspiration start IP1 and an inspiration end IP2 (or M). As stated previously, the peak M can indicate inspiration end IP2 as well as indicate expiration start EP1 when the time between inspiration end IP2 and expiration start EP1 is zero or insignificant. As also state previously, the peak M can be expressed as a plateau when there is a difference in the timing of inspiration end IP2 and expiration start EP1 representing a holding or obstruction of an exhalation for said different in the timing. Also, the peak M can be defined to correspond to both or only one of expiration start EP1 and inspiration end IP2, and is preferably associated with expiration start EP1.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, sensor information obtained regarding respiratory cycle A (or several respiratory cycles A, not shown) can be used to predict the timing of respiratory cycle B and used to determine the timing of a stimulation delivered during respiratory cycle B. The start time N of the stimulation may be calculated by using the time interval defining respiratory cycle A (or respiratory cycles A) that extends from peak M<sub>1 </sub>(at expiration start EP1 of cycle A or at the inspiration end IP2 of the prior respiratory cycle) to peak M<sub>2 </sub>(at inspiration end IP2 of cycle A or at the expiration start EP1 of the subsequent cycle) to provide a time value (or multiple time values) that can be used to predict the timing of peak M<sub>3 </sub>that corresponds to the inspiration end IP2 of cycle B or the expiration start EP1 of the cycle following cycle B. The prediction of the timing for peak M<sub>3 </sub>can be obtained by assigning to cycle B the same or a similar duration that was observed for cycle A, or by calculating the duration of cycle B by using an average or mean of two of more cycles A to provide the timing for peak M<sub>3</sub>, or by calculating the duration of cycle B by observing two or more cycles A and identifying a cycle A or a subset of the cycles A that is based on an acceptable quality data set or that conforms with a predefined template for respiratory cycles to provide the timing for peak M<sub>3</sub>, or by calculating the duration of cycle B by using a parameter from a table stored in memory or calculated by an algorithm to provide the timing for peak M<sub>3</sub>. Next, in order to capture the entire inspiratory period IP of respiratory cycle B, including the brief pre-inspiratory period of approximately 300 milliseconds, stimulation may be timed to start at a time N<sub>B </sub>that is calculated to be prior to the predicted time of expiration M<sub>3 </sub>by an offset time interval that is approximately 30% to 50% of the duration calculated for respiratory cycle B. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the predicted time of peak M<sub>3 </sub>can be used to calculate an offset at an earlier time by subtracting from the time for peak M<sub>3 </sub>a value corresponding to 30% to 50% of the duration time of respiratory cycle B to arrive at the stimulation time N<sub>B</sub>. As can be appreciated, the offset of approximately 30% to 50% defines a window of time during which the start of stimulation N<sub>B </sub>is preferably disposed in order to have the stimulation capture the entire inspiratory phase IP. As can also be appreciated, the stimulation N<sub>B </sub>can be disposed outside of the 30% to 50% window to account for variations in the respiratory cycles due to patient characteristics and health, disease state, physiological factors, and environmental factors. The stimulation can continue until the time of expiration at or near peak M<sub>3 </sub>is reached or it can be continued into or through the expiration period EP. As can also be appreciated, the offset time interval that provides the timing of time N<sub>B </sub>can be calculated by adding time directly to the detection time of the measured expiration M<sub>2 </sub>instead of by subtracting from the estimated time of expiration M<sub>3</sub>, so that the stimulation start time N<sub>B </sub>is placed at a time that is approximately 50% to 70% after the detection of expiration M<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments, however, it is contemplated that an adequate measure of respiration may not be available, such as, for example, when a relied-upon signal has failed. In these embodiments, it is contemplated that the implanted neurostimulator system may be configured to respond in one or more of the following three ways. First, the implanted neurostimulator may completely cease stimulation until an adequate signal is acquired. Second, the neurostimulator may deliver continuous simulation pulses of predetermined durations (e.g., up to 60 seconds) until an adequate signal is acquired; or if an adequate signal is not acquired in this time, the stimulation will be turned off. Third, the neurostimulator may continue to stimulate at the same or a fraction (e.g., one quarter) of the stimulation rate for the most recently measured respiratory cycle. That is to say, the neurostimulator may deliver stimulation pulses of relatively long durations at a frequency that is less than the frequency of stimulation utilized with an adequate measure of respiration. Alternatively, the neurostimulator may deliver stimulation pulses of relatively short durations at a frequency that is greater than the frequency used with an adequate measure of respiration.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Description of an Exemplary Stimulation Pulse</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, there is depicted an exemplary stimulation pulse waveform <b>5000</b> that may be emitted from an INS in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. Typically, exemplary stimulation pulse waveform <b>5000</b> may include a square wave pulse train having one or more square wave pulses <b>5001</b> of approximately 1 to 3 volts in amplitude, a duration of approximately 100 ms, and a frequency of approximately 30 Hz, assuming a 1000 ohm impedance at the electrodes and a constant current or voltage.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, exemplary stimulation pulse waveform <b>5000</b> may include a bi-phasic charge balanced waveform square pulses <b>5001</b> and <b>5002</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. Square pulse <b>5002</b> may be included in waveform <b>5000</b> to, among other things, promote efficient stimulation and/or mitigate electrode corrosion. However, square pulse <b>5002</b> may be excluded from waveform <b>5000</b> as desired. Furthermore, although the depicted exemplary waveform <b>5000</b> includes square pulse <b>5002</b> that exactly balances the stimulation wave pulse <b>5001</b>, in certain circumstances, square pulse <b>5002</b> may not exactly balance the stimulation wave pulse <b>5001</b>, and may not be a square pulse.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, exemplary stimulation pulse waveform <b>5000</b> may include the delivery of a low amplitude (e.g., below the stimulation threshold), long duration, pre-stimulation pulse <b>5004</b>. The pre-stimulation pulse <b>5004</b> may include any suitable low amplitude, long duration pulse, and may be provided approximately 0.5 ms before the delivery of a first stimulation pulse <b>5001</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Pre-stimulation pulse <b>5004</b> may facilitate selectively stimulating certain fibers of a nerve, such as, for example, the hypoglossal nerve or the superior laryngeal nerve. In particular, when stimulating the hypoglossal nerve, the presence of a pre-stimulation pulse, such as, for example, pulse <b>5004</b>, before a stimulation pulse (e.g., the bi-phasic stimulation pulse <b>5001</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) may serve to saturate the large diameter fibers of the nerve so as to allow the stimulation pulse <b>5001</b> to only affect (e.g., stimulate) the smaller diameter fibers of the nerve. In circumstances where a nerve (e.g., the hypoglossal nerve) may be stimulated for extended periods of time, a pre-stimulation pulse <b>5004</b> may be selectively introduced to waveform <b>5000</b>, so as to permit selective switching between stimulating the large and small diameter fibers of the nerve, in order to reduce muscle fatigue. Similarly, in situations where OSA may be treated by stimulating the superior laryngeal nerve to open the upper airway through a reflex mechanism, the presence of pre-stimulation pulse <b>5004</b> may serve to saturate the larger diameter efferent fibers so as to allow the stimulation pulse <b>5001</b> to only affect the smaller diameter afferent fibers of the nerve.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Detection of Airway Obstruction and OSA Events</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, individual waveforms can be identified within the respiratory waveform <b>5500</b> and further analyzed to identify patient status and the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea events. An individual waveform can be defined to be a portion of the respiratory waveform extending between two sequential impedance peaks (e.g., peaks M of respiratory cycle A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) or between two other similar or repeated respiratory waveform features (e.g., a series of peaks M defining multiple respiratory cycles A, shown in part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>). Features of the individual waveforms and the respiratory waveform <b>5500</b> can be identified and analyzed to determine patient status, sleep-related events, and responsiveness to therapy, and can be used to adjust therapy parameters. As can be appreciated, the respiratory waveform <b>5500</b> can also be characterized with data provided from any type of sensor configured to detect breathing or breathing motions, such as an airflow sensor positioned to measure the flow of air into and out of the lungs, to provide an airflow signal that can be used in a similar manner as, and correlated to, the impedance value illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. Likewise, a pressure sensor disposed in or on the chest can detect breathing motions by the changes in pressure detected by the sensor. Similarly, an accelerometer disposed in or on the chest can be configured to detect breathing motions or, in another embodiment, breathing sounds can be detected with a microphone or other acoustic sensor. In the exemplary embodiments and the techniques described below, it can be further appreciated that techniques applied to impedance values and respiratory waveforms defined by impedance values can be equally or equivalently applied to airflow, pressure, and motion values and respiratory waveforms defined by values representing airflow, pressure, and motion.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> illustrates a series of respiratory cycles measured with two measurement methods over the same period of time. The first method measures motion to identify respiratory activity and, in the illustrated embodiment, uses impedance to measure movement of the chest corresponding to breathing, as described above. The second method measures airflow to identify respiratory activity and, in the illustrated embodiment, uses an airflow sensor measuring the passage of air at a patient's nostrils. The illustrated respiratory cycles represented in waveform <b>5501</b> (generated with the first method) and waveform <b>5511</b> (generated with the second method) show a breathing pattern that is initially ordered and then degrades to a disordered breathing pattern as time (t) progresses. As illustrated, the degradation and the presence of disordered breathing can be detected by an increase in the magnitude of the impedance peaks M over time, which shows that greater chest motion and greater chest extension is required by the patient to draw in a labored breath as compared to a normal, ordered, unobstructed, and/or not flow limited breath achieved earlier along the timeline. The degradation can also be detected by a gradual decrease in the magnitude of the airflow peaks P over time, which shows that less airflow is achieved by the patient as the patient attempts to draw in a labored breath as compared to a normal breath achieved earlier along the timeline. Both the waveforms <b>5501</b> and <b>5511</b> may be compared to thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>, respectively, described in detail below. It should be understood that two measurements are displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> to illustrate different approaches for identifying disordered breathing and to illustrate how two different approaches can be used together to identify disordered breathing. It should be further understood that the same identification of disordered breathing may be achieved with a single measurement technique or with other techniques described above (such as with the use of a pressure sensor or an accelerometer to detect breathing) and described in the art.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the respiratory waveform <b>5501</b> and <b>5511</b> and the peaks M and P may be analyzed to identify trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> that are generated from a comparison of peaks M and P over an evaluation time period t<sub>eval </sub>during which actual measurements of peaks M and P are used to calculate the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b>. As can be appreciated, the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be based on the magnitudes of peaks M and P or on other features provided in respiratory waveforms <b>5501</b> and <b>5511</b>, or on a combination of peaks M and P and such other features. For example, an area under each peak M and P (between points where the respiratory waveforms intersects the x-axes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>) can be used for calculation of the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b>. Furthermore, although the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> to be a linear best fit of the measured peaks M and P over the evaluation time period t<sub>eval</sub>, the calculation of the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be achieved with other known methods or using methods that give different weights to the measured peaks M and P. The trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can also provide a slope value indicating a degree to which the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> are moving towards or away from the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be extrapolated to extend into a future projected time period t<sub>proj </sub>to estimate an intersection point <b>5504</b> and <b>5514</b> where it is estimated that the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> will exceed, cross, and/or surpass the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>. In another embodiment similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> but not requiring a projected time period t<sub>proj</sub>, the evaluation time period t<sub>eval </sub>can be extended to include at least the intersection point <b>5504</b> and <b>5514</b> so that the exceeding, crossing, and/or surpassing of the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b> by the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> is identified by a detection of a peak M or P that is on the other side of the threshold <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, it can be appreciated that the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be reduced or flattened (due to, for example, an application of a nerve stimulation therapy). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, it can also be appreciated that the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be reversed (due to, for example, an application of a nerve stimulation therapy), so that the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> (when calculated for later time periods) again cross the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>, thereby indicating a return to a non-disordered breathing state of the subject.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The amplitude of the impedance peaks M of respiratory waveform <b>5501</b>, or the peaks P of respiratory waveform <b>5511</b>, can be compared to a threshold value <b>5502</b> or <b>5512</b> to determine the level of effort required during a respiratory cycle. A high or otherwise significant level of respiratory effort is indicated when an impedance peak value M exceeds or surpasses (rises above) a threshold <b>5502</b>, which can identify disordered or atypical breathing indicative of an obstructive sleep apnea event. Likewise, a low or significant airflow peak value P that exceeds or surpasses (falls below) a threshold <b>5512</b> can be used to identify disordered or atypical breathing. As can be appreciated, the measurement technique used to acquire the respiratory waveform, and the selection of the threshold, may require calibration based on a baseline related to the normal or usual respiratory effort for the patient, and to account for the configuration of the impedance, airflow, pressure, accelerometer, or other sensors measuring the respiratory effort.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, as illustrated, a patient can be monitored to measure respiratory movement or effort and to measure airflow or the volume of air entering and leaving the patient's lungs, so as to identify disordered breathing events. The measurement of respiratory movement or effort may be acquired directly or indirectly with an impedance sensor, a pressure sensor, an accelerometer, or with any of the sensors or techniques described above or known in the art. For example, a measurement of airflow or air volume may be acquired directly with an airflow sensor disposed near the patient's nostrils. In another example, an airflow measurement may be obtained indirectly with an impedance sensor disposed to detect the movement of the chest and configured to calculate the volume of air entering or leaving the lungs. In an example applicable to both direct and indirect measurement methods, a pressure sensor can be disposed in the chest wall that provides direct measurement of pressure relating to the movement of the chest during breathing, and that simultaneously provides indirect measurement of airflow by using detected chest movements to estimate the volume of the air in the lungs or the passage of air into or out of the lungs. In addition to direct and indirect measurement methods, estimations may be used to generate values characterizing respiration movement, respiration effort, airflow, and air volume. For example, patient body mass or awake lung volume measurements may be determined and a baseline condition of the patient identified that may be correlated to a baseline value for respiration obtained by, for example, an impedance sensor or a pressure sensor as described above. After correlating the baseline value for the patient with sensor measurements, the patient may be evaluated further with voluntary shallow and deep breaths that may be compared to changes in the baseline value so as to provide an estimation of patient breathing changes when sensor measurements are generated during normal sleep periods.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the patient may be evaluated while awake or asleep to identify and characterize a normal breathing pattern of the patient, and then further evaluated to identify a threshold value or level <b>5502</b> and a threshold value or level <b>5512</b> at which breathing is considered to require greater effort as compared to breathing during the normal breathing pattern. The characterizing of the normal breathing pattern for the patient may involve evaluating a baseline level of effort or work required for the patient to achieve a necessary level of respiration, which can be measured as an air volume or a blood oxygen level. After characterizing the effort or work associated with normal breathing, the patient can be further evaluated while awake (and simulating labored breathing that requires greater effort, such as breathing through a constricting mask) or asleep (while being monitored in a sleep lab and measuring blood oxygen levels) to correlate respiratory effort or work with blood oxygen levels, for example. Further evaluation may be performed to identify a threshold value or level <b>5502</b> at which the breathing can be characterized as labored or deficient, or at which the breathing can be considered insufficient to maintain adequate blood oxygen levels. In a similar fashion, the patient's airflow can be evaluated while awake or asleep to determine a normal airflow or air volume and to determine a labored airflow or air volume that may be used to characterize the air intake threshold value or level <b>5512</b>. The thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b> may be expressed as a singular value representing a transition to labored breathing and may have the units provided by the measurement technique, or may be expressed as a percentage change relative to the baseline value. Likewise, the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b> may be expressed as multiple values defining a range or continuum of increasing levels of severity having the units provided by the measurement technique or provided as a percentage change relative to the baseline.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one embodiment, the respiratory peak threshold <b>5502</b> is a percentage increase from the average peak values for a series of qualifying respiratory cycles having peaks M or a similar maximum. For example, a qualifying respiratory cycle may be a cycle that is measured with a sufficient level of quality (e.g., with a minimal number of signal spikes) and, in a further example, a series of qualifying respiratory cycles may be a running average of five sequential qualifying respiratory cycles. In another example, the running average may be based on a greater number of qualifying respiratory cycles such as 10 or 15, and/or the running average may be based on non-sequential respiratory cycles. Also, the running average may be based on values that are weighed so that the running average is biased to favor older or more recent respiratory cycles in the calculation of the running average to provide a long-term running average (biased to favor older cycles) and a short-term running average (biased to favor recent cycles). Older cycles may be cycles that were measured 5 or more cycles prior to a current cycle being measured, or may be 10 or more cycles prior to the current cycle, or may be a series of cycles including, for example, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th cycles prior to the current cycle. Recent cycles may be the 5 cycles immediately preceding the current cycle being measured, or may be the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cycles preceding the current cycle. To generate the respiratory peak threshold <b>5502</b> for comparison to the current cycle being measured, the running average value may be increased by a predetermined percentage to provide the respiratory peak threshold <b>5502</b>. For example, for a long-term running average biased to favor older respiratory cycles, the predetermined percentage may be 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of a long-term running average. In the 10% example, the respiratory peak threshold is 110% of the long-term running average value and may operate so that immediate changes towards more labored breathing are indicated by increases in the sensed signal, and labored breathing identified when the sensed signal surpasses the 110% respiratory peak threshold. In a similar fashion, to generate the airflow peak threshold <b>5512</b> for comparison to the current cycle being measured, the running average value may be decreased by a predetermined percentage to provide the airflow peak threshold <b>5512</b>. For example, for a long-term running average biased to favor older respiratory cycles, the predetermined percentage may be 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of a long-term running average. In the 10% example, the airflow peak threshold is 90% of the long-term running average value and may operate so that immediate changes towards more labored breathing are indicated by decreases in the sensed signal, and labored breathing identified when the sensed signal falls below the 90% airflow peak threshold.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The stimulation therapy described above can be applied prior to the estimated or actual time of the intersection point <b>5504</b> and <b>5514</b>, and subsequently terminated when or after the subject returns to a non-disordered breathing state. The stimulation therapy may open the airway of the subject during a duration of the disordered breathing state. The stimulation therapy can be a applied in several ways. For example, the stimulation therapy can be applied continuously (synchronous or asynchronous with breathing) and evaluated to a greater amplitude when a crossing of a threshold <b>5502</b> or <b>5512</b> is anticipated or detected. In another example, the stimulation therapy can be configured so that no or minimal stimulation is applied and a therapeutic level of stimulation is applied only when the subject is expected or detected to enter a disordered breathing state. As can be appreciated, battery life can be extended and nerve and muscle fatigue reduced when stimulation is delivered primarily, or only, during anticipated or detected disordered breathing events. As can also be appreciated, when an anticipated disordered breathing event is treated with a therapy delivered prior to the anticipated or detected intersection point <b>5504</b> and <b>5514</b>, the subject may no longer cross the threshold <b>5502</b> or <b>5512</b> due to the effectiveness of the corrective nerve stimulation therapy and/or the effectiveness of an increase in the existing application of a nerve stimulation therapy. In such a situation, the application of the corrective nerve stimulation therapy or the increase in the level of existing therapy can be timed to terminate when an estimated duration of the anticipated disordered breathing event has passed. Alternatively, instead of using a timing, the termination of the corrective therapy or the resumption of the existing therapy can be based on features or peaks identified in the respiratory waveform or on a subsequent evaluation of a trend or slope of the trend.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the waveforms <b>5501</b> and <b>5511</b> can be evaluated for longer periods of time than illustrated in the figure. Over that longer time, the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> can be evaluated to identify multiple periods of time when the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> are within (above or below) the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>, and multiple times when the trends exceed the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b>. The continuing monitoring of the trends <b>5503</b> and <b>5513</b> relative to the thresholds <b>5502</b> and <b>5512</b> or relative to a different value (a predetermined baseline, a fixed threshold, or the x-axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>) can provide long-term data regarding most or the entire sleep period of the patient. This long term data can be evaluated to identify a percentage of the sleep period during which the patient is subjected to a disordered breathing event, with the collective time periods of the disordered breath events compared to the entire time of the sleep period. As can be appreciated, this comparison can provide a disordered-sleep value or percentage that can be a measure of the effectiveness of the therapy or used as a tool to compare the effectiveness of changes or titrations to the therapy. For example, a patient can be monitored while not receiving stimulation therapy to determine a baseline status of the patient characterized with an initial disordered-sleep value, and then the patient can be treated with a stimulation therapy and evaluated in a similar manner to determine a therapeutic status of the patient characterized with a therapy disordered-sleep value. A comparison of the initial disordered-sleep value and the therapy disordered-sleep value can provide a measure of the effectiveness of the sleep apnea stimulation therapy. In another example, a change or titration of the stimulation therapy can be evaluated by treating the patient with a first stimulation therapy and determining a first-therapy status of the patient characterized with a first-therapy disordered-sleep value, and then the patient can be treated with a second stimulation therapy and evaluated in a similar manner to determine a second-therapy status of the patient characterized with a second-therapy disordered-sleep value. A comparison of the first-therapy disordered-sleep value and the second-therapy disordered-sleep value can provide a measure of the effectiveness of the change or titration of the applied sleep apnea stimulation therapy.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> illustrates a series of respiratory cycles measured with two measurement methods with each method applied to the same period of time (t). Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the first method measures motion and, in the illustrated embodiment, uses impedance to measure motion, and the second method measures airflow and, in the illustrated embodiment, uses an airflow sensor. The illustrated respiratory cycles contained in waveforms <b>5521</b> and <b>5531</b> show a normal breathing pattern that is initially normal and then degrades to a disordered breathing as time progresses. As discussed in more detail below, the degradation can be detected by evaluating respiration cycles to identify cycles that become more dominated by an inspiration phase of the respiratory cycle, which indicates that the patient is experiencing labored breathing because more time is needed during the respiratory cycle to draw in sufficient air.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the waveform <b>5521</b> can include a series of peaks M indicating a maximum intake or breath and/or the beginning of expiration. As also illustrated, a portion of the waveform <b>5521</b> extending from one peak M to a subsequent peak M includes both an inspiratory period and an expiratory period to define a respiratory cycle. The respiratory cycle can include signal maximums such as peak M and well as signal minimums such as negative peak Q which corresponds to the end of expiration and/or the beginning of inspiration. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the inspiratory period (IP) of a restricted breath can be analyzed to determine whether it provides a value that exceeds a value associated with the inspiratory period (IP) of a normal inspiratory breath, so as to detect disordered breathing. The inspiratory period IP may be defined to be a portion of a respiratory waveform, such as respiratory waveforms <b>5500</b> or <b>5521</b>, that relates to the intake or the attempted intake of air into the lungs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, one method of measuring the inspiratory period IP can be to measure the period between an impedance peak M of the respiratory waveform <b>5521</b> and the preceding impedance negative peak Q<sub>1 </sub>to represent a first inspiratory period IP<sub>1 </sub>of the respiratory waveform <b>5521</b>, with the inspiratory period IP<sub>1 </sub>extending from the impedance negative peak Q<sub>1 </sub>to the impedance peak M over an inspiration time period (t<sub>1</sub>). The impedance negative peak Q<sub>1 </sub>can be a minima point or the point where a positive slope of the impedance signal is first encountered and the slope following peak Q<sub>1 </sub>remains mostly or entirely positive until the end inspiration peak M is detected. It can be appreciated that there are other wave shape analysis techniques for establishing a point on the signal that correlates to the onset of inspiration, and also appreciated that the onset of inspiration correlating to peak Q<sub>1 </sub>can be based on a measurement of inspiration onset obtained with an airflow sensor such as that shown in waveform <b>5531</b>. By isolating and analyzing the inspiratory period IP<sub>1 </sub>of the respiratory waveform <b>5521</b>, and by analyzing the effort required over the inspiration time period correlated to the inspiratory period IP<sub>1</sub>, the amount of effort over time (peak-to-peak time) may be determined for the entire inspiration period IP<sub>1</sub>, which may be provided as a value that is comparable to another respiratory cycle or to a threshold. In an exemplary use of another respiratory cycle, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, a later respiratory cycle C exhibits an increased duration of the inspiratory period IP<sub>2 </sub>as compared to an earlier cycle B having a shorter inspiratory period IP<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">By comparing the two inspiratory periods IP<sub>1 </sub>and IP<sub>2</sub>, it can be determined that the comparatively longer period of inspiratory period IP<sub>2 </sub>(as compared to an earlier inspiratory period IP<sub>1</sub>) indicates that the patient is entering a period of disordered breathing because more of the respiratory cycle is occupied by breath intake as compared to a normal breath intake when the patient experiences non-disordered or normal breathing. In another analysis technique relating to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, a measured inspiratory time period (t<sub>1 </sub>or t<sub>2</sub>) of a breath can be identified (from minimum Q<sub>1 </sub>to the subsequent peak M or from minimum Q<sub>2 </sub>to the subsequent peak M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>) and compared to the entire duration of the respiratory cycle (e.g., the time (t) from Q<sub>1 </sub>to Q<sub>2 </sub>or the time (t) from Q<sub>2 </sub>to Q<sub>3 </sub>(not shown)) to identify a disordered breath. A threshold can be identified and applied so that a disordered breath is identified when the inspiratory period IP of the corresponding respiratory cycle (extending from Q to Q for the measured IP) is 40% or more of the entire observed respiratory cycle. In the exemplary embodiment, disordered breathing can be identified with the use of a variety of thresholds. For example, a disordered breath can be identified when an observed respiratory cycle or breath provides a time period for the entire cycle or breath and it is determined that the inspiratory period of that cycle or breath has a inspiratory time period that is 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, or 60% of the time period for the entire cycle or breath. In particular, disordered breathing can be identified when the inspiratory period occupies 40% or more, 45% or more, 50% or more, 55% or more, or 60% or more of the time period for the entire respiratory cycle corresponding to the observed inspiratory period.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the waveform <b>5531</b> which is based on an airflow measurement can be used to identify disordered breathing in a manner similar to that described above for waveform <b>5521</b> or, as described further below, can be used to support or confirm the identification of disordered breathing detected by, for example, the impedance measurement generating waveform <b>5521</b>. For example, waveform <b>5531</b> can characterize a non-limited breath (B<sub>NL</sub>) extending between minimum Q<sub>3 </sub>and minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>with a peak P disposed between the two minimums. As illustrated, the inspiratory period IP<sub>3 </sub>(extending from minimum Q<sub>3 </sub>to the subsequent peak P) measured by an airflow sensor may correspond with or be offset from similar measurements taken with another technique (such as that shown in waveform <b>5521</b>). As with waveform <b>5521</b>, the non-limited breath B<sub>NL </sub>can be observed to have an inspiratory period IP<sub>3 </sub>that occupies a portion of the entire period of inspiration extending from minimum Q<sub>3 </sub>to minimum Q<sub>4</sub>. In a later disordered flow-limited breath B<sub>FL </sub>(extending between minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>and minimum Q<sub>5</sub>) the peak P of the breath may not be well defined because the patient is drawing in less air as breathing is attempted but not fully achieved, which is characterized in the waveform <b>5531</b> as a peak P that is spread over a plateau or as a peak P followed by a plateau. As with the non-limited breath B<sub>NL</sub>, the flow-limited breath B<sub>FL </sub>can be observed to have an inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>that occupies a portion of the entire period of inspiration extending from minimum Q<sub>3 </sub>to minimum Q<sub>4</sub>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the flow-limited inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>can be the time period between the first minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>of the respiratory cycle to the first detection of a peak P to indicate the time period over which the patient is achieving breath intake, with a short breath-intake time (compared to earlier breaths or a threshold) indicating disordered breathing. Alternatively, the flow-limited inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>can be the time period between the first minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>of the respiratory cycle and the end of the plateaued peak P value to indicate an entire time over which the patient is attempting to take breath, with a long attempted-breath time (compared to earlier breaths or a threshold) indicating disordered breathing. The flow-limited inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>can be compared to the time period for the entire disordered breath extending from the first minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>to the next minimum Q<sub>5</sub>. As described for waveform <b>5521</b>, the normal breath B<sub>NL </sub>or normal inspiratory period IP<sub>3 </sub>can be compared to the disordered breath B<sub>FL </sub>or disordered inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>to identified the presence of disordered breathing indicated by the observed increase in the amount of time needed to draw in a breath. Also similar to waveform <b>5521</b>, the time associated with the disordered inspiratory period IP<sub>4 </sub>can be compared to the time associated with the disordered breath B<sub>FL </sub>as a whole to provide a percentage of time of the respiratory cycle that is occupied by breath intake or attempted breathing. For disordered inspiratory periods IP<sub>4 </sub>extending from a first minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>to the first identification of a peak P value, a short-breath intake time that is 40% or less of the entire breath cycle (minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>to minimum Q<sub>5</sub>) can indicate disordered breathing. For disordered inspiratory periods IP<sub>4 </sub>extending from a first minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>to the last identification of a peak P value, an extended-breath intake time that is 60% or more of the entire breath cycle (minimum Q<sub>4 </sub>to minimum Q<sub>5</sub>) can indicate disordered breathing. Similar to waveform <b>5521</b>, these thresholds can vary. For example, the short-breath intake time threshold can be 40% or less, 41% or less, 42% or less, 43% or less, 44% or less, 45% or less, 46% or less, 47% or less, 48% or less, 49% or less, or 50% or less. Similarly, the extended-breath intake time threshold can be 60% or more, 59% or more, 58% or more, 57% or more, 56% or more, 55% or more, 54% or more, 53% or more, 52% or more, 51% or more, or 50% or more.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the detection of disordered breathing with the technique illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> can be used to start or increase the level of a nerve stimulation therapy. The therapy can be started when the patient falls asleep, after the activation of a timer, or after a preset period of time, and the therapy can continue at a first level until disordered breathing is detected, after which the stimulation therapy can be increased for a time period corresponding to the detected disordered breathing event or for a preset period of time. Alternatively, the therapy can be started when the patient provides instruction that sleep is to commence, after the detection of a sleep status of the patient, or after the activation of a timer, and the therapy can continue with the delivery of no stimulation or a minimum level of stimulation, and the stimulation can be turned on to an effective level only when disordered breathing is detected or anticipated.

Paradoxical breathing can occur when the chest expands in an attempt to inspire air when the airway is obstructed, causing the abdomen to contract, resulting in the upper body maintaining a constant or near constant volume until the obstruction is resolved. When multiple signals obtained from sensors located at different parts of the chest are analyzed, the impedance signal between two vectors can be found to be out of phase, thus indicating paradoxical breathing and the presence of an obstructed airway. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref>, the same respiration cycles are presented of the same time period (t) as an airflow waveform <b>5540</b>, an impedance vector A waveform <b>5541</b> configured to detect chest expansion, and an impedance vector B waveform <b>5542</b> configured to detect abdomen contraction. As illustrated, as disordered breathing is observed in the airflow data as time (t) progresses, the data illustrated in the vector A waveform <b>5541</b> (chest) diverges from the data illustrated in the vector B waveform <b>5542</b> (abdomen), and a comparison of the absolute values of the two waveforms <b>5541</b> and <b>5542</b> exhibits that there is difference that can be correlated to a disordered breathing event. As illustrated, a patient can transition from a period of normal breathing B<sub>N </sub>to a period of flow-limited breathing B<sub>FL</sub>, and then to a period of obstructed breathing B<sub>O</sub>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref> illustrates a breathing signal in the vector A waveform <b>5541</b> (chest) that increases in magnitude over time (t), indicating that the chest is continuing to expand to greater and greater levels as the patient begins a period of disordered breathing. The figure also illustrates a similarly timed breathing signal in the vector B waveform <b>5542</b> (abdomen) that decreases in magnitude over the same time (t) period as the vector A waveform <b>5541</b>, indicating that the abdomen is expanding to lesser and lesser levels as the patient begins a period of disordered breathing. A comparison of the airflow waveform <b>5540</b>, the vector A chest waveform <b>5541</b>, and the abdomen vector B waveform <b>5542</b> indicates the presence of paradoxical breathing that begins in the time period corresponding to flow-limited breathing B<sub>FL </sub>and that becomes fully realized in the time period corresponding to obstructed breathing B<sub>O</sub>. As described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>, a nerve stimulation therapy can be applied when paradoxical breathing is detected or anticipated, or when divergence is observed between a chest respiration measurement (such as vector A) and an abdomen respiration measurement (such as vector B). The therapy can also be based on a comparison of absolute values for the peaks (or other corresponding portions of the waveforms <b>5541</b> and <b>5542</b>) to provide a value representing a difference between the vector A and vector B measurements. As can be appreciated, the value representing the difference can be compared to a threshold, and the threshold can be a predetermined value or a percentage as compared to earlier breathing cycles. For example, paradoxical breathing can be identified when the aforementioned value (difference between vectors A and B) is 50% or more of the magnitude of an earlier peak magnitude observed during the period of normal breathing B<sub>N</sub>, or to value can be 40% or more, 45% or more, 55% or more, or 60% or more. Similarly, paradoxical breathing can be identified when the vector B value is a certain percentage of the vector A value, such as when the vector B value is 50% or less of the vector A value, or when the vector B value is 40% or less, 45% or less, 55% or less, or 60% or less of the vector A value.

Some impedance vectors are known to invert during an obstruction event. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>15</b>D</figref>, a change in the polarity or the direction of a peak in the respiratory waveform, such as a peak M of the respiratory waveform <b>5550</b>, can be an indicator that the patient has an obstructed airway or is undergoing an OSA event.

In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>D</figref>, the waveform <b>5550</b> includes a series of peaks M that reduce in magnitude over time as the vector C approaches an inversion a point <b>5551</b>, which then leads to a series of anti-peaks or minima M&#x2032; caused by the signal inversion.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>15</b>E</figref>, as the airway collapses to a greater degree with each successive breath, the impedance peaks M will over time progressively increase in magnitude until an arousal from sleep occurs at arousal peak M<sub>ar</sub>, leading to a period of hyperventilation and then leading to hypoventilation (both indicated by HV) and reduced respiratory effort starting at shallow peaks M<sub>sh</sub>. After this period of hyperventilation and hypoventilation HV, the disordered breathing pattern begins again with the presence of flow-limited breaths B<sub>FL</sub>, and then obstructed breaths B<sub>O</sub>, and then another period having a maximum impedance peak M<sub>ar&#x2032;</sub> followed by another period of hyperventilation and hypoventilation HV&#x2032; and shallow breathing peaks M<sub>sh</sub>. This trend or pattern of increasingly greater magnitudes in impedance peaks (the period of cyclic disordered breathing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>E</figref>), observed over several respiratory waveforms, indicates the degradation of the airway over time and the presence of disordered breathing. Taken together, the cycle starting with arousal peak M<sub>ar </sub>and ending with the next occurrence of another arousal peak M<sub>ar&#x2032;</sub> can define a period of cyclic disordered breathing P<sub>CDB</sub>. Blood oxygen saturation levels may also be measured. Blood oxygen saturation levels that fluctuate with approximately the same period P<sub>CDB </sub>may be indicative of disordered breathing corresponding to OSA. Similarly, EEG signal fluctuation at approximately the same frequency may also be indicative of disordered breathing corresponding to OSA. An observation or detection of a period of cyclic disordered breathing P<sub>CDB </sub>can be used to indicate a need for elevated therapy or can be used to increase a nerve stimulation therapy to provide greater levels of stimulation in response to the detected cycle or in response to future anticipated arousal peaks M<sub>ar</sub>. Similarly, the time period associated with the P<sub>CDB </sub>can be analyzed with different therapies or titrations to identify whether changes to the therapy are effective or beneficial to the patient, with longer P<sub>CDB </sub>cycles indicating an improvement because greater time is realized between consecutive arousal peaks M<sub>ar</sub>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">It should be appreciated that a plurality of respiratory cycles may be analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>F</figref>), with aspects of one or more of the respiratory cycles over a first time period being compared to aspects of one or more of the respiratory cycles over a second time period.

Additionally, or alternatively, a breathing pattern may be identified over a first time period, which may be indicative of disordered breathing corresponding to OSA. Identifying repetitions of the breathing pattern in subsequent time periods may confirm the occurrence of the disordered breathing. Stated differently, identifying repetitions in subsequent time periods may increase the confidence in determining the disordered breathing. For example, if the breathing pattern repeats once, sequentially, the occurrence of the disordered breathing may be confirmed, increasing the confidence in determining the occurrence.

An external signaling device can be used by the patient to indicate that sleep is planned, and timers or the counting of respiratory cycles can be employed to determine whether a period of low variability in the respiratory waveform amplitude and time period has been maintained sufficiently long enough to identify the onset of sleep.

When deep sleep states are detected, such as with the techniques described above, the stimulation therapy can be provided at a level that is greater than the level tolerated when the patient was awake, and at a level that is greater than the stimulation levels useable in other sleep states (because the stimulation levels in these other sleep states will arouse the patient).

Over several such cycles of high amplitude followed by low amplitude stimulations, the increased amplitudes in this cycle can be progressively increased or decreased to identify the maximally-effective stimulation amplitude, i.e., the maximum stimulation amplitude at which further amplitude increase produces no benefit.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In another exemplary embodiment, the electrode configuration can be adjusted with field steering techniques to produce different stimulation electrical fields. The electrode configurations and electrical fields that can be implemented may be stored in a memory available to the neurostimulator, or pre-selected by an operator, and made useable during the stimulation therapy. When a disordered breathing event is detected, the neurostimulator can cycle through the available electrode configurations and electrical fields to determine which provide better efficacy, improved disruption of disordered breathing events, and less arousal from sleep. The best of the cycled configurations and fields can be implemented by the device in accordance with a protocol preset in the neurostimulator or selected by the operator or user, and the response of the patient to the stimulation can be recorded for further analysis to establish future stimulation therapies. As can be appreciated, the cycling of predefined or preselected electrode configurations and electrical fields can also be accomplished without input from a sensor or analysis of a respiratory waveform, with the cycling put into effect according to a schedule or in response to a parameter that is not a function of the respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In yet another exemplary embodiment, the delivery of the stimulation waveform <b>5000</b> can be adjusted to improve efficacy and reduce power consumption. The stimulation waveform can be changed to a different stimulation waveform in a subsequent delivery of the stimulation waveform, to provide an isolated difference in therapy or to define a pattern or cycle of stimulation waveforms that provide a therapy not achieved with a single waveform. Various stimulation waveforms can be stored in a memory available to the neurostimulator, or pre-selected by an operator, and made useable during the stimulation therapy. When providing a stimulation therapy, the neurostimulator can provide stimulation using a single stimulation waveform A that is provided for each respiratory cycle, to provide a pattern that is A-A-A-A-A and so on. Alternatively, the neurostimulator can provide stimulation using a single stimulation waveform A that is provided at every other respiratory cycle with a series of non-stimulation respiratory cycles disposed between each stimulated respiratory cycle, or provide stimulation with two stimulation waveforms with one being the aforementioned stimulation waveform A and the other being a null stimulation waveform 0 that has zero or a non-therapeutic amplitude, to provide a pattern that is A-0-A-0 and so on. In another alternative, two or more stimulation waveforms (e.g., a stimulation waveform A and a stimulation waveform B) can be implemented and configured to alternate with each other in a pattern or in a cycle that is repeated, to provide a pattern that is A-B-A-B and so on. In an exemplary embodiment, stimulation waveform A may be a square waveform, and stimulation waveform B may be a triangular waveform or any other suitable waveform of a differing parameter. In a further example stimulation waveform A may have a first amplitude and stimulation waveform B may have a second amplitude different than the first amplitude. In yet another alternative, three waveforms (that may include the null waveform 0) can be implemented to provide a pattern that is A-B-0-A-B-0 and so on. As described above, the variation of the delivery of the stimulation waveform can be evaluated by analyzing the effect the stimulation has on the respiratory waveform. As also described above, the best of the stimulation waveform configurations can be implemented by the device in accordance with a protocol preset in the neurostimulator or selected by the operator or user, and the response of the patient to the stimulation can be recorded for further analysis to establish future stimulation therapies. As can be appreciated, the cycling of predefined or preselected stimulation waveform patterns can also be accomplished without input from a sensor or analysis of a respiratory waveform, with the cycling put into effect according to a schedule or in response to a parameter that is not a function of the respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">It is known that the severity of the OSA affecting an individual can change over time due to the progression of the OSA, changes to the underlying causes of the apnea, and the introduction of new factors affecting sleep quality. For example, over time a person suffering OSA may be affected by changes in age, diet, medications, and BMI and influenced by factors affecting sleep or respiration such as seasonal allergies, respiratory illness and colds, diseases or medications affecting sleep and breathing, dietary or medication changes, onset of menopause in women, anxiety, and insomnia. Each of these factors taken alone or together can lessen or worsen the apnea and the efficacy of some stimulation therapies. The above-described respiratory breathing monitoring and therapy administration and adjustment techniques can be employed to identify and react to changes in the patient's OSA condition over time. The identification of the changes can be achieved by scheduling regular re-optimizations of the stimulation therapy by, for example, using the aforementioned alternative-stimulation cycling techniques to re-evaluate the efficacy of the current and alternative stimulation therapies. In another approach, a history of comparable respiratory waveforms can be maintained or a parameter derived from historical respiratory waveforms that characterizes the waveform over a time period, such as the calculation of a range of median impedance amplitudes over a moving three-month window from which it can be determined that the window is progressively tightening, expanding, or moving to a higher or lower amplitude value or range of values to indicate a progression of the OSA disease state. Once changes are identified, the therapy can be adjusted to account for the changes and the progression of the OSA disease state. For example, the stimulation can be adjusted by identifying and implementing a new or modified stimulation therapy identified by, for example, the above-described cycling of alternative stimulation therapies. In another example, the stimulation system can report to the user or caretaker the reduced efficacy of the current therapy and/or the need for a re-optimization of the current therapy. In additional exemplary embodiments, when the stimulation system employs a stimulation therapy that allows for incremental increases in the stimulation amplitude and the increases are found to be implemented every night to a specific level, the stimulation system can be configured to adjust the amplitude baseline in expectation of the continued need for the increased amplitude in following sleep periods. In another exemplary embodiment, if the stimulation system is configured to determine and does determine that the bio-impedance respiration sensor is detecting that some levels of stimulation are potentially causing arousals from sleep or an increase in arousals from sleep, the stimulation therapy can be adjusted to decrease amplitude or a signal can be provided to the user or caretaker recommending further evaluation or the reduction of stimulation levels.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is known that sleep position can influence the likelihood of a person having a disordered breathing event. For example, the airways of some individuals with OSA are more collapsible when sleeping in the supine position. As a result, greater levels of stimulation may be needed to minimize obstructive breathing when the patient is sleeping in an OSA-aggravating position, such as the supine position. Sleep position can be detected with a bio-impedance respiration sensor, an implanted accelerometer, or an external sensor communicating with the implanted stimulation device. When an OSA-aggravating sleep position is detected, the stimulation therapy can be modified using the above-described methods to increase the stimulation up to a level at which arousal from sleep is expected or detected, or to a pre-set maximum level. In another exemplary embodiment, the above-described cycling of stimulation therapies can be performed when an OSA-aggravating sleep position is detected to identify a stimulation therapy that is more effective for certain sleep positions. In a similar manner, the position and movement of the stimulated tongue, stimulated with a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, can be evaluated for efficacy in regard to sleep position to identify an appropriate stimulation therapy and to identify an effective field steering technique suitable for the sleep position.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">It has been observed that the time spent sleeping in the N3 and REM sleep stages is often insufficient for patients suffering OSA. The detection of the amount of time spent in these and other stages of sleep can be used to adjust therapy to promote longer periods of sleep in under-utilized sleep states. The implanted bio-impedance sensor or other sensors, for example, can be used to detect sleep state using the methods described above, and the stimulation therapy can be adjusted or cycled through several stimulation therapies to promote certain stages of sleep, the entry into desired sleep stages, and the extension of time in desired sleep stages. For example, by cycling through different or selected stimulation therapies when the patient is in an under-utilized sleep state, as described above, stimulation parameters can be identified that disrupt, promote, and have no effect on the evaluated sleep state. When it is determined that one or more stimulation parameters, or a change to one or more stimulation parameters, typically results in longer periods of REM sleep, for example, as compared to other stimulation parameters, those parameters can be correlated and used to affect the desired sleep state in future sleep periods. Also, stimulation waveforms can be selected and implemented that utilize the parameters identified as having a positive influence on the entry into or the maintenance of a desired sleep state. Likewise, stimulation waveforms can be selected and implemented that avoid or minimize parameters identified as having a negative influence on the maintenance of a desired sleep state or that cause the premature exit from a desired sleep state. As can be appreciated, the correlation between stimulation waveforms and sleep state can be a factor among other factors in the optimization of a patient's stimulation therapy, or in the selection of default settings for the stimulation therapy.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Patient Control of Stimulation</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Clinical studies have suggested that patient control of stimulation parameters can promote positive outcomes for patients being treated for OSA with a neurostimulator device. Patient control can facilitate proper stimulation therapy levels during therapy titration and in regular use, and can facilitate the implementation of therapy adjustment in response to patient circumstances night to night. Patient control can include control of stimulation parameters, stimulation intensity, the ability to stop and start therapy, the ability to pause or delay therapy, adjustment of automatic start or stop times of the stimulation therapy, the lag time between the delivery of a therapy command and the start of therapy (to account for the time it takes the patient to fall asleep), duration of the stimulation therapy, and the ability to change stimulation waveforms or to cycle through different stimulation waveforms. Patient control of stimulation therapy can be through an interface device such as patient controller <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and can include a display and a feedback device that is visual, auditory, or haptic, or a combination of these. Patient control can also be provided in a context established by the care provider, with the patient's options for adjustment of the stimulation therapy limited by constraints defined by the care provider or limited to pre-determined modes established by the care provider. The patient's control can also be subject to mode changes that reset the device to a predetermined safe mode or stimulation therapy starting point, or reduce stimulation in predetermined increments, when there is an indication that the stimulation therapy has been poorly adjusted by the patient. These indications of a poor adjustment of the stimulation therapy can include excessive patient control adjustments, excessive manual pause, and frequent patient arousals.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, it has been observed that the stimulation amplitude levels required to prevent disordered breathing during an initial PSG study (which may be used to define initial stimulation therapy target levels) may be at a stimulation level that is uncomfortable for the patient at the initial stage of therapy. It has also been observed that a patient receiving a stimulation therapy over time may later no longer be bothered by stimulation levels that were initially uncomfortable during the PSG or initial use of the neurostimulator, which may be the result of the stimulated muscles becoming stronger in response to the stimulation. Progressive increases in stimulation amplitudes and other related parameters as the patient acclimates to the sensation of therapy can assist with the initiation of stimulation therapy, and assist with the re-initiation of stimulation therapy after a significant pause or reduction in stimulation levels. By allowing the patient control of the stimulation therapy, the patient can determine when he or she is ready for a higher level of stimulation towards a target therapy level determined at the PSG. To simplify, and limit, the patient's control of the stimulation, the stimulation therapy and related parameters can be subject to programmed guidelines. Those programmed guidelines can be established by the care provider and can include, for example, a limit on the number of adjustments that the patient can make over a pre-determined time period, such as a limit on the number of incremental increases or decreases allowed each day so as to avoid severe changes in the stimulation therapy levels. In another example, the maximum stimulation levels available to the patient can be limited to guidelines or programmed by the caretaker to prevent drastic changes to stimulation therapy parameters over predefined time periods.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, a therapy plan <b>6000</b> is shown in which the patient can incrementally increase stimulation levels or be subject to a predefined incremental increase in stimulation levels (of, e.g., stimulation amplitude, intensity, or pulse width) over a period of time (weeks) until reaching a normal therapy level (N). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, an exemplary patient may receive the implanted neurostimulator in the first week of therapy <b>6001</b> and the use of the neurostimulator during surgery can provide a baseline stimulation level <b>6002</b> that achieves the opening of the airway. At weeks <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> (<b>6003</b>), the patient may undergo an evaluation or a PSG (at an awake comfort level determined in an office visit (<b>6004</b>) or at a night PSG amplitude needed for mitigation of OSA events (<b>6005</b>)) that determines that the patient's stimulation therapy comfort level is significantly less than a target level <b>6005</b> determined by a PSG. Further evaluation of the patient can determine that a target level <b>6005</b> is required to mitigate the occurrence of disordered breathing events and OSA. The patient may then be started on a stimulation therapy (at an initial level <b>6010</b>) that is tolerable but insufficient to fully mitigate disordered breathing events. Over several weeks (weeks <b>4</b>-<b>9</b>), the stimulation level can be incrementally increased manually (at <b>6011</b>, <b>6012</b>, and <b>6013</b>) in response to patient commands as the patient learns to tolerate each stimulation level, or in accordance with an automated increase (<b>6011</b>, <b>6012</b>, and <b>6013</b>) that can be defined by the patient or physician. As illustrated at week <b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the patient may reach a point where the stimulation becomes intolerable when the neurostimulator is operating at the therapeutic stimulation level. For example, the patient's muscles may strengthen as therapy continues until reaching a stimulation level or point <b>6020</b> where the strengthened muscle contractions cause discomfort. In another example, the patient may be exposed to stress, diet, or drug related factors that reduce the patient's ability to tolerate the stimulation therapy. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the patient control allows the patient to incrementally decrease the stimulation level (at <b>6022</b>) to regain a tolerable level <b>6024</b> of therapy, or to allow an automatic decrease in the stimulation level automatically in response to, for example, an excess number of arousals or therapy pauses during a sleep period. Likewise, when the patient believes that the therapeutic stimulation level <b>6024</b> is insufficient or becomes insufficient, patient control allows the stimulation level to be increased temporarily or permanently (at <b>6026</b>). The level N after the increase <b>6026</b> may indicate normal therapy use by the patient, and may be substantially equal to the target level <b>6005</b>. As described above, patient control can be limited by a context defined by the caretaker or in accordance with pre-programmed limitations built into the neurostimulator. Parameters subject to patient control can include stimulation amplitude (including current, voltage, pulse width, and frequency), duration of a pause in the stimulation therapy, rate of ramping after a pause, duration of a delay after a manual start of stimulation therapy, ramping rate after a manual start, the setting of core hours for the stimulation therapy amplitude, and the setting of a schedule for the core hours of stimulation therapy.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The way in which stimulation therapy sessions are started and stopped are significant factors affecting the efficacy of the therapy. The start of therapy can be based on a preset time after the patient indicates that sleep is planned, or according to a sleep schedule programmed into the neurostimulator. With patient control, the patient can adjust the timing so that additional time can be had when it is difficult to fall asleep, and schedules can be adjusted by patient control to account for a disrupted sleep schedule when travelling for example. Patient control can also provide control as to how a therapy starts or stops. The starting of the therapy can be automatic or manual depending on the patient's preference. Likewise, the cessation of therapy can be automatic when arousal is detected or when commanded by the patient. Patient control over therapy timing can also include control over the duration of a therapy delay and the rate of ramping at the end of a delay or pause. Patient control can also be provided over whether the neurostimulator will automatically suspend therapy if there is detection of an arousal from sleep (by the above-described respiratory waveform analysis or with the use of a motion detector, for example). Patient control can also be provided to control whether the stimulation amplitude can be increased during core hours and to what degree and duration the increase can be implemented. Patient control can also be provided to control as to whether an arousal from sleep will suspend or terminate a therapy, which can be useful when a patient forgets to shut off the therapy after awaking and the stimulation therapy resumes after the patient has left a home environment or to a location that does not provide access to the patient controller.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Stimulation Therapy Optimization</heading><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The stimulation system can be configured to automatically or semi-automatically adapt to optimize the stimulation therapy. In an exemplary embodiment, the amplitude can be adjusted to elicit a dose-metric airflow response. When obstructive breathing is detected, the stimulation amplitude may be increased automatically in an attempt to mitigate the OSA events. The nominal amplitude may be preferentially at a lower level to save battery life or prevent unwanted arousals from sleep. Increasing stimulation amplitude and the probability of an arousal is typically an acceptable risk trade-off to achieve resumption of unobstructed breathing. The following amplitude parameters can be adjusted: stimulation amplitude, stimulation intensity, current, voltage, pulse width, and frequency of pulse train. The signals used to indicate that stimulation amplitude may be increased or decreased to optimize therapy can include signals from a bio-impedance detector, which may identify disordered breathing and allow adjustments that cause the progressively incremental increase of stimulation levels until a pre-set maximum level is reached or until the disordered breathing is no longer detected. Another exemplary signal from a bio-impedance sensor can be used to identify the existence of arousals from sleep coincident with when stimulation is active without the detection of disordered breathing, which can be used to progressively decrease the stimulation amplitude until the arousals are no longer detected. In another exemplary embodiment, a signal from an implanted accelerometer may indicate the presence of disordered breathing or the presence of arousals, which can be used to increase or decrease the stimulation amplitude to mitigate arousals. A signal from a pause counter can count the number times the patient pauses or reduces a high level of stimulation which can be used to decrease the therapy levels if the behavior continues for a set number of nights. Conversely, the lack of pause detection, combined with detection of disordered breathing may be used to increase the stimulation amplitude. In another exemplary embodiment, an external home diagnostic sensing (PSG) signal can be telemetered to the implanted device to allow the determination as to whether the stimulation amplitude should be increased or decreased. This can be accomplished by having the PSG signals fed into a bed-side unit designed to do further processing of the signals and then telemetering the signal to the implanted system. Examples of signals from a PSG diagnostic system can include: airflow, motion detection, snore sensors, electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), Effort (Belts) and other typical PSG signals.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In an exemplary embodiment, the hypoglossal nerve stimulation system can maintain a log of the number of pauses in sequence and provide a determination that the patient is not able to fall asleep before the resumption of stimulation with the programmed pause duration or the programmed rate of ramping (as stimulation is resumed after a pause). The system (and the neurostimulator) can be configured to automatically increase the duration of the pauses or increase the length of the ramp to compensate. This may continue to be increased until a pre-set value(s) is reached or until the system no longer detects a series of pauses by the patient. Conversely, if the implanted bio-impedance sensor, an accelerometer, or an external PSG sensor detect the presence of sleep before the completion of a pause period, the pause period can then be automatically shortened or the therapy automatically resumed. This is desirable since increasing the amount of time stimulation is delivered during sleep will reduce the number of obstructive events and improve the patient's OSA therapy. Similarly, the system can provide an automatic adjustment of the duration of a pause to automatically increase the amount of time stimulation is delivered by progressively decreasing the duration of the delay.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In another exemplary embodiment, the start and stop times of certain core hours (programmed to provide a greater amplitude during predetermined times during a sleep period) can be adjusted to increase the amount of the sleep period covered by this higher amplitude setting when the start time is advanced with no arousals from sleep detected. Similarly, the stop time of the core hours can be extended progressively, provided no arousals from sleep are detected as a result. Conversely, if arousals are detected after the initiation of the core hours, the start time of core hours may be progressively delayed until arousals are not detected. Stop times of core hours may also be foreshortened if arousals are detected prior to the normal stop time for the elevated core hours amplitude.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">As can be appreciated, and as described above, a normal stimulation delivery algorithm can include a stimulation period delivered with each breath, primarily covering inspiration (in an A-A-A-A pattern). The stimulation pattern can be manually adjusted by the patient (within pre-set limitations by the physician or by programming), by the physician, or automatically by the neurostimulator if it is determined that a desired level of effectiveness is not being achieved. Some exemplary stimulation patterns or algorithms can include an A-0-A-0 pattern, an A-B-A-B pattern, a A-B-0-A-B-0 pattern, and a variety of others. It is believed that the insertion of some non-stimulated breaths into sequences of stimulated breaths may help to trigger the patient's own physiological response to flow limitation. It is further believed that this may increase the inherent tone of the muscles responsible for patency that would add to the tone created by the functional stimulation from the implanted system. This may include the same muscles stimulated by the functional stimulation such as the genioglossus or other muscles such as the pharyngeal dilators.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Screening Methods</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Patients with obstructive sleep apnea have repeated episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) upper airway collapse during sleep.

The posterior pharyngeal wall <b>1150</b> is relatively fixed to the spinal column. Thus, collapse of the upper airway generally involves, depending on the level and mode of collapse, the tongue <b>1122</b>, the soft palate <b>1138</b> and/or the lateral walls <b>1144</b> and <b>1148</b>, or any combination thereof. In addition, or alternatively, collapse may involve the nasopharynx and/or hypopharynx (not shown).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The present disclosure offers a method to stimulate various upper airway structures and to observe and assess the effects thereof. The method generally involves causing the tongue <b>1122</b> to protrude while observing the response of the upper airway using an imaging technique. In general, the desired response is an increase in airway size. An adequate increase in airway size during the tongue protrusion maneuver is indicative of likely therapeutic success with HGNS. If an adequate increase in airway size is observed during the maneuver, a HGNS device may be implanted in the patient with a higher confidence of a successful outcome.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>, a naso-endoscope <b>400</b> or any other suitable imaging or visualization device, may be used to visually observe the upper airway while the patient is awake in the supine position. Alternatively, the observation may be made while the patient is in a seated or semi-recumbent position. A conventional naso-endoscope <b>400</b> including a fiber optic shaft <b>410</b> and a hand piece <b>420</b> may be used. Hand piece <b>420</b> may include a light source and a viewing window, and/or facilitate connection to ancillary imaging equipment (e.g., light source, camera, monitor, recorder, etc.). The patient may be asked to volitionally protrude his/her tongue <b>1122</b> straight and to its maximal extent with the mouth open and the lips loosely touching the tongue. Alternatively, the tongue protrusion may be performed sub-maximally, which may limit muscle contraction to the genioglossus <b>1124</b> without recruiting other musculature. Also alternatively, the tongue protrusion may be performed by asking the patient to point the tip of the tongue <b>1122</b> to one side or the other, which may more closely mimic unilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation. The distal end of the endoscope <b>400</b> may be positioned superior to the soft palate <b>1138</b> and substantially parallel with the posterior pharyngeal wall <b>1150</b> to visualize the retro-palatal space <b>1142</b>. The distal end of the endoscope <b>400</b> may be positioned inferior to the soft palate <b>1138</b>, superior to the tongue base and substantially parallel with the posterior pharyngeal wall <b>1150</b> to visualize the retro-glossal space <b>1140</b>.

As can be seen by comparing the views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>B and <b>18</b>C</figref>, tongue protrusion can result in an increase in airway size, including area, circumference, anterior-posterior dimension, and lateral dimension. The increase in airway size at the level of the tongue <b>1122</b> and palate <b>1138</b> may be most discernable by an increase in anterior-posterior (AP) dimension between the posterior pharyngeal wall and the posterior side of the tongue base (retro-glossal) and soft palate <b>1138</b> (retro-palatal), respectively. Since the posterior pharyngeal wall <b>1150</b> is fixed relative to the spinal column, the increase in AP dimension involves anterior displacement of the tongue <b>1122</b> and soft palate <b>1138</b>, respectively. The increase in airway size may also be discernable by an increase in lateral dimension between the right and left lateral pharyngeal walls <b>1144</b> and <b>1148</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">During the tongue protrusion maneuver, observing an adequate increase in size of the retro-glossal airway <b>1140</b> is predictive of HGNS efficacy in patients with isolated tongue base collapse.

With the patient awake in the supine position, a nasal endoscope <b>400</b>, or other suitable device, may be inserted into the pharynx via one of the nares to allow visualization of the upper airway. Video and still images may be captured at both the retro-palatal and retro-glossal levels LV<sub>RPS </sub>and LV<sub>RGS </sub>to document the effect of different maneuvers on anatomic structures of the upper airway (tongue <b>1122</b>, palate <b>1138</b>, epiglottis, pharyngeal walls <b>1144</b>, <b>1148</b>, and <b>1150</b>, etc.). When imaging the retro-palatal level LV<sub>RPS</sub>, the endoscope <b>400</b> may be placed such that all four walls (soft palate <b>1138</b>, posterior wall <b>1150</b>, and the two lateral walls <b>1144</b> and <b>1148</b>) of the pharynx are visible before, during and after maneuvers. Similarly, when imaging the retro-glossal level LV<sub>RGS</sub>, the endoscope <b>400</b> may be placed such that all four walls (tongue base, posterior wall <b>1150</b>, and the two lateral walls <b>1144</b> and <b>1148</b>) of the pharynx are visible before, during and after maneuvers. The endoscope <b>400</b> may be placed such that it runs generally parallel to the posterior wall <b>1150</b> and provides a symmetric field of view. This may be achieved by initially placing the distal end of the endoscope <b>400</b> near the level of the epiglottis and subsequently pulling back to the desired level. The patient then performs a series of maneuvers, including a tongue protrusion maneuver while breathing through their nose. The tongue protrusion maneuvers involves voluntary maximal straight tongue protrusion with lips loosely touching the tongue <b>1122</b>, with the mouth completely open, and/or with the teeth clenched closed. Other maneuvers such as a Mueller maneuver (inspiratory efforts against a closed airway) may be performed as well. Each maneuver is held for 2 seconds, and performed several times while data (images and measurements) are gathered.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Alternative non-volitional tongue protrusion maneuvers include, for example, manually gripping and pulling the tongue <b>1122</b> anteriorly (e.g., by the physician), using a tongue retaining device (e.g., as used for the treatment of OSA), both of which are non-invasive. Another alternative is to stretch the palatoglossal arch by pushing the tongue <b>1122</b> down (depress tongue), by pushing the arch laterally outward, or by pulling the arch anteriorly (all palatoglossal maneuvers) using a tongue depressor or similar device. The palatoglossal maneuver may be used in place of or in combination with the tongue protrusion maneuver, and the entire description herein with respect to the tongue protrusion maneuver is applicable to the palatoglossal maneuver. Other alternative non-volitional tongue protrusion maneuvers include, for example, sub-mental stimulation and intra-muscular stimulation (using fine wire electrodes, for example), both of which are relatively more invasive, but have the benefit of more selectively activating the genioglossus muscle alone to more closely mimic HGNS, as compared to volitional tongue protrusion which may recruit more than the genioglossus muscle <b>1124</b>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although naso-endoscopy is perhaps the most practical imaging technique to employ to assess the response of the upper airway to the tongue protrusion maneuver, other imaging techniques may be used as well. For example, x-ray imaging, fluoroscopy, x-ray computed tomography (CT), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are suitable alternatives. These alternatives may provide more quantitative measurements by using a reference marker of known dimension in the field of view. Alternatively, improvements may be made to conventional naso-endoscopes to facilitate more quantitative measurements. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>, conventional naso-endoscope <b>400</b> includes a fiber optic shaft <b>410</b> and a hand piece <b>420</b>. The distal end of the shaft <b>410</b> may be improved by including an attached extension <b>430</b> having a tip <b>440</b>. The extension <b>430</b> positions the tip <b>440</b> into the field of view and may be approximated to the upper airway structure being visualized. The tip <b>440</b> may have a known dimension (e.g., diameter of 1 French or 3 mm), such that quantitative measurements of upper airway structures may be made by comparison. Other devices to make quantitative measurements may be employed, such as a laser pointer of know beam diameter projected onto the upper airway structure of interest. As an alternative, a catheter (e.g., nasogastric, nasoesophageal or nasopharyngeal catheter) may be inserted into the nasopharynx such that it resides in the field of view of the endoscope to serve as a quantitative reference of known dimension (e.g., diameter).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">As mentioned above, the upper airway assessment during a tongue protrusion maneuver may be used as a screening tool wherein the patient is treated with the desired therapy (e.g., HGNS) only if the increase in size of the upper airway meets a predefined criterion. To this end, the response of the upper airway may be measured using a qualitative scale such as a visual analog scale of 0-10, wherein 0 represents a closed airway and 10 represents a completely open or patent airway. The airway size may be scored with the tongue at rest and during the tongue protrusion maneuver. The patient may be treated if the difference between the two scores meets a threshold, if the score during the maneuver meets a threshold, or if both the difference between the scores and the score during the maneuver meet thresholds (e.g., 5 on a scale of 0-10).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Alternatively, the response of the upper airway may be measured using a quantitative scale such as: a pixel count of captured images which may be representative of cross-sectional area; a linear dimension such as anterior-posterior and/or lateral; or a measure of circumference. Here again, the airway size may be measured (e.g., pixel count, AP length (i.e., the distance between the anterior and the posterior walls of the upper airway), and/or lateral width) with the tongue at rest and during the tongue protrusion maneuver. The patient may be treated if the difference between the two measures meets a threshold, if the measure during the maneuver meets a threshold, or if both the difference in measures and the measure during the maneuver meet thresholds.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In each case, the threshold may be a percentage increase in size (e.g., difference in AP length=50%), an absolute value (e.g., difference of AP length=0.5 cm), or a relative value. The relative value may be with reference to an anatomical landmark such as the width of the superior aspect of the epiglottis (e.g., difference in AP length=50% of epiglottal width).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Other response criteria observed during the tongue protrusion maneuver, in addition to an increase in airway size, may be used as well. For example, movement of the hyoid bone may be observed visually, by palpation or by x-ray. Movement of the hyoid bone in an anterior direction and/or inferior direction during the tongue protrusion maneuver may be predictive of therapeutic success with HGNS.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Optionally, it may be desirable to observe the response of the airway at the level of collapse. The level of collapse may be determined during sleep or simulated sleep (e.g. sedation) using known techniques such as drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), or may be determined by examination of the airway structures using known techniques such as naso-endoscopy. In some embodiments, the airway may be observed using imaging and visualization methods that do not require subjecting the patient to drug induced sleep. Stated differently, portions of the upper airway may be observed while the patient is awake or asleep, regardless of whether such sleep is drug induced or natural. In non-drug induced imaging methods, the upper airway may be visualized or otherwise monitored via e.g., magnetic imaging resonance. Further, flow sensors may be utilized to observe or otherwise monitor the patency of the upper airway. The airway may collapse at the level of the tongue base (i.e., retro-glossal), at the level of the palate (i.e. retro-palatal), or both levels. In some cases, airway collapse may occur in portions of the airway further away from the soft palate and towards the epiglottis. Such portions may include the oropharynx and/or hypopharynx. Because most OSA patients have palatal involvement in airway collapse, it may not be necessary to determine the level of collapse. In this case, collapse may be assumed to occur at least at the level of the palate, and therefore an adequate response (e.g., increase in airway size) in the retro-palatal space during the tongue protrusion maneuver would be indicative of likely therapeutic success with HGNS.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Typically, candidates for HGNS therapy are those who (1) do not experience palatal complete concentric collapse (CCC), in which the circular airway at the level of the soft palate uniformly moves radially inward toward the center of the airway; and (2) do experience anterior-posterior collapse (APC) of the upper airway, in which the anterior wall moves towards the posterior wall, such as due to posterior movement of the tongue while the patient sleeps. Wall collapse, however, may occur in configurations other than APC which may nevertheless render a patient a candidate for HGNS treatment. For example, HGNS may be used to treat patients, provided they do not experience palatal CCC, in whom at least one wall of the airway moves towards a central axis of the airway. Thus, candidates for HGNS therapy include those who experience lateral-lateral collapse (LLC), in which at least one first lateral wall moves towards at least one second lateral wall. LLC may occur independently, in which at least one lateral wall moves inwardly, or jointly, in which multiple lateral walls move inwardly, for example.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Candidates also include those who experience a predetermined ratio of APC and LLC. For example, HGNS patients include those who experience a 1:1 ratio of APC and LLC, in which, for example, the patient experiences 50% APC and 50% LLC. Further, HGNS patients may include those individuals that experience a 2:1 ratio of APC and LLC. For example, an anterior wall may move inwardly twice as much as a lateral wall. Patients that experience LLC where two lateral wall movements move inwardly by approximately the same amount as anterior wall (or the posterior wall) may also experience a 2:1 ratio, since the movement of both lateral walls may combine to collectively constrict or otherwise reduce the patency of the patient's airway.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">As disclosed above, HGNS may be used to treat patients intolerant of CPAP, provided they do not experience palatal CCC. Complete concentric collapse at other levels, however, may also exclude patients from HGNS treatment. For example, as alluded to above, airway constriction may occur along the upper airway moving away from the soft palate towards the epiglottis. Patients who experience CCC at the hypopharynx and/or velopharynx levels may be excluded from HGNS treatment. Moreover, collapse at the palatal, hypopharynx, and/or velopharynx level below CCC may exclude patients from HGNS treatment.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">The observation methods disclosed herein may be used to observe any of the types of wall movement disclosed herein. For example, these observation methods may be used to observe CCC, anterior-posterior movement, lateral-lateral movement, and any combination thereof, including ratios of APC to LLC. Moreover, these observation methods may be used to observe movement at various levels, including the palatal, hypopharynx, and/or velopharynx levels.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Screening criteria to select individuals who are more likely to respond to HGNS may include DISE-identified APC of the upper airway as well as movement of the lateral walls along with anterior-posterior movement, provided that the lateral movement does not exceed: (i) the anterior-posterior movement; (ii) 50% of the anterior-posterior movement; or (iii) other % of the anterior-posterior movement. As another example, screening criteria may include DISE-identified CCC combined with awake endoscopy demonstrating anterior-posterior movement with tongue protrusion.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Once an INS is implanted into a patient, parameters, such as, e.g., stimulation parameters, may be adjusted by the patient or via automatic settings programmed into the device to increase the effectiveness of the treatment and patient comfort. For example, the INS may include a library of settings which the patient may adjust or selectively choose, wherein each setting includes a set of parameters established by the patient's physician and programmed into the device. The set of parameters for each setting option in the library may include, for instance: voltage, current, pulse width, field steering options, frequency of stimulation, stimulation waveform type, timing of stimulation relative to respiration, pattern of stimulation, and/or any of the combination of parameters mentioned above with reference to cycling. Additional parameters may include adjusting initiating or triggering of stimulation. For example, a patient or provider may selectively choose to offset stimulation relative to, e.g., the beginning of inspiration. Stated differently, stimulation may be started a predetermined time period (e.g., 300 ms) prior to or after the initiation of inspiration or a prediction of inspiration. The list of library setting options may be selected automatically by the implanted device based on feedback of body position, disordered breathing, and other indications of effectiveness such as number of pauses, body movement, and arousals from sleep.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">The pattern of stimulation may be chosen, for example, from A-A-A-A (e.g., a continuous pulse train) and A-O-A-O-A (e.g., an on, off, on, off, etc. stimulation pulse patent). In another embodiment, the pattern of stimulation may include, for example, A-A&#x2032;-A-A&#x2032;. In such an example, &#x201c;A&#x201d; may be a first pulse having a first amplitude and &#x201c;A&#x2032;&#x201d; may be a second pulse having a second amplitude different than the first amplitude. In another embodiment, the pattern of stimulation may include, for example, A-B-A-B. In such an example, &#x201c;A&#x201d; may include a first waveform, such as, for example, a square waveform, and &#x201c;B&#x201d; may include a second waveform different from the second waveform, such as, e.g., a triangular waveform. In one embodiment, the INS device is provided with four selection options for the patient to adjust: amplitude, pulse width, frequency, and a fourth variable, wherein the fourth variable is chosen from one of the set of parameters listed above. In addition, the disclosed treatment system may be provided with an option to selectively activate or otherwise energize one or more desired electrode cuffs of a plurality of electrode cuffs, which may be implanted on differing upper airway nerves or on various portions/branches of a single upper airway nerve (e.g., the hypoglossal nerve). In such embodiments, the patient, via patient controller <b>40</b>, may be able to selectively choose which electrode cuffs they wish to energize. In embodiments where multiple electrode cuffs are implanted at multiple stimulation sites, stimulation may be performed independently of any feedback, such as, e.g., respiration sensing.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">From the foregoing, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure provides, in exemplary non-limiting embodiments, devices and methods for nerve stimulation for OSA therapy.
