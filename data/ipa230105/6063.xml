In addition, the protective film <b>23</b> covering the gate insulating film <b>17</b>, the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b>, and the pair of electrodes <b>21</b> is provided.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The protective film <b>23</b> provided over the transistor <b>10</b> shown in this embodiment is an oxide insulating film containing oxygen in excess of the stoichiometric composition. It is preferable that the protective film <b>23</b> contain a larger amount of oxygen than that of oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b>. Such an oxide insulating film containing oxygen in excess of the stoichiometric composition is an oxide insulating film from which part of oxygen is released by heating. Thus, when the oxide insulating film from which part of oxygen is released by heating is provided as the protective film <b>23</b>, oxygen is diffused into the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> by performing heat treatment, so that oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> can be filled. As a result, the amount of oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> is reduced, the threshold voltage of the transistor can be prevented from shifting in the negative direction. Further, a shift in the threshold voltage with time or a shift in the threshold voltage due to a gate BT stress under light is small; thus, the transistor can have excellent electric characteristics.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the transistor <b>10</b>, some oxygen contained in the protective film <b>23</b> directly transfers to the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b>, and further some oxygen in a region where the gate insulating film <b>17</b> is in contact with the protective film <b>23</b> transfers to the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> through the gate insulating film <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, as for the protective film <b>23</b>, the spin density of a signal at g=2.001, measured by electron spin resonance, is preferably lower than 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>spins/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>spins/cm<sup>3</sup>. When the spin density of the protective film <b>23</b> is within the above range, defects at the interface between the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> and the protective film <b>23</b> and defects in the protective film <b>23</b> can be reduced; electron traps in such regions can be reduced. As a result, as electric characteristics of the transistor, the rising voltage of the on-state current is the substantially same even when the drain voltage varies. In other words, a transistor with excellent electric characteristics can be provided. Note that the above spin density of the protective film <b>23</b> is a value obtained after heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As the protective film <b>23</b>, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or the like can be formed to have a thickness greater than or equal to 30 nm and less than or equal to 500 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 100 nm and less than or equal to 400 nm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other details of the transistor <b>10</b> are described below.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">There is no particular limitation on the property of a material and the like of the substrate <b>11</b> as long as the material has heat resistance enough to withstand at least heat treatment to be performed later. For example, a glass substrate, a ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, or the like may be used as the substrate <b>11</b>. Alternatively, a single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate made of silicon, silicon carbide, or the like, a compound semiconductor substrate made of silicon germanium or the like, an SOI substrate, or the like may be used as the substrate <b>11</b>. Furthermore, any of these substrates further provided with a semiconductor element may be used as the substrate <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Still further alternatively, a flexible substrate may be used as the substrate <b>11</b>, and the base insulating film <b>13</b> and the transistor <b>10</b> may be provided directly on the flexible substrate. Alternatively, a separation layer may be provided between the substrate <b>11</b> and the base insulating film <b>13</b>. The separation layer can be used when part or the whole of a semiconductor device formed over the separation layer is separated from the substrate <b>11</b> and transferred onto another substrate. In such a case, the transistor <b>10</b> can be transferred to a substrate having low heat resistance or a flexible substrate as well.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Typical examples of the base insulating film <b>13</b> are films of silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, silicon nitride oxide, gallium oxide, hafnium oxide, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, aluminum oxynitride, and the like. When silicon nitride, gallium oxide, hafnium oxide, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, or the like is used for the base insulating film <b>13</b>, diffusion of impurities such as alkali metal, water, or hydrogen from the substrate <b>11</b> to the oxide semiconductor film <b>19</b> can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gate electrode <b>15</b> can be formed using a metal element selected from aluminum, chromium, copper, tantalum, titanium, molybdenum, and tungsten; an alloy containing any of these metal elements as a component; an alloy film containing these metal elements in combination; or the like. Further, one or more metal elements selected from manganese and zirconium may be used. Further, the gate electrode <b>15</b> may have a single-layer structure or a stacked structure of two or more layers. For example, a single-layer structure of an aluminum film containing silicon, a two-layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over an aluminum film, a two-layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over a titanium nitride film, a two-layer structure in which a tungsten film is stacked over a titanium nitride film, a two-layer structure in which a tungsten film is stacked over a tantalum nitride film or a tungsten nitride film, a three-layer structure in which a titanium film, an aluminum film, and a titanium film are stacked in this order, and the like can be given. Alternatively, a film, an alloy film, or a nitride film which contains aluminum and one or more elements selected from titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, neodymium, and scandium may be used.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The gate electrode <b>15</b> can also be formed using a light-transmitting conductive material such as indium tin oxide, indium oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium zinc oxide containing tungsten oxide, indium oxide containing titanium oxide, indium tin oxide containing titanium oxide, indium zinc oxide, or indium tin oxide to which silicon oxide is added.

Note that the film deposition is accompanied with the formation of the crystal parts or followed by the formation of the crystal parts through crystallization treatment such as heat treatment.

Therefore, an oxide having a composition of In&#x3e;Ga has higher mobility than an oxide having a composition of In Ga.

The barrier film <b>733</b> may be formed as a layer that is separate from the wiring <b>734</b><i>a</i>, or may be formed in such a manner that a barrier film material contained in a wiring material is separated out by heat treatment to the inner walls of the openings provided in the insulating film <b>731</b>.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0321">For the insulating film <b>731</b>, it is possible to use an insulator such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), phosphosilicate glass (PSG), silicon oxide to which carbon is added (SiOC), silicon oxide to which fluorine is added (SiOF), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) which is silicon oxide made from Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ), organosilicate glass (OSG), or an organic-polymer-based material. In particular, in the case of advancing miniaturization of the semiconductor device, parasitic capacitance between wirings is significant and signal delay is increased. Therefore, the relative permittivity of silicon oxide (k=4.0 to 4.5) is too high, and it is preferable to use a material with k=3.0 or less. In addition, since CMP treatment is performed after the wiring is embedded in the insulating film, the insulating film needs to have high mechanical strength. As long as their mechanical strength can be secured, the insulating film can be made porous to have a lower dielectric constant. The insulating film <b>731</b> is formed by a sputtering method, a CVD method, a coating method including a spin coating method (also referred to as spin on glass (SOG)), or the like.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0322">An insulating film <b>732</b> may be provided over the insulating film <b>731</b>.

The barrier film <b>735</b> can be formed using an insulating material such as silicon nitride, SiC, or SiBON. However, when the barrier film <b>735</b> is thick, capacitance between wirings is increased; thus, a material having barrier properties and a low dielectric constant is preferably selected.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0324">The wiring <b>734</b><i>a </i>is connected to a wiring <b>723</b> provided in a lower layer than a barrier film <b>724</b> through a contact plug <b>730</b><i>a</i>.
