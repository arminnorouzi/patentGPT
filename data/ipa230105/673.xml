The counterbalance mechanism includes a balance beam pivotably mounted on a support block, with the laser head and a counterweight mounted on its two ends. The counterweight is movable along the balance beam via a linear motion bearing. A mechanical link links the counterweight to the support block; the link has a predefined length and is pivotable around its respective connection points on the support block and the counterweight.

In one exemplary application, a laser beam delivery head of an ophthalmic laser system is typically heavy and needs to be counterbalanced so as to inhibit gravity-induced movement and to inhibit transfer of gravity-induced forces to the patient's eye coupled to the laser head.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More specifically, in an ophthalmic laser system, a laser beam delivery head contains various optical elements to deliver a laser beam to the patient's eye. A patient interface device of the laser head is mechanically coupled to the eye, with the patient in a supine position. The patient interface device typically includes a flexible suction ring to securely attach the patient interface device to the surface of the eye. Some patient interface devices also include a contact lens (also referred to as an applanation lens) that contacts the cornea surface of the eye, where a downward applanation force is applied by the applanation lens to applanate the cornea during the surgery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The laser head in such ophthalmic laser systems are moveable in at least the vertical direction. Various types of mechanisms for counterbalancing the weight of the laser head have been described. Some such systems employ a spring mechanism for counterbalance. For example, U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2016/0310317, entitled &#x201c;Free Floating Patient Interface for Laser Surgery System,&#x201d; describes z axis springs implemented by metal tapes wound around spring loaded bearing spools as the counterbalance mechanism. Some other systems use a counterweight. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,337,490, entitled &#x201c;Apparatus for Movable and Weight-Compensating Suspension of a Focusing Objective of a Laser System,&#x201d; describes a counterweight on a lever arm of a rocker, where a counterweight can be shifted manually along the lever arm so as to change the effective force application point of the counterweight and thus the effective counterforce moment.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a counterbalance mechanism, in particular, a counterbalance mechanism in an ophthalmic laser system for counterbalancing the laser beam delivery head.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a counterbalance mechanism that allow the large weight of the laser head to be counterbalanced while providing small, precise and repeatable variations in net load (force) exerted by the laser head on the patient's eye over a defined distance of travel of the laser head.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the descriptions that follow and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

The counterbalance mechanism allows the large load of the laser head to be counterbalanced, while providing a small, precise and repeatable variation in net load (force) over a defined distance of travel of the laser head in the vertical direction. As described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the counterbalance mechanism employs a balance beam that supports a counterbalance weight on a linear motion bearing. A geometric linkage varies the mechanical advantage of the weight and precisely varies the counterbalancing force to provide the variation in the net load.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the counterbalance mechanism <b>10</b> includes a support block <b>11</b> and a balance beam <b>12</b> pivotably supported by the support block <b>11</b> via a fulcrum (pivot) <b>13</b>. The laser head, i.e., the object being counterbalanced, is mounted at a first end <b>12</b>A of the balance beam <b>12</b>, preferably by a vertical linear bearing to allow the laser head to maintain a vertical orientation when the balance beam <b>12</b> pivots. The laser head, which contains various optical elements, is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to avoid obscuring parts of the counterbalance mechanism, but the force it exerts on the balance beam <b>12</b> is indicated as the &#x201c;LOAD&#x201d; by the downward arrow.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A counterweight <b>14</b> is mounted on the balance beam <b>12</b> near the second end <b>12</b>B via a linear motion bearing <b>15</b>, so that the counterweight is able to move along the balance beam with negligible friction, as indicated by the double headed arrow. The linear motion bearing <b>15</b> may be implemented by any suitable mechanical components, such as rollers, slides, etc. The linear motion bearing <b>15</b> may include a first block <b>15</b>A affixed to the counterweight <b>14</b> and a second block <b>15</b>B affixed to the balance beam <b>12</b> near the second end <b>12</b>B, the two blocks being moveable relative to each other along the direction of the balance beam.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The counterweight <b>14</b> is further linked to the support block <b>11</b> by a mechanical link <b>16</b>, which may be implemented by a rigid member of any suitable shape, for example, a rod. One end of the link <b>16</b> is pivotably connected to the support block <b>11</b> by a first connection assembly <b>16</b>A, at a location above the fulcrum <b>13</b>, and the other end of the link is pivotably connected to the counterweight <b>14</b> by a second connection assembly <b>16</b>B. It should be noted that the two connection points of the link <b>16</b> that are respectively connected to the support block <b>11</b> and counterweight <b>14</b> are not required to be at the two ends of the link <b>16</b>, and the link is not required to have a straight shape; the operative geometric property of the link <b>16</b> is the length of the link, i.e., the linear distance between the two connection points. The connection assemblies <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B allow the link <b>16</b> to pivot around the respective axes of the connection assemblies. As will be described in detail later, the locations of the rotation axes of the two connection assemblies and the length of the link <b>16</b> partially determine the counterbalancing properties of the counterbalance mechanism. The length of the link <b>16</b> is fixed during an ophthalmic surgery, but may be adjustable for the purpose of system adjustment, e.g., to adjust the zero point of the balance beam <b>12</b>, as will be described in more detail later. The adjustable length of the link <b>16</b> may be implemented, for example, by using a threaded rod with nuts at either or both ends.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the location of the connection assembly <b>16</b>A on the support block <b>11</b> is directly above the pivot <b>13</b> in the vertical direction; the location of the connection assembly <b>16</b>B on the counterweight <b>14</b> is above the balance beam and is offset from the center of gravity of the counterweight in the direction parallel to the balance beam. The connection locations of the link <b>16</b> is not limited to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operating principle of the counterbalance mechanism is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. The diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically represents the geometric configuration of various components of the counterbalance mechanism of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a side view. Line AB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> represents the balance beam <b>12</b>, where point A represents the point where the load L acts on the balance beam. Point C represents the fulcrum <b>13</b> where the balance beam <b>12</b> is pivotably attached to the support block <b>11</b>. Line DE represents the link <b>16</b>, where point D represents the rotation axis of the connection assembly <b>16</b>A on the support block <b>11</b>, and point E represents the rotation axis of the connection assembly <b>16</b>B on the counterweight <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The position of the counterweight <b>14</b> relative to the balance beam <b>12</b> may be defined as the perpendicular projection of a defined point on the counterweight onto the balance beam. In this example, it is defined as the perpendicular projection of the center of gravity of the counterweight (point F) onto the balance beam, as indicated by point X. Point X is a fixed point with respect to the counterweight <b>14</b> but is variable along the balance beam <b>12</b> (line AB), as the counterweight <b>14</b> is moveable along the balance beam via the linear motion bearing <b>15</b>. Note here that when the balance beam <b>12</b> is horizontal, as is in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, point X is also the point where the weight M of the counterweight acts on the balance beam.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">During operation, the weight M of the counterweight <b>14</b> is fixed; the orientation and length of line CD are fixed (it need not be vertical); and the lengths of line AC, line DE, and line EX are fixed. The angle CDE and angle DEX are variable (as the link <b>16</b> is pivotable around the connection assemblies <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B); the angle DCX is variable (as the balance beam <b>12</b> is pivotable around the fulcrum <b>13</b>); and the angle EXC is fixed. The length of line CX is variable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Given the above geometric constraints, the position of point X varies as a function of the angle DCB, i.e. the pivot angle of the balance beam <b>12</b>. For example, from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (where line AB is horizontal and point D is located above point C), if line AB rotates in the counter-clockwise direction around the pivot point C, point X will move away from the pivot C. Conversely, if line AB rotates in the clockwise direction, point X will move toward the pivot C. In other words, when the balance beam <b>12</b> pivots around the fulcrum <b>13</b>, the counterweight <b>14</b> will slide along the balance beam via the bearing <b>15</b> due to the geometric constraint imposed by the link <b>16</b>. In the meantime, when the balance beam <b>12</b> pivots, the point at which the weight M of the counterweight acts on the balance beam also shifts away from point X. The combined result of these movements and shifts is that the lever arm length for the counterweight M changes. This means, in turn, that the amount of load L required to balance the counterweight M changes. As will be described in more detail later, this results in a change of the applanation force exerted on the patient's eye.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The precise relationship between the pivot angle of the balance beam <b>12</b> and the change of load required to balance the counterweight M is determined by the geometry of the counterbalance mechanism. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> schematically illustrate a counterbalance mechanism that has a simpler geometry, showing how the lever arm length of the counterweight changes with the pivot angle of the balance beam. In this simpler geometry, point E, point F and point X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> collapse to the same point X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>. This may be achieved, for example, by lowering the center of gravity of the counterweight <b>14</b> to coincide with the balance beam <b>12</b>, and connecting the second end <b>16</b>A of the link <b>16</b> to a point that coincides with the center of gravity. This simpler geometry is used here as an example to illustrate the general working principle of the counterbalance mechanism.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the counterbalance mechanism is adjusted such that when the balance beam AB is horizontal (with the line CD being vertical, and the angle DCB=90&#xb0;), the counterweight M and the load L balance each other. This is referred to as the zero point. At the zero point, the length l<sub>1 </sub>of line CX, i.e. the lever arm length for the counterweight M, is:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>l</i><sub>1</sub>=&#x221a;{square root over (<i>r</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;h</i><sup>2</sup>)}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0036" num="0000">where r is the length of line DX (i.e. the length of the mechanical link) and h is the length of line CD.

The counterbalancing mechanism can be design to have its zero point at any given pivot angle. What is important is the fact that the required load changes with the pivot angle of the balance beam <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0037">For a more complex geometry, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the geometric analysis will be modified accordingly to calculate the required load as a function of the pivot angle &#x3b1;. Such analysis and calculation may be performed by those of ordinary skill in the mechanical art, based on the descriptions in this disclosure, without undue experimentation. A counterbalance mechanism can have any geometry, so long as the above-described geometric constraints are met.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0038">For an ophthalmic laser system, the counterbalance mechanism is designed so that the patient interface device of the laser head exerts a downward force on the eye (referred to as the applanation force) during surgery. Thus, the load acting at the first end of the balance beam <b>12</b> is the sum of the weight (downward) of the laser head and a force (upward) exerted by the eye on the laser head (i.e. the counterforce of the applanation force). Because different patients and different ophthalmic procedures may require different amounts of applanation force, the goal of the counterbalance mechanism is to provide a desirable amount of applanation force that can be precisely controlled by varying the pivot angle of the balance beam.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0039">The counterbalance mechanism may be designed so that when the balance beam <b>12</b> is at a predefined pivot angle (e.g., horizontal), the applanation force is a predefined amount. When the balance beam <b>12</b> pivots away from the predefined angle, the additional load <b>4</b>F required to balance the counterweight <b>14</b> results in a change in the applanation force exerted on the eye, because the weight of the laser head is constant. In the geometry shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, for example, pivoting of the balance beam <b>12</b> in the counter-clockwise direction results in a positive (i.e. downward) additional load being required to maintain balance, which results in a decrease in the applanation force on the eye. Conversely, pivoting of the balance beam <b>12</b> in the clockwise direction results in a negative (i.e. upward) additional load being required, which results in an increase in the applanation force on the eye. Thus, the counterbalance mechanism allows the amount of applanation force on the eye to be adjusted by changing the pivot angle of the balance beam <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0040">The pivot angle &#x3b1; is related to the vertical distance s from point A to point C by:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>cos &#x3b1;=<i>s/l</i><sub>0</sub>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0060" num="0000">Here, the vertical distance s is defined as positive when point A is below point C. The vertical distance s may be referred to as the vertical travel of the laser head. Thus, the property of the counterbalance mechanism may also be expressed as a relationship between the applanation force and the vertical travel of the laser head. When h*cos &#x3b1;&#x3c;&#x3c;l<sub>1</sub>, the equation of &#x394;F becomes:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>F=M*h*s/l</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0062" num="0000">In other words, when &#x3b1; is near 90&#xb0;, the applanation force varies linearly with the vertical travel s and the slope of the linear relationship is determined by the geometry of the counterbalance mechanism.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0041">It should be noted that a change in the vertical travel of the laser head does not have to result in a change in the distance between the patient's eye and the laser head. This is because the support block <b>11</b> may itself be mounted on another movement system to allow it to move vertically. For example, the counterbalance mechanism may be located within a gantry of the laser system, with the support block fixedly attached to the gantry and the laser head partly protruding from the gantry. The gantry is supported by a movement system to allow it to move relative to the laser system's outer frame in at least the vertical direction, and preferably also in the horizontal directions. This movement system can facilitate docking of the laser head to the patient's eye in preparation for surgery. The movement system may be implemented by any suitable mechanical structure, such as rails, pivotable arms, telescoping arms, etc. In addition, the patient support bed that the patient is situated on may also be adjustable in height, which can change the distance between the eye and the laser head. Thus, for any given vertical travel of the laser head relative to the support block, the laser head and the patient's eye can be made to remain at a proper distance from each other for the patient interface device to engage the eye. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram that illustrate the relationship of the counterbalance mechanism <b>10</b>, the laser head <b>17</b>, the gantry <b>21</b>, the movement system <b>22</b> and the frame <b>23</b> of the laser system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0042">In summary, a counterbalance mechanism according to embodiments of the present invention can have any geometry so long as the earlier-described geometric constraints are met. This allows for great freedom in designing the counterbalance mechanism to meet various requirements that may be imposed by practical considerations such as the size of the laser head.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0043">In one particular example, the counterweight is M=5 kg, the lever arm of the load is l<sub>0</sub>=100 mm, the lever arm of the counterweight at zero point is l<sub>1</sub>=200 mm, the height of the connecting point of the link from the fulcrum h is about 39.5 mm (more generally, in the range of 35-45 mm), and the length of the link r is about 203.9 mm (more generally, in the range of about 203-205 mm). The applanation force is set at about 100 g at zero vertical travel of the laser head, and the change in applanation force &#x394;F is about 28-30 g per 1 mm change in vertical travel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0044">Various modifications may be made to the counterbalance mechanism described above. For example, although the balance beam <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> is straight, it may alternatively have a bent (angled) or curved shape.

The connection point <b>16</b>B of the link <b>16</b> on the counterweight <b>14</b> may also be located below the balance beam <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0045">In other alternative embodiments, the counterweight may be moved with an actuator, where the movement is controlled based on the desired amount of load, the desired position of the laser head, the desired applanation diameter, etc.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0046">The counterbalance mechanism described above is applicable to any system that requires precise load variation as a function of distance of travel over a defined range.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates the geometric configuration (side view) of a counterbalance mechanism for a laser head in an ophthalmic laser system according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The counterbalance mechanism <b>50</b> includes a balance beam <b>52</b> supported by a fulcrum (pivot) <b>53</b>. The laser head (LOAD) is attached to the balance beam <b>52</b> near the first end.
