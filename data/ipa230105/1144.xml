No. 63/218,161, entitled &#x201c;Non-Integrated Catheter System Having an Extension Set&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter hub, the catheter extending distally from the catheter hub, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increases. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample. Sometimes an instrument, such as a guidewire or tube, may be inserted through the catheter assembly to reduce or remove occlusions such as the fibrin sheath or thrombus and extend a life of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access devices and related systems and methods. More particularly, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to a catheter system that is non-integrated and includes an extension set. In some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to the extension set and/or related methods.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a catheter system may include a catheter assembly, which may include a catheter and a catheter adapter. In some embodiments, the catheter adapter may include a distal end and a proximal end aligned with the distal end. In some embodiments, the catheter system may be non-integrated, meaning the catheter adapter of the catheter system may not include a side port with an extension tube integrated with the side port. In these embodiments, the catheter adapter may be referred to as straight. In some embodiments, the catheter extending from the distal end of the catheter adapter. In some embodiments, the catheter may include a peripheral intravenous catheter, a midline catheter, or peripherally inserted central catheter. In some embodiments, the catheter may be inserted through skin of a patient and into vasculature of the patient at an insertion site via an introducer needle, which may be removed after the catheter is positioned within the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the catheter system may include an extension set, which may include a distal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of the extension set may include a first connector coupled to the proximal end of the catheter adapter. In some embodiments, the first connector may include a luer-lock connector, which may be threaded to facilitate securement with the catheter adapter. In some embodiments, the first connector may include a blunt cannula and/or one or more snap features, which may also facilitate securement with the catheter adapter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the extension tube may extend from a proximal extension proximate the first connector. In some embodiments, the proximal extension and the first connector may be monolithically formed as a single unit. In some embodiments, the proximal extension may be generally cylindrical. In some embodiments, a port may extend from a side of the proximal extension, and the extension tube may be integrated with the port.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the catheter system may include a second connector. In some embodiments, the catheter system may include an extension tube disposed between the first connector and the second connector. In some embodiments, a fluid pathway of the catheter system may extend through one or more of following: the catheter, the catheter adapter, the first connector, the extension tube, and the second connector. In some embodiments, the second connector may be configured to couple to an instrument advancement device and may facilitate instrument access to the catheter. In some embodiments, the extension tube may be short, which may decrease a length of an instrument of the instrument advancement device needed to extend through the catheter. In some embodiments, the extension tube and the second connector may provide a remote connection for the instrument advancement device, which may decrease a risk of disturbing the insertion site of the catheter. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may be coupled to a blood collection device such that the extension tube and the second connector may also facilitate blood collection at a remote location. In some embodiments, the extension set may include an anti-reflux valve, which may be disposed within the second connector.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the catheter system may include a stabilization platform, which may be disposed below the first connector for stability and to reduce movement of the catheter. In some embodiments, the stabilization platform may include a first wing and a second wing opposing the first wing, which may facilitate stabilization of the catheter assembly on the skin of the patient and may facilitate taping of the catheter assembly to the skin. In some embodiments, an upper surface of the stabilization platform may be coupled to the luer-lock connector. In some embodiments, the stabilization platform may be overfolded over one or more of the following: the extension tube, the luer-lock connector, and the proximal extension. In these and other embodiments, the stabilization platform may include an elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the stabilization platform may be separately molded and attached to one or more of the following: the extension tube, the luer-lock connector, and the proximal extension.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, a bottom surface of the stabilization platform may be arc-shaped, which may facilitate positioning and securement of the stabilization platform on a curved arm surface of the patient. In some embodiments, the catheter, the catheter adapter, the luer-lock connector, the second connector, and the extension tube may be axially aligned, which may facilitate insertion of the instrument of the instrument advancement device therethrough. In some embodiments, the instrument may include a tube, a guidewire, a probe, or another suitable instrument. In some embodiments, the instrument may include one or more sensors. In some embodiments, the instrument may be configured for blood sampling, fluid administration, sensing, light disinfection, or another purpose.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the extension set may include another extension tube longer than the extension tube, and the fluid pathway may extend through the other extension tube. In some embodiments, a clamp may be disposed on the other extension tube, and the other extension tube may be clamped off when not in use. Additionally, or alternatively, another clamp may be disposed on the extension tube, and the extension tube may be clamped off when not in use. In some embodiments, the other extension tube may facilitate remote connection with an infusion device or another suitable device, decreasing a risk of disturbing the insertion site of the catheter. In some embodiments, the other extension tube may extend in a proximal direction, which may facilitate movement of fluid from the other extension tube in a distal direction through the catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, a distal end of the other extension tube may be coupled to a third connector, and the third connector may be coupled to the second connector, which may provide a generally straight path for instrument advancement. In some embodiments, the other extension tube may extend from the stabilization platform. In some embodiments, the other extension tube may extend from the second connector. In some embodiments, an angle of the other extension tube with respect to the extension tube may be adjustable. In some embodiments, the angle may be adjustable between 15&#xb0; and 160&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the extension tube may be angled downwardly with respect to a longitudinal axis of the first connector, which may result in a lower profile catheter placement and smooth feeding and advancement of the instrument. In some embodiments, an angle between the longitudinal axis of the first connector and a longitudinal axis of the extension tube may be between 135&#xb0; and 180&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality illustrated in the drawings. It should also be understood that the embodiments may be combined, or that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural changes, unless so claimed, may be made without departing from the scope of the various embodiments of the present invention.
