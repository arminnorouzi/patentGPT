The tissue can be any biological construct (for example, graft, ligament, or tendon) that is employed for repairing a tendon or ligament, or similar anatomical structure. The reinforced tissue can be attached to any fixation device(s) and/or to any bone tunnel(s) or similar structures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A surgical construct can include a reinforcement material, a flexible coupler attached to the reinforcement material, and at least one eyelet. The eyelet allows the flexible coupler to form a knotless, tensionable, self-locking, adjustable loop and a splice, to lock the flexible coupler after proper graft suturing is completed (self-locking mechanism). The reinforcement material can be suture tape. The flexible coupler can be suture. The eyelet can be a shuttle/pull device, or part of a shuttle/pull device. The construct can be provided with holes or eyelets to facilitate suture passes through the reinforcement material with a suture passing instrument such as a needle. Additional fixation devices such as strands, anchors, buttons, implants, screws, plates, or suture loop/button constructs, among many others, can be attached to the flexible coupler and/or reinforcement material. A surgical construct can be knotless, self-locking, tensionable, adjustable, self-cinching.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A surgical assembly or surgical system can include a reinforcement material with a self-locking mechanism or tensionable construct (including an eyelet secured to a flexible coupler) and a fixation device attached to the reinforcement material. The fixation device can be an anchor, button, implant, screw, plate, suture loop/button construct, or combinations thereof. The fixation device can be a suspensory fixation device, such as TightRope&#xae; Attachable Button System (ABS), ACL TightRope&#xae; construct, or other button/suture loop constructs. The surgical assembly or system can be knotless, tensionable, self-locking, self-cinching.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A reinforced tissue construct can include a stitched region formed by employing (1) a piece of material; and (2) at least one self-locking flexible coupler attached to the piece of material and to an eyelet, the flexible coupler forming at least one locking splice after graft attachment is completed. The piece of material can be attached/affixed to at least a portion of tissue (graft, ligament, or tendon) to reinforce the tissue. The material can be any reinforcement or reinforcing material such as suture, tape, weave, ribbon, textile, or mesh that can be attached (sutured) to the tissue. The material can be attached to the tissue by suturing (for example, stitching such as whipstitching) or by any other affixing/attachment techniques, to provide additional fixation when implanted. The reinforced tissue (graft, ligament, or tendon) construct can be attached to additional fixation devices for various repairs such as ACL/PCL, Achilles, biceps, meniscus, labrum, patella, single limb, multi limb, cervical cerclage, wound closure, and joint capsule repairs and reconstructions, among many others. The reinforced tissue construct can be knotless, self-locking, tensionable.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Methods of forming knotless, self-locking, tensionable, reinforced tissue constructs having increased pull-out strength as well as methods of securing such tissue constructs in bone tunnels or sockets are also disclosed. An exemplary method of forming a knotless, self-locking, tensionable, reinforced tissue construct (reinforced biologic construct) comprises: (i) suturing or stitching tissue to a reinforcement material with at least one flexible coupler; and (ii) locking the at least one flexible coupler to the reinforcement material in a knotless manner. The locking can include forming a splice. The locking can include forming two or more splices with ends/limbs of the flexible coupler. The splice can be formed with a shuttle/pull device. The splice can be housed partially or totally within the reinforcement material. The reinforcement material can be a flat over-braided middle suture tape section with two longitudinal open lumens that protect and house splices that are used to lock the sutures after proper tissue suturing is completed. The reinforced construct can be attached to one or more fixation devices (for example, ACL Tightrope&#xae;, BTB Tightrope&#xae;, ABS Tightrope&#xae;, or other suture loop/button constructs) and/or any bone tunnel.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The surgical constructs provide simplified, knotless, self-locking, tensionable suturing systems and attachment of grafts, tendons, or ligaments to fixation devices using suturing techniques such as the &#x201c;rip-stop&#x201d; suturing technique, without knot formation and faster tissue reduction with a stronger and more reproducible repair. The surgical constructs can be provided as stand-alone surgical constructs, or they can be provided already attached to one or more fixation devices, for example, one or more implantable buttons, or may be subsequently attached to one or more fixation devices. The surgical constructs provide self-locking, knotless soft tissue to bone fixation, without knot formation, with fewer passing steps, increased fixation and uniform soft tissue compression.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings, where like elements are designated by like reference numerals, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>33</b></figref> illustrate exemplary surgical constructs <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>550</b>; surgical assemblies <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>; and methods of forming reinforced tissue construct <b>99</b> with such surgical constructs and assemblies.

Traditionally, grafts or tendons are stitched and knots are tied with remaining suture limbs. Surgical knots vary in strength and size and contribute to cyclic displacement and lower ultimate loads if tied improperly. A knotless solution (such as the one of the present disclosure) reduces user variation contributing to a stronger and more reproducible repair. Additionally, arthroscopic soft tissue repair and reconstruction is typically completed with the use of a suture passer to pass suture limbs through tissue when knots are tied on top of the reconstructed or repaired soft tissue. The combination (in the present disclosure) of a knotless suturing system with a suture passer provides for faster tissue reduction with a stronger and more reproducible repair. The present disclosure uses splicing coupled with multiple bifurcations (openings or eyelets) to allow needle passages and rip stop technology to be implemented into the final construct. The design of the &#x201c;Tag&#x201d; component is novel and includes two longitudinal open lumen sutures extending along the length of the flat over-braided middle suture tape section. The two longitudinal open lumen sutures protect and house the splices that are used to lock the sutures after proper graft suturing is completed. The bifurcations (through-holes or eyelets) allowing for the rip stop technology are not necessary for all embodiments of the device. Additionally, the two longitudinal sutures are not necessary as one-piece construction is possible and can be an effective solution. The two longitudinal sutures can be one element creating passage for the splices, connected at the tip to provide additional strength and construct rigidity. Multiple suturing methods can be achieved with integration of this technology into its final construct (e.g., whipstitch, Krackow, baseball, loop and tack, Bunnell, Kessler, Bauer, Strobel, etc.). In additional embodiments, the technology can be repeated in a serial fashion for wound repair with biologic or other technology incorporation. Possible repair indications include but are not limited to Achilles, biceps, ACL/PCL, meniscus, labrum, patella, single limb, multi limb, any reducing device, cervical cerclage, wound closure, joint capsule, etc.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Reinforcement material <b>20</b>, <b>20</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>b </i>can be formed of any suture, tape, weave, fabric, ribbon, textile, web, or mesh, or any combinations of these materials.
