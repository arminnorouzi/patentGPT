In some embodiments, the driver cap may attach to a top of the heat sink module. In some embodiments, the holder may attach to the heat sink module with the optical reflector and the LED light chip disposed between elements of the holder and elements of the heat sink module. In some embodiments, the heat sink module may be finned at various locations (of the heat sink module). In some embodiments, where the heat sink module may be finned at its upper portions, the heat sink module may have a larger diameter than its non-finned bottom portion, which in turn may provide for increased heat dissipation and greater lumens output. In some embodiments, the holder may screw upon the bottom portion of the heat sink module with the optical reflector and the LED light chip disposed between the holder and the heat sink module. In some embodiments, trim, such as MR16 sized trim, may attach to bottom flanges of the holder. In some embodiments, the integrated-lighting-module may be adjusted without interfering with the trim.
