The assets of each user are recorded in a ledger in a centralized database. The total amount of assets owned by a user recorded in a centralized ledger is called the total amount of assets belonging to the user. Assets of users held by the service provider are called valid user provisions. For example, on a blockchain-based digital assets service platform, the total amount of assets displayed in each of all user accounts is the total amount of assets belonging to users, and the total amount of blockchain-based assets that the platform service provider stores and has the right to control in a blockchain network is the valid user provisions. Since the user provisions can be disposed with no authority by the service provider and are beyond the supervision of common users, it is possible that the service provider uses the user provisions without the permission of users, causing the situation in which the valid user provisions are less than the total amount of assets belonging to users. This results in users's distrust of the digital assets service provider. The service provider can eliminate doubts from users and gain users' trust by proving that the valid user provisions held by itself are not less than the total amount of assets belonging to users on the platform in an effective way.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To overcome the defects in the prior art, the present invention provides a method for providing digital assets. By combining a mathematic algorithm and a computer, the present application provides a user with an entrusted method for verifying the valid user provisions and the total amount of assets of the user on the platform, while protecting the assets privacy of each of the users, to resolve the problems in prior art.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an exemplary embodiment, a method for proving digital assets of an asset transaction platform is described. The method includes identifying, by a server, all users on an asset transaction platform. The method also includes generating, by the server, a snapshot for each of the identified users at a first time instant. Each snapshot includes a user identity and a user assets amount for the user at the first time instant. The user assets amount for each user at the first time instant is a total amount of digital assets held by the user on the asset transaction platform at the first time instant. The method also includes transforming, by the server, each of the snapshots of the user identity and the user assets amount for the first time instant into a string combined hash value. Each string combined hash value is generated by hashing one of the snapshots of the user identity and the user assets amount for the first time instant. The method also includes generating, by the server, a merkle tree for the plurality of string combined hash values. The merkle tree includes a leaf node for each of the plurality of string combined hash values. The method also includes performing an audit process of the asset transaction platform for the first time instant. The audit process includes generating, for the first time instant, a valid user provision for the asset transaction platform. The valid user provision for the asset transaction platform for the first time instant is the total amount of digital assets held by the asset transaction platform at the first time instant. The audit process also includes verifying the user identity and user assets amount of each user on the asset transaction platform for the first time instant. The verifying includes generating a first hash for each user on the asset transaction platform for the first time instant. Each of the first hashes is a hash of the user identity and user assets amount for the user for the first time instant.
