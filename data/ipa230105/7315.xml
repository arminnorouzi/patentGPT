id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and device for transmitting or receiving a broadcast signal are discussed. The method for transmitting the broadcast signal can include processing one or more Internet Protocol (IP) packets into link layer packets, processing the link layer packets to output the broadcast signal, and transmitting the broadcast signal. The one or more IP packets can carry components of a service and service signaling information for signaling the components of the service. The broadcast signal can further include a service list table. The service list table can include one or more of service identification information for identifying the service, capabilities information related to the service, channel number information of the service, category information for indicating a type of the service, protocol information for representing a type of a protocol used to deliver the service signaling information.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="54.78mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230007316A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded

invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The detailed description, which will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings, is intended to explain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, rather than to show the only embodiments that can be implemented according to the present invention. The following detailed description includes specific details in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the terms used in the present invention are selected from generally known and used terms, some of the terms mentioned in the description of the present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her discretion, the detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein. Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood, not simply by the actual terms used but by the meanings of each term lying within.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present invention provides apparatuses and methods for transmitting and receiving broadcast signals for future broadcast services. Future broadcast services according to an embodiment of the present invention include a terrestrial broadcast service, a mobile broadcast service, an ultra high definition television (UHDTV) service, etc. The present invention may process broadcast signals for the future broadcast services through non-MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) or MIMO according to one embodiment. A non-MIMO scheme according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a MISO (Multiple Input Single Output) scheme, a SISO (Single Input Single Output) scheme, etc. The present invention proposes a physical profile (or system) optimized to minimize receiver complexity while achieving performance required for special uses.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing a protocol stack according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A service may be delivered to a receiver through a plurality of layers. First, a transmission side may generate service data. The service data may be processed for transmission at a delivery layer of the transmission side and the service data may be encoded into a broadcast signal and transmitted over a broadcast or broadband network at a physical layer.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Here, the service data may be generated in an ISO base media file format (BMFF). ISO BMFF media files may be used for broadcast/broadband network delivery, media encapsulation and/or synchronization format. Here, the service data is all data related to the service and may include service components configuring a linear service, signaling information thereof, non real time (NRT) data and other files.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The delivery layer will be described. The delivery layer may provide a function for transmitting service data. The service data may be delivered over a broadcast and/or broadband network.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Broadcast service delivery may include two methods.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As a first method, service data may be processed in media processing units (MPUs) based on MPEG media transport (MMT) and transmitted using an MMT protocol (MMTP). In this case, the service data delivered using the MMTP may include service components for a linear service and/or service signaling information thereof.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As a second method, service data may be processed into DASH segments and transmitted using real time object delivery over unidirectional transport (ROUTE), based on MPEG DASH. In this case, the service data delivered through the ROUTE protocol may include service components for a linear service, service signaling information thereof and/or NRT data. That is, the NRT data and non-timed data such as files may be delivered through ROUTE.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Data processed according to MMTP or ROUTE protocol may be processed into IP packets through a UDP/IP layer. In service data delivery over the broadcast network, a service list table (SLT) may also be delivered over the broadcast network through a UDP/IP layer.

A transmission side may transmit data from the network layer to the physical layer and a reception side may transmit data from the physical layer to the network layer (t<b>6010</b>). The purpose of the link layer is to compress (abstract) all input packet types into one format for processing by the physical layer and to secure flexibility and expandability of an input packet type which is not defined yet. In addition, the link layer may provide option for compressing (abstracting) unnecessary information of the header of input packets to efficiently transmit input data. Operation such as overhead reduction, encapsulation, etc. of the link layer is referred to as a link layer protocol and packets generated using this protocol may be referred to as link layer packets. The link layer may perform functions such as packet encapsulation, overhead reduction and/or signaling transmission.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">At the transmission side, the link layer (ALP) may perform an overhead reduction procedure with respect to input packets and then encapsulate the input packets into link layer packets. In addition, in some embodiments, the link layer may perform encapsulation into the link layer packets without performing the overhead reduction procedure. Due to use of the link layer protocol, data transmission overhead on the physical layer may be significantly reduced and the link layer protocol according to the present invention may provide IP overhead reduction and/or MPEG-2 TS overhead reduction.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">When the shown IP packets are input as input packets (t<b>6010</b>), the link layer may sequentially perform IP header compression, adaptation and/or encapsulation. In some embodiments, some processes may be omitted. For example, the RoHC module may perform IP packet header compression to reduce unnecessary overhead. Context information may be extracted through the adaptation procedure and transmitted out of band. The IP header compression and adaption procedure may be collectively referred to as IP header compression. Thereafter, the IP packets may be encapsulated into link layer packets through the encapsulation procedure.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">When MPEG 2 TS packets are input as input packets, the link layer may sequentially perform overhead reduction and/or an encapsulation procedure with respect to the TS packets. In some embodiments, some procedures may be omitted. In overhead reduction, the link layer may provide sync byte removal, null packet deletion and/or common header removal (compression). Through sync byte removal, overhead reduction of 1 byte may be provided per TS packet. Null packet deletion may be performed in a manner in which reinsertion is possible at the reception side. In addition, deletion (compression) may be performed in a manner in which common information between consecutive headers may be restored at the reception side. Some of the overhead reduction procedures may be omitted. Thereafter, through the encapsulation procedure, the TS packets may be encapsulated into link layer packets. The link layer packet structure for encapsulation of the TS packets may be different from that of the other types of packets.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">First, IP header compression will be described.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The IP packets may have a fixed header format but some information necessary for a communication environment may be unnecessary for a broadcast environment. The link layer protocol may compress the header of the IP packet to provide a mechanism for reducing broadcast overhead.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">IP header compression may employ a header compressor/decompressor and/or an adaptation module. The IP header compressor (RoHC compressor) may reduce the size of each IP packet header based on the RoHC scheme. Thereafter, the adaptation module may extract context information and generate signaling information from each packet stream. A receiver may parse signaling information associated with the packet stream and attach context information to the packet stream. The RoHC decompressor may restore the packet header to reconfigure an original IP packet. Hereinafter, IP header compression may mean only IP header compression by a header compression or a combination of IP header compression and an adaptation process by an adaptation module. The same is true in decompressing.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Hereinafter, adaptation will be described.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In transmission of a single-direction link, when the receiver does not have context information, the decompressor cannot restore the received packet header until complete context is received. This may lead to channel change delay and turn-on delay. Accordingly, through the adaptation function, configuration parameters and context information between the compressor and the decompressor may be transmitted out of band. The adaptation function may provide construction of link layer signaling using context information and/or configuration parameters. The adaptation function may use previous configuration parameters and/or context information to periodically transmit link layer signaling through each physical frame.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Context information is extracted from the compressed IP packets and various methods may be used according to adaptation mode.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Mode #1 refers to a mode in which no operation is performed with respect to the compressed packet stream and an adaptation module operates as a buffer.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Mode #2 refers to a mode in which an IR packet is detected from a compressed packet stream to extract context information (static chain). After extraction, the IR packet is converted into an IR-DYN packet and the IR-DYN packet may be transmitted in the same order within the packet stream in place of an original IR packet.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Mode #3 (t<b>6020</b>) refers to a mode in which IR and IR-DYN packets are detected from a compressed packet stream to extract context information. A static chain and a dynamic chain may be extracted from the IR packet and a dynamic chain may be extracted from the IR-DYN packet. After extraction, the IR and IR-DYN packets are converted into normal compression packets. The converted packets may be transmitted in the same order within the packet stream in place of original IR and IR-DYN packets.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In each mode, the context information is extracted and the remaining packets may be encapsulated and transmitted according to the link layer packet structure for the compressed IP packets. The context information may be encapsulated and transmitted according to the link layer packet structure for signaling information, as link layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The extracted context information may be included in a RoHC-U description table (RDT) and may be transmitted separately from the RoHC packet flow. Context information may be transmitted through a specific physical data path along with other signaling information. The specific physical data path may mean one of normal PLPs, a PLP in which low level signaling (LLS) is delivered, a dedicated PLP or an L1 signaling path. Here, the RDT may be context information (static chain and/or dynamic chain) and/or signaling information including information associated with header compression. In some embodiments, the RDT shall be transmitted whenever the context information is changed. In addition, in some embodiments, the RDT shall be transmitted every physical frame. In order to transmit the RDT every physical frame, the previous RDT may be reused.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The receiver may select a first PLP and first acquire signaling information of the SLT, the RDT, the LMT, etc., prior to acquisition of a packet stream. When signaling information is acquired, the receiver may combine the signaling information to acquire mapping between service-IP information-context information-PLP. That is, the receiver may check which service is transmitted in which IP streams or which IP streams are delivered in which PLP and acquire context information of the PLPs. The receiver may select and decode a PLP carrying a specific packet stream. The adaptation module may parse context information and combine the context information with the compressed packets. To this end, the packet stream may be restored and delivered to the RoHC decompressor. Thereafter, decompression may start. At this time, the receiver may detect IR packets to start decompression from an initially received IR packet (mode 1), detect IR-DYN packets to start decompression from an initially received IR-DYN packet (mode 2) or start decompression from any compressed packet (mode 3).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Hereinafter, packet encapsulation will be described.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The link layer protocol may encapsulate all types of input packets such as IP packets, TS packets, etc. into link layer packets. To this end, the physical layer processes only one packet format independently of the protocol type of the network layer (here, an MPEG-2 TS packet is considered as a network layer packet). Each network layer packet or input packet is modified into the payload of a generic link layer packet.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In the packet encapsulation procedure, segmentation may be used. If the network layer packet is too large to be processed in the physical layer, the network layer packet may be segmented into two or more segments. The link layer packet header may include fields for segmentation of the transmission side and recombination of the reception side. Each segment may be encapsulated into the link layer packet in the same order as the original location.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In the packet encapsulation procedure, concatenation may also be used. If the network layer packet is sufficiently small such that the payload of the link layer packet includes several network layer packets, concatenation may be performed. The link layer packet header may include fields for performing concatenation. In concatenation, the input packets may be encapsulated into the payload of the link layer packet in the same order as the original input order.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The link layer packet may include a header and a payload. The header may include a base header, an additional header and/or an optional header. The additional header may be further added according to situation such as concatenation or segmentation and the additional header may include fields suitable for situations. In addition, for delivery of the additional information, the optional header may be further included. Each header structure may be pre-defined. As described above, if the input packets are TS packets, a link layer header having packets different from the other packets may be used.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Hereinafter, link layer signaling will be described.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Link layer signaling may operate at a level lower than that of the IP layer. The reception side may acquire link layer signaling faster than IP level signaling of the LLS, the SLT, the SLS, etc. Accordingly, link layer signaling may be acquired before session establishment.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Link layer signaling may include internal link layer signaling and external link layer signaling. Internal link layer signaling may be signaling information generated at the link layer. This includes the above-described RDT or the below-described LMT. External link layer signaling may be signaling information received from an external module, an external protocol or a higher layer. The link layer may encapsulate link layer signaling into a link layer packet and deliver the link layer packet. A link layer packet structure (header structure) for link layer signaling may be defined and link layer signaling information may be encapsulated according to this structure.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing a link mapping table (LMT) according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The LMT may provide a list of higher layer sessions carried through the PLP.
