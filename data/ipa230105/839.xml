When the saliva secretion decreases, objective symptoms such as bad breath are observed in addition to unpleasant subjective symptoms such as masticatory disorders, dysgeusia, and dry mouse, and tongue coating and periodontal disease are observed. When the decrease in the amount of saliva secreted is severe, decayed teeth, angular cheilitis, etc., are observed in the patients.

Acetylcholine receptors are roughly classified into G protein-coupled muscarinic receptors and ion channel type nicotinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors are classified into five subtypes, M1 to M5. Subtype M3 muscarinic receptors (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;M3 receptors&#x201d;) have been reported to be mainly expressed in the bladder, gastrointestinal tract, pupil, salivary gland, lacrimal gland, etc., and be involved in contraction of the bladder, gastrointestinal tract, and pupil, secretion of saliva and tears, etc. (see NON-PATENT DOCUMENTS 4 and 5).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0157">Regarding G protein-coupled receptors, there have been many reports on the structure of an allosteric site different from an orthosteric site to which an endogenous agonist binds, and this allosteric site is attracting much attention in recent years (see NON-PATENT DOCUMENT 6). Depending on the ligand that binds to the allosteric site, the structure of the receptor is changed, and the binding force between the endogenous agonist and the receptor is increased. Accordingly, endogenous agonist-stimulation-dependent signal levels can be enhanced for the receptor. As used herein, a ligand that enhances the signal level of the receptor due to the endogenous agonist by binding to the allosteric site as described above is referred to as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM). That is, a positive allosteric modulator means a ligand that binds to the allosteric site different from the orthosteric site, to which the endogenous agonist binds, and enhances a signal of the agonist.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0158">Also, regarding M3 receptors, in recent years, an allosteric site different from an orthosteric site to which an endogenous agonist (acetylcholine, muscarinic) binds has been reported (see NON-PATENT DOCUMENT 7). M3 receptor PAMs (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;M3 PAMs&#x201d;) are considered to be able to enhance endogenous agonist-stimulation-dependent signal levels for M3 receptors. Therefore, M3 PAMs can enhance the signal levels of M3 receptors under more physiological conditions, and are expected to be therapeutically promising for the treatment of diseases involving M3 receptors.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0159">As shown in Test Examples described later, the compound of the present invention has M3 PAM activity and has an effect of improving gastrointestinal function and an effect of promoting salivation. Here, M3 PAM activity means an effect of enhancing M3 receptor function by binding to a site (allosteric site) different from the binding site (orthosteric site) of an endogenous activator (acetylcholine or muscarine) in the M3 receptor.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0160">Therefore, the compound of the present invention can be used as a therapeutic agent or a prophylactic agent for functional gastrointestinal disorders or xerostomia.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0161">When the compound of the present invention is administered as a pharmaceutical, the compound of the present invention is administered to a mammal including human as it is or as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound in an amount, such as 0.001% to 99.5%, preferably 0.1% to 90%, in a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic and inert carrier.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0162">The diseases to which the compound of the present invention can be applied include functional gastrointestinal disorders.
