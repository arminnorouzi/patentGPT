A wireless local area network (wireless local area network, WLAN) device that supports the next-generation IEEE 802.11 standard has a multi-band (multi-band) transmitting and receiving capability. If a frequency spacing between multiple frequency bands supported by the WLAN device that supports the next-generation standard is small, sending a signal on one frequency band affects receiving a signal on another frequency band. Therefore, the entity cannot independently perform transmitting and receiving operations on multiple frequency bands, so as to avoid interference. For example, for a simultaneous transmit and receive (simultaneous transmit and receive, STR) constraint system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, blocking occurs when a block acknowledgment (block ack, BA) <b>2</b> and a physical layer protocol data unit (PHY protocol data unit, PPDU) <b>1</b> overlap in time. To be specific, energy leaked on a link <b>1</b> during transmission of the BA <b>2</b> over a link <b>2</b> blocks receiving of the PPDU <b>1</b> over the link <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A solution in the conventional technology for the STR constraint system has a limitation, and is only applicable to a scenario in which none of PPDUs sent by a sending device carries a trigger frame. However, the conventional technology is not applicable to a scenario in which the sending device sends a PPDU carrying a trigger frame.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, this application provides a communication method and a communication apparatus. When a PPDU sent by a sending device carries a trigger frame, it can be ensured that a receiving device successfully implements carrier sensing before returning a TB PPDU.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a communication method is provided. The method includes: A sending device sends a first physical layer protocol data unit (PPDU) over a first link, where the first PPDU carries a trigger frame.

A core idea is that a WLAN device that supports the next-generation IEEE 802.11 standard has a multi-band (multi-band) transmitting and receiving capability, so that a wider bandwidth can be used for data transmission. This improves throughput significantly. The multi-band includes but is not limited to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, a 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, and a 6 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band. Access and transmission performed on each frequency band are referred to as one link, so that access and transmission performed on multiple frequency bands are referred to as ML. There may also be multiple links on each frequency band, and the multiple links may form ML. For example, there may be multiple links on a 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band. In another example, there may be multiple links on a 6 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band. A next-generation IEEE 802.11 standard station device that simultaneously supports multiple links is referred to as a multi-link device (multi-link device, MLD) herein.

In another example, the MLD may alternatively be another device. This is not limited.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For ease of understanding, the following briefly describes terms or concepts used in the embodiments of this application.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A sending device sends a physical layer protocol data unit (PHY protocol data unit, PPDU) carrying a trigger (trigger) frame to a receiving device. After receiving the PPDU carrying the trigger frame, the receiving device sends uplink data by using a trigger-based physical layer protocol data unit (trigger-based PHY protocol data unit, TB PPDU) after a short interframe space (short interframe space, SIFS) time (which may also be denoted as aSIFSTime). Before returning the TB PPDU, the receiving device needs to detect, in an energy detection manner within the SIFS time before sending the TB PPDU, whether a channel is in an idle state. If the channel is in an idle state, the receiving device sends the TB PPDU. If the channel is in a busy state, the receiving device does not send the TB PPDU. For example, the sending device and the receiving device may be MLDs. When the sending device sends a PPDU that does not carry a trigger frame, the receiving device does not need to perform carrier sensing before returning a BA.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The SIFS time includes three parts: D1, M1, and Rx/Tx. For example, the SIFS time is 16 microseconds. D1 is a physical layer processing delay, and D1 may also be denoted as aRxPHYDelay. M1 is a MAC layer processing delay, and M1 may also be denoted as aMACProcessingDelay. Rx/Tx is a transition time from a receiving state to a sending state, and may also be denoted as aRxTxTurnaroundTime. The three time periods are related to specific implementations, and duration of the three time periods is not determined. Within D1 and M1 time periods, the receiving device is in a receiving state, and energy sensing may be performed simultaneously when signal processing is performed at a physical layer and a MAC layer. Energy sensing is usually performed by an independent circuit, and energy measurement can be performed throughout the receiving process. In an implementation, for Rx/Tx, a time period of several hundred nanoseconds to 2 microseconds is usually required, and the receiving device cannot perform energy sensing within the Rx/Tx time period. Energy sensing usually requires a measurement result within 4 microseconds. Then measurement is continuously performed, and a measurement result is fed back to the MAC layer, to be used to determine a busy/an idle state of the channel.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For a case in which the sending device sends the PPDU carrying the trigger frame, the conventional technology cannot provide an effective solution. This application provides a communication method, to provide an alignment criterion for PPDUs sent over two links, so that the receiving device can perform energy detection within the SIFS time before returning the TB PPDU.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The following describes a communication method provided in this application with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a communication method <b>400</b> according to an embodiment of this application.

To ensure that the receiving device performs carrier sensing within the SIFS time before returning the TB PPDU over the first link, the end time of sending the PPDU by the sending device over the second link needs to be constrained. The end time of sending the second PPDU cannot be earlier than the first time, and cannot be later than the second time. The first time needs to be determined based on the end time of the first PPDU and the state turnaround time within the SIFS time.

For example, the receiving device adds the state turnaround time Rx/Tx of the receiving device to an association request frame or an association response frame and sends the association request frame or the association response frame to the sending device, so that the sending device learns of the state turnaround time Rx/Tx.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">For example, for the state turnaround time defined in the protocol, the state turnaround time may be a typical implementation value, or may be a value negotiated by all chip vendors, or may be a value selected by voting in the standard.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">For the receiving device, if the state turnaround time is defined as Rx/Tx0 in the protocol, the receiving device may select Rx/Tx of the receiving device with reference to Rx/Tx0. There may be different implementations of how the receiving device selects Rx/Tx.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">Implementation 1: A Rx/Tx value selected by the receiving device is greater than or equal to a Rx/Tx0 value.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">A reason why the receiving device selects the Rx/Tx value greater than or equal to the Rx/Tx0 value is described herein by using an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the sending device sends a PPDU <b>1</b> carrying a trigger frame over a link <b>1</b>, and sends a PPDU <b>2</b> that does not carry a trigger frame over the link <b>2</b>. After the SIFS time, the receiving device needs to return a TB PPDU over the link <b>1</b> and returns a BA <b>2</b> over the link <b>2</b>. Herein, the Rx/Tx value selected by the receiving device needs to be greater than or equal to the Rx/Tx0 value. If the Rx/Tx value selected by the receiving device is less than Rx/Tx0, within a first time period, adjacent-band signal leakage caused by the BA <b>2</b> blocks energy detection on the link <b>1</b>. Consequently, a channel becomes busy. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first time period is denoted as [T0-Rx/Tx0, T0-Rx/Tx]. TO is a predetermined start time of sending the TB PPDU, or T0 is the end time of the first PPDU (for example, the PPDU <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) plus the SIFS time.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Implementation 2: The Rx/Tx value selected by the receiving device is less than the Rx/Tx0 value.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">In the implementation 2, the receiving device may determine, by using an energy detection threshold, whether to send the TB PPDU. When the Rx/Tx value is less than the Rx/Tx0 value, the receiving device subtracts an adjacent-band energy leakage amount from an energy detection result, to determine a channel state of the first time period. For example, if in the first time period, a value obtained by subtracting the adjacent-band energy leakage amount from the energy detection result is greater than the energy detection threshold, it is determined that the channel is busy. If in the first time period, a value obtained by subtracting the adjacent-band energy leakage amount from the energy detection result is less than or equal to the energy detection threshold, it is determined that the channel is idle. A manner of obtaining the adjacent-band energy leakage amount is not limited in this application. For example, the adjacent-band energy leakage amount may be obtained through channel training.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">It may be understood that the foregoing implementation in which the energy detection threshold is introduced to determine whether to send the TB PPDU is merely example descriptions, and does not constitute a limitation on the protection scope of the embodiments of this application. A person skilled in the art can obtain various implementations related to the energy detection threshold based on the foregoing implementations.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">Alternatively, in the implementation 2, the receiving device may ignore an energy detection result within the first time period.
