Often, a tissue graft is attached to the bone to facilitate regrowth and permanent attachment. Techniques and devices that have been developed generally involve tying the soft tissue with suture to an anchor or a hole provided the bone tissue. Knotless suture anchors, such as the two piece Arthrex PushLock&#xae; anchor, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,329,272, have been developed to facilitate tissue fixation to bone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be desirable to provide a suture construct which has a design that allows tensioning of the construct as necessary and upon insertion into bone. Also needed is a suture construct that may be knotless and that is formed essentially of a soft material such as suture (or suture-based materials or other soft materials and/or compositions) with the ability to be inserted into a bone socket and then tightened by simple traction on one of the suture strands.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a suture construct for fixation of soft tissue to bone with the ability to tension/retension the suture construct. The suture construct may be a knotted or a knotless construct.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The suture construct of the present invention is a soft, suture-based anchor which is self-cinching and has a specific, accordion-type configuration (i.e., with the ability to fold from a first, extended position to a second, folded or compressed position). The suture-based anchor may be formed essentially of a flexible material such as suture (for example, FiberWire&#xae; suture) or suture chain (such as FiberChain&#xae;) or suture tape (such as FiberTape&#xae;), to form a SutureLock&#x2122; ChainLock&#x2122; or TapeLock&#x2122; suture-based anchor, respectively.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A suture (such as FiberWire&#xae;) may be employed to form a SutureLock&#x2122; anchor. Another suture (for example, a TigerWire&#xae; suture) is first passed through a length of the FiberWire&#xae; through multiple points such that the TigerWire&#xae; circles back to exit through the FiberWire&#xae; near the spot where it entered (in a suture-through-suture technique), creating a loop that penetrates the suture in a &#x201c;sine-wave&#x201d; configuration. Tensioning the two free ends of the TigerWire&#xae; tightens the loop and &#x201c;accordionizes&#x201d; the suture, creating expansion of the SutureLock&#x2122; anchor to create an interference fit. The SutureLock&#x2122; anchor is inserted into a bone socket/tunnel and the tails of the TigerWire&#xae; are tensioned to &#x201c;accordionize&#x201d; the FiberWire&#xae; (i.e., to fold or compress the FiberWire&#xae; to achieve an &#x201c;accordion-like&#x201d; shape). Additional sliding sutures may be added (threaded) through the soft anchor (SutureLock&#x2122; anchor) so that the soft anchor becomes double-loaded, triple-loaded, etc., i.e., multiple-loaded, as desired and depending on the specific characteristics of each surgical repair.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A suture chain (such as FiberChain&#xae; or FiberLink&#xae;) may be employed to form a ChainLock&#x2122; anchor. A free end of the suture chain (FiberChain&#xae;) is first passed through the chain (for example, through every other link in the chain) so that, when the free end is tightened, it collapses the chain in an accordion-like fashion with laterally-projecting links to produce an interference fit. The loop is closed down by pulling tension on the tail and this collapses the link like an accordion, forming the ChainLock&#x2122; anchor (i.e., folding or compressing the FiberChain&#xae; to achieve an &#x201c;accordion-like&#x201d; shape). A flexible strand (for example, a FiberWire&#xae;) is threaded through a middle link of the accordion. This flexible strand acts as the sliding suture for tissue fixation after the anchor is placed into bone. Once the ChainLock&#x2122; anchor is inserted into the bone socket/tunnel, the sliding suture (FiberWire&#xae;) is tensioned so that the tail of the FiberChain is flush with the bone after tensioning. Additional sliding sutures may be added (threaded) through the soft anchor (ChainLock&#x2122; anchor) so that the soft anchor becomes double-loaded, triple-loaded, etc., i.e., multiple-loaded, as desired and depending on the specific characteristics of each surgical repair.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A suture tape (such as FiberTape&#xae;) may be employed to form a TapeLock&#x2122; anchor. A FiberWire&#xae; suture is first passed through a length of the FiberTape&#xae; such that the FiberWire&#xae; circles back to exit through the FiberTape&#xae; near the spot where it entered, creating a loop that penetrates the tape in a &#x201c;sine-wave&#x201d; configuration. Tensioning the two free ends of the FiberWire&#xae; tightens the loop and &#x201c;accordionizes&#x201d; the suture tape (i.e., folding or compressing the FiberTape&#xae; to achieve an &#x201c;accordion-like&#x201d; shape), creating expansion of the TapeLock&#x2122; anchor to create an interference fit. The TapeLock&#x2122; anchor is inserted into a bone socket/tunnel and the tails of the FiberWire&#xae; are tensioned to &#x201c;accordionize&#x201d; the FiberTape&#xae; (i.e., to fold or compress the FiberTape&#xae; to achieve an &#x201c;accordion-like&#x201d; shape). Additional sliding sutures may be added (threaded) through the soft anchor (TapeLock&#x2122; anchor) so that the soft anchor becomes double-loaded, triple-loaded, etc., i.e., multiple-loaded, as desired and depending on the specific characteristics of each surgical repair.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description that is provided in connection with the accompanying drawings and illustrated exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a suture-based anchor (SutureLock&#x2122;

The suture anchor of the present invention is a suture-based anchor with a body that consists essentially of a flexible material such as suture, high-strength suture such as FiberWire&#xae; suture (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,716,234), suture tape such as FiberTape&#xae; (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,892,256), suture chain such as FiberChain&#xae; (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,803,173), among others, or combination of these materials. The body of the flexible material forms a loop that closes down and collapses the loop like an accordion. Once the suture anchor is placed into a bone socket or tunnel, tails of the anchor are tensioned to allow the loop of flexible material to &#x201c;accordionize&#x201d; and to create an interference fit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to the drawings, where like elements are designated by like reference numerals, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b></figref> illustrate exemplary soft suture-based anchors <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> of the present invention that are provided with a specific, accordion-type configuration. The suture-based anchors <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be formed essentially of a flexible material such as suture (for example, FiberWire&#xae; suture) or suture chain (such as FiberChain&#xae;) or suture tape (such as FiberTape&#xae;), to form a SutureLock&#x2122;, ChainLock&#x2122; or TapeLock&#x2122; suture-based anchor, respectively.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates suture-based anchor <b>90</b> (SutureLock&#x2122; anchor <b>90</b>) formed essentially of a flexible strand <b>10</b> (for example, a suture such as a FiberWire&#xae; suture <b>10</b>). Another flexible strand <b>11</b> (for example, another FiberWire&#xae; or TigerWire&#xae; suture <b>11</b>) is passed through the length of the FiberWire&#xae; <b>10</b> (with a needle, for example) in a suture-through-suture technique. The flexible strand <b>11</b> (TigerWire&#xae; suture <b>11</b>) is preferably a colored flexible strand or suture (or colored differently from the flexible strand <b>10</b>) to allow easy differentiation between the strands and to allow medical personnel (e.g., surgeon) to distinguish between the sutures. The TigerWire&#xae; <b>11</b> circles back to exit through the FiberWire&#xae; <b>10</b> near the spot where it entered, creating a loop <b>15</b> that penetrates the suture in a &#x201c;sine-wave&#x201d; configuration.
