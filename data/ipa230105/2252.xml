The photocatalytic bionic net made of a photocatalytic material is used to absorb light generated from the underwater lighting system, and continuously adsorb and degrade pollutants. The photocatalystic bionic net can be used to collect microorganisms, and decompose the organic pollutants in the water body into nutrients for the growth of the aquatic plant by the microorganisms. The aquatic plant performs photosynthesis by underwater light and grow. The system utilizes the photocatalytic material that can respond to the visible light to enable the natural restoration of the water environment to decontaminate the water body and restore ecology.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, an ecosystem for deep water environment restoration is provided, including an underwater lighting system, a photocatalytic bionic net and an aquatic plant. The underwater lighting system is connected with a light-collecting device, and the light-collecting device is configured to collect light and transmit the collected light to a deep water layer to supply the collected light to the underwater lighting system. The photocatalytic bionic net is placed on a surface and in the deep water layer of the water body, the photocatalytic bionic net is interwoven by a photocatalytic bionic rope, and the photocatalytic bionic rope includes a photocatalytic material and a fiber.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The photocatalytic material has a photocatalytic function and an adsorption function. Under a lighting condition, the photocatalytic material adsorbs and degrades pollutants of the water body, concentrates the microorganisms and decomposes, by the microorganisms, organic pollutants into nutrients required for the growth of the aquatic plant, and absorb the light to split water to produce oxygen for promoting the reproduction of the microorganisms, thus improving the decontamination of the water body and increasing a transparency of the water body and a depth that the light can reach. Further, under the lighting condition, the aquatic plant performs photosynthesis to release oxygen and thus increase a concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water body and promote the decontamination of the water body.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the photocatalytic material includes at least one selected from a composite material of mesoporous graphene and a mesoporous photocatalyst, mesoporous titanium dioxide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and graphene, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and graphitic carbon nitride, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and a molecular sieve, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and an organic metal framework material, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and iron trioxide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and molybdenum disulfide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and silver nitrate, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and a bismuth-based photocatalyst, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and tungsten oxide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and tin oxide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and cadmium sulfide, a composite material of mesoporous titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide, metal-doped mesoporous titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide self-doped by oxygen vacancies, a composite material of mesoporous titanium oxide and a photocatalyst self-doped by oxygen vacancies, titanium oxide self-doped by titanous, and any combinations thereof.

Metatitanic acid is used as a titanium source to be mixed and reacted with sulfuric acid to prepare a titanyl sulfate solution. The titanyl sulfate solution is added with mesoporous graphene, thereby obtaining a mixture solution. The titanyl sulfate solution rapidly diffuses into pores of mesoporous graphene due to hydrophilicity of the surface of mesoporous graphene, to obtain mesoporous graphene coated with titanyl sulfate. An alkaline substance is further added to react with titanyl sulfate on the surface of mesoporous graphene to form a shell-core structure material with a titanium hydroxide shell and a mesoporous graphene core. Subsequent processes of solid-liquid separation, washing and drying are performed, and the precipitated product is calcined at a high temperature to obtain photocatalytic powders having the shell-core structure with the porous core and the mesoporous quantum titanium oxide shell. The so-called precipitation and self-assembly process refers to a process where the alkaline substance diffuses into the pores of mesoporous graphene and reacts with titanyl sulfate to form titanium hydroxide. Titanium hydroxide is subjected to a high temperature annealing and spontaneously spreads and grows from the inside of mesoporous graphene to outside. Due to the local high pressure and high temperature and the gas diffusion in the pores, the mesoporous quantum titanium oxide is grown in the pores, and the gas continues to diffuse to the surface of mesoporous graphene, bringing the titanium hydroxide to form the mesoporous quantum titanium oxide shell (i.e., self-assembly). Mesoporous graphene is coated by the mesoporous quantum titanium oxide from the inside to the outside.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, metatitanic acid and sulfuric acid are mixed to prepare the titanyl sulfate solution.

The light source is introduced in the deep water layer by using the light-collecting device transmit the light collected to the underwater lighting system in the deep water layer, to allow the light to reach the photocatalytic bionic net in deep water layer. Under the lighting condition, the photocatalytic material of the photocatalytic bionic net adsorbs and degrades the water pollutants, enriches the microorganisms and decomposes the organic pollutants by the microorganisms into nutrients required for the growth of the aquatic plant. The aquatic plant performs photosynthesis under the lighting condition to release oxygen and thus increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water body. Therefore, the ecosystem for deep water environment restoration is constructed.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0057">The principle of the present disclosure is explained below to help the understanding of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">The present ecosystem is suitable for the deep water environment restoration. By combining the underwater lighting module, the photocatalytic bionic net and the aquatic plant, the present ecosystem is capable of restoring a water ecology, in which technologies of mesoporous adsorption and photocatalysis are used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">Firstly, the underwater light module/device/system adopts a solar-driven LED light strip or a bunching light-guiding rod to guide the light into the deep water layer. It should be noted that the light source can be located at any position or depth of the water body, for example at the bottom or the deep water layer of the water body.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">Secondly, the photocatalytic material (e.g., the composite material of mesoporous graphene and the mesoporous photocatalyst) which is responsive to the visible light is coated on the surface of the fiber net to form the photocatalytic bionic net, which is placed under water to catalyze the self-decontamination of the water body. The photocatalyst has a mesoporous structure, and is coated on and embedded in graphene. That is, the photocatalyst is used to form the composite material with the mesoporous material with a large specific surface area, and the composite material has an improved underwater adsorption performance. The light source provided by the underwater lighting system can be used for catalyzing the regeneration of the adsorption capacity of the mesoporous material, that is, for maintaining the adsorption activity of the mesoporous material. Further, the underwater light source can enhance the photosynthesis of the aquatic plants and promote the reproduction of microorganisms. The photocatalytic material absorbs the light energy provided by the underwater lighting system. The photocatalytic material can continuously adsorb and degrade the water pollutants, and enrich the microorganisms and decompose the organic pollutants into nutrients for the growth of the aquatic plant (including underwater plants and surface plants). The underwater plant may perform photosynthesis by the underwater light source and thus the growth is improved.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">Finally, the system utilizes the photocatalytic material that can respond to the visible light to enable the natural restoration of the water environment to decontaminate the water body and restore the water ecology.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">In order to facilitate the understanding of the present disclosure, the technical means of the present disclosure is further described below.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">(I) Photocatalytic Water Decontamination by Using the Photocatalytic Material</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Under the lighting condition, the photocatalytic material produce extremely active hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals, which can decompose the organic substances. The organic substance in water and air may be directly decomposed into water and carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, the photocatalysis can split water to produce oxygen. The use of environmentally friendly photocatalysis technology for water decontamination will not cause the secondary pollution to the water body. However, the traditional commercial photocatalytic materials require ultraviolet light and have almost no response to the visible light. It is known that more than 90% of the sunlight is visible light and near-infrared light. Through a lot of researches, the inventors of the present disclosure find that the photocatalytic material (e.g., the composite material of mesoporous graphene and a mesoporous photocatalyst) is responsive to the visible light and can absorb light having a wave length of 200 to 1200 nm (commercial titanium oxide only absorbs ultraviolet light of &#x3c;400 nm), and thus the photocatalytic material of the present disclosure can realize the efficient absorption and the utilization of the solar energy. The photocatalytic material is coated on the fiber net to make each fiber filament/rope of the net have high catalytic activity. For the photocatalytic material, physical/chemical adsorption and photocatalysis are applied. The mesoporous material has a strong adsorption capacity and can effectively capture various organic pollutants, heavy metal ions, phosphorus, iron and manganese in the water body. The captured organic pollutants are decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by the photocatalysis, and heavy metal ions, phosphorus, iron and manganese are effectively adsorbed, mineralized and removed from the water body. Meanwhile, the photocatalysis may decompose water to produce oxygen, to increase the concentration of the dissolved oxygen in the water body and promote the self-decontamination of the water body.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">The photocatalytic bionic net sinks and spreads at a preset level of the water body, for example at the bottom or in the deep water layer, to realize the sewage decontamination under the light irradiation (i.e., the lighting condition). Meanwhile, the water body can be purified or decontaminated in the following aspects. In a first aspect, indexes of the water body are improved. The excess organic substances in the water body is rapidly decomposed, chemical oxygen demand (COD), permanganate index, ammonia nitrogen index and total phosphorus index of the water body are reduced. In a second aspect, the physical condition of the water body is improved. Algae microorganisms are reduced and the transparency of the water body is improved. In a third aspect, the ecological environment is improved. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen of the water body is improved, and the metabolism of the water ecosystem is promoted.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">(II) Growth of the Aquatic Plant under Synergistic Effect of Photosynthesis and Photocatalysis</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0065">The aquatic plants, such as vallisneria, polygonaceae, bengal waterdropwort herb, hydrilla, mimulicalyx, lotus, iris, zantedeschia hybrida, <i>Potamogeton pectinatus, </i>potamogeton malaianus, ottelia, orchid and cyperus altrnlifolius, can build a three-dimensional forest in the water body and provide for lives of fishes, mussels, snails and other aquatic organisms, to reach a good ecological balance of the water body. Therefore, the water body can be decontaminated and the secondary pollution to water body can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">The photocatalytic bionic net, the aquatic plants and the microorganisms may have a synergistic effect in the decontamination of the water body under the lighting condition provided by the LED light strip and/or the bunching light-guiding rod. The underwater LED light strip or the bunching light-guiding rod is used as the light sources in the deep water layer to provide enough light for the growth of the aquatic plants and the microorganisms, thus solving the problem of poor light transmission of the black, odorous and polluted water body. The aquatic plants perform the photosynthesis in the water body to produce oxygen, which can further improve the growth of the aquatic plant themselves and also provides oxygen for the microorganisms and other aquatic lives like fishes. The photocatalytic bionic net is used to catalyze the photocatalytic reaction(s) to provide nutrients for the growth of aquatic plants and microorganisms. Moreover, the net itself can be used as a good habitat for the microorganisms. The photocatalytic material of the photocatalytic bionic net under the lighting condition of the LED light strip or the bunching light-guiding rod produces extremely active hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals, which can decompose the organic substances in the water body into water and carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, water can be split by the photocatalysis to produce oxygen. The photocatalytic bionic net can effectively adsorb and mineralize heavy metal ions, phosphorus, iron, and manganese, and carry these pollutants out off the water body, thus reducing the metal ion pollution of the water body. In addition, the conductive carbon electrode material is added to the photocatalytic bionic net to utilize the electric energy generated by the solar energy through the solar photovoltaic panel, and thus a voltage is applied to the photocatalytic bionic net to make it an electrochemical adsorption material, maintaining a long-term adsorption activity and improving an adsorption saturability of the photocatalytic bionic net.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">In some embodiments, the aquatic plant is selected as vallisneria, polygonaceae, or bengal waterdropwort herb.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">Vallisneria can increase the density of sediments. Vallisneria roots absorb water of the bottom sludge (i.e., the sediments), reducing the water content of the bottom sludge can effectively reduce the mobility of the sediments and inhibit the suspension of black and odorous substances, so as to improve the transparency of the water body. Further, vallisneria absorb substances such as phosphorus and nitrogen in the water body, and achieve the synergistic effect with the microorganisms to restore the water ecological environment. In addition, vallisneria secrete substances that inhibit the growth of algae and destroy the physiological metabolism of the algae, and thus ultimately cause the death of algae in a large area in the water body like the river, minimize the pollution of the water body caused by toxins produced by the algae, and improve the eutrophication situation of the water body. Vallisneria is a submerged plant, and can grow with symbiotic bacteria, resulting in an increase of the oxygen content in the water body and an increase of a speed of water ecological restoration.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">Polygonaceae (also called azolla filliculoidas) is a high-protein, high-nutrient, high-yield, high-benefit plant. It is a natural green manure and can be used to improve saline-alkali land and sandy wasteland. It contains various beneficial elements, such as &#x3b2;-carotene, chlorophyll, emodin, isoflavones, SOD, selenium, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, phosphorus and magnesium, and thus provides nutrient elements needed by lives in the water body. It can be applied in diversified fields such as food, medicine, fertilizer, soil improvement, and environmental protection.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">Bengal waterdropwort herb has a developed root system and a strong adaptability, which can effectively improve water quality via the processes of degradation/decomposition and photosynthesis in the eutrophic water body. Bengal waterdropwort herb can help the water environment treatment through enrichment, absorption and transfer processes. Bengal waterdropwort herb grows on the water surface and has dense roots, forming a natural bionic filter, which reduces a water flow rate, facilitates the sedimentation of suspending solids, and provides a substrate and habitat for the microorganisms. The large roots provide a large area for adsorbing zoogloea, thus realizing a physical filtration function. Meanwhile, the growth of bengal waterdropwort herb needs various nutrients, so it will absorb a certain amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in water body and the sediments. Since bengal waterdropwort herb can be harvested in multiple times within a year, the elements adsorbed by bengal waterdropwort herb can be taken away, thereby improving the water restoration.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">(III) Underwater Photocatalytic Reaction Promoting the Reproduction of the Microorganisms in the Water Body</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0071">Under the irradiation of the light, the underwater microorganisms absorb the nutrients produced by the photocatalytic bionic net to promote the reproduction of the microorganisms. The microorganisms can decompose the organic pollutants into simple and stable inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide and water and reduce the COD, ammonia nitrogen index, total phosphorus index of the water body. In the case where the light reaches the sludge on the bottom of the water body, the rapid reproduction of microorganisms in the sludge can be realized to decontaminate the bottom sludge and improving the clarity of the water body. A dynamic change of the dissolved oxygen in the water body can reflect the treatment process of the organic pollutants in the water body, and thus is used as an indicator of the decontamination of the water body.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">The photocatalytic bionic net functions synergistically with the microorganisms in the decomposition of the organic substances and the increase of the dissolved oxygen. Moreover, the photocatalytic bionic net is a good substrate for breeding the microorganisms, and thus can improve the reproduction of the microorganisms. In addition, for anaerobic microorganisms, the organic substances in the water body or produced by the photocatalytic decomposition can support the reproduction of the anaerobic microorganisms. In this system, both anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms can live. The microorganisms can quickly decompose the organic substances adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalytic bionic net and accelerate the photocatalytic decomposition. The photocatalytic bionic net functions with the aquatic plants to restore the growth environment of plants and animals in the water. While the aquatic plants grow smoothly, the aquatic plants will continue to improve the light transmittance of the water body and reduce the organic substances in the water. With the increase of the visibility and light transmittance of the water body, the photocatalytic bionic net receives more light, which promote the photocatalytic reactions. Under the lighting condition, the photocatalytic biomimetic net, the aquatic plants, and the microorganisms are coordinated to activate the automatic restoration of the water body to achieve the long-term ecological governance.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">The photocatalytic bionic net is coated with the mesoporous material having a large specific surface area, which can adsorbs the organic substances and the microorganisms, and is beneficial to the growth and the reproduction of the microorganisms. Specifically, by absorbing the light energy, the photocatalytic bionic net decomposes the algae and the organic substances adsorbed on the surface of the net, and thus provides the microorganisms growing on or inside the graphene mesoporous quantum material with nutrients and breeding places and promotes the reproduction of the microorganisms. The growth and reproduction of the microorganisms will inhibit the growth of algae and decompose the organic substances, so as to quickly remove the algae on the surface of the photocatalytic bionic net, increase the light irradiation range of the photocatalytic bionic rope, and increase a contact area between the photocatalytic bionic net and the organic substance. In this case, the photocatalytic bionic net has a high adsorption capacity and is able to maintain the decomposition function in the water body.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">(IV) Biodiversity Wetland Construction and Water Quality Natural Filtration and Purification</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0074">The technical solutions of the present disclosure can be used for construction of biodiversity wetlands. The present composite material of the photocatalytic material, graphene, carbon-based adsorption material, the three-dimensional mesoporous material or the surface polar oxide has a large specific surface area and a strong adsorption function.

The present material can perform and improve the restoration of the wetlands to form a wetland landscape.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0075">The surface polar oxides can inactivate blue algae and the mesoporous materials can absorb the organic components such as proteins and amino acids of blue algae as organic fertilizers for wetland plants, to enrich the natural microorganism of the wetland and degrade/decompose the pollutants of the water body into organic nutrients. On this basis, a natural virtuous cycle of wetland ecology can be generated, to achieve the purpose of wetland management and decontamination of the water body.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076">The mesoporous adsorption of the present material can be regenerated by the photocatalysis to maintain the material at a high level of mesoporous adsorption activity/capacity. With the mesoporous adsorption, absorption of the aquatic plants and the microorganisms, and the formed bionic community, nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals and other pollutants in the water body can be decomposed or stored by the plants through a series of physical/chemical changes or through bionic transfers, and thus are removed from the water body. Meanwhile, the aquatic plants can release oxygen to the water body through the photosynthesis, forming an active bionic ecological environment, and promoting the catabolism of the microorganisms in the root zone of the aquatic plants.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">The present disclosure has the following beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">In the ecosystem of the present disclosure is suitable for the deep water environment restoration. By combining the underwater lighting system, the photocatalytic bionic net and the aquatic plant, the photocatalytic material of the photocatalytic bionic net is used to absorb the light energy from the underwater lighting system, continuously absorb and degrade the pollutants in the water body, enrich the microorganisms, and decompose the organic pollutants in water body into nutrients for the growth of the aquatic plant(s). The aquatic plant performs the photosynthesis by the underwater light and grows. The present system utilizes the photocatalytic material that can respond to the visible light to enable the natural restoration of the water environment to decontaminate the water body and restore ecology. The photocatalytic bionic net can be used as a water purification system with a large specific surface area, and has the functions of rapidly adsorbing algae, total phosphorus, and organic substances of the water body, and degrading these pollutants through the photocatalysis. The light (sunlight) provides energy for the photocatalysis. Organic substances such as common blue algae, green algae, brown algae and other organic matters are adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalytic bionic net and are degraded/decomposed into water and carbon dioxide without providing any new pollutants. Further, the photocatalytic bionic net can absorb light energy and be used to decompose water to produce oxygen. A large amount of newly produced oxygen can support lives such as fishes and shrimps, and promote the reproduction of the surrounding aquatic plants to achieve a dynamic balance of the aquatic ecology. In addition, the photocatalytic bionic net includes two photocatalytic bionic nets, one is arranged in the deep water layer of the water body to realize the decontamination of the water body, and the other one is arranged on the surface of the water body. In this way, the surface of the water body can become clean and transparent by the present ecosystem with the photocatalytic bionic net which is driven by the light.
