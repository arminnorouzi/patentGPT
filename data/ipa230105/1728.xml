An image to be infused is printed on a paper (or any type of sheet) using sublimation dyes (contained in the sublimation inks) and the printed paper is pressed against a substrate (generally a thermoplastic material) under heat. The heat causes the dyes to sublimate from a solid state on the printed paper to a gaseous state to travel to the substrate, where the dyes are deposited as solids. This sublimation process therefore infuses the image in the printed paper into the substrate. As the infused image is embedded within the substrate, the image may not chip, fade, or delaminate like the capped and printed images.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dye sublimation apparatus may have a heating section to generate the heat for sublimating the dyes such that the dye can travel from the printed paper (or printed sheet) to the substrate. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a heating section <b>100</b> of a dye sublimation apparatus. As shown, the heating section comprises a bank of heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d </i>(collectively referred to as heater banks <b>102</b>) that generates radiating heat <b>106</b> towards a printed sheet <b>104</b> to sublimate the dyes thereon. More specifically, each of heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d </i>generates roughly same quantity of radiating heat <b>106</b>, the collection of which heats the printed sheet <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the setup of conventional heating sections and the heating processes in conventional heating sections have technical shortcomings. Continuing with the above example of a conventional heating section <b>100</b>, the radiating heat <b>106</b> generated by the heater banks <b>102</b> generates an uneven temperature distribution within the heating section <b>100</b>. For example, the heated printed sheet <b>104</b> or any cover thereto (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) heats the air within the heating section <b>100</b> causing the heated air <b>108</b> to rise. The heated air <b>108</b> tends to accumulate near the heater banks <b>102</b> thereby causing a significant temperature difference within the heating section <b>100</b>. Furthermore, as the radiating heat <b>106</b> is brought back to the heater banks <b>102</b> by the heated air <b>108</b>, the heater banks <b>102</b> may have to radiate more heat thereby making the conventional heating process more inefficient. As the heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d </i>are spatially distributed distinct sources of heat, the radiating heat <b>106</b> may not be uniform all over the printed sheet <b>104</b> and cause hot spots. For example, the central areas of the printed sheet <b>104</b> may develop hot spots. Other areas such as peripheral locations of the printed sheet <b>104</b> may not even receive a desired amount of heat while some areas may be overheated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, a significant improvement upon the heaters for dye sublimation is therefore desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is therefore desired are dye sublimation systems and methods that provide a more uniform heat to a printed sheet placed in a heating section. What is further desired are computer/controller configurable components within the heating section to provide a more uniform heat to the printed sheet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments described herein attempt to solve the aforementioned technical problems and may provide other benefits as well. An illustrative heating section in a dye sublimation apparatus may include one or more individually controllable fans. More specifically, a computer or a controller may control speed and/or orientation of the fans for a convective heat transfer to a printed sheet in the heating section. Furthermore, the speed and/or orientation of the fans may be dynamically adjusted based upon the temperature requirement of different stages of the dye sublimation process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a dye sublimation apparatus for infusing an image on a printed sheet to a substrate comprises a heating section configured to heat the printed sheet to sublimate one or more dyes forming the image, such that the one or more dyes travel to the substrate in a gaseous state and deposit on the substrate in a solid state to infuse the image on the substrate; the heating section comprising one or more heaters configured to radiate heat towards the printed sheet; and the heating section further comprising one or more fans with individually configurable speed and orientation to convectively transfer the radiated heat to the printed sheet.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a dye sublimation method for infusing an image on a printed sheet to a substrate comprises heating, by a heating section of a dye sublimation apparatus, the printed sheet to sublimate one or more dyes forming the image such that the one or more dyes travel to the substrate in a gaseous state and deposit on the substrate in a solid state to infuse the image on the substrate, the heating section comprising one or more heaters configured to radiate heat towards the printed sheet; convectively transferring, by one or more fans of the dye sublimation apparatus, the radiated heat to the printed sheet; and configuring, by a processor of the dye sublimation apparatus, speed and orientation of each of the one or more fans.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the disclosed embodiment and subject matter as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The accompanying drawings constitute a part of this specification and illustrate embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a heating section of a conventional dye sublimation apparatus;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an illustrative system for dye sublimation, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating section of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating section of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of an illustrative method for dye sublimation, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made to the illustrative embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used here to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the claims or this disclosure is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the subject matter illustrated herein, which would occur to one ordinarily skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein. The present disclosure is here described in detail with reference to embodiments illustrated in the drawings, which form a part here. Other embodiments may be used and/or other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description are not meant to be limiting of the subject matter presented here.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments disclosed herein describe an improved dye sublimation apparatus that may generate a uniform or nearly uniform heat distribution within a heating section through convective heat transfer. Conventional dye sublimation systems and methods rely upon radiative heat that may generate a non-uniform temperature distribution within the heating section and have a tendency to develop hot spots. A substrate containing a sublimated image using the conventional systems and methods therefore may have a non-uniform quality containing darker areas with excess ink and lighter areas with less than desired ink.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments disclosed herein utilize individually configurable (or controllable) fans within the heating section to generate a uniform or nearly uniform heat distribution within the heating section of the improved sublimation apparatus. A processor (a term broadly used to encompass both microprocessors and controllers) may control the speed and orientation of each of the fans to maintain the uniform or nearly uniform temperature through convective heat transfer. The radiative heat generated by heating elements (e.g., electric heaters) in the heating section is distributed utilizing the airflow generated by each of the fans. For instance, the each of the four corners of the heating section may have a fan. The processor may cause these fans to orient at a predetermined angle and turn the fan blades at a predetermined speed such that there is a circular airflow generated within the heating section. The circular airflow may convectively distribute the radiative heat generated by the heating elements such that a uniform or nearly uniform distribution of heat is maintained within the heating section. In some embodiments, the processor may dynamically change the speed and the orientation of the fans during a dye-sublimation cycle, e.g., a low-temperature first stage may less likely develop a hot spot and high temperature later stage may likely develop a hot spot that may be avoided through air circulation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fans generally may be electrical fans with electric motors providing the motive power to move the fan-blades. The processor may configure the speed of the fans by regulating the control of the current flowing through the corresponding electric motors. Each of the fans may also have one or more motors (or any other actuating mechanism) controlling the orientation of the corresponding fan. The processor may generate actuating instructions to the one or more controlling the orientation of the fans. A thermocouple or any other type temperature measurement sensor may provide temperature feedback to the processor for the processor to configure the speed and orientation of the fans. In some embodiments, the dye sublimation apparatus may include multiple temperature sensors to measure the temperature of the heating section at multiple locations to detect whether hot spots are being formed such that the one or more fans can be configured to generate an airflow away from the potential hot spots.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that the use of electric heaters to generate the radiating heat (also referred to as radiative heat) and the electric fans to convectively distribute or transfer the radiative heat is for the ease of illustration and therefore should not be considered limiting. Any type of heating element configured to radiate heat and any type of actuating mechanism configured to convectively distribute the radiated heat through directed airflows should be considered within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative dye sublimation machine (also referred to as dye sublimation apparatus) <b>200</b>, according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the dye sublimation machine <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and described herein is merely for illustration and explanation and machines with other form factors and components should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure. For example, dye sublimation machines having additional, alternative, or a fewer number of components than the illustrative dye sublimation machine <b>200</b> should be included within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The dye sublimation machine <b>200</b> may comprise a sublimation table <b>202</b>, which may provide structural support for the components of the dye sublimation machine <b>200</b>. The dye sublimation machine <b>200</b> in general and the sublimation table <b>202</b> in particular may be divided into three zones: a loading zone (also referred to as a loading section) <b>204</b>, a heating zone (also referred to as heating section) <b>206</b>, and a cooling zone (also referred to as a cooling section) <b>208</b>. The loading zone <b>204</b> may allow a worker (or a user) to load a printed sheet <b>218</b> and a substrate <b>224</b>. The printed sheet <b>224</b> may have an image thereon printed using sublimation inks containing sublimation dyes. The substrate <b>224</b> may be of any type of material such as thermoplastic where the image may be infused through the dye sublimation process. The combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> may be loaded onto a bed <b>214</b> at the loading zone <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the bed <b>214</b> may be formed by a graphite honeycomb structure. The bed <b>214</b> may be configured as a conveyer belt that moves through the loading zone <b>204</b>, the heating zone <b>206</b>, and the cooling zone <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The heating zone <b>206</b> may include heating elements <b>210</b>. The heating elements <b>210</b> may be of any kind such as heating coils in any type configuration. The heating elements <b>210</b> may be electrically heated providing a radiative type heating to the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b>. For example, the heating elements <b>210</b> may be included in multiple electrical heaters, each heating a section of the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate. The heating zone <b>206</b> may also include a temperature sensor <b>220</b> (e.g., a thermocouple) to measure the temperature of the heat generated by the heating elements <b>210</b>. The heating elements <b>210</b> may be within individual heaters that may be individually controlled by one or more controllers. For example, a controller associated with a heater may receive a temperature measurement from the temperature sensor <b>220</b> and determine the amount of heat to be radiated by the heater. The heating elements <b>210</b> may also be divided into a plurality of zones, each zone containing one or more heaters. Therefore, a corresponding controller may individually control the heat output of each zone to maintain a consistent temperature at the bed <b>214</b> within the heating zone <b>206</b>. Within the heating zone <b>206</b>, a membrane <b>216</b> may cover the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b>. The membrane <b>216</b> may be formed by any kind of material that may withstand the heat for repeated heating cycles in the heating zone <b>206</b>. A vacuum pump <b>222</b> may pull down the membrane <b>216</b> such that the membrane <b>216</b> may cover the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> snugly without air bubbles.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cooling zone <b>208</b> may cool down the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> after the dye sublimation process in the heating zone <b>206</b>. The cooling zone <b>208</b> may include cooling elements <b>212</b> such as cold air blowers to expedite the cooling down process. However, it should be understood that the cooling zone <b>208</b> may not necessarily include the cooling elements <b>212</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> may cool down to ambient temperature without the aid of the cooling elements <b>212</b>. It should also be understood that the loading zone <b>204</b> and the cooling zone <b>208</b> may be combined in some embodiments. In these embodiments, the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> may be placed on the combined zone providing both loading and cooling functionality, be moved to the heating zone <b>206</b>, and moved back to the combined zone for cooling. Therefore, it should generally be understood that the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is merely illustrative and alternative configurations should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an illustrative operation, a worker may place the substrate <b>224</b> on the loading zone <b>204</b> and place the printed sheet <b>218</b> directly on the substrate <b>224</b>. The bed <b>214</b> may be configured as a conveyer belt, which may move the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> to the heating zone <b>206</b>. The heating zone <b>206</b> may be a covered area within the dye sublimation machine <b>200</b>. Within the heating zone <b>206</b>, the vacuum pump <b>222</b> may pull a vacuum between the membrane <b>216</b> and the bed <b>214</b> such that the membrane <b>216</b> presses down on the printed sheet <b>218</b>. The heating elements <b>210</b> may generate a requisite amount of heat to sublimate the ink on the printed sheet <b>218</b>. The sublimated ink may then be deposited on the substrate <b>224</b>. The temperature sensor <b>220</b> may measure the temperature within the enclosure created by the membrane <b>216</b> and the bed <b>214</b> and the temperature measurement may be used by the heating elements to regulate the generated heat. After the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> are left in the heating zone <b>206</b> for a requisite amount of time (e.g., based upon the properties of the substrate <b>224</b>), the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> is moved to the cooling zone. As described above, the loading zone <b>204</b> may also function as the cooling zone <b>208</b>. The cooling process in the cooling zone <b>208</b> may be expedited by the cooling elements <b>212</b>, which may provide an active source of cooling such as a flow of cold air. After the combination of the printed sheet <b>218</b> and the substrate <b>224</b> is sufficiently cooled, the combination is removed from the dye sublimation machine <b>200</b>. After this process, the image in the printed sheet <b>218</b> may be infused (or deposited) into the substrate <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The heating zone <b>206</b> may include one or more fans for convective heat transfer.

The connection <b>314</b> may be wired, e.g., a thermocouple providing the feedback to the controller <b>308</b>, or wireless, e.g., a wireless temperature sensor wirelessly providing the feedback to the controller <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to the controller <b>308</b>, the bank of heaters <b>312</b> may be controlled based upon instructions provided by a computing device <b>306</b>. For example, the computing device <b>306</b> may include an interface for a user to enter a desired bed temperature in the heating zone <b>310</b> for a particular image and the computing device <b>306</b> may provide instructions to the bank of heaters <b>312</b> through the network <b>304</b> to maintain the temperature. Alternatively or additionally, the computing device <b>306</b> may provide the instruction to maintain the temperature to the controller <b>308</b>. In some embodiments, the computing device <b>306</b> may provide instructions to the bank of heaters <b>312</b> to maintain a first temperature at a first stage of the dye sublimation process and to maintain a second temperature at a second stage of the dye sublimation process. It should be understood that the instructions to maintain the temperature and the process of maintaining the temperature may be maintained either in hardware, e.g., through the controller <b>308</b>, or as a combination of hardware and software, e.g., through one or more applications in the computing device <b>306</b>, the controller <b>308</b>, and/or other hardware components in the dye sublimation apparatus. In some embodiments, the controller <b>308</b> may sequentially activate the heaters in the bank of heaters <b>312</b>. For example, the dye sublimation process may require a gradual ramping up of the heat and therefore the sequential activation may allow heat to build up to a desired temperature. As another example, activating the heaters at the periphery of the heating section <b>310</b> first may allow a controller to determine an amount of heat (generally lesser than the heaters at the periphery) to be generated by heaters at the center of the heating section <b>310</b> to maintain a desired temperature within the heating section <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The heating section <b>310</b> may further include a plurality of fans (an example shown as fan <b>316</b>) to facilitate a convective heat transfer from the bank of heaters to the printed sheet. The fan <b>316</b> may receive control signals from the controller <b>308</b> and/or control instructions from the computing devices <b>306</b>. The control signals/instructions may cause the fan <b>316</b> to turn ON, turn OFF, change speed, and/or change orientation. The control signals/instructions may be based upon feedback (e.g., temperature measurement) received by the controller <b>308</b> and/or the computing device <b>306</b>. Utilizing the fan <b>316</b>, the system <b>300</b> may be able to maintain a uniform or nearly uniform temperature distribution within the heating section <b>310</b> of the dye sublimation apparatus <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computing devices <b>306</b> may include any type processor based device that may execute one or instructions (e.g., instructions to cause a uniform temperature distribution in the heating section <b>310</b>) to the dye sublimation apparatus <b>302</b> through the network <b>304</b>. Non-limiting examples of the computing devices <b>306</b> include a server <b>306</b><i>a</i>, a desktop computer <b>306</b><i>b</i>, a laptop computer <b>306</b><i>c</i>, a tablet computer <b>306</b><i>d</i>, and a smartphone <b>306</b><i>e</i>. However, it should be understood that the aforementioned devices are merely illustrative and other computing devices should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure. At minimum, each computing device <b>306</b> may include a processor and non-transitory storage medium that is electrically connected to the processor. The non-transitory storage medium may store a plurality of computer program instructions (e.g., operating system, applications) and the processor may execute the plurality of computer program instructions to implement the functionality of the computing device <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The network <b>304</b> may be any kind of local or remote network that may provide a communication medium between the computing devices <b>306</b> and the dye sublimation apparatus <b>302</b>. For example, the network <b>304</b> may be a local area network (LAN), a desk area network (DAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN). However, it should be understood that aforementioned types of networks are merely illustrative and any type of component providing the communication medium between the computing devices <b>306</b> and the dye sublimation apparatus <b>302</b> should be considered within the scope this disclosure. For example, the network <b>304</b> may be a single wired connection between a computing device <b>306</b> and the dye sublimation apparatus <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating section <b>400</b> of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment. It should be understood that the components of the heating section <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and described herein are merely illustrative and additional, alternative, and fewer number of components should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure. The heating section <b>400</b> may comprise a bank of a plurality of heaters <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b</i>, <b>402</b><i>c</i>, <b>402</b><i>d </i>(collectively referred to as heater banks <b>402</b>) that may generate radiating heat (also referred to as radiative heat) <b>406</b> and a plurality of fans <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>(commonly or collectively referred to as <b>404</b>) to convert at least a portion of the radiating heat <b>406</b> to convective heat <b>408</b>. The radiative heat <b>406</b> and convective heat <b>408</b> may cause dyes in a printed sheet <b>414</b> to sublimate and get deposited to a substrate <b>416</b> thereby infusing an image in the printed sheet <b>414</b> to the substrate <b>416</b>. As shown, the substrate <b>416</b> may be on a bed <b>410</b>, which may be a conveyer belt and the combination of the printed sheet <b>414</b> and the substrate <b>416</b> may be under a membrane <b>412</b> may be snugly hold the printed sheet <b>414</b> and the substrate <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The heater banks <b>402</b> may include any type of heating element that may generate the radiating heat <b>406</b>. For example, the heater banks <b>402</b> may include an electric heating element such as a heating coil that can be controlled by a controller. As another example, the heater banks <b>402</b> may include a chemical heating element that may chemically generate the radiating heat <b>406</b>. It should be understood that these forms of heating are merely illustrative and any type of mechanism that generates the radiating heat <b>406</b> should be considered within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fans <b>404</b> may any type of component that may cause air movement within the heating section <b>400</b> to generate the convective heat <b>408</b> from the radiating heat <b>406</b>. The fans <b>404</b> may be powered by any of power source. For example, the fans <b>404</b> may be electric with an electric motor providing the motive power to move the fan blades. A controller may provide control signals to control the fans <b>404</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a computer may generate instructions to control the fans <b>404</b>. The control signals and/or the instructions may cause the fans <b>404</b> to switch ON, switch OFF, change speed, and/or change orientation (e.g., to change the direction of airflow within the heating section <b>400</b>). The control signals and/or the instructions may be based upon a feedback (e.g., a continuous temperature measurement) from the heating section <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the controller and/or computer may dynamically control the various operational attributes of the fans <b>404</b> during dye sublimation. For example, the computer and/or the controller may cause the fans <b>404</b> to move with a first speed at the beginning of a dye sublimation cycle and with a second speed as the later stages of the dye sublimation cycle. Furthermore, the computer and/or the controller may periodically switch the fans <b>404</b> ON or OFF based on the amount of airflow required to maintain a uniform or nearly uniform temperature within the heating section <b>400</b>. The computer and/or the controller may dynamically change the orientation of the fans <b>404</b> based upon the desired direction of airflow. For example, if the computer and/or the controller detects a potential hot spot build up, the computer and/or the controller may cause the fans <b>404</b> to direct an airflow away from the spot such that the excess heat may be carried away by the airflow. By the dynamic control of the fans <b>404</b>, the computer and/or the controller may maintain a uniform or nearly uniform temperature distribution <b>418</b> (e.g., with temperature difference below a threshold, &#x394;T) within the heating section <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, the computer and/or the controller may maintain static speed and a static orientation of the fans <b>404</b> during the entirety of the sublimation cycle.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating section <b>500</b> of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment.
