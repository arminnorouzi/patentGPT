The following five types of downlink reference signals are defined as: a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), an MBSFN reference signal, a data demodulation reference signal (DM-RS) being a user equipment-specific reference signal (UE-specific reference signal), a positioning reference signal (PRS), and a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS). The physical layer measurement objects of a communication terminal include reference signal received powers (RSRPs).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The transport channels described in Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 5) are described.

The DL-SCH can be broadcast to the entire coverage of the base station (cell). The DL-SCH supports dynamic or semi-static resource allocation. The semi-static resource allocation is also referred to as persistent scheduling.

The HARQ is the technique for improving the communication quality of a channel by combination of automatic repeat request (ARQ) and error correction (forward error correction). The HARQ is advantageous in that error correction functions effectively by retransmission even for a channel whose communication quality changes. In particular, it is also possible to achieve further quality improvement in retransmission through combination of the reception results of the first transmission and the reception results of the retransmission.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An example of the retransmission method is described. If the receiver fails to successfully decode the received data, in other words, if a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error occurs (CRC=NG), the receiver transmits &#x201c;Nack&#x201d; to the transmitter. The transmitter that has received &#x201c;Nack&#x201d; retransmits the data. If the receiver successfully decodes the received data, in other words, if a CRC error does not occur (CRC=OK), the receiver transmits &#x201c;AcK&#x201d; to the transmitter. The transmitter that has received &#x201c;Ack&#x201d; transmits the next data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The logical channels described in Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 6) are described.

This is a method in which a plurality of basic beams having narrowed directivity are formed in a first stage, and SN enhancement or null formation is performed by using the first-stage beams in a second stage. The following two types of methods have been studied. One method is a hybrid method in which beams are formed in an analog manner in the first stage, and beams are formed digitally in the second stage. According to the hybrid method, processing of a digital unit can be reduced. The other method is a full-digital method in which beams are digitally formed also in the first stage by reducing the number of first-stage beams to the number that can be processed.

When starting a cell search, in Step ST<b>601</b>, the communication terminal synchronizes slot timing and frame timing by a primary synchronization signal (P-SS) and a secondary synchronization signal (S-SS) transmitted from a neighbor base station.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0117">The P-SS and S-SS are collectively referred to as a synchronization signal (SS). Synchronization codes, which correspond one-to-one to PCIs assigned per cell, are assigned to the synchronization signals (SSs). The number of PCIs is currently studied in 504 ways. The 504 ways of PCIs are used for synchronization, and the PCIs of the synchronized cells are detected (specified).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0118">In Step ST<b>602</b>, next, the user equipment detects a cell-specific reference signal (CRS) being a reference signal (RS) transmitted from the base station per cell and measures the reference signal received power (RSRP). The codes corresponding one-to-one to the PCIS are used for the reference signal RS. Separation from another cell is enabled by correlation using the code. The code for RS of the cell is derived from the PCI specified in Step ST<b>601</b>, so that the RS can be detected and the RS received power can be measured.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0119">In Step ST<b>603</b>, next, the user equipment selects the cell having the best RS received quality, for example, the cell having the highest RS received power, that is, the best cell, from one or more cells that have been detected up to Step ST<b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0120">In Step ST<b>604</b>, next, the user equipment receives the PBCH of the best cell and obtains the BCCH that is the broadcast information. A master information block (MIB) containing the cell configuration information is mapped to the BCCH over the PBCH. Accordingly, the MIB is obtained by obtaining the BCCH through reception of the PBCH. Examples of the MIB information include the downlink (DL) system bandwidth (also referred to as a transmission bandwidth configuration (dl-bandwidth)), the number of transmission antennas, and a system frame number (SFN).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0121">In Step ST<b>605</b>, next, the user equipment receives the DL-SCH of the cell based on the cell configuration information of the MIB, to thereby obtain a system information block (SIB) 1 of the broadcast information BCCH. The SIB1 contains the information about the access to the cell, information about cell selection, and scheduling information on another SIB (SIBk; k is an integer equal to or greater than two). In addition, the SIB1 contains a tracking area code (TAC).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0122">In Step ST<b>606</b>, next, the communication terminal compares the TAC of the SIB1 received in Step ST<b>605</b> with the TAC portion of a tracking area identity (TAI) in the tracking area list that has already been possessed by the communication terminal. The tracking area list is also referred to as a TAI list. TAI is the identification information for identifying tracking areas and is composed of a mobile country code (MCC), a mobile network code (MNC), and a tracking area code (TAC). MCC is a country code. MNC is a network code. TAC is the code number of a tracking area.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0123">If the result of the comparison of Step ST<b>606</b> shows that the TAC received in Step ST<b>605</b> is identical to the TAC included in the tracking area list, the user equipment enters an idle state operation in the cell.

The core-network-side device transmits the updated tracking area list to the communication terminal. The communication terminal rewrites (updates) the TAC list of the communication terminal based on the received tracking area list. After that, the communication terminal enters the idle state operation in the cell.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0125">For example, the following description concerns a technology of changing basic beams depending on a change in a communication state to maintain communication.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0126">The 5G system requires large-volume communication and therefore needs to use a wide bandwidth with high carrier frequencies. However, this requires a countermeasure against a propagation loss due to the high carrier frequencies. In order to compensate for the propagation loss, beamforming with a super multi-element antenna not only in the base station but also in the user equipment has been studied. With a multi-element antenna, the following two methods have been studied.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0127">One method is a method in which an analog-to-digital converter (AD) and a digital-to-analog converter (DA) are provided for each antenna element to perform beamforming. It is difficult to secure calculation accuracy due to a low antenna gain. Further, it is known that calculations for enhancing a signal-to-noise ratio (SN ratio) and forming a null of a beam are increased by a cubic order of the number of elements, and a reduction in a processing volume needs to be studied in various ways. Note that the SN ratio may also be hereinafter referred to as SN.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0128">For example, a method of forming beams in two stages is known. According to a directivity variable antenna, when the same signal is emitted from an element of each antenna in phase, a signal having narrowed directivity in a direction perpendicular (right in front) with respect to an emission plane can be sent out. When the phase of the same signal emitted from each element is adjusted to satisfy an expression of distance between elements&#xd7;sin &#x3b8;, beams having a transmission direction (i.e., directivity) deviated by &#x3b8; can be formed. In this manner, when a plurality of basic beams having narrowed directivity are formed in the first stage to obtain an antenna gain, SN can be enhanced and calculation accuracy can be enhanced. At the same time, due to {number of antenna elements}&#x3e;{number of first-stage beams}, a calculation amount for forming a null by the first-stage beams can be reduced in the second stage. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0129">In another method, a plurality of antenna elements are configured in an analog manner in the first stage to perform desired beamforming. In this case, the first-stage analog beams are formed as beams with narrow directivity by using a horn antenna or a sector antenna, or making the phase variable in an analog manner. The second stage employs a hybrid method of digitally forming the first-stage beams, similar to the above-mentioned first method. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0130">With any of the above-mentioned methods, in a case where beams are formed in two stages by both of the base station and the user equipment, when the user equipment uses first-stage beams (n beams) of the user equipment to receive known sequence data transmitted with first-stage beams (m beams) of the base station, the user equipment estimates n&#xd7;m channels. For example, through diversity and equalization processing performed with use of the estimated channels, throughput is enhanced. Particularly, in order to remove interference between beams, it is efficient to multiply transmission data of the user equipment by inverse characteristics of the above-mentioned n&#xd7;m channels as a precoding weight to form the second-stage beams. For example, the weight calculation can be done by calculating an inverse matrix of a matrix of the n&#xd7;m channels. When the transmission data is multiplied by the inverse matrix, only the diagonal elements of the matrix remain to eliminate a cross factor between beams. Thus, interference between beams can be removed.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0131">However, a communication state of the user equipment is changed due to movement or the like, and accordingly the first-stage beams are changed every moment. Therefore, there is a problem that channel estimation fails, and correct precoding cannot be performed in the base station.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0132">The first embodiment solves the above-mentioned problem. For example, the following description concerns re-acquisition at the time of beam disappearance.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0133">Ideally, regarding the first-stage beams of the user equipment, a plurality of first-stage beams cover the whole area. However, when directivity is directed in a non-communication direction, directivity cannot be narrowed in a desired direction. Thus, an antenna gain cannot be obtained. Therefore, it is efficient to orient directivity in a direction of an opposing base station. Alternatively, it is efficient to orient directivity in a direction in which a signal from a base station directly arrives or a direction in which a signal from a base station arrives through reflection and diffraction. Further, it is efficient to direct the first-stage beams to all the base stations and repeaters transmitting a primary synchronization signal (PSS) or a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) other than the base station currently in communication.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0134">Therefore, the user equipment discontinuously transmits a known sequence signal corresponding to a signal called sounding, so that the user equipment can monitor variation of the channels of the base station. This signal is transmitted with the directivity of the first-stage beams. Further, the user equipment may change directivity of the beams when the user equipment does not communicate and thereby sequentially may monitor neighboring spaces as to if channels have not been changed due to movement or the like.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0135">For example, when the channels that can be estimated from the first-stage beams are significantly changed due to movement of the user equipment or tilting of the user equipment, a received signal of the known sequence data from the opposing base station disappears or becomes weak. In this manner, the user equipment detects a change of the channels. When SN is reduced to be smaller than a certain threshold and a change of the channels is detected, if in communication, data communication/sounding communication is stopped, and all of the spaces are monitored by using a time period in which data communication is scheduled. When the known sequence data transmitted by the base station is found, The first-stage beams should be formed to be directed to the base station and to a sounding signal be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0136">If there are a plurality of base station antennas in the same direction and a plurality of channels (links) having a low correlation with a plurality of antennas of the user equipment, and the plurality of antennas of the user equipment are directed in the direction, then different pieces of data can be simultaneously transmitted and received from the plurality of antennas, which is efficient.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a detailed example of a processing flow.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0138">The user equipment and the base station perform a beam detection procedure St<b>901</b> at the time of initial synchronization establishment. The base station notifies what sort of frequency, timing, and a code (a seed of a spread code or the like) beams for random access are formed, through broadcast information. The user equipment receives the broadcast information, and performs neighboring cell/beam search based on the received broadcast information. With this, the user equipment monitors the status of channel between each beam of the base station and each beam of the user equipment, and arrange orders the channel in the order of high quality.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0139">Next, the user equipment and the base station perform a communication establishment procedure St<b>902</b>. The user equipment transmits a channel configuration request on a random access channel or the like to an acceptable base station among the base station beams found in St<b>901</b>. In this case, the user equipment transmits the channel configuration request to the above-mentioned acceptable base station with directivity of the second-stage beams having higher directivity through synthesis with the first-stages beams of the user equipment. Further, the user equipment transmits the channel configuration request, in accordance with a resource (frequency, timing, and a code (a seed of a spread code or the like)) of the base station beams. When the directivity (half width) of the random access is adjusted in accordance with the speed of the neighboring monitor cycle of the user equipment, a change in a propagation environment can be handled, and a probability that communication can be established is enhanced. Specifically, it is also effective to employ A&#xd7;C/D (&#xb0;) where A (&#xb0;) is a usual half width other than random access, C (ms) is the neighboring monitor cycle of the user equipment, and D (ms) is average time for changing by 3 dB under the speed of propagation environment change averaged in a moving UE.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0140">A flow of the procedure St<b>903</b> and later is a flow of a case where the received signal of the known sequence data (DMRS or CSI-RS) from the opposing base station disappears or becomes weak due to a change of a direction of the user equipment, for example.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0141">In the procedure St<b>903</b>, the user equipment simultaneously performs normal communication and measurement of SN of each beam. The user equipment monitors a known sequence of the first-stage beams when the known sequence is transmitted from the base station with directivity of the first-stage beam, and monitors a known sequence of the second-stage beams when the known sequence is transmitted with directivity of the second-stage beams. SN is measured by monitoring the known sequence. In general, a communication channel is formed with the second-stage beams, and therefore DMRS/CSI-RS transmitted with directivity of the second-stage beams is monitored.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0142">In the procedure St<b>904</b>, the user equipment determines whether or not all of the SNs of the second-stage beams used in communication are equal to or less than a certain threshold that can maintain communication quality.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0143">When a condition that that all of the SNs of the second-stage beams are equal to or less than a threshold is not satisfied, i.e., when at least one SN of the second-stage beams used in communication is greater than the threshold, the user equipment continues the procedure St<b>903</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0144">On the other hand, when all of the SNs of the second-stage beams are equal to or less than the threshold, if the user equipment is in communication, the user equipment stops data communication/sounding communication, and transmits a beam disappearance notification (procedure St<b>905</b>). It is desirable that the beam disappearance notification be transmitted by using a dedicated/shared channel (PUSCH/PUCCH), for the sake of simplification of communication state transition. Alternatively, it is important to not disconnect communication so that random access may be used for the beam disappearance notification. Alternatively, it is important not to disconnect communication and also efficient to maximize the half width or use omni beams as the beams to transmit the beam disappearance notification, from the viewpoint of directivity (half width) of the beams.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0145">The user equipment starts a beam re-detection procedure St<b>906</b> while waiting for a response to the beam disappearance notification.

In an urban case such as a dense-urban model, it is important to narrow directivity so that a transmission signal from the user equipment does not interfere with other base stations not in communication and also from the aspect of enhancing communication capacity in a system totally.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0159">In such a case, when the beam disappearance notification is transmitted with omni-directivity in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the interference can be reduced by configuring the transmission power as follows.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0160">The user equipment transmits a known sequence corresponding to sounding with directivities of the first-stage beams and the second-stage beams, and transmits a known sequence corresponding to sounding with omni-directivity, in order to perform and maintain communication. The transmission may be discontinuously performed in a manner of time, frequency, and a code. The base station performs quality measurement, e.g., SN measurement, of the omni beams, as well as the first-stage beams and the second-stage beams. Even when SN of the omni beams is low, the omni beams are completely in synchronization with the second-stage beams in communication. Thus, SN of the omni beams can be accurately known. It is desirable that the base station notify the user equipment of a result of the SN measurement of the signal transmitted by the user equipment with the omni beams regularly (RRC/PUSCH or PUCCH). When it is time that the user equipment transmits the beam disappearance notification, the user equipment determines transmission power of the omni beams for transmitting the beam disappearance notification, using the SN of the omni beams that is most recently received.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0161">The description above describes an example in which the SN of the omni beams measured by the base station is notified, but information other than the SN may be notified. For example, information of power for the user equipment to transmit the beam disappearance notification with the omni beams may be notified, in consideration of a change of reception performance of a base station, depending on a base station.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0162">For example, it is also efficient to notify by how many more decibels should transmission power of the omni beams be increased (or by how many more decibels may it be decreased) to enable the beam disappearance notification to reach the base station with SN that can be received by the base station.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0163">Alternatively, for example, it is also efficient to notify by how many decibels the omni beams seem lower (or seem higher) than the directivity beams. The user equipment can determine the transmission power, in consideration of a modulation level, a coded rate, or the like in communication, and a modulation level, a coded rate, or the like used for the beam disappearance notification.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0164">As described above, the user equipment monitors SN of the base station in communication, and detects disappearance of a base station signal. When the base station signal disappears, the user equipment notifies the base station of the disappearance of the base station signal with a signal having wide directivity. Consequently, link re-establishment between the base station and the user equipment can be performed soon, and communication can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0165">According to the first embodiment, for example, the following configuration is provided.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0166">A communication system including a user equipment, and a base station configured to be connected to the user equipment to perform radio communication with the user equipment is provided. More specifically, the user equipment performs radio communication with a beam. When the user equipment detects a beam disappearance state being a state incapable of maintaining communication quality with the base station, the user equipment transmits a notification of the beam disappearance state with a beam having a wider half width than a half width before detection of the beam disappearance state.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0167">Further, a communication system including a user equipment and a base station configured to be connected to the user equipment to perform radio communication with the user equipment is provided. More specifically, the user equipment performs radio communication with a beam. When the user equipment detects a beam disappearance state being a state incapable of maintaining communication quality with a first base station, the user equipment transmits a notification of the beam disappearance state to a second base station configuring dual connectivity with the first base station. When the second base station receives the notification of the beam disappearance state, the second base station gives a command to the first base station to perform beam re-detection processing with the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0168">According to such a configuration, the above-mentioned problem is solved, and the above-mentioned effect can be obtained.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0165" num="0169">For example, the second embodiment involves a technology to maintain a communication by changing basic beams depending on a change in a communication state, and further involves specifying beams of the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0170">When beamforming is performed in two stages by both of the base station and the user equipment similar to the first embodiment, if the base station cannot specify beams of the user equipment, throughput is affected. Specifically, the base station receives known sequence data form the user equipment, acquires a channel estimation value from the received data, and determines beams to be formed based on the channel estimation value. However, when the base station cannot specify the beams of the user equipment, there is a problem that the base station cannot determine what sort of beams should be formed to enable improvement in throughput.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0171">For example, when two beams have a high correlation and thus the two beams are hardly separated, it is efficient to transmit the same data, instead of transmitting different pieces of data for each beam. This is because such a manner of transmission enhances SN and improves throughput. On the other hand, if two beams have a low correlation, different pieces of data are transmitted for each beam to gain maximum throughput. Consequently, actual throughput can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0172">In view of this, a technology of enabling identification of beams having different directivities and half widths to

have the same direction but have different half widths, and therefore are assigned different IDs.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0177">Further, it can be known that the beams of the beam IDs=2, 3 are emitted to the same area but have different beam IDs. This is effective when an antenna corresponding to the beam ID=2 and an antenna corresponding to the beam ID=3 are sufficiently away from each other and are in a low correlation. Therefore, it is efficient when there are a large number of users in the area or when there is a user using high speed transmission. For example, under a configuration of forming the first-stage beams in an analog manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrate examples of a relationship between directivity and a half width of a planar antenna, concerning directivity in a range from &#x2212;90&#xb0; to +90&#xb0;. In contrast, configuring directivity and a half width in a range from &#x2212;180&#xb0; to +180&#xb0; is also possible, according to a configuration in which a dipole antenna, a helical antenna, or the like is used as a basic element, and a plurality of basic elements are arrayed in a circular shape (i.e., a cylindrical shape) as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, and the first-stage beams are digitally formed.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0179">Here, the user equipment is different from the base station in that the user equipment significantly changes a direction as time elapses, and in that surroundings of the user equipment change. Therefore, a situation in which the channels change and are not restored to the original state frequently occurs. In view of this, it is effective that the user equipment monitors SN of the known sequence signal from the base station to detect whether or not there is a significant change in the channels, and when it is determined that there has been a significant change in the channels, different beam IDs are assigned. According to this, misuse of channel information detected from the same beam ID before the change of the channels can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0180">In this manner, new beam IDs are successively assigned. Thus, when p beam IDs are cyclically used (1, 2, . . . , p, 1, 2, . . . ), p or more beam IDs can be secured, where p is the number of beam IDs that can be configured for the first-stage beams. Consequently, the number of information bits can be limited even when the number of IDs is large. Thus, transmission efficiency can be increased. For example, when the beam IDs are assigned with zero-based numbering and p=256, a configuration of the beam IDs=0 to 255 is employed, and the beam IDs can be transmitted with 8 bits. The control information is an overhead, and is repeatedly transmitted together with data (U-plane data) used by the user, and thus reduction in the number of bits even by 1 bit can enhance transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0181">The upper limit p of the number of IDs is notified from the base station by using broadcast information or RRC (corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP) at the time of channel configuration.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0182">Alternatively, it is also effective to prepare as many IDs as a doubled number of IDs that can be configured for the first-stage beams (i.e., prepare two sets of IDs), and use another set of IDs (i.e., toggle the two sets of IDs to be used) at the time of changing the beam IDs. The IDs to be used when to change the beam IDs are notified from the base station by using broadcast information or RRC (corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP) at the time of channel configuration.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0183">(2) Next, means for matching recognition of the beam IDs between the user equipment and the base station is described.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0184">The first method is a method in which numbers of the beam IDs are transmitted as data, and in this case, the beam ID data is transmitted with a beam having directivity and a half width corresponding to the beam IDs to be transmitted. The beam ID data may accompany the user data as a control channel (corresponding to PUCCH in 3GPP). The base station demodulates the control channel, and when the CRC is okay, the base station can extract beam IDs of the beam.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0185">The second method is a method in which, unlike transmitting the beam IDs as data, association between the beam IDs and a transmission condition of the beam IDs (a transmission timing, a transmission frequency, etc.) is configured in RRC in advance.

Therefore, a change speed of the channels may be monitored, and a configuration value may be changed depending on a monitoring result. As an index for monitoring the change of the channels, a Doppler frequency measured in the base station for each user equipment may be used. Alternatively, information about SN [change speed of SN, variability (dispersion) of SN, or the like] from the opposing device may be acquired in the base station or the user equipment, and such information may be used as the index for monitoring the change of the channels. When it is determined that a change is needed, re-configuration is performed with RRC (corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">The third method is a method in which, as the data to be transmitted, an orthogonal code/quasi-orthogonal code using the beam ID as a seed, such as a Gold code and an Hadamard code, is used. The sounding signals of a plurality of beams can be simultaneously transmitted, and thus an information amount for transmitting the beam IDs being an overhead for the U-plane data can be reduced. Further, when beam directions are different, the effect of space division multiplex (SDM) can be taken into consideration for the simultaneously transmitted sounding signals, and SN can be further improved than simply spreading the code. Association between the seed of the orthogonal code/quasi-orthogonal code and the beam IDs are configured in advance in RRC (corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP), and the base station identifies the beam IDs with a detectable seed.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">In the above-mentioned first to third methods, to change the beam IC assignment in association with a significant change of the channels between the base station and the user equipment, a method of re-configuring RRC (corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP) at the time of the change or a method of transmitting beam IDs for re-detection in advance is effective.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">Alternatively, when IDs for re-detection are transmitted in advance, a message which has included as many IDs as a multiple of the number of IDs that can be configured in first-stage beams is transmitted.

When the base station detects that the beam IDs have been changed, the base station stops and discards processing of integrating channel information detected from previous beam IDs, and calculates new channel information.

The base station determines signal quality by using SN or the like to detect whether or not there is a beam.

In this case, in order not to overlap the beam IDs in the user equipments, association between the beam ID and the resource (a transmission timing, a frequency, etc.) is configured in RRC in advance. Although some user equipments need to suddenly search for many beam IDs again due to dropping and a direction change, in view of the fact that there are also user equipments such as user equipments installed in a vending machine that are not assumed to move, grouping can reduce radio resources due to the statistical multiplexing effect.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">The known sequence for the group IDs is notified from the base station with broadcast information or a medium corresponding to RRC Connection Reconfiguration in 3GPP.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">When two or more, out of the known sequence common to all of those user equipments and common to all of the beam IDs, the known sequence common to all of the beam IDs used by those user equipments, and the known sequence for the group IDs, are used in combination, detection processing of the base station can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0206">According to the second embodiment, for example, the following configuration is provided.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0207">A communication system including a user equipment, and a base station configured to be connected to the user equipment to perform radio communication with the user equipment is provided.

The third embodiment describes beamforming of the user equipment to improve throughput of downlink (the base station&#x2192;the user equipment).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0211">It is known that a method in which the base station acquires downlink channel information from a received uplink signal by using reciprocity, and calculates a precoding weight based on the acquired downlink channel information, and multiplies downlink transmission data by the calculated precoding weight is effective to enhance throughput. However, data transmitted in such a way does not consider an interference component from another base station, and thus there is a problem that cannot gain an expected throughput.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0212">Solutions to this problem is described below.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0213">The first method is a method in which interference information from another base station other than the base station in communication is measured by the user equipment, and the information is fed back to the base station in communication.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0214">The user equipment receives the transmission data multiplied by the precoding weight and transmitted by the base station in communication while the user equipment reduces interference from another base station as much as possible by using a degree of freedom of the antenna of the user equipment with post-coding or the like.

When the base station in communication increases transmission power based on the feedback information, throughput can be enhanced.

In contrast, when the insufficiency value indicating insufficiency with respect to required SN or the interference amount from other base station not in communication is fed back to the base station in communication by using the PUCCH or the L1 control signal in 3GPP, the feed-back information can be performed in a short time period. Therefore, variation of the fading can be compensated for, and more stable communication can be performed. Further, when a transmission power increase/decrease request command (e.g., 1: 1 dB increase, 0: 1 dB decrease, or +1: increase required, 0: change not required, &#x2212;1: decrease possible) is employed to feed back the command, it is effective to reduce an information amount of the feedback.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0221">The second method is a method in which adjustment is preformed such that data transmission from a plurality of base stations is not simultaneously performed, by using the information about how much interference there will be if receiving signals with the beams having appropriate directivity formed by the user equipment between the user equipment and the base station in communication (information corresponding to a measurement report of RRC in 3GPP).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">The base station in communication notifies neighboring base stations having the cell IDs notified from the user equipment of information about a resource (a timing, a frequency, a spread code, a resource block, or the like) of which use is not desired or of which use should be refrained from, through a message between the base stations.

After the processing, the base station performs precoding on downlink data to transmit the downlink data.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0265">Note that, when the base station transmits data before Step St<b>1610</b>, the base station transmits data without precoding.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0266">When the reciprocity capability information is transmitted as UE-capability of the user equipment from the user equipment to the base station as described above, even if reciprocity capabilities of the user equipment and the base station coexist, precoding can be performed with capable transmission efficiency. Particularly, when reciprocity capability information is provided for each frequency band, even if reciprocity capabilities coexist for each frequency band in one user equipment, precoding can be performed with capable transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0267"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrate a sequence diagram illustrating an example of performing configuration of reciprocity capability for each frequency band at the time of handover. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> are connected at the position of the border line BL. Exchanges of capabilities of a frequency band that can be used in a destination (destination after handover) are performed, and the base station determines whether reciprocity up to a value with lower transmission efficiency is used, or channel estimation is performed without using reciprocity. The determination result is notified, and then communication of U-plane data is started.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0268">When the user equipment transmits a measurement report (Step St<b>1701</b>) and a source base station on movement determines that communication quality has deteriorated worse than a certain threshold based on the measurement report, a source base station on movement notifies an SGW (a serving gateway) of Handover Required (Step St<b>1702</b>). The SGW notifies the target base station on movement of a Handover Request (Step St<b>1703</b>) depending on the details of the Handover Required. After the SGW receives a notification from the target base station on movement that handover is possible (Step St<b>1704</b>), the SGW notifies the source base station on movement that the handover is possible (Step St<b>1705</b>).</p><p id="p-0273" num="0269">Here, the source base station on movement notifies the SGW of information about capability of reciprocity of the user equipment and information about a capable MCS and number of layers as information of the user equipment (Step St<b>1706</b>). Particularly, it is efficient that the above-mentioned information to be notified be information for each frequency band. The SGW transfers the notified information to the target base station on movement (Step ST<b>1707</b>). Therefore, when the source base station on movement directly transmits a status transfer to the target base station on movement, it is efficient because configuration time can be reduced. The target base station on movement determines capability of reciprocity, a capable MCS and number of layers, etc. (Step St<b>1708</b>), and notifies the source base station on movement of configuration information of the capability of precoding for each frequency band to be used as a result of the determination (Step St<b>1709</b>).</p><p id="p-0274" num="0270">Subsequent Steps St<b>1710</b> to St<b>1715</b> are the same as the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> (example in which configuration of capability of reciprocity for each frequency band is performed at the time of channel configuration).</p><p id="p-0275" num="0271">According to the fourth embodiment, for example, the following configuration is provided.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0272">A communication system including a user equipment, and a base station configured to be connected to the user equipment to perform radio communication with the user equipment is provided. More specifically, the user equipment is configured to perform reciprocity-using channel estimation being channel estimation using reciprocity of a channel, for each frequency band.
