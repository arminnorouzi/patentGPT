The parameter is a coefficient that converts an operation amount input to the slewing lever, for example, into a command value of the brake of the slewing device. In this case, the braking time that was A seconds before the parameter adjustment can be shortened to B seconds by adjusting the parameter. As a result, the brake performance satisfies the determination criterion.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The performance of the equipment <b>14</b> is a time required to generate an operation amount per unit time or a unit operation amount of a component that affects an actuator included in the working machine <b>2</b>, such as brake performance or engine performance.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, the modification section <b>133</b> can modify the parameter during work of the working machine <b>2</b>.

The determination section <b>131</b> derives an estimation equation (approximate equation) of change in measurement value based on the time-series data of the measurement value having been acquired. This estimation equation is used for setting the upper limit value and the lower limit value. For example, assume that an estimation equation for a certain item is f(t)=at (a: coefficient, t: time). In this case, the upper limit value is expressed by, for example, g(t)=at+u (u&#x3e;0), and the lower limit value is expressed by h(t)=at &#x2212;v (v&#x3e;0).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The estimation equation is an equation for estimating the current (time t) state from the most recent state (time t&#x2212;&#x394;t) from the current.

Specifically, the determination section <b>131</b> compares the current state acquired by the sensor <b>12</b> with the current upper limit value g(t) and the current lower limit value h(t), and determines whether the current state falls within the range of the current upper limit value g(t) and the current lower limit value h(t). Then, when the determination section <b>131</b> determines that the current state is outside the range, the calculation section <b>132</b> calculates the parameter so that the current state falls within the current upper limit value g(t) and the current lower limit value h(t). This makes the current state satisfy the determination criterion. The various items include one or more thresholds. The calculation section <b>132</b> increases or decreases the parameter according to the degree of deviation of the current state acquired by the sensor <b>12</b> from the threshold. The sampling period in acquiring temporal change of the measurement value of the sensor <b>12</b> can be appropriately changed. ON/OFF of sampling can be appropriately switched by the operator of the working machine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The controller <b>13</b> may be configured to modify the parameter by transitioning the state of the working machine <b>2</b> to a state in which the parameter can be modified. The state transition may be performed in an intangible manner using control software or may be performed in a tangible manner using a physical button. After the state transition, the display <b>16</b> is caused to display an operation example, and the operator is caused to actually perform this operation. Examples of the operation include a boom raising full lever, an arm pushing full lever, and a slewing full lever, but are not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">During operation of the working machine <b>2</b>, based on the temporal change of the measurement value, the determination section <b>131</b> calculates the upper limit value and the lower limit value based on the estimated value of the current state estimated to be output in a case where the values of various items assumed as the determination criterion are input, and sets the range of the upper limit value and the lower limit value as the determination criterion. Then, when the determination section <b>131</b> determines that the current state acquired by the sensor <b>12</b> deviates from the determination criterion, the calculation section <b>132</b> calculates the parameter so as to satisfy the determination criterion. After the parameter is modified or not modified, the state of the working machine <b>2</b> transitions to a normal work state. The controller <b>13</b> may execute a step of causing the operator to perform the same operation again to confirm whether the determination criterion is satisfied after the parameter is modified and before the state of the working machine <b>2</b> transitions to the normal work state.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a view showing temporal change of a measurement value of the sensor <b>12</b>.
