The brake system <b>100</b> is shown here as a hydraulic brake by wire system in which electronically controlled fluid pressure is at least partially utilized to apply braking forces for the brake system <b>100</b>. The brake system <b>100</b> may suitably be used on a ground vehicle, such as an automotive vehicle having four wheels with a wheel brake associated with each wheel. Furthermore, the brake system <b>100</b> can be provided with other braking functions such as anti-lock braking (ABS) and other slip control features to effectively brake the vehicle. Components of the brake system <b>100</b> may be housed in one or more blocks or housings. The block or housing may be made from solid material, such as aluminum, that has been drilled, machined, or otherwise formed to house the various components. Fluid conduits may also be formed in the block or housing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrated embodiment of the brake system <b>100</b>, there are four wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D. The wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D can have any suitable wheel brake structure operated electrically and/or by the application of pressurized brake fluid. Each of the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D may include, for example, a brake caliper mounted on the vehicle to engage a frictional element (such as a brake disc) that rotates with a vehicle wheel to effect braking of the associated vehicle wheel. The wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D can be associated with any combination of front and rear wheels of the vehicle in which the brake system <b>100</b> is installed.

The first piston segment <b>250</b> has a first cross-sectional footprint, and the second piston segment <b>252</b> has a second cross-sectional footprint which is larger than the first cross-sectional footprint. For example, when a cross-section of the first piston segment <b>250</b> is substantially circular, the second piston segment <b>252</b> may have a substantially circular (or any other shape) cross-section with a larger area than the area of the cross-section of the first piston segment <b>250</b>.

In the power transmission unit <b>108</b> configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the second piston segment <b>252</b> includes a ball screw cavity <b>254</b>, which allows the ball screw <b>244</b> to selectively extend into the body of the second piston segment <b>252</b>, thereby potentially reducing the total dimension of the power transmission unit <b>108</b> in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A housing <b>256</b> at least partially encloses the plunger piston <b>248</b>, the ball screw <b>244</b>, and the ball nut <b>246</b>. A plunger chamber <b>258</b>, comprising the first and second chamber segments <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, is at least partially defined by the housing <b>256</b> and at least one of the first and second cross-sectional footprints of the plunger piston <b>248</b>. It is contemplated that one or more seals, such as, but not limited to, the large and small plunger seals <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> may be provided to help fluidically separate the first and second chamber segments <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> from each other in the plunger chamber <b>258</b>. The plunger chamber <b>258</b> is configured to contain hydraulic fluid and is selectively pressurized by reciprocal motion of the plunger piston <b>248</b> with respect to the housing <b>256</b>. The plunger chamber <b>258</b> includes, as mentioned, the first and second chamber segments <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, which are configured to receive the first and second piston segments <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, respectively, for reciprocal motion within the plunger chamber <b>258</b>. The first chamber segment <b>136</b> has a first bore cross-sectional area, and the second chamber segment <b>138</b> has a second bore cross-sectional area which is larger than the first bore cross-sectional area. Again, as mentioned above, the first and second bore cross-sectional areas, and the cross-sectional shapes thereof, are selectively coordinated with the cross-sectional shapes of the first and second piston segments <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> to facilitate pressurization of hydraulic fluid within the first and second chamber segments <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> in a desired manner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first output channel (shown here as first PTU output <b>134</b>A) is in fluid communication between the first chamber segment <b>136</b> and at least one SAP valve <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> associated with at least one selected wheel brake <b>102</b>. The second output channel (shown here as second PTU output <b>134</b> B) is in fluid communication between the second chamber segment <b>138</b> and at least one SAP valve <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> associated with at least one other wheel brake <b>102</b> than the one which is in fluid communication with the first output channel <b>134</b>A. The first and second output channels <b>134</b>A, <b>134</b>B may be fluidically separated from one another by structures of the power transmission unit, such as a block <b>264</b> into which the housing <b>256</b> is connected. It is also contemplated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, that the housing <b>256</b> could be provided in multiple parts, such as <b>256</b>A and <b>256</b>B, with each segment of that housing <b>256</b> enclosing different components and/or chambers of the power transmission unit <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An electric motor <b>132</b>, which may be the aforementioned dual wound electric motor, may be provided for selectively driving the ball screw <b>244</b> of the single acting plunger assembly type power transmission unit <b>108</b> to responsively reciprocate the plunger piston within the plunger housing. Through control of the electric motor <b>132</b>, the ECUs <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B may control actuation of the power transmission unit <b>108</b>, which results in control of supply of pressurized hydraulic fluid to other portions of the brake system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the power transmission unit <b>108</b> may include a cuplike floating seal retainer <b>266</b> located within the second chamber segment <b>138</b> and having proximal and distal retainer faces <b>268</b> and <b>270</b>, respectively, separated by an annular retainer body <b>272</b>. The distal retainer face <b>270</b> includes a piston aperture <b>274</b> configured to receive the first piston segment <b>250</b> slidingly therethrough. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the small plunger seal <b>262</b> could be positioned in or adjacent to the piston aperture <b>274</b>, to help seal against the first piston segment <b>250</b>. The piston aperture <b>274</b> has an aperture footprint which is smaller than the second cross-sectional footprint of the second piston segment <b>252</b>, such that the second piston segment <b>252</b> is prevented from passing through at least a portion of the piston aperture <b>274</b>. The seal retainer <b>266</b> could have a substantially right cylindrical shape, or could include any other desired configuration. Optionally, the seal retainer <b>266</b> could have a longitudinally fluted outer surface around the retainer body <b>272</b> to facilitate fluid flow between the first chamber segment <b>136</b> and a portion of the first PTU output <b>134</b>A formed in the block <b>264</b>. The seal retainer <b>266</b> can &#x201c;float&#x201d; perpendicular to (i.e., can move laterally with respect to, and/or rotationally about) and/or parallel to the longitudinal direction. The floating seal retainer <b>266</b> and first piston segment <b>250</b> cooperatively resist fluid communication between the first and second chamber segments <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> through the piston aperture <b>274</b>. There is a narrow annular space located laterally between the seal retainer <b>266</b> and an inner wall of the plunger chamber <b>258</b>, which helps to separate (optionally with the assistance of retainer seal <b>278</b>) the channel of the first PTU output <b>134</b>A from the channel of the second PTU output <b>134</b>B. Stated differently, the floating seal retainer <b>266</b> and an inner surface of the second chamber segment <b>138</b> cooperatively define an annular second chamber space <b>276</b> placing the first output channel <b>134</b>A, or at least a portion thereof formed in the block <b>264</b>, in fluid communication with the first chamber segment <b>136</b>. An inner surface of the floating seal retainer <b>266</b> is in fluid communication with the second output channel <b>134</b>B.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a result, under influence of the electric motor with <b>132</b> driving the ball screw <b>244</b>, the ball nut <b>246</b> reciprocates longitudinally within at least a portion of the housing <b>256</b>. Such movement of the ball nut <b>246</b> causes the plunger piston <b>248</b> to likewise reciprocate with respect to the plunger chamber <b>258</b>. Motion of the first piston segment <b>250</b> toward the left, in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, causes hydraulic fluid within the first chamber segment <b>136</b> to become pressurized, travel through the annular space <b>276</b>, and flow, under pressure, out of the power transmission unit <b>108</b> through the first PTU output <b>134</b>A. Similarly, and also due to motion of the plunger piston <b>248</b>, motion of the second piston segment <b>252</b> toward the left, in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, causes hydraulic fluid within the second chamber segment <b>138</b> to become pressurized (at least partially against an inner surface of the seal retainer <b>266</b>) and flow, under pressure, out of the power transmission unit <b>108</b> through the second PTU output <b>134</b>B. Through use of such a stepped plunger chamber <b>258</b>, two physically separate sources of pressurized hydraulic fluid can be used to separately provide output pressure at two PTU output channels <b>134</b>A, <b>134</b>B. When the electric motor <b>132</b> is of a dual wound type, relatively high pressure can still be built on any desired number of the four wheel brakes <b>102</b>, even if one of the ECUs <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B is not functioning correctly to control the electric motor <b>132</b>. When one of the ECUs <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B fails completely and no longer controls a respective first or second pressure circuit, hydraulic pressure can still be provided by the power transmission unit <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref> actuate the wheel brakes <b>102</b> on the remaining first or second pressure circuit, despite the status of the ECU <b>114</b> on the field pressure circuit.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a second configuration of the brake system <b>100</b> is depicted, parts or all of which can be used with other components of the present invention, as desired.

In contrast, the phrase &#x201c;at least one of X&#x201d; can be interpreted to include one or more Xs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. Thus, a &#x201c;first&#x201d; element discussed below could also be termed a &#x201c;second&#x201d; element without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure. The sequence of operations (or steps) is not limited to the order presented in the claims or figures unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">While aspects of this disclosure have been particularly shown and described with reference to the example aspects above, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various additional aspects may be contemplated. For example, the specific methods described above for using the apparatus are merely illustrative; one of ordinary skill in the art could readily determine any number of tools, sequences of steps, or other means/options for placing the above-described apparatus, or components thereof, into positions substantively similar to those shown and described herein. In an effort to maintain clarity in the Figures, certain ones of duplicative components shown have not been specifically numbered, but one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, based upon the components that were numbered, the element numbers which should be associated with the unnumbered components; no differentiation between similar components is intended or implied solely by the presence or absence of an element number in the Figures. Any of the described structures and components could be integrally formed as a single unitary or monolithic piece or made up of separate sub-components, with either of these formations involving any suitable stock or bespoke components and/or any suitable material or combinations of materials. Any of the described structures and components could be disposable or reusable as desired for a particular use environment. Any component could be provided with a user-perceptible marking to indicate a material, configuration, at least one dimension, or the like pertaining to that component, the user-perceptible marking potentially aiding a user in selecting one component from an array of similar components for a particular use environment. A &#x201c;predetermined&#x201d; status may be determined at any time before the structures being manipulated actually reach that status, the &#x201c;predetermination&#x201d; being made as late as immediately before the structure achieves the predetermined status. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used herein to indicate a quality that is largely, but not necessarily wholly, that which is specified&#x2014;a &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; quality admits of the potential for some relatively minor inclusion of a non-quality item. Though certain components described herein are shown as having specific geometric shapes, all structures of this disclosure may have any suitable shapes, sizes, configurations, relative relationships, cross-sectional areas, or any other physical characteristics as desirable for a particular application. Any structures or features described with reference to one aspect or configuration could be provided, singly or in combination with other structures or features, to any other aspect or configuration, as it would be impractical to describe each of the aspects and configurations discussed herein as having all of the options discussed with respect to all of the other aspects and configurations. A device or method incorporating any of these features should be understood to fall under the scope of this disclosure as determined based upon the claims below and any equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Other aspects, objects, and advantages can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
