Western blot can examine the impact of different stimulus on a biological system (e.g., a biological entity) by observing the differences in the expression of different proteins. The expression of different proteins are identified by incubating a protein band isolated via Western blot with an antibody. Western blot can be a highly specific test for protein analysis; however, Western blot can be a low throughput technique and that can demand a large amount of sample and expensive antibodies. Furthermore, Western blots are labor intensive and demand a high level of skill on the part of the user executing the Western blot.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and advances in digital imaging have partially overcome the low throughput technique and can allow for some multiplex analysis and quantitation. Even with these advances, however, analysis is still limited to two or three proteins at a time. Further, these techniques can use custom gel formulations, gasket designs, and skilled manual intervention. The complexity of the multiplex Western blot assays can be labor intensive and expensive to operate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure relates to integrating a dispense system at the end of a Western blot workflow by utilizing a computing device coupled to a droplet dispenser (e.g., an inkjet printhead) to deposit a volume of fluid (e.g., antibody fluid) from a reservoir coupled to the droplet dispenser onto a matrix (e.g., a polyacrylamide, an agarose gel, and/or a nitrocellulose membrane). As used herein, the term &#x201c;reservoir&#x201d; refers to a container capable of including a reagent within the container. The computing device can include a controller to align the droplet dispenser with a protein band on the matrix and/or a specific area of the matrix and deposit an antibody fluid from the coupled reservoir. As used herein, the term &#x201c;matrix&#x201d; refers to a material that can form a structure suitable for the transfer and/or separation of molecules. For example, a matrix can be a nitrocellulose membrane with a protein-binding affinity that can be compatible with a variety of detection methods. Another example of a matrix is a polyacrylamide gel which can separate molecules of proteins by size and/or charge through the polyacrylamide matrix,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The droplet dispenser can be equipped with and/or coupled to sensors (e.g., optical sensor, camera, spectrometer, illuminance detection, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, etc.). For example, an optical sensor can be a device that can convert light rays into an electronic signal. Optical sensors can generate a signal that is readable by a computing device responsive to contact-less detection of the optical sensor. The droplet dispenser can use the sensors to identify a protein band on the matrix, determine the location of the protein band on the matrix, align the droplet dispenser with the protein band, and/or determine the status of antibody fluid deposited on the matrix (e.g., determine the completion of an analytical process).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Examples of the present disclosure include the droplet dispenser depositing a fluidic barrier on the matrix such that more than one antibody fluid droplet can be deposited on an individual protein band without contamination or merging of different antibody fluids. The fluidic barrier can be a hydrophobic area deposited from the droplet dispenser. The droplet dispenser can be aligned to deposit a first antibody fluid onto a first portion of the protein band, and the droplet dispenser can be further aligned to deposit a second antibody fluid onto a second portion of the protein band, where the first portion and the second portion are separated by the fluidic barrier. In this way, multiple antibodies can be tested on an individual protein band without adding additional equipment, additional cost, or additional time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example of the present disclosure, the droplet dispenser can refrain from depositing a first antibody fluid on a first protein band and instead deposit the first antibody fluid on a second protein band, The decision to selectively deposit a first and/or a second antibody fluid can be based in part on the knowledge of the proteins isolated from the biological system. For example, if it is known that a biological system includes a first protein band that does not react (e.g., bind) with a first antibody fluid, the droplet dispenser can refrain from depositing the first antibody fluid onto the first protein band. In this way, reagent such as antibody fluids can be selectively positioned onto selected protein bands. This can increase precision and save time and cost.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The figures herein follow a numbering convention in which the first digit corresponds to the drawing figure number and the remaining digits identify an element or component in the drawing.

The droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can include a plurality of reservoirs (not illustrated as to not obscure examples of the disclosure) which can contain a fluid. As used herein, the term &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; refers to a substance that can be deposited by a droplet dispenser. Some examples of fluids that can be contained in a reservoir include an antibody fluid, a fluidic barrier, a washing buffer (e.g., reagents), a stain (e.g., a generic visualization stain), etc. For example, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can include multiple antibody fluids, a hydrophobic fluid for a fluidic barrier, different concentrations of antibody fluids, reagents, stains, and combinations thereof.

Some of the protein bands <b>108</b> of the matrix <b>106</b> are not marked with an identifier as to not obscure examples of the disclosure, The protein bands <b>108</b> are each within a lane <b>107</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>107</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>107</b>-M. For example, the protein bands <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>108</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>108</b>-N are separated protein bands from the sample that was loaded into the lane <b>107</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, the lanes <b>107</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>107</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>107</b>-M can each contain a different sample (e.g., a different biological system). In other examples, each lane <b>107</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>107</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>107</b>-M can include the same sample (e.g., biological system) and antibody fluids can be used to precision the immunoblot array.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The samples can be loaded into their respective lanes <b>107</b> and the protein bands <b>108</b> can be separated into the matrix <b>106</b> using a protocol such as that for a Western blot. The matrix <b>106</b> can be transferred to a stage <b>110</b> such that the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can be positioned with the stage <b>110</b> to align a droplet <b>105</b> of antibody fluid (or other fluids) onto a portion of a protein band <b>108</b>. The droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can deposit multiple antibody fluids onto an individual protein band <b>108</b> and thereby increasing the quantity of tests that can be performed on the matrix <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the controller <b>102</b> can be communicatively coupled to a droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit antibody fluid onto a matrix <b>106</b> of an immunoblotting array. The controller <b>102</b> can align the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> with a protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> included in the matrix <b>106</b> and instruct the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit a first antibody fluid on to the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> of the matrix <b>106</b>. The controller <b>102</b> can instruct the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit a second antibody fluid on to the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> of the matrix <b>106</b> adjacent to the first antibody fluid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, &#x201c;communicatively coupled&#x201d; refers to various wired and/or wireless connections between devices such that data and/or signals may be transferred in various directions between the devices. The controller <b>102</b> and/or the computing device <b>101</b> can transmit control signals to the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> and/or the stage <b>110</b> related to an operation of the stage <b>110</b>. The controller <b>102</b> and/or the computing device <b>101</b> can receive information from stage <b>110</b> or the matrix <b>106</b> (via an imaging system described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> and/or the protein bands <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The controller <b>102</b> can control the movement and operation stage <b>110</b>, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b>, or both, The stage <b>110</b> can be communicatively coupled to the controller <b>102</b> to support the matrix <b>106</b> of the immunoblotting array, where the stage <b>110</b> is moveable to align the matrix <b>106</b> with the droplet dispenser <b>112</b>. The controller <b>102</b> can be a component of the computing device <b>101</b> such as a processor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a metal-programmable cell array (MPCA), or other combination of circuitry and/or logic to orchestrate execution of machine-readable instructions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can be a modified inkjet printhead. In an example, this modified inkjet printhead is a thermal inkjet (TIJ) which uses a heating resistor to form an ejection bubble to propel a liquid droplet. In another example, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> (e.g., the modified inkjet printhead) is a piezoelectric inkjet (PIJ) which uses a piezoelectric actuator to eject the droplet.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can alter the droplet <b>105</b> to a particular volume to be deposited onto the matrix <b>106</b> when instructed by the controller <b>102</b>. For example, based on the immunoblotting array, the droplet <b>105</b> can be customized by the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit a precise volume. Some immunoblotting arrays utilize small volumes (e.g., pico, nano, and/or micro liters) of antibody fluid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>102</b> can move the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to a position that is aligned with a protein band <b>108</b> of the matrix <b>106</b>. In some examples, a user of the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can be prompted to place the matrix <b>106</b> in a predetermined position and/or orientation relative to the stage <b>110</b>. For example, the predetermined position can be prompted to the user by utilizing pre-placed markings on the stage <b>110</b> which can direct the user to position the matrix <b>106</b> on the stage <b>110</b>. In another example, instead of or in addition to the pre-placed markings on the stage <b>110</b>, a physical protrusion and/or indentation on the stage <b>110</b> can prevent incorrect placement of the matrix <b>106</b> on to the stage <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As mentioned herein, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can be equipped with sensors to determine the alignment of the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> with the protein band <b>108</b>. The controller <b>102</b> can cause the stage <b>110</b> and/or the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to move to align the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> with a protein band <b>108</b>. For example, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can align with protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> to deposit droplet <b>105</b>. The position of the droplet <b>105</b> on the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> can be confirmed by the controller <b>102</b> and the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> by utilizing an optical sensor as will be described in herein.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the controller <b>102</b> can be communicatively coupled to an imaging system and/or an optical sensor, where a first and a second antibody fluid are deposited on the matrix <b>106</b> on different positions of the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> based on the optical sensor. Said differently, an optical sensor coupled to the controller, the optical sensor to determine a location of the protein band on the matrix to align the droplet dispenser with the protein band. Specifically, an optical sensor can be communicatively coupled to the controller <b>102</b> to determine a location of the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, where the second antibody fluid is deposited adjacent to the first antibody fluid responsive to the optical sensor determining the location of the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> and/or a reservoir coupled to the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can include a generic protein stain which can be deposited onto the matrix <b>106</b> to identify (e.g., visualize) the location of the protein bands <b>108</b>. For example, the controller <b>102</b> can instruct the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit a generic protein stain onto the matrix <b>106</b>, where the generic protein stain can couple to the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>. The controller <b>102</b> can further determine the location of the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> responsive to the optical sensor identifying the generic protein stain coupled to the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned, the controller <b>102</b> can deposit a fluidic barrier on the matrix <b>106</b> of the immunoblotting array, where the fluidic barrier is hydrophobic, For example, the controller <b>102</b> can instruct the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> to deposit the fluidic barrier on the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> to form a pattern. In this example, the pattern can separate a first antibody fluid from a second antibody fluid on the matrix <b>106</b>. Using this method, multiple different antibodies and/or multiple concentrations of antibodies can be tested on an individual protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a non-limiting example, the droplet dispenser <b>112</b> can deposit droplets (e.g., the droplet <b>105</b>), where each droplet covers a fraction of the protein band <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>.

The processing resource <b>682</b>, in some examples, can be analogous to the controller <b>102</b> describe with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The instructions <b>686</b>, <b>688</b>, <b>690</b>, and <b>692</b> are executable by the processing resource <b>682</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A system <b>680</b> can be a server or a computing device (among others) and can include the processing resource <b>682</b>. The system <b>680</b> can further include a non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>), on which may be stored instructions, such as instructions <b>686</b>, <b>688</b>, <b>690</b>, <b>692</b>. Although the following descriptions refer to a processing resource and a memory resource, the descriptions may also apply to a system with multiple processing resources and multiple memory resources. In such examples, the instructions may be distributed (e.g., stored) across multiple memory resources and the instructions may be distributed (e.g., executed by) across multiple processing resources.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The memory resource <b>684</b> may be electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical storage device that stores executable instructions. Thus, non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>) may be, for example, a non-transitory MRM comprising Random Access Memory (RAM), an Electrically-Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM), a storage drive, an optical disc, and the like. The non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>) may be disposed within a controller and/or computing device. In this example, the executable instructions <b>686</b>, <b>688</b>, <b>690</b>, and <b>692</b> can be &#x201c;installed&#x201d; on the device. Additionally, and/or alternatively, the non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>) can be a portable, external or remote storage medium, for example, that allows the system <b>680</b> to download the instructions <b>686</b>, <b>688</b>, <b>690</b>, and <b>692</b> from the portable/external/remote storage medium. In this situation, the executable instructions may be part of an &#x201c;installation package&#x201d;. As described herein, the non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>) can be encoded with executable instructions for array droplet manipulations.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The instructions <b>686</b>, when executed by a processing resource such as the processing resource <b>682</b>, can include instructions to determine a location of a protein band on a matrix of an immunoblotting array. The location can be determined by a predetermined instruction included in the non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>). In another example, the location can be determined by a generic visualization stain being utilized on the matrix and visualized by an optical sensor communicatively coupled to the processing resource. The instructions when executed by a processing resource such as the processing resource <b>682</b> can include instructions to deposit a fluid. As used herein, the term &#x201c;instruction to deposit&#x201d; refers to executable instructions stored by the non-transitory machine readable medium (e.g., a memory resource <b>684</b>) than when executed can cause the droplet dispenser to deposit a fluid.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The instructions <b>688</b>, when executed by a processing resource such as the processing resource <b>682</b>, can include instructions to deposit a fluidic barrier in a particular location on the matrix and traversing the protein band. The fluidic barrier can be a hydrophobic fluid that is deposited on the matrix by a droplet dispenser. In this example, the droplet dispenser is an inkjet print head. The fluidic barrier can prevent antibody fluids from bleeding into one another and causing contamination.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The instructions <b>690</b>, when executed by a processing resource such as the processing resource <b>682</b>, can include instructions to deposit a first antibody fluid onto a first portion of the protein band. The first portion of the protein band can be defined by the fluidic barrier. In this way, multiple antibody fluids can be deposited on an individual protein band.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The instructions <b>692</b>, when executed by a processing resource such as the processing resource <b>682</b>, can include instructions to deposit a second antibody fluid onto a second portion of the protein band, wherein the first portion and the second portion are separated by the fluidic barrier. In some examples the matrix can include a plurality of protein bands. In this example, the controller and/or the computing device coupled to the processing resource <b>682</b> can include instructions executable to determine a different location of a different protein band on the matrix of the immunoblotting array and the processing resource <b>682</b> can cause the droplet dispenser to be aligned with the different location. Because the fluidic barrier traversed the protein bands, antibody fluids can be deposited on the different protein band.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the memory resource may include further instructions to deposit the first antibody fluid onto a first portion of the different protein band; refrain from depositing the second antibody fluid onto a second portion of the different protein band; and deposit a third antibody fluid onto a third portion of the different protein band, wherein the first portion of the different protein band, the second portion of the different protein band, and the third portion of the different protein band are separated by the fluidic barrier.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The above specification, examples and data provide a description of the method and applications and use of the system and method of the present disclosure, Since many examples can be made without departing from the scope of the system and method of the present disclosure, this specification merely sets forth some of the many possible example configurations and implementations.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
