Field</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The instant disclosure relates to various types of medical catheters, in particular catheters for diagnostics within, and/or treatment of, a patient's cardiovascular system. In one embodiment, the instant disclosure relates to an ablation catheter for treating cardiac arrhythmias within a cardiac muscle. Various aspects of the instant disclosure relate to force sensing systems capable of determining a force applied at a distal tip of the ablation catheter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure further relates to low thermal mass ablation catheter tips (also known as high-thermal-sensitivity catheter tips) and to systems for controlling the delivery of radio-frequency energy to such catheter tips during ablation procedures.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">b. Background</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Exploration and treatment of various organs or vessels has been made possible using catheter-based diagnostic and treatment systems. These catheters may be introduced through a vessel leading to the cavity of the organ to be explored, and/or treated. Alternatively, the catheter may be introduced directly through an incision made in the wall of the organ. In this manner, the patient avoids the trauma and extended recuperation times typically associated with open surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The human heart routinely experiences electrical currents traversing its many layers of tissue. Just prior to each heart contraction, the heart depolarizes and repolarizes as electrical currents spread across the heart. In healthy hearts, the heart will experience an orderly progression of depolarization waves. In unhealthy hearts, such as those experiencing atrial arrhythmia, including for example, ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, the progression of the depolarization wave becomes chaotic.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Catheters are used in a variety of diagnostic and/or therapeutic medical procedures to diagnose and correct conditions such as atrial arrhythmia. Typically, in such a procedure, a catheter is manipulated through a patient's vasculature to the patient's heart carrying one or more end effectors which may be used for mapping, ablation, diagnosis, or other treatment. Where an ablation therapy is desired to alleviate symptoms including atrial arrhythmia, an ablation catheter imparts ablative energy to cardiac tissue to create a lesion in the cardiac tissue. The lesioned tissue is less capable of conducting electrical signals, thereby disrupting undesirable electrical pathways and limiting or preventing stray electrical signals that lead to arrhythmias. The ablation catheter may utilize ablative energy including, for example, radio frequency (RF), cryoablation, laser, chemical, and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Ablation therapies often require precise positioning of the ablation catheter, as well as precise pressure exertion for optimal ablative-energy transfer into the targeted myocardial tissue. Excess pressure between the ablation catheter tip and the targeted myocardial tissue may result in excessive ablation which may permanently damage the cardiac muscle and/or surrounding nerves. When the contact pressure between the ablation catheter tip and the targeted myocardial tissue is below a target pressure, the efficacy of the ablation therapy may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ablation therapies are often delivered by making a number of individual ablations in a controlled fashion in order to form a lesion line. To improve conformity of the individual ablations along the lesion line, it is desirable to precisely control the position at which the individual ablations are conducted, the ablation period, the ablation electrode and/or target tissue temperature, and the contact pressure between the ablation catheter tip and the targeted tissue. All of these factors affect the conformity of the resulting lesion line.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing discussion is intended only to illustrate the present field and should not be taken as a disavowal of claim scope.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is desirable to precisely control the delivery of RF energy to an ablation catheter to enable the creation of uniform lesions along a lesion line, and mitigate against overheating of tissue.

It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure including aspects defined in the claims. In addition, the term &#x201c;example&#x201d; as used throughout this application is only by way of illustration, and not limitation.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to medical catheters, in particular, catheters for diagnostics within, and/or treatment of, a patient's cardiovascular system. In many embodiments, the instant disclosure relates to an ablation catheter for treating cardiac arrhythmias within a cardiac muscle, such as atrial fibrillation. To diagnose and treat symptoms related to atrial fibrillation, for example, a distal tip of the catheter may include electrodes (also referred to as sensing electrodes and/or electrophysiology electrodes). The electrodes may also be used to confirm a successful ablation therapy by verifying isolation of stray electrical signals (e.g., those caused by arrhythmic foci) from a left atrium of the cardiac muscle, for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">During a non-invasive intravascular ablation therapy, it is desirable to precisely control delivery of energy (e.g., radio-frequency, thermal, etc.) at a distal tip of the catheter to enable proper lesion formation in the myocardial tissue. During ablation therapy, generator power must remain sufficiently high to form adequate lesions, while mitigating against overheating of tissue (associated with steam pops, charring and/or coagulation on the ablation catheter tip). Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward an ablation catheter tip with high thermal sensitivity materials which facilitate near real-time temperature sensing at the ablation catheter tip.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to an ablation catheter with thermocouples and/or electrodes positioned at a distal end of an ablation tip (and/or a second set of thermocouples and/or electrodes positioned at a proximal end of the ablation tip).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To improve safety and effectiveness of intracardiac ablation therapies, aspects of the present disclosure monitor tip-tissue temperatures and local electrograms. The need to monitor tip-tissue temperature has become more critical as many physicians have moved to therapy protocols utilizing higher power and shorter duration ablations. The ablation electrode is commonly manufactured with sharp corners at a proximal end, and therefore during ablation therapy may be subject to &#x201c;hot zones&#x201d; due to the increased current density. These &#x201c;hot zones,&#x201d; when contacted by myocardial tissue may subject the tissue to undesirably high temperatures which can, in extreme cases, result in steam pops. Aspects of the present disclosure monitor the temperature at or near the proximal end of the ablation electrode during ablation therapy, and in response to temperature signals received by controller circuitry, the controller circuitry may adjust power delivery to the ablation electrode&#x2014;thereby improving therapy efficacy, and safety (e.g., by reducing the possibility of char, coagulum, or a steam pop).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Aspects of the present disclosure are further directed to increasing ablation catheter capability. For example, it has been discovered that ablation catheters may benefit from the ability to measure localized temperature, electrograms, voltage, and impedance with the ablation catheter&#x2014;improving patient safety and facilitating improved patient outcomes. Such capabilities, including electrodes and thermocouples may be implemented on, or in close proximity to, an ablation electrode. Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate capturing local electrophysiology properties and/or local temperature measurements at the ablation catheter tip, while further minimizing complexity and cost of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To minimize complexity and cost of an ablation catheter, various embodiments of a flexible ablation catheter tip utilize one or more flex circuits including thermocouples and microelectrodes which are communicatively coupled to controller circuitry. These one or more flex circuit(s) may be routed through an internal lumen of the catheter shaft and extend proximally along a length of the catheter shaft toward controller circuitry which is communicatively coupled to a catheter handle of the ablation catheter via a connector.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Several embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to the integration of localized temperature and/or voltage/impedance information into an ablation catheter, with the safety profile of the FlexAbility&#x2122; ablation catheter (manufactured by Abbott Laboratories). In such an embodiment, a flexible electronic circuit (with thermocouples and/or electrodes communicatively coupled thereto) may be wrapped around and/or attached to an internal diameter of a conductive shell that operates as the ablation electrode. The electrodes may extend through apertures in the ablation electrode and be electrically insulated therefrom. The thermocouples may be placed into thermal contact with an inner diameter of the ablation electrode. In yet other embodiments, portions of the one or more flexible circuits may extend outside the conductive shell and be coupled to an external diameter of the conductive shell&#x2014;facilitating direct tissue contact between the electrodes and target tissue. The use of the flexible electronic circuit assembly reduces assembly complexity by placing the flexible electronic circuit (or flex circuit) outside of an internal diameter of the tip, where space is more limited. Furthermore, external temperature sensor positioning may improve temperature sensing accuracy (as the thermocouples are not in contact with or otherwise washed out by catheter irrigation flow within the catheter shaft) and benefit from near real-time temperature sensing due to the thermal conductivity between the ablation electrode and flex circuit. The flex circuit may then communicate electrical signals indicative of the sensed temperatures at the one or more thermocouples to controller circuitry.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a flex circuit is integrated into an outer surface of an ablation electrode (also referred to as the conductive tip shell). One or more trenches extending into the outer surface of the ablation electrode facilitate flush coupling (or nearly flush) of electrodes on the flex circuit and the outer surface of the ablation electrode-facilitating a smooth, atraumatic transition between the tip, flex circuit, and the ablation electrode.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to identify identical components in the various views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> generally illustrates an ablation catheter system <b>10</b> having an elongated medical device <b>19</b> that includes a sensor assembly <b>11</b> (e.g., fiber optic based distance measurement sensor) at a distal end <b>24</b>, and configured to be used in the body for medical procedures.
