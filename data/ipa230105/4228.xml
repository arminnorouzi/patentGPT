While the present disclosure is not necessarily limited to such applications, various aspects of the disclosure may be appreciated through a discussion of various examples using this context.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">People spend an immense amount of time in front of displays. From movies at home to games on the computer, a large amount of exposure to new products and other interesting items occurs through digital media. However, there is a need for a user-friendly method of selecting items on a display for a smart lookup without disturbing other users who are also watching the display.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, a system and method for using a smart device to monitor user gestures, and thereby identify on-display items, is proposed. In some embodiments, the system may implement a smart lookup to find identified items using associated internet resources (e.g., product pages for purchase, informational websites, locations, or even directions).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts example gesture system <b>100</b>, which may include one or more computer systems (described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> below).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, an integrated camera, an external camera, and/or a motion sensor in the smart device may register one or more gestures by the user. For example, a camera on smart watch <b>110</b> or an external camera with a user in view may register that hand <b>120</b> is displaying two fingers. In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may compare images taken from a camera on a smart watch to one or more images in a database for one or more gestures. For example, during a user setup, the camera may take reference pictures of the user pointing, holding up two fingers, etc., and store the reference pictures in a database. System <b>100</b> may compare a photo of a gesture to the reference pictures to determine what gesture the user is making.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, while watching a display <b>140</b> (e.g., a TV, a monitor, or some other type of screen) a user may make a gesture with an appendage (e.g., arm, hand <b>120</b>, finger, foot, etc.) to indicate an interest in an item (e.g., item <b>170</b>) depicted on the display <b>140</b>. For example, a user can point a finger with hand <b>120</b> towards vitamins (item) <b>170</b> on display <b>140</b> indicating an interest in vitamins <b>170</b>. Some examples of display <b>140</b> may include a TV, a computer monitor, a projector, and a tablet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, a smart device, such as a smart watch, attached to the appendage may be used to extrapolate a direction of the gesture. For example, some smart devices are equipped with directional and movement sensing equipment, such as a compass, a gyroscope, vibration sensor, bioimpedance sensor, gesture sensors, muscle movement measurement sensors, and/or an angular sensor measurement sensor. In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may use the sensing equipment to determine a location and orientation of the smart device. For example, a compass may be used to determine which direction (North, South, East, or West) a watch is facing, and an angle sensor may be used to determine at what angle the watch is being held. Thus, by determining the location and orientation of the smart device, system <b>100</b> may extrapolate the position or direction of a gesture. For example, if a finger side of a smart watch <b>110</b> is pointed directly northwest at a 30 degree angle, system <b>100</b> may infer that a finger of hand <b>120</b> is pointed directly northwest at a 30 degree angle from horizontal. In some embodiments, a calculation or table may be used to determine the gesture direction <b>130</b> in reference to the smart device position and orientation. For example, the orientation of the smart watch <b>110</b> may not be identical to that of the gesture of hand <b>120</b>, thus the angle of the gesture may be &#x2212;5 degrees from the angle of the smart watch.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the smart device may determine a position/location and orientation of a display. For example, display <b>140</b> may send the display coordinates to the smart watch <b>110</b>, the smart watch may use triangulation of a signal to determine the location, the smart watch may use an integrated camera to determine a location, the display may send an infrared signal to the smart watch, or another method of determining the location and orientation of the display. In a more specific example, display <b>140</b> may give its precise GPS coordinates as an orientation of 20 degrees (where due north is 0 degrees, and due south is 180 degrees).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, a camera on the smart device may detect one or more images on the screen to determine orientation. For example, display <b>140</b> may display <b>2</b> infrared dots which the camera on smart watch <b>110</b> records. System <b>100</b> may use the dots to determine an orientation of smart watch <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the extrapolated direction of the gesture is used in conjunction with the location and the orientation of the display to determine at what point on a display a user is gesturing towards. For example, using the extrapolated direction <b>130</b> with location and orientation of display <b>140</b>, system <b>100</b> is able to identify point <b>190</b> as an extrapolated direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, based on the extrapolated gesture direction towards the TV display content, the proposed system may identify a particular item selected by the user and display the item for the user. For example, system <b>100</b> may use the extrapolated gesture direction <b>130</b> to determine the user is gesturing towards point <b>190</b>. Point <b>190</b> is within area <b>172</b> for vitamins <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, display <b>140</b> may send information about items <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>170</b> to the smartwatch. Such information may include items' <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>170</b> locations on display, the name of the items, the spatial relation of one item to another on the display, or other information. For example, the display may send the location (e.g., 7 inches from the left of the display <b>140</b> and 7 inches from the top of display <b>140</b> of the center of item <b>170</b>) to smart watch <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the determination that the user is pointing to a particular product may be based on the proximity of point <b>190</b> to a particular item. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts example areas <b>152</b>, <b>162</b>, and <b>172</b> for example items <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, and <b>170</b>. In some embodiments, the particular area that indicates a positive selection of an item may be set by system <b>100</b>. For example, the area may be a particular distance away from the center of the item or from the edge of the item. Other methods of determining what area of the display corresponds to a particular item may be utilized depending on the use case.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, once the system <b>100</b> has identified an item, the system <b>100</b> may display the item for the user. For example, smart watch <b>110</b> is displaying vitamins <b>170</b> on the smart watch display. System <b>100</b> may use other display techniques, such as a holographic display <b>115</b>, a projection, or even displaying the item on another device (e.g., a mobile phone).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may adjust the extrapolation of the gesture direction based on user input. For example, system <b>100</b> may prompt the user to determine if system <b>100</b> has selected the correct item. In some embodiments, the input may be a prompted user response. For example, system <b>100</b> may initialize by entering a calibrating mode. Some possible steps of the calibration mode may include asking the user what item the user is pointing at, asking a user to identify an area of the display the user is pointing to, and/or asking a user to point to a certain area of the display. In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may calibrate during operation based on the user actions. For example, if the user is consistently pointing two inches to the right of items, system <b>100</b> may adjust the extrapolation two inches to the left. In another example, if system <b>100</b> selects and displays vitamins <b>170</b> in response to a gesture, and the user immediately moves the gesture to the left and up, towards item <b>150</b>, system <b>100</b> may adjust the extrapolated direction <b>130</b> to the left and up for future user gestures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may actively monitor the user input and display products as they are selected. For example, the user may first select (with a gesture as described above) vitamins <b>170</b>, then select drink (item) <b>160</b>, and then select item <b>150</b>. The displayed item on smart watch <b>110</b> may be actively updated as each item is selected.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may display one or more options for an item. For example, smart watch <b>110</b> may give the user an option to open an informational page on the item, purchase the item, and/or load the item into a queue such as a shopping list. In a first example, after determining that the user has selected vitamins <b>170</b>, smart watch <b>110</b> may give the user the option to open a web site listing the composition of the vitamins. In another example, after determining that the user has selected drink <b>160</b>, system <b>100</b> may give the user the option to purchase drink <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, after prompting the user for an option, the smart device may register a gesture as a response to the option. For example, after displaying an item, smart watch <b>110</b> may register a thumb-up gesture by hand <b>120</b> as a positive response to the prompted option and a thumb down as a negative response to the prompted option. In a specific example, after system <b>100</b> has displayed vitamins <b>170</b> and prompted the user with the option to purchase vitamins <b>170</b>, system <b>100</b> may record a thumbs up sign as a confirmation that the user wants to purchase vitamins <b>170</b> and subsequently purchase vitamins <b>170</b> for the user. The item may be purchased using the user's credentials such as financial information or account information. In some embodiments, financial information is registered or linked to system <b>100</b> by a user profile. In some embodiments, profile information is encrypted. In some embodiments, users may opt-in or opt-out of having their profile or financial information accessed by system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may record specific gestures as conveying further information regarding the option. For example, hand <b>120</b> may hold up two fingers, shake twice, or make a thumbs up motion twice to indicate an intention of buying two items</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the display on the watch may be augmented with audio information to give information on the selected item, to present item options, and/or to confirm an option selection. For example, following the user selection of vitamins <b>170</b>, system <b>100</b> may synthesize a voice saying, &#x201c;do you want to buy exempli gratia vitamins?&#x201d; After selecting yes, system <b>100</b> may synthesize a voice saying &#x201c;confirmed, you have purchased one unit of exempli gratia vitamins.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may receive audio information from a user. The audio information could be an annotation of the user selection, a quantity of items, an affirmation or denial of the selection, and/or a modification to the selection. In an example of an annotation, the user could say &#x201c;more information,&#x201d; to indicate a desire for the product information page. In an example of denial, after prompting the user to purchase an item, the user could say &#x201c;no&#x201d; to indicate that the user does not want to purchase the item. In an example of a modification, where the user has selected brand A of an item, the user could say &#x201c;buy brand B of the item&#x201d; to indicate that he wants to purchase a different brand.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example method <b>200</b> of item selection using gestures for displayed items. Operations of method <b>200</b> may be enacted by one or more computer systems such as the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Method <b>200</b> begins with operation <b>205</b> of monitoring an appendage gesture. In some embodiments, a smart device may monitor an appendage for one or more gestures. For example, a gesture may be initiated based on one or more gesture triggers. For example, a gesture trigger may be a specific set of movement by the appendage and recorded by one or more sensors. As discussed above the one or more sensors may include a camera, a gyroscope, muscle movement measurement sensors, and/or an angular sensor measurement sensor, among others. For example, the system may identify the beginning of a gesture if a smart device senses a hand moving up quickly and stabilizing in a general direction of a display.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>210</b> of extrapolating a gesture direction. In some embodiments, based on the smart device sensors, the system may determine a direction of the gesture. For example, if the finger side of the smart watch is pointing at 30 degrees (where north is zero degrees and south is 180 degrees), at sea level, and angle of 5 degrees above horizontal, the system may determine that a pointing gesture of the hand is pointing at 30 degrees, at sea level, and angle of 5 degrees above horizontal. Other methods of determining location and orientation are possible. The system may have other sensors that are able to aid in the determination of the gesture without departing from the scope of this method. For example, one or more external cameras, connected to the system wirelessly, may aid in the determination of the orientation and location of the gesture.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>215</b> of determining a location and orientation of a display. For example, display <b>140</b> may send the display coordinates to the smart watch <b>110</b>, the smart watch may use triangulation of a signal to determine the display location, the smart watch may use an integrated camera to determine a display location, the display may send an infrared signal to the smart watch, or another method of determining the location and orientation of the display. In a more specific example, display <b>140</b> may give its precise GPS coordinates and an orientation of 20 degrees off of southwest.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>220</b> of determining a gesture point/area on the display, based on the extrapolated gesture direction. In some embodiments, the extrapolated direction of the gesture is used in conjunction with the location and the orientation of the display to determine at what point on a display a user is gesturing towards. For example, by obtaining a precise gesture direction and knowing a precise position and orientation of a display, the system may determine what area on the display the gesture is pointing towards.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the system may also register a user drawing a contour on the display to select one or more objects. For example, the user may move the gesture in a circle, and the system may use the moving extrapolated direction from the moving gesture to determine the contour the user is drawing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>225</b> of selecting an item based on the gesture area. In some embodiments, based on the extrapolated gesture direction towards the display content, the proposed system may identify a particular item selected by the user and the smart device may display the item for the user. For example, the system may use the extrapolated gesture direction to determine the user is gesturing towards a point on the display. In some embodiments, the system may identify one or more items graphically displayed on the display and set boundary areas or designated areas for each item on the display. For example, the system may set a ten centimeter radius circle as a designated area in the center of each item on the display. When the system determines that the user is gesturing anywhere in a designated area for an item, the system may select the item. Alternatively, the system may set a radius around a gesture point, and any item that is within the radius may be selected. In some embodiments, more than one item may be selected. This may be performed when two items are in the radius around the gesture point. In some embodiments, the item that is closest to the gesture point may be selected. For example, if two items are within the radius the closest item to the gesture point may be selected. In some embodiments, the display may generate item information for the items displayed and send the information to the smart device. For example, the display may have metadata attached to a feed for the broadcast being displayed and may use that metadata to generate information for the item to provide to the smart device. The metadata a may contain information such as a placement of an item in a video feed, a name of the item, a retailer for an item, a cost of an item, alternative brands for an item, and etc. In some embodiments, the display sends a location for the items displayed to the smart device. For example, the screen may give a location of each item on the display. In a more detailed example, a display may send item <b>1</b> location [3 inches from left 3 inches from top], item <b>2</b> location [6 inches from left 6 inches from top], and item <b>3</b> location [9 inches from left 3 inches from top]. Other methods of determining where items are displayed on the display are possible.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the system may identify objects present inside a user drawn contour on the display. For example, if a user draws a contour around or partially including two objects with a gesture (similar to the method for determining a point above), the system may select both objects as a selected items.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>230</b> of displaying the item with the smart device. In some embodiments, once one or more items are selected, the smart device may display the one or more items. In some embodiments, the system may use one or more display techniques, such as graphical display on the smart device, a holographic display, a projection, or even displaying on another device (e.g., a mobile phone). In some embodiments, the image for the displayed item may be from an online shopping portal, an item depiction database, an informational Internet site, or a cropped image from the display the user is pointing at. For example, a holographic projection may receive a 3D object of the selected product from an online shopping portal. In some embodiments, the display may send images of the items to the smart device. For example, the display may crop an image of a screen shot and send the cropped image to the smart device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>235</b> of prompting the user regarding an option for the selected item. In some embodiments, options may include the capability to purchase the selected item, display information on the selected item, add the selected item to a shopping cart, query how many items should be added to the cart, display alternative items, and/or add the selected item to a favorites list. For example, the system may search for the selected item in an online shopping portal and display the shopping portal product details. Further, the system may give the user the option to add the selected item to a shopping cart for the user. In some embodiments, the system may retrieve the user information for the shopping portal and then use the retrieved information to enhance the options. For example, if the user has a profile in the shopping portal (e.g., an E-commerce portal) the system may add the selected item to the shopping cart for the user in the shopping portal. In an alternative example, if the user does not have a profile for the shopping portal, the system may prompt the user to create a profile for the shopping portal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>240</b> of receiving an option response from the user. In some embodiments, the system may accept a gesture, inferred by readings/data from one or more sensors on the smart device, to indicate an option response to a prompted option. For example, some acceptable gestures may include a thumbs up for approving a purchase, a thumbs down for not adding the selected item to the shopping cart, a number of fingers to indicate how many items should be purchased, and/or a closed fist to indicate that the user wishes to not see any further information/options regarding the selected item. In some embodiments, the system may accept audible commands from the user or smart device interface commands as an option response. For example, when prompted to purchase a product, the user may say yes, hit a yes button on a graphical interface for the smart device, and/or scroll a wheel to change the number of items selected.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Method <b>200</b> continues with operation <b>245</b> of performing an action based on the option response from the user. For example, after receiving a user option response the system may enact an action based on the user option response. Some possible actions may include purchasing the selected item based on the user selecting a yes button, and/or adding a number of selected items to a shopping cart based on the number of fingers the user has extended.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, operations <b>230</b> through <b>245</b> may be repeated for each item selected.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary embodiment, the system (e.g., system <b>100</b>) includes computer system <b>01</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and computer system <b>01</b> may perform one or more of the functions/processes described above.
