A chemical compound is distinguished from another chemical compound on the one hand by its type, that is, its chemical composition, and on the other hand by its nature, that is, its physicochemical properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a known manner, a non-selective chemical sensor, such as a semiconductor sensor, is configured to determine a measurement signal of the amount of a group of chemical compounds of a chemical medium, such as the concentration of volatile organic compounds, abbreviated as &#x201c;VOC&#x201d;, in the air. Examples of VOCs are pollutants emitted by means of transport, printers, radiators, smoking, candle burning or emissions from ripening fruit and vegetables. For this, a semiconductor sensor, also called a &#x201c;MOX sensor&#x201d; or &#x201c;MOS sensor&#x201d;, comprises a metal oxide layer heated by a heating element on which VOCs are fixed, this phenomenon being known to the skilled person under the term &#x201c;adsorption&#x201d;. Such a semiconductor sensor further comprises electrodes for measuring the electrical conductivity of the metal oxide layer, which is a function of the amount of adsorbed VOCs, which makes it possible to determine the concentration of VOC in the air based on a conversion function specific to the semiconductor sensor. The determination of the concentration of VOC in the air can be used, in particular, to measure the quality of the indoor air in an office, a home, a school or a fruit and vegetable packaging and/or ripening area, or to measure the quality of the outdoor air near a transportation route, such as a road or an airport.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a known manner, a non-selective chemical sensor has to be calibrated before its first use. To do this, using the previous example of the semiconductor sensor, the semiconductor sensor is placed in several standard media with known concentration of VOC. The deviation between the measured concentration of VOC by the semiconductor sensor and the theoretical concentration of VOC of each standard medium is corrected by adjusting the conversion function between the electrical conductivity and the concentration of VOC specific to the semiconductor sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In practice, the response of a semiconductor sensor drifts during its use, especially because of the gradual obstruction of the pores of the metal oxide layer due to the adsorption of VOCs which modifies its electrical conductivity. Such a semiconductor sensor has to be regularly calibrated to ensure that the measured concentration of VOC remains reliable and accurate. This requires uninstalling the semiconductor sensor to place it in standard media and then reinstalling said semiconductor sensor in the office, which is time consuming. In addition, if there is an oversight or delay in performing the calibration or an unforeseen malfunction of the semiconductor sensor, a biased concentration of VOC may be unknowingly measured.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is thus directed to a method and system for calibrating a non-selective chemical sensor that eliminates at least some of these drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a method for calibrating at least one non-selective chemical sensor, called a &#x201c;sensor to be calibrated&#x201d;, by means of at least one reference sensor, said sensor to be calibrated and said reference sensor being in contact with a same chemical medium, said sensor to be calibrated being configured to determine a chemical signal of the amount of a group of chemical compounds in said chemical medium, said reference sensor being configured to determine a reference signal whose temporal variation is correlated to that of said chemical signal, said sensor to be calibrated comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">an element for measuring an electrical signal, which is a function of the amount of said group of chemical compounds in said chemical medium, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">an element for calculating said chemical signal based on a conversion function f specific to said sensor to be calibrated and configured to associate the corresponding chemical signal S<b>1</b> with said measured electrical signal U according to the following relationship: S<b>1</b>=f(U).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The invention is remarkable in that the method comprises:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">a step of measuring, during a reference period, a first chemical signal S<b>1</b><sub>P1 </sub>by means of the sensor to be calibrated and a first reference signal S<b>2</b><sub>P1 </sub>by means of the reference sensor,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">a step of determining a first regression function g<sub>P1 </sub>defined as follows: S<b>2</b><sub>P1</sub>=g<sub>P1</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>),</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0013">at least one step of measuring, during a test period subsequent to the reference period, a second chemical signal S<b>1</b><sub>P2 </sub>by means of the sensor to be calibrated and a second reference signal S<b>2</b><sub>P2 </sub>by means of the reference sensor,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0014">at least one step of determining a second regression function g<sub>P2 </sub>defined as follows: S<b>2</b><sub>P2</sub>=g<sub>P2</sub>(S<sub>P2</sub>),</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0015">at least one step of calculating a deviation between the first regression function and the second regression function and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0016">when the deviation is greater than a reference deviation, at least one step of determining an optimized conversion function so that the second regression function is substantially equal to the first regression function, so as to calibrate the sensor to be calibrated.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0017">By virtue of the invention, a non-selective chemical sensor can be calibrated directly during the acquisition of measurements of interest, that is, in the chemical medium whose amount of a group of chemical compounds is to be determined. It is therefore not necessary to place the sensor to be calibrated in one or more standard media of known chemical composition. The calibration is thus simpler, faster and more convenient to implement, but also more relevant because it is performed directly in the chemical medium of interest.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0018">Such a calibration method is also reliable because it is based on comparisons of measurements of the sensor to be calibrated and of a reference sensor acting as a standard sensor, whose measurements are considered valid and temporally correlated to the measurements of the sensor to be calibrated. Each comparison is also made on the basis of measurements made over the same period of time and in the same chemical medium, which increases reliability. Furthermore, such a calibration method is accurate because the first comparison is performed during a reference period when a measurement of the non-selective chemical sensor is deemed valid, in the manner of a calibration phase. The comparison during a test period is further repeatable when and as often as desired, for example periodically.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0019">According to one aspect, the calibration method is implemented for a single sensor to be calibrated and a single reference sensor. Such a method is configured to calibrate a single sensor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0020">According to another aspect, the calibration method is implemented for a plurality of sensors to be calibrated and at least one reference sensor, each sensor to be calibrated being calibrated by means of a single reference sensor, preferably identical for all sensors to be calibrated. Such a method is suitable for the calibration of a sensor array. The use of a single reference sensor advantageously makes it possible to limit the overall size.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0021">According to one aspect of the invention, the calibration method is implemented for a plurality of test periods subsequent to the reference period, said method comprising for each test period:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0022">a step of measuring, during the test period, a second chemical signal S<b>1</b><sub>P2 </sub>by means of the sensor to be calibrated and a second reference signal S<b>2</b><sub>P2 </sub>by means of the reference sensor,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0023">a step of determining a second regression function g<sub>P2 </sub>defined as follows: S<b>2</b><sub>P2</sub>=g<sub>P2</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P2</sub>),</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0024">a step of calculating a deviation between the first regression function and the second regression function and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0025">when the deviation is greater than a reference deviation, a step of determining an optimized conversion function so that the second regression function is substantially equal to the first regression function, so as to calibrate the sensor to be calibrated.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0026">Advantageously, the first regression function calculated for the reference period does not have to be recalculated, thus saving time. The first regression function thus serves as a control for all subsequent test periods, which makes the method reliable and accurate, as the optimized conversion function is always obtained based on the same first regression function. Furthermore, such a calibration method can thus easily be reproduced many times, preferably periodically to prevent drift of the sensor to be calibrated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0027">According to one aspect of the invention, the sensor to be calibrated is in the form of a VOC sensor, in order to perform measurements of pollutants in the air.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0028">Preferably, the sensor to be calibrated is in the form of a semiconductor sensor or an electrochemical sensor or a photoionization sensor. The choice of the nature of the sensor is advantageously made according to the chemical compounds whose amount is to be measured. To measure an amount of various chemical compounds, a semiconductor sensor represents an economic and accurate solution. To measure an amount of more targeted chemical compounds, an electrochemical sensor represents a reliable and accurate solution. To measure an amount of ionizable chemical compounds, a photoionization sensor is more suitable and accurate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0029">According to one aspect of the invention, the reference sensor is in the form of a carbon dioxide sensor, in order to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in an occupied enclosed space, this amount being advantageously correlated to the occupancy of the space, and thus to the amount of VOCs emitted into said space. Preferably, the reference sensor is in the form of a non-dispersive infrared sensor, known by the abbreviation &#x201c;NDIR&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0030">According to another aspect of the invention, the reference sensor is in the form of a sound intensity sensor, in order to measure, for example, the noise emitted in proximity to a road, this noise advantageously being correlated to the traffic on the road, and thus to the amount of VOCs emitted by said traffic on the road.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0031">Preferably, the reference sensor is in the form of a self-calibrated sensor, whose measurements are advantageously valid at any time and do not drift during its use. A self-calibrated reference sensor thus forms a reliable and accurate standard sensor for both the reference period and the test period(s).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0032">According to one aspect, the reference period is between one day and one month, preferably in the order of one week. Preferably, the test period is between one day and one month, preferably in the order of one week, more preferably equal to the reference period. Advantageously, such a reference period and such a test period are long enough to characterize the full range of variation in the amount of chemical compounds in the chemical medium, and short enough to limit data storage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0033">According to one preferred aspect, the first chemical signal comprises a plurality of measurement points spaced apart by a measurement pitch between 1 min and 4 h, preferably in the order of 1 h. Preferably, the first reference signal comprises a same number of measurement points as the first chemical signal and spaced by the same measurement pitch. Also preferably, the second chemical signal comprises a plurality of measurement points spaced apart by a measurement pitch between 1 min and 4 h, preferably in the order of 1 h. Preferably, the second reference signal comprises a same number of measurement points as the second chemical signal and spaced by the same measurement pitch. Advantageously, the obtained regression functions comprise sufficient points to be representative and accurate, while limiting data storage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0034">Preferably, the first regression function is polynomial, preferably affine, more preferably linear. Also preferably, the second regression function is polynomial, preferably affine, more preferably linear. Such regression functions are advantageously simple to determine and operate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0035">According to one aspect of the invention, the deviation holds the following relationship: &#x3b5;=Max(IS<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>&#x2212;S<b>1</b><sub>P2</sub>I)/S<b>1</b><sub>P1 </sub>such that S<b>2</b><sub>P1</sub>=S<b>2</b><sub>P2</sub>. Such a deviation is advantageously simple to determine and representative of the possible drift of the sensor to be calibrated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">Preferably, the reference deviation is between 0.01 and 0.1, preferably in the order of 0.05, which makes it possible to avoid any significant drift while avoiding having to carry out an irrelevant micro-correction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">According to one aspect of the invention, the second chemical signal S<b>2</b><sub>P2 </sub>being determined based on a second electrical signal U<sub>P2</sub>, the optimized conversion function f* holds the following relationship: g<sub>P2</sub>(f*(U<sub>P2</sub>))=G<sub>P1</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>). Such an optimized conversion function makes it possible to calibrate the sensor in such a way that for a given amount of chemical compounds, the sensor to be calibrated provides the same chemical signal as during the reference period.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">The invention also relates to a calibration system for implementing the calibration method as previously described, said system comprising at least one non-selective chemical sensor, called a &#x201c;sensor to be calibrated&#x201d;, and at least one reference sensor configured to be in contact with a same chemical medium, and a calculation module connected to the sensor to be calibrated and to the reference sensor, said sensor to be calibrated being configured to determine a chemical signal of the amount of a group of chemical compounds in said chemical medium, in particular a first chemical signal S<b>1</b><sub>P1 </sub>during a reference period and a second chemical signal S<b>1</b><sub>P2 </sub>during a test period, said reference sensor being configured to determine a reference signal whose temporal variation is correlated to that of said chemical signal, in particular a first reference signal S<b>2</b><sub>P1 </sub>during said reference period and a second reference signal S<b>2</b><sub>P2 </sub>during said test period, said sensor to be calibrated comprising:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0039">an element for measuring an electrical signal, which is a function of the amount of said group of chemical compounds in said chemical medium, and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0040">an element for calculating said chemical signal based on a conversion function f specific to said sensor to be calibrated and configured to associate the corresponding chemical signal S<b>1</b> with said measured electrical signal U according to the following relationship: S<b>1</b>=f(U),</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0041">said calculation module being configured to:        <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0042">determine a first regression function g<sub>P1 </sub>and a second regression function gp<b>2</b> defined as follows: S<b>2</b><sub>P1</sub>=g<sub>P1</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>) and S<b>2</b><sub>P2</sub>=g<sub>P2</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P2</sub>)</li>            <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0043">calculate a deviation between the first regression function and the second regression function and</li>            <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0044">when the deviation is greater than a reference deviation, determine an optimized conversion function so that the second regression function is substantially equal to the first regression function, so as to calibrate the sensor to be calibrated.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0045">Advantageously, such a calibration system is space-saving and can be easily and conveniently installed directly in the physical medium being measured by the sensor to be calibrated.

A chemical compound is distinguished from another chemical compound on the one hand by its type, that is, its chemical composition, and on the other hand by its nature, that is, its physicochemical properties.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0061">Still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a non-selective chemical sensor <b>1</b> comprises:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0062">an element for measuring <b>10</b> an electrical signal U, which is a function of the amount of the group of chemical compounds <b>40</b> in the chemical medium, and</li>        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0063">an element for calculating <b>11</b> the chemical signal S<b>1</b> based on a conversion function f configured to associate the corresponding chemical signal S<b>1</b> with the measured electrical signal U according to the following relationship: S<b>1</b>=f(U).

Such a semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> comprises a measurement element <b>10</b> comprising a metal oxide layer, a heating element and measurement electrodes. The metal oxide layer is heated by the heating element so that VOCs <b>40</b> are fixed thereto, a phenomenon known to the skilled person under the term &#x201c;adsorption&#x201d;. The measurement element <b>10</b>, and more precisely the measurement electrodes, is configured to measure an electrical conductivity U of the metal oxide layer, which is a function of the amount of adsorbed VOCs and forms the electrical signal. A chemical signal in the form of a concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> is then determined based on the measured electrical conductivity U via the conversion function f.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0065">In a known manner, the response of a semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> drifts during its use, especially because of the gradual obstruction of the pores of the metal oxide layer due to the adsorption of VOCs <b>40</b> which modifies the measured electrical conductivity U. In other words, the electrical conductivity U measured at several months intervals under identical conditions is different, although the actual concentration of VOC is identical. The determined concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> is then biased because the conversion function f no longer reflects the relationship between the electrical conductivity U and the actual concentration of VOC <b>40</b> in the air of the office <b>4</b>. It is therefore necessary to calibrate the semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> so that the measured concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> remains reliable and accurate. The calibration consists in correcting the conversion function f so that it compensates for the drift of the sensor <b>1</b>, that is, so that it reflects the new relationship linking the electrical conductivity U and the actual concentration of VOC <b>40</b> in the air of the office <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0066">The invention relates to a method for calibrating a semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> such as that previously described, or more generally any non-selective chemical sensor having a conversion function f to be calibrated, such as an electrochemical sensor or a photoionization sensor, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>&#x201d; for clarity.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, to implement the calibration method, the invention provides to use a calibration system comprising the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and a reference sensor <b>2</b> different from the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> that is brought into contact with the same physical medium as the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>, namely the indoor air of an office <b>4</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. The calibration system further comprises a calculation module <b>3</b> connected to the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and to the reference sensor <b>2</b> and configured to compare their measurements in order to detect any drift of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and to calculate an optimized conversion function f*. Preferably, the calculation module <b>3</b> is in the form of a microprocessor. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the calculation module <b>3</b> comprises a database <b>30</b> and a calculator <b>31</b> with three calculation units <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>. Of course the calculation module <b>3</b> comprises any number of databases <b>30</b> integrated or not with the calculator <b>31</b> and any number of calculators <b>31</b> comprising any number of calculation units <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0068">In order for the comparison to be relevant, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is chosen to be sensitive to a physicochemical quantity of the physical medium that is correlated to that of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>. In other words, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is configured to measure a reference signal S<b>2</b> whose temporal variation is correlated to that of the chemical signal S<b>1</b> measured by the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is preferably chosen to be selective and/or self-calibrated, so that its measurements are accurate and not subject to drift over time.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0069">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is thus in the form of a carbon dioxide sensor <b>41</b>, abbreviated as &#x201c;CO2&#x201d;, configured to determine the concentration S<b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> in the air of the office <b>4</b>. Such a concentration S<b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> is correlated to the concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> measured by the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> in that they are both related to the occupancy rate O of the office <b>4</b>. Indeed, CO2 <b>41</b> present in the office <b>4</b> is essentially emitted by the occupants of the office <b>4</b> and its temporal variation thus depends on the occupancy rate O of the office <b>4</b>. VOCs <b>40</b> present in the office <b>4</b> are essentially emitted by the electronic devices such as computers, printers or radiators, used by the occupants, so that their temporal variation also depends on the occupancy rate O of the office <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is preferably in the form of a self-calibrated, non-dispersive infrared sensor selective to CO2 <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0070">Of course another reference sensor <b>2</b> could be chosen, the important thing being that it is configured to measure a reference signal S<b>2</b> correlated to the chemical signal S<b>1</b> of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>, accurate and not subject to drift. Thus, in this example, the reference sensor <b>2</b> could be sensitive to another physical quantity than CO2 <b>41</b>, such as oxygen which is essentially consumed by the occupants of the office <b>4</b> and whose amount is therefore correlated to that of VOC <b>40</b>. However, CO2 has the advantage of varying more in proportion relative to oxygen, which allows for more accurate calibration. Furthermore, in this example, the reference sensor <b>2</b> could be of a different nature, such as an electrochemical or non-dispersive infrared sensor, which has to be selective and self-calibrated. Thus, it should be noted that the choice of reference sensor <b>2</b> depends on the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>, and especially on the group of chemical compounds <b>40</b> to which it is sensitive. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> is sensitive to VOCs <b>40</b>, but of course the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> could be sensitive to another group of chemical compounds <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0071">Furthermore, preferably, the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and the reference sensor <b>2</b> are installed in close proximity to each other, preferably adjacent to each other, so as to be in contact with a same physical medium <b>4</b> under identical physicochemical conditions. Preferably also, the calibration system forms a unitary module, which is easy to install, but of course the calculation module <b>3</b> could be remote to limit the overall size, since it does not require contact with the physical medium <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0072">A calibration method implemented by the previously described calibration system is described below.

In addition, such a calibration method can be performed autonomously by the calibration system and in particular the calculation module in the form of a computer program, and therefore does not require human intervention as in prior art. The implementation of the calibration method in the physical medium also has the advantage of being more relevant, because the optimized conversion function f* is then specifically calculated for the medium of interest and the chemical compounds of interest. The accuracy of the calibration method is further guaranteed by the choice of the reference sensor <b>2</b>, namely sensitive to a physical quantity whose temporal variation is correlated to that of the sensor to be calibrated. Preferably, the reference sensor <b>2</b> is also chosen to be selective and self-calibrated in order to provide accurate measurements that are not subject to drift.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0080">Preferably, the calibration method is implemented for several test periods P<b>2</b>. More precisely, for each of the test periods P<b>2</b>, a measurement step E<b>3</b>, a determination step E<b>4</b>, a calculation step E<b>5</b> and a determination step E<b>6</b> are implemented. Advantageously, the calibration method is repeatable as often as desired. A regular or even periodic calibration, for example every three months, can thus be set up to periodically check the potential drift of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and correct it. Advantageously, such a calibration method guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the measurements of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> as it is used. It should also be noted that regardless of the number of test periods P<b>2</b>, the measurement step E<b>1</b> and the determination step E<b>2</b> are only implemented once, thus also saving time and increasing the relevance of the calibration. Indeed, the first regression function g<sub>P1 </sub>serves as a control and as a basis for comparison for the second regression function(s) determined subsequently.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0081">Each of the steps of the calibration method is described in more detail below, considering only one test period P<b>2</b>. The steps are further described as part of the previously described calibration system, namely formed by a semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> (that is the sensor to be calibrated), an infrared sensor <b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> (that is the reference sensor) and the calculation module <b>3</b>, such as a microprocessor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0082">The calibration method starts with a step of simultaneously measuring E<b>1</b> the concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> and the concentration S<b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> of the indoor air of the office <b>4</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> is measured by the sensor to be calibrated during a reference period P<b>1</b> and noted &#x201c;first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b>&#x201d;. The concentration S<b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> of the indoor air of the office <b>4</b> is measured by the reference sensor <b>2</b> during the same reference period P<b>1</b> and noted &#x201c;first concentration S<b>2</b>P<b>1</b> of CO2 <b>41</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0083">The reference period P<b>1</b> is preferably chosen such that the response of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> is deemed valid, that is, the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> is deemed calibrated and does not drift. In other words, the first concentration S<b>1</b><sub>P1 </sub>of VOC <b>40</b> is substantially identical to the actual concentration of VOC <b>40</b> of the indoor air in the office <b>4</b>. In practice, the reference period P<b>1</b> is chosen within days of the installation and/or configuration of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> in the office <b>4</b>. Alternatively, the reference period P<b>1</b> is chosen within days of its calibration, for example in one or more standard media as implemented in prior art.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0084">Furthermore, still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the reference period P<b>1</b> is also chosen to be long enough to measure the entire range of variability of the concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> in the indoor air of the office <b>4</b>, and especially its maximum value and minimum value. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the concentration S<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> is a function of the occupancy rate O of the office <b>4</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and varying between 0 occupant (minimum occupancy rate Omin) and <b>5</b> occupants (maximum occupancy rate Omax). Conventionally, the occupants gradually arrive in the morning, leave for lunch and come back in the afternoon before gradually going home. The occupancy rate is therefore minimal Omin at noon, in the morning before the arrival of the first occupant and in the evening after the departure of the last occupant. The occupancy rate is on the contrary maximal Omax during the morning and the afternoon. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the reference period P<b>1</b> is thus chosen equal to one day, which is sufficient to measure the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> when the occupancy rate is minimal Omin and maximal Omax. In general, the reference period P<b>1</b> is preferably between one day and one month, preferably in the order of one week.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0085">Still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> corresponds to a plurality of measurement points (represented by triangles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) spaced by a measurement pitch &#x394;t. In this example, the measurement pitch &#x394;t is equal to 1 h, small enough to observe the temporal variation of the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> and large enough to limit the size of the measured data. In general, the measurement pitch &#x394;t is preferably between 1 min and 4 h, depending on the physical medium and the physical or chemical quantity measured. The first concentration S<b>2</b>P<b>1</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> preferably comprises the same number of measurement points (represented by crosses in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) measured at the same measurement time as for the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b>. In this example, the measurement points correspond to instantaneous values, but of course the measurement points could also correspond to values averaged over a time period, for example equal to the measurement pitch &#x394;t.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0086">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at the end of the measurement step E<b>1</b>, the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b> and the first concentration S<b>2</b>P<b>1</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> are transmitted to the calculation module <b>3</b>, and more precisely in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to a first calculation unit <b>32</b> of the calculation module <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0087">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the calibration method continues with a step of determining E<b>2</b> a first regression function g<sub>P1 </sub>defined as follows: S<b>2</b><sub>P1</sub>=g<sub>P1</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>).

Indeed, among the four measured concentrations S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>, S<b>1</b><sub>P2</sub>, S<b>2</b><sub>P1</sub>, S<b>2</b><sub>P2</sub>, only the second concentration S<b>1</b><sub>P2 </sub>of VOC <b>40</b> is not deemed valid, so that the observed deviation &#x3b5; is only due to the drift of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> between the reference period P<b>1</b> and the test period P<b>2</b>. It is noted here the necessity of the presence of a reference sensor <b>2</b> which serves to know accurately and reliably the composition of the indoor air of the office <b>4</b> which is a priori different for the reference period P<b>1</b> and the test period P<b>2</b>. A comparison between the first concentration S<b>1</b><sub>P1 </sub>and the second concentration S<b>2</b><sub>P1 </sub>of VOC <b>40</b> would indeed not be relevant because the measurements would not be carried out in a physical medium of identical chemical composition. Indeed, as an example, one of the occupants could be absent during the test period P<b>2</b>, reducing the maximum occupancy rate Omax and thus the amount of VOC <b>40</b> in the indoor air of the office <b>4</b>. Thus, it is also noted the necessity to have a reference sensor <b>2</b> deemed valid at any time, because a drift of the reference sensor <b>2</b> would make the deviation c unrepresentative of the drift of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0096">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the calibration method ends with a determination step E<b>6</b> during which, if the deviation c is greater than a minimum deviation &#x3b5;<sub>ref</sub>, a third calculation unit <b>34</b> of the calculation module <b>3</b> determines an optimized conversion function f* for the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>, so as to correct the drift. The minimum deviation &#x3b5;<sub>ref </sub>corresponds to the threshold above which the drift is considered not negligible. Preferably, the minimum deviation &#x3b5;<sub>ref </sub>comes from the database <b>30</b> and is between 0.01 and 0.1, preferably in the order of 0.05, which makes it possible to avoid any significant drift while avoiding having to carry out an irrelevant micro-correction. In practice, the value of the minimum deviation &#x3b5;<sub>ref </sub>is adjusted by feedback.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0097">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the determination step E<b>6</b> is implemented by calculating the optimized conversion function f* as follows: g<sub>P2</sub>(f*(U<sub>P2</sub>))=g<sub>P1</sub>(S<b>1</b><sub>P1</sub>), noting UP<b>2</b> the electrical conductivity of the metal oxide layer of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> measured during the test period P<b>2</b> and which is related to the second concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>2</b> of VOC <b>40</b> by the relationship: S<b>1</b><sub>P2</sub>=f(U<sub>P2</sub>). In other words, the optimized conversion function f* is calculated by seeking equality g<sub>P2</sub>=g<sub>P1</sub>, that is, the two regression functions g<sub>P1</sub>, g<sub>P2 </sub>correspond to a polynomial function with the same coefficients.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0098">To summarize, the calibration method according to the invention makes it possible to determine an optimized conversion function f* for the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> base on the deviation &#x3b5; between a first regression function g<sub>P1 </sub>for a reference period P<b>1</b> in which the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> is deemed valid and a second regression function g<sub>P2 </sub>for a test period P<b>2</b> in which the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> has potentially drifted. The two regression functions g<sub>P1</sub>, g<sub>P2 </sub>are calculated by relating the physical quantities measured by the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and a reference sensor <b>2</b>, deemed valid at any time, in a same physical medium <b>4</b>. The reference sensor <b>2</b> thus makes it possible to know the composition of the physical medium <b>4</b> at any time and thus to evaluate the drift of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0099">Furthermore, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the calibration method is carried out in the indoor air of an office <b>4</b> by means of a calibration system comprising a semiconductor sensor <b>1</b> of VOC <b>40</b>, an infrared sensor <b>2</b> of CO2 <b>41</b> and a microprocessor <b>3</b>, but of course the calibration method can be carried out in any physical medium and by means of a sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> being in the form of any non-selective chemical sensor, the reference sensor <b>2</b> being chosen as a function of the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and of the physical medium <b>4</b> and the calculation module <b>3</b> comprising at least a database <b>30</b> and a computer <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0100">Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrating another embodiment of the invention, the calibration method is implemented in proximity to a road <b>5</b> where vehicles V are travelling. The sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> is as previously in the form of a semiconductor VOC sensor <b>40</b>. The reference sensor <b>2</b> is in the form of a sound intensity sensor <b>42</b> of the road <b>5</b>. Such a sound intensity sensor <b>42</b> is advantageously self-calibrated and performs accurate measurements, which makes it a suitable reference sensor. Moreover, the sound intensity <b>42</b> is a function of the traffic of vehicles V on the road <b>5</b> as well as the concentration of VOC <b>40</b> emitted in proximity to the road <b>5</b>, so that the physical quantities measured by the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and the reference sensor <b>2</b> are correlated. Conventionally, with reference to FIG. . <b>10</b>, the traffic of vehicles V has a peak in the morning corresponding to the trip to work and a more extended peak in the afternoon and evening corresponding to the trip home from work. The traffic of vehicles V is thus maximal Vmax in the morning and minimal Vmin very early in the morning. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the reference period P<b>1</b> is thus chosen equal to one day as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, because such a reference period P<b>1</b> is sufficient to measure the first concentration S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> when the traffic of vehicles V is minimal Vmin and maximal Vmax.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0101">A calibration system comprising a single sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> and a single reference sensor <b>2</b> has been previously described, but of course the calibration system could comprise several sensors to be calibrated <b>1</b> each configured to be calibrated by a reference sensor <b>2</b>. Preferably, such a calibration system comprises a single reference sensor <b>2</b> allowing the calibration of each sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> in order to limit the overall size. Thus, by way of example, using the embodiment of the invention in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b> in the form of a semiconductor VOC sensor <b>40</b> could be replaced by an array of sensors to be calibrated <b>1</b> comprising a semiconductor sensor and an electrochemical VOC sensor <b>40</b> as well as a carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide sensor. Such a sensor array has the advantage of measuring the air quality in proximity to the road more accurately than a semiconductor VOC sensor <b>40</b> alone. The reference sensor <b>2</b> remains unchanged and is in the form of a sound intensity sensor <b>42</b>, with the sound intensity <b>42</b> emitted by the traffic being related to the amount of VOCs produced, but also to those of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0102">For such a calibration system, the calibration method is implemented by measuring a first chemical signal S<b>1</b>P<b>1</b> and a second chemical signal S<b>1</b>P<b>2</b> from each sensor to be calibrated <b>1</b>.
