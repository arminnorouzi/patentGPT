An inkjet printing layer is provided on the paint layer, and characters, symbols, figures, patterns, and so on (hereinafter, abbreviated as a design as appropriate) are displayed by the inkjet printing layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to this configuration, by using an inkjet printer, it is possible to efficiently, rapidly, and easily represent a desired design on the surface of the exterior case and enhance the aesthetic properties. Compared with the conventional spray painting method, it is possible to improve the operating environment and greatly improve the productivity. The effect of reducing the manufacturing cost of the hot-water unit can also be obtained.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the above-mentioned prior art, the inkjet printing layer is provided only as a single layer. Therefore, although a two-dimensional design can be represented by the inkjet printing layer, it is difficult to represent more (for example, three-dimensional representation). From the viewpoint of increasing the commercial value of the exterior case, it is desired to have functionality other than the flat design representation. In addition, the single-layer inkjet printing layer is susceptible to damage, and there is a risk of chalking occurring due to aging. Chalking is a phenomenon in which the pigment in the coating film is powdered and appears on the surface of the printing layer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2019-60508</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2019-60509</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to provide an exterior case for a hot-water unit capable of having unprecedented functionality aesthetic properties, and a hot-water unit equipped with the exterior case.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the above problems, the following technical means are taken in the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The exterior case for a hot-water unit provided by a first aspect of the invention is an exterior case for a hot-water unit, used to house hot-water equipment for generating or storing hot water inside.

has a configuration in which hot-water equipment <b>1</b> for generating hot water is housed in an exterior case C. The hot-water equipment <b>1</b> includes a heat exchanger <b>10</b> through which hot water flows, a burner <b>11</b> for heating the hot water in the heat exchanger <b>10</b>, a fan <b>12</b> for supplying combustion air to the burner <b>11</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The exterior case C includes a rectangular box-shaped case body <b>2</b> having an opening portion <b>20</b> on the front surface, and a cover body <b>3</b> (front cover body) that closes the opening portion <b>20</b>. The cover body <b>3</b> is detachably attached to the front surface portion of the case body <b>2</b> by using, for example, screw bodies <b>9</b> such as screws and screw insertion holes <b>31</b> and <b>21</b> through which the screw bodies <b>9</b> are inserted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present embodiment, the cover body <b>3</b> is provided with a first to a third thick printing portions <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C, which are not provided on the case body <b>2</b>. Therefore, hereinafter, the configuration of the cover body <b>3</b> will be described in detail, and the description of the case body <b>2</b> will be omitted. However, as will be described later, it goes without saying that the case body <b>2</b> may be provided with the thick printing portion or the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cover body <b>3</b> is formed by press-working a color steel sheet <b>30</b> to be described later, and has a panel shape having a substantially rectangular front view. The cover body <b>3</b> has an outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b> and a bulging portion <b>33</b> that is surrounded by the outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b> and that bulges forward (front side of the exterior case C) from the outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b>. The outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b> is a portion for abutting on a flange portion <b>22</b> on the front surface portion of the case body <b>2</b>. The bulging portion <b>33</b> is provided with a plurality of air supply ports <b>34</b> that allow outside air to flow into the exterior case C, and an exhaust port <b>35</b> for discharging the exhaust gas that has been heat-recovered by the heat exchanger <b>10</b> to the outside of the exterior case C.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the color steel sheet <b>30</b> has a multi-layer structure including a plated steel sheet <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a white-based (including white) front-side paint layer <b>30</b><i>b </i>laminated on the surface of the plated steel sheet <b>30</b><i>a </i>as an outer surface, and a back-side paint layer <b>30</b><i>c </i>on the back side as a service coat laminated on the back surface of the plated steel sheet <b>30</b><i>a </i>as an outer surface.

The first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A is a portion where a plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> are laminated in an overlaid state. These plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> are, for example, all clear layers and do not contain pigments. However, each of the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b>, for example, contains an ultraviolet curable resin and a thermosetting resin (the same applies to a second and a third thick printing portions <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C, and thick printing portions <b>4</b>D to be described later).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exhaust port <b>35</b> is formed as a burring hole in which a cylindrical burring portion <b>35</b>a is continuously provided on the back surface side of the peripheral portion thereof. The first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A is not provided at a position facing the exhaust port <b>35</b> so as to avoid a corner portion of the burring portion <b>35</b>a. This is preferable in order to prevent damage to the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A when the exhaust port <b>35</b> is formed after the formation of the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A, as will be described later. However, the invention is not limited thereto, and may have, for example, a configuration in which the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A is extended to the formation portion of the burring portion <b>35</b>a, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As is well shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second thick printing portion <b>4</b>B is provided around the plurality of air supply ports <b>34</b>. Similar to the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A, the second thick printing portion <b>4</b>B is a portion where the plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> are laminated in an overlaid state. The plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> are all clear layers. Similar to the exhaust port <b>35</b>, each air supply port <b>34</b> is also formed as a burring hole, and the second thick printing portion <b>4</b>B is provided so as to avoid a burring portion <b>34</b>a.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C represents characters such as the manufacturer, model, or trademark of the hot-water unit U (in the drawing, &#x201c;ABCABC&#x201d; as an example). The third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C is composed of a plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> that overlap each other, as is well shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> (in the same figure, only &#x201c;ABC&#x201d; is represented).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, a plurality of (for example, two) inkjet printing layers, <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b>b, forming a part thereof are opaque printing layers containing pigments. The inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> other than these (including the outermost layer of the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b>) are clear layers. The opaque inkjet printing layers <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>represent, for example, the characters &#x201c;ABC&#x201d;, but the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> as clear layers are interposed in between, and the opaque inkjet printing layers <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>are separated from each other in the print thickness direction. According to this configuration, when the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C is viewed from an angle, the characters &#x201c;ABC&#x201d; can be further seen behind the characters &#x201c;ABC&#x201d;, which gives the characters a three-dimensional effect.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C may also be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>D</figref>. In the configuration shown in the figures, one of two opaque inkjet printing layers <b>40</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b>d represents a part of the character &#x201c;ABC&#x201d;, and the other represents the remaining part of the character &#x201c;ABC&#x201d;. According to this configuration, since the characters are completed by combining the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b>d, it is possible to give the characters a three-dimensional effect and adds fun.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C has been described as a specific example of displaying characters, but the invention is not limited thereto. The number and shape of the opaque inkjet printing layers similar to the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b><i>a </i>to <b>40</b><i>d </i>described above may be variously changed to represent characters other than the above-mentioned characters and other desired designs so as to give a three-dimensional effect.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cover body <b>3</b> described above may be manufactured through the following steps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the flat plate-shaped color steel sheet <b>30</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is prepared as a raw material for the cover body <b>3</b>. Next, on the color steel sheet <b>30</b> (strictly speaking, on the paint layer <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the color steel sheet <b>30</b>), inkjet printing is repeatedly performed a plurality of times. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the first to the third thick printing portions <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C are provided.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Inkjet printing is performed using, for example, an inkjet printer <b>8</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In the inkjet printer <b>8</b>, a print head <b>80</b> is movable in the x and y directions orthogonal to each other on the upper side of a mounting table <b>81</b> on which the color steel sheet <b>30</b> is mounted and supported. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the print head <b>80</b> includes a plurality of inkjet nozzles <b>82</b> for making inkjet paint of a predetermined color into droplets and sprayed the same onto the color steel sheet <b>30</b>, and a pair of ultraviolet light sources <b>83</b> (<b>83</b>a, <b>83</b>b).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, when performing inkjet printing while moving the print head <b>80</b> in an x<b>1</b> direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> as the main scanning direction, the ultraviolet light source <b>83</b>a on the rear side in the main scanning direction is made to emit light, and the area immediately after inkjet printing is irradiated with ultraviolet light. Since the inkjet printing layer <b>40</b> contains an ultraviolet curable resin, the inkjet printing layer <b>40</b> can be rapidly cured (cured to the extent that bleeding does not occur) by irradiation with the ultraviolet light described above. When such a curing process is completed, the inkjet printing is performed again, and the inkjet printing and the curing process are repeated to form (overlay) a plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> in a laminated manner. When the inkjet printing is carried out in a direction opposite to the x<b>1</b> direction described above, the same effect as described above can be obtained by making the ultraviolet light source <b>83</b>b to emit light instead of the ultraviolet light source <b>83</b>a.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">After finishing the above-mentioned inkjet printing on the color steel sheet <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the color steel sheet <b>30</b> is heated to dry the first to the third thick printing portions <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C, and the thermosetting resin contained therin is cured. As a result, it is possible to increase the strength of the first to the third thick printing portions <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C, and make them have durability against the press-working performed thereafter.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the thermosetting treatment described above, drawing as a press-working is performed on the color steel sheet <b>30</b> to form the outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b> and the bulging portion <b>33</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>. Along with this, press-working for forming the air supply port <b>34</b>, the exhaust port <b>35</b> and the like; and trimming processing for removing the excess portion of the outer peripheral flange portion <b>32</b> and the like are performed. Thereby, the cover body <b>3</b> described above can be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The operation of forming the exhaust port <b>35</b> is performed by using a punch <b>7</b><i>a </i>and a die <b>7</b>b, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In this case, the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A is provided so as to avoid the place where the exhaust port <b>35</b> is planned to be formed, and is provided with a non-printing portion having a width Lb larger than a width La of the punch <b>7</b><i>a</i>. According to such means, the possibility that the first thick printing portion <b>4</b>A is damaged due to the contact with the punch <b>7</b><i>a </i>can be eliminated. This is the same for the second thick printing portion <b>4</b>B.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the operations of the exterior case C provided with the cover body <b>3</b> and the hot-water unit U will be described.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, the surrounding of the exhaust port <b>35</b> may be heated by the exhaust gas and become hot. Therefore, of the paint layer <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the color steel sheet <b>30</b> constituting the cover body <b>3</b>, the surroudingl portion of the exhaust port <b>35</b> is inherently liable to deteriorate. Further, since surrouding of the air supply port <b>34</b> is also subject to drippings and the like, the surrouding portion portion of the air supply port <b>34</b> of the paint layer <b>30</b><i>b </i>is inherently liable to deteriorate. On the other hand, since the first and the second thick printing portions <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B are respectively provided around the exhaust port <b>35</b> and the air supply port <b>34</b>, the paint layer <b>30</b><i>b </i>is protected, and the above-mentioned risk is appropriately eliminated. The first and the second thick printing portions <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B are large in thickness and durable, and are less likely to be damaged as compared with the paint layer <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the durability of the outer surface coating of the cover body <b>3</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The plurality of inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> constituting the first and the second thick printing portions <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B are all clear layers containing no pigments. Therefore, the occurrence of chalking is also appropriately prevented.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>D</figref>, since the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C can represent three-dimensional characters, it is useful for enhancing the aesthetic properties or decoration of the hot-water unit U. Since the outermost layer of the inkjet printing layers <b>40</b> of the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C is a clear layer, the occurrence of chalking in the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C can also be appropriately prevented. In other words, since the clear layer does not contain pigments and does not cause chalking, if the clear layer is provided on the outermost layer of the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C, the occurrence of chalking in the third thick printing portion <b>4</b>C due to aging can be appropriately prevented.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As can be understood from the above-described embodiment, since the thick printing portion in the invention has a configuration in which a plurality of inkjet printing layers are laminated in an overlaid state, the thickness can be increased and representations that are difficult to represent (for example, a three-dimensional representation) can be enabled with only a single inkjet printing layer. Moreover, compared to a single inkjet printing layer, the thick printing portion can be made stronger and less susceptible to damage due to its larger thickness, and can be made less likely to deteriorate over time. Further, since the thick printing portion can be formed by repeatedly performing the inkjet printing a plurality of times, the forming operation is easy and it is possible to prevent the manufacturing cost of the exterior case from being significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>12</b>B</figref> show other embodiments of the invention.
