A neurodegenerative disease is generally associated with &#x3b2;-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). This may result in neuronal or glial cell defects including but not limited to neuronal loss, neuronal degeneration, neuronal demyelination, gliosis (i.e., astrogliosis), or neuronal or extraneuronal accumulation of aberrant proteins or toxins (e.g., amyloid beta peptide, i.e., A&#x3b2;). Some examples of neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), mild cognitive impairment, and early or late stages of these diseases.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Alzheimer's disease (AD), in particular, is a neurodegenerative disorder generally characterized by the progressive decline of mental functioning. More specifically, AD is characterized clinically by the progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment, and emotional stability that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and, ultimately, death. Although there are many hypotheses for the possible mechanisms of AD, one central theory is that the excessive formation and accumulation of toxic beta-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) peptides either directly or indirectly affects a variety of cellular events and leads to neuronal damage and cell death. Selkoe, <i>Neuron. </i>1991; 6(4):487-98 1991; Selkoe, <i>J. Clin Invest. </i>2002; 110(10): 1375-81. Dementia associated with AD is referred to as senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) in usage with Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">AD is a progressive disorder with a mean duration of around 8-15 years between onset of clinical symptoms and death. AD is believed to represent the seventh most common medical cause of death and affects about 5 million people in the United States. There are three general stages of Alzheimer's disease: mild (early) stage, moderate (middle) stage and severe (late) stage. Each stage is associated with a worsening of neurological abilities. In the early (mild) stage, the subject may function independently, but experiences mild changes in cognitive functioning, such as memory lapses of recent events. The moderate stage, which is typically the longest stage and can last for many years, can be characterized by increased cognitive decline, significantly impacting memory and thinking, and interfering with routine functioning. The severe (late) stage of AD is characterized by further decline of mental functioning, such as losing the ability to communicate, to respond to surroundings, and to control movement and physical abilities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the largest gene families of protein kinase. Several PKC isozymes are expressed in the brain, including PKC&#x3b1;, PKC&#x3b2;1, PKC&#x3b2;II, PKC&#x3b4;, PKC&#x3b5;, and PKC&#x3b3;. PKC is primarily a cytosolic protein, but with stimulation it translocates to the membrane. PKC activators have been associated with prevention and treatment of various diseases and conditions. For example, PKC has been shown to be involved in numerous biochemical processes relevant to AD, and PKC activators have demonstrated neuroprotective activity in animal models of AD. PKC activation has a crucial role in learning and memory enhancement, and PKC activators have been shown to increase memory and learning. Sun and Alkon, <i>Eur J Pharmacol. </i>2005; 512:43-51; Alkon et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>2005; 102:16432-16437. PKC activation also has been shown to induce synaptogenesis in rat hippocampus, suggesting the potential of PKC-mediated antiapoptosis and synaptogenesis during conditions of neurodegeneration. Sun and Alkon, <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>2008; 105(36): 13620-13625. In fact, synaptic loss appears to be a pathological finding in the brain that is closely correlated with the degree of dementia in AD patients. PKC activation has further been shown to protect against traumatic brain injury-induced learning and memory deficits, (see Zohar et al., <i>Neurobiology of Disease, </i>2011, 41: 329-337), has demonstrated neuroprotective activity in animal models of stroke, (see Sun et al., <i>Eur. J. Pharmacol., </i>2005, 512: 43-51), and has shown neuroprotective activity in animal models of depression, (see Sun et al., <i>Eur. J Pharmacol., </i>2005, 512: 43-51).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Neurotrophins, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), are key growth factors that initiate repair and regrowth of damaged neurons and synapses. Activation of some PKC isoforms, particularly PKC&#x3b5; and PKC&#x3b1;, protect against neurological injury, most likely by upregulating the production of neurotrophins such as BDNF. Weinreb et al., <i>FASEB Journal. </i>2004; 18:1471-1473). The activation of PKC&#x3b5; also increases brain postsynaptic density anchoring protein (PSD-95) which is an important marker for synaptogenesis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, changes in dendritic spine density form the basis of learning- and memory-induced changes in synaptic structure that increase synaptic strength. Abnormalities in the number and morphology of dendritic spines have been observed in many cognitive disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, and fragile X syndrome. For example, the brains of schizophrenic patients and people suffering from cognitive-mood disorders show a reduced number of dendritic spines in the brain areas associated with these diseases. In mental retardation and autism, the shapes of the dendritic spines are longer and appear more immature.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the limited existing options for treating neurodegenerative disease, new methodologies for treating, preventing, or slowing the onset of neurodegenerative disease are needed. There is a particular need for methodologies that not only treat the neurophysiological deterioration and mental decline resulting from these diseases, but that mitigate or halt the progression by interfering with the mechanism associated with the initiation and/or progression of these diseases and which can also repair damaged synapses.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a method for treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease in a subject by administering an angiotensin in a therapeutically effective amount to the subject to result in treatment (e.g., mitigation) or prevention of symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease. More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to a method of inducing synaptogenesis in a subject by administering an angiotensin in a therapeutically effective amount to the subject. The neurodegenerative disease may be any of the diseases enumerated earlier above, such as, for example, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. The angiotensin may be any of the known an angiotensins, e.g., any of angiotensin I, II, III, or IV.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present method operates by activating HGF in a subject and potentiating HGF activity at its receptor, c-Met (i.e., by administration of the angiotensin, which binds to HGF and induces c-Met phosphorylation). It is also known that PKC-&#x3b1; and PKC-&#x3b5; isozymes control HGF signaling efficacy and vice-versa. Thus, HGF can be considered as immediately downstream from PKC-&#x3b1; and PKC-&#x3b5;, and these two isozymes are also activated by HGF, which thus functions as a PKC activator (e.g., S. Kermogant, P. J. Parker, <i>Cell Cycle, </i>4(3), 352-355; 2005; Z. Xie et al., <i>eNeuro, </i>3(4), 2016; S. Kermorgant et al., <i>EMBO Journal, </i>23(19), 3721-3734, November 2004; and G. D. Sharma et al., <i>Exp Eye Res., </i>85(2), 289-297, August 2007, all of the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The interrelationship between PKC, Met, and HGF is conveniently captured in the schematic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as adopted from S. Kermorgant et al., <i>Cell Cycle </i>4:3, 352-355, March 2005. Significantly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows that the HGF-Met pathway is a PKC epsilon activation process. As particularly noted in the aforesaid publication, it was previously reported that c-Met signaling to the MAPkinase(s), ERK 1/2 (extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2), occurs in the internalised endosomal compartments and requires continued signal output to sustain elevated levels of activated ERK1/2&#x2014;inactivation of the upstream kinase MEK rapidly leads to the loss of active phosphorylated ERK1/2 even 1.8 hours after the initial stimulation by HGF. From this internalised compartment, the activated ERK1/2 is translocated to the plasma membrane and becomes associated with focal complexes, as evidenced by colocalization with paxillin, vinculin and actin at sites of membrane ruffling (S. Kermorgant et al., <i>EMBO Journal, </i>23(19), 3721-3734; S. Ishibe et al., <i>Mol Cell </i>2003, 12:1275-85).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As further noted in S. Kermorgant et al., <i>Cell Cycle </i>4:3, 352-355, March 2005, a key regulator of this sorting of signals at the endosome and the consequent ERK1/2 translocation to the plasma membrane is PKC&#x3b5;; in the absence of PKC&#x3b5;, HGF no longer causes ERK1/2 to accumulate at focal complexes. PKC&#x3b5; is required for c-Met dependent cell migration as is ERK1/2 activation. For example, sustained ERK1/2 activation is required for the disassembly of adherens junctions, one of the early steps in cell dissociation (S. Potempa et al., <i>Mol. Biol. Cell, </i>9:2185-2200,1998). These studies indicate that it is the combination of ERK1/2 activation and its PKC&#x3b5; dependent translocation to focal complexes. [foregoing statements reprinted from S. Kermorgant et al., <i>Cell Cycle </i>4:3, 352-355, March 2005].</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as adopted from S. Kermorgant et al., <i>EMBO Journal, </i>23(19), 3721-3734, November 2004, further illustrates the elements in the HGF-induced c-Met pathway under the control of PKC. As stated in the foregoing publication: &#x201c;It is shown that c-Met signalling to the ERK cascade occurs within endosomal compartments and that it is in this compartment that PKC&#x3b5; specifically exerts its control on the pathway with the consequent accumulation of ERK in focal complexes. These events are clearly separated from the subsequent microtubule-dependent sorting of c-Met to its perinuclear destination, which is shown to be under the control of PKC&#x3b1;. Thus while it is shown that traffic to endosomes is essential for HGF/c-Met to trigger an ERK response, the subsequent traffic and signalling of c-Met controlled by these two PKC isotypes are unconnected events. The dynamic properties conferred by the PKC&#x3b5; control are shown to be essential for a normal HGF-dependent migratory response. Thus PKCs are shown to control both receptor traffic and signal traffic to relay HGF/c-Met responses.&#x201d; [reprinted from S. Kermorgant et al., <i>EMBO Journal, </i>23(19), 3721-3734, November 2004]</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The ELAV (HUD) pathway is also known, by which PKC activation activates HGF and other growth factors (e.g., J. Hongpaisan and D. L. Alkon, <i>PNAS, </i>104(49), Dec. 4, 2007). Hongpaisan and Alkon, 2007 (Ibid) also demonstrate that PKC activation by bryostatin enhances associative learning and increases the number of fully mature mushroom spine synapses. As the HGF-Met pathway is ultimately a PKC-&#x3b5; activation process, the presently described method provides an alternative methodology for treating neurodegenerative disease by directly interfering with the mechanism associated with initiation and/or progression of neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer's Disease.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as reprinted from S.

BDNF is a peptide that is implicated to induce mitogenesis and improve cognitive function. Although evidence for BDNF polymorphisms in AD is still inconclusive, synaptic loss is the single most important correlate of AD. Lower BDNF levels are associated in AD cases with apathy, a noncognitive symptom common to many forms of dementia (Alvarez et al., Apathy and APOE4 are associated with reduced BDNF levels in Alzheimer's disease, <i>J. Alzheimers Dis., </i>42:1347-1355, 2014). While BDNF expression is regulated by at least nine promoters (Aid et al., Mouse and rat BDNF gene structure and expression revisited, <i>J. Neurosci. Res.; </i>85:525-535, 2007; Pruunsild et al., Dissecting the human BDNF locus: bidirectional transcription, complex splicing, and multiple promoters, <i>Genomics, </i>90:397-406, 2007), promoter IV (PIV) is most responsive to neuronal activity (Tao et al., Ca2 influx regulates BDNF transcription by a CREB family transcription factor-dependent mechanism, <i>Neuron, </i>20:709-726, 1998). PKC&#x3b5;, which is decreased in AD (Hongpaisan et al., PKC epsilon activation prevents synaptic loss, Abeta elevation, and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice, <i>J. Neurosci., </i>31:630-643, 2011; Khan et al., PKC-epsilon deficits in Alzheimer's disease brains and skin fibroblasts, <i>J. Alzheimers Dis., </i>43:491-509, 2015), also regulates BDNF expression (Lim and Alkon, 2012; Corbett et al., 2013; Hongpaisan et al., PKC activation during training restores mushroom spine synapses and memory in the aged rat, <i>Neurobiol. Dis., </i>55:44-62, 2013; Neumann et al., Increased BDNF protein expression after ischemic or PKC epsilon preconditioning promotes electrophysiologic changes that lead to neuroprotection, <i>J.

While Bryostatin-1 has two pyran rings and one 6-membered cyclic acetal, in most bryologs one of the pyrans of Bryostatin-1 is replaced with a second 6-membered acetal ring. This modification may reduce the stability of bryologs, relative to Bryostatin-1, for example, in either strong acid or base, but has little significance at physiological pH. Bryologs also tend to have a lower molecular weight (ranging from about 600 g/mol to 755 g/mol), as compared to Bryostatin-1 (988), a property which may facilitate transport across the blood-brain barrier.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Bryologs</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>PKC Affin</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Name</entry><entry>(nM)</entry><entry>MW</entry><entry>Description</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Bryostatin-1</entry><entry>1.35</entry><entry>988</entry><entry>2 pyran + 1 cyclic acetal + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 1</entry><entry>0.25</entry><entry>737</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetal + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 2</entry><entry>6.50</entry><entry>723</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetal + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 7 a</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>642</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetals + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 7 b</entry><entry>297</entry><entry>711</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetals + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 7 c</entry><entry>3.4</entry><entry>726</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetals + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 7 d</entry><entry>10000</entry><entry>745</entry><entry>1 pyran + 2 cyclic acetals + macrocycle,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>acetylated</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 8</entry><entry>8.3</entry><entry>754</entry><entry>2 cyclic acetals + macrocycle</entry></row><row><entry>Analog 9</entry><entry>10000</entry><entry>599</entry><entry>2 cyclic acetals</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0054" num="0048">Analog 1 exhibits the highest affinity for PKC.

The fatty acid substitution on the diacylglycerol derivatives may determine the strength of activation. Diacylglycerols having an unsaturated fatty acid may be most active.

Activation of the PKC signaling pathway by these or other growth factors offers an additional potential means of activating PKC.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0061">The PKC activator or HGF activator may also include hormones and growth factor activators, including 4-methyl catechol derivatives, such as 4-methylcatechol acetic acid (MCBA), which stimulate the synthesis and/or activation of growth factors, such as NGF and BDNF, which also activate PKC as well as convergent pathways responsible for synaptogenesis and/or neuritic branching.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0062">The PKC activator or HGF activator (being combined with an angiotensin) may also include polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#x201c;PUFAs&#x201d;). PUFAs are essential components of the nervous system and have numerous health benefits. In general, PUFAs increase membrane fluidity, rapidly oxidize to highly bioactive products, produce a variety of inflammatory and hormonal effects, and are rapidly degraded and metabolized. The inflammatory effects and rapid metabolism is likely the result of their active carbon-carbon double bonds.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0063">In one embodiment, the PUFA is selected from linoleic acid (shown below).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-C00012" he="7.70mm" wi="68.16mm" file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0077" num="0064">The PKC activator or HGF activator may also be a PUFA or MUFA derivative.

See <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>2009, 284(50): 34514-34521; see also U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0022645 A1. Like their parent molecules, PUFA derivatives are thought to activate PKC by binding to the PS site.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0065">Cyclopropanated fatty acids exhibit low toxicity and are readily imported into the brain where they exhibit a long half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>). Conversion of the double bonds into cyclopropane rings prevents oxidation and metabolism to inflammatory byproducts and creates a more rigid U-shaped 3D structure that may result in greater HGF or PKC activation. Moreover, this U-shape may result in greater isoform specificity. For example, cyclopropanated fatty acids may exhibit potent and selective activation of HGF or PKC-&#x3b5;.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0066">The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation reaction is an efficient way of converting double bonds to cyclopropane groups. This reaction, acting through a carbenoid intermediate, preserves the cis-stereochemistry of the parent molecule.

The following metrics may be used to evaluate dosing regimens: induction of brain postsynaptic anchoring protein PSD-95, upregulation of BDNF levels in brain, upregulation of HGF levels in brain, minimal downregulation of PKC-&#x3b5; levels, and elevation of brain and plasma concentrations of the angiotensin. Groups of 2-3 mice may be formed and housed in an approved research animal facility. Water may be given ad libitum. A first study involves three groups of mice with animals in each group dosed weekly for 1, 2, 3, or 6 consecutive weeks. Each group has its own control group containing the same number of mice. For example, mice in the first, second and third groups may receive an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 10 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>, 15 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>, and 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>dose of an angiotensin. For each dose, mice in that group may receive a single injection of the angiotensin weekly for a predetermined number of consecutive weeks. Following dosing, mice are sacrificed, and the blood and brain of each animal is collected for further analysis.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0111">A dose of 10 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>, (i.v. administration) of angiotensin for 3 or 6 consecutive weeks may not result in elevated levels of brain BDNF. While some increase in the levels of brain BDNF may be observed at a dose of 15 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for three consecutive weeks, the maximum increase in brain BDNF levels may be observed at a dose of 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>. At a dose of 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>, the levels of brain BDNF may increase with each successive week of dosing, that is, brain BDNF levels may be greatest after three consecutive weeks of dosing.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0112">A similar observation can be made concerning the levels of the synaptogenesis marker PSD-95. Brain and blood samples of study subjects may show higher amounts of PSD-95 after three weeks at a dose of 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>angiotensin, administered as i.v. as a once per week injection. In addition, 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>administered in three consecutive weekly doses may not produce more PKC-&#x3b5; downregulation in brain compared to three consecutive weeks of lower doses. Continued weekly dosing at 10 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for another three consecutive weeks (total of 6 consecutive weeks) may result in downregulation.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0113">Although 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>administered in three consecutive weekly doses may not produce more PKC-&#x3b5; downregulation in brain than three consecutive weeks of lower doses, with continued dosing at this higher level, additional downregulation may occur for the &#x201c;1 on/1 off&#x201d; and &#x201c;2 on/1 off&#x201d; regimens. Since PKC-&#x3b5; is a biological target of angiotensin, lower levels of this protein may result in decline in cognitive benefits in AD patients. In some embodiments, mice are dosed weekly with an angiotensin at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for three consecutive weeks, followed by cessation of drug administration for three consecutive weeks, and then a second round of dosing at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for an additional three consecutive weeks (that is, a &#x201c;3 on/3 off/3 on&#x201d; dosing regimen). In other embodiments, mice are dosed at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>at a &#x201c;1 on/1 off&#x201d; regimen for a total of nine weeks (e.g., one dose of angiotensin on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, with no dosing in weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8). In other embodiments, mice are dosed at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for another regimen starting with &#x201c;2 on/1 off&#x201d; immediately followed by alternating &#x201c;1 on/1 off&#x201d; until reaching the ninth total week (i.e., one dose of angiotensin on weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, with no dosing in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9). Increasing the duration of the rest intervals (i.e., &#x201c;off&#x201d; intervals) to three weeks may significantly reduce PKC downregulation. That is, the &#x201c;3 on/3 off&#x201d; dosing regimen may increase brain PKC-&#x3b5; levels in mice over the other regimens, thus resulting in optimal cognitive benefits.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0114">Brain BDNF in mice may reach its highest level after three consecutive weekly doses of angiotensin at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>and remain elevated after three additional consecutive weeks of no dosing, followed by three more consecutive weekly doses at 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2</sup>. Since BDNF is a peptide that induces synaptogenesis (i.e., the formation of new synapses), a &#x201c;3 on/3 off&#x201d; regimen may maximize synaptogenesis and minimize PKC downregulation.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0115">Further evaluation may be performed on angiotensin crossing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the steady state levels of angiotensin in the brain and plasma of mice. In some embodiments angiotensin administered intravenously crosses the BBB. In that case, the concentration of angiotensin in mice brain may be less than its concentration in plasma. However, the concentration in brain may be no less than two-fold tower than the plasma concentrations for comparable doses under steady-state conditions.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0116">A weekly dosing regimen of a single injection of angiotensin at a dose of 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>for three consecutive weeks may be less effective at increasing angiotensin concentration in mice brain than a &#x201c;1 on/1 off&#x201d; or a &#x201c;2 on/1 off&#x201d; administration of the 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>dose. In contrast, plasma concentrations of angiotensin may be greater when the drug is administered as a single injection for three consecutive weeks. Blood plasma concentrations of angiotensin may be less in mice receiving a 25 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>2 </sup>dose as a &#x201c;1 on/1 off&#x201d; or a &#x201c;2 on/1 off&#x201d; administration. Without being bound to a specific theory, it may be hypothesized that the intermittent dosing regimen facilitates the transport of angiotensin across the BBB.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0117">While there have been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art may make various changes and modifications which remain within the scope of the invention defined by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00016" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00016.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00016.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00017" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00017.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00017.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00018" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00018.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00018.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00019" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00019.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00019.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00020" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00020.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00020.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00021" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00021.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00021.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00022" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00022.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00022.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00023" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00023.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00023.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00024" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00024.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00024.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00025" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00025.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00025.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00026" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00026.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00026.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00027" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00027.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00027.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00028" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00028.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00028.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00029" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00029.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00029.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00030" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00030.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00030.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00031" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00031.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00031.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00032" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00032.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00032.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00033" cdx-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00033.CDX" mol-file="US20230000943A1-20230105-C00033.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
