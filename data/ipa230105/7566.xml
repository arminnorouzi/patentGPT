Because of this functionality and other reasons, radio frequency bands allocated to wireless or broadband communication have become increasingly congested. Yet even as the regulatory bodies expand the radio frequency bands accessible to consumer devices, the radio frequency bands that are allocated by these regulatory bodies often include licensed systems or devices that operate on these frequency bands based on a licensing arrangement. When unlicensed devices (e.g., consumer devices that do not receive regulatory licenses) combine with licensed devices on the same radio frequency bands, there is the potential for interference. Since this interference may be at the detriment to the licensed user, there is a need for an approach that minimizes or reduces the potential of this interference to occur. This is especially true when many consumer devices are mobile (e.g., mobile phones) and may move from one area that did not interfere with a licensed system to another area that does interfere with a licensed system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One aspect of the disclosure provides a computer-implemented method for generating a geofence for an automated frequency coordination (AFC) device using an AFC system.

Many households today have numerous devices capable of wireless connectivity and often these devices are mobile in nature. To wirelessly communicate, user devices or consumer devices use a designated portion of the radio frequency spectrum. The radio frequency spectrum refers to a continuous range of radio wave frequencies that have been divided into bands by one or more communication regulating bodies. A radio band refers to some contiguous section of radio spectrum frequencies in which channels are usually designated for a particular purpose. For instance, device operating services such as broadcasting, mobile radio, or navigation are allocated non-overlapping ranges of frequencies (i.e., frequency bands) to prevent interference and to promote the efficient use of the radio spectrum.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the use of consumer devices continuously expanding over the last few decades, the frequency bands allocated to such devices has also been expanding. Generally speaking, user equipment (e.g., wireless access points), thought of colloquially as user devices or consumer devices, are unlicensed devices capable of wireless communication using radio waves. Here, &#x201c;unlicensed&#x201d; refers to the fact that this category of equipment (i.e., user equipment) does not require a license from a radio frequency regulatory body such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or a frequency assignment from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Initially, unlicensed devices, which were typically low-power devices, such as mobile phones, Bluetooth, wireless networking (e.g., Wi-Fi), keyless entry, garage door openers, etc., were allocated to operate at an ultra-high frequency (UHF) on a microwave frequency band (also known as the S band). More particularly, Wi-Fi networks following standards like IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n used the 2.4 GHz section of the S band. Depending on the country, this 2.4 GHz band includes around 11 channels. At the turn of the 21<sup>st </sup>century, and ushered further by the IEEE 802.11n standard, wireless communication for user equipment expanded to the use of the 5 GHz band (or ultra-high frequency (UHF) band). Even with the 5 GHz band offering an additional 500 MHz of spectrum to Wi-Fi's capability, the popularity of technology having wireless connectivity has led to both the 2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz band to have a significant amount of congestion today.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Recently, the FCC approved the use of the 6 GHz frequency band for wireless communication (e.g., Wi-Fi or similar broadband technology) with unlicensed devices on the condition that unlicensed devices do not interfere with devices (also referred to as licensed devices) that have received licenses to use the 6 GHz frequency band. The 6 GHz frequency band is a spectrum of radio frequencies ranging from 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz (or 1200 MHz of spectrum). This spectrum addition to wireless capability is an expansion that adds upwards of one hundred channels for unlicensed devices to utilize.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The caveat to the 6 GHz spectrum expansion is that unlicensed devices do not interfere with incumbent licensed devices or systems. This may be particularly important when these licensed uses in the 6 GHz band correspond to uses such as communication links for utility and public safety networks, Fixed Satellite Services (FSS), and backhaul connections to provide data to and from cell sites for carrier providers (i.e., mobile services). In order to ensure that interference does not occur between licensed devices and unlicensed devices, the FCC established a framework that allows unlicensed devices to operate in the 6 GHz band without causing interference by relying on two different methods. The first method is for indoor use and dictates that low-power unlicensed devices will be used indoors only. The rationale for this method is that a building's structure will attenuate signals from the low power unlicensed devices during indoor use such that the amount of radio energy imparted on outdoor licensed uses is too small to cause harmful interference. For example, a low power unlicensed device is a device that uses a maximum EIRP power spectral density of 5 dBm/MHz. The second method is for standard or high-power unlicensed devices (e.g., devices exceeding the maximum EIRP power spectral density of 5 dBm/MHz) being used indoors or outdoors and employs spectrum use coordination. In this method, the unlicensed device communicates operating parameters (e.g., a location, height, target power, radio frequency of operations, etc.) to a spectrum use coordination system called an Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) system. Here, the AFC is configured as a system (e.g., a cloud-based system) with information regarding licensed systems/devices. That is, the AFC knows relevant operating parameters of licensed systems (e.g., location, height, antenna characteristics, frequency of operations, etc.). With the target operating parameters from the unlicensed device and the relevant operating parameters of licensed systems, the AFC system is able to determine whether the unlicensed device can operate with its target parameters without causing harmful interference to any of the licensed incumbent systems in a particular area. The AFC system then instructs the unlicensed device which frequency channels are available for the operation of the unlicensed device at the submitted operating parameters that will not interfere with licensed systems.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Industry standards have begun to develop based on the FCC's framework rules for preventing interference between unlicensed and licensed devices. One such standard created by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) outlines protocols for a communication interface between an unlicensed device and the AFC system. Since the unlicensed device is communicating with the AFC system, the unlicensed device may also be referred to as an AFC device. In the standard set forth by the WFA, the AFC device reports its location to the AFC system along with the AFC device's target operating parameters. Based on these inputs, the AFC system basically responds with a binary decision that the AFC device may or may not operate at the target operating parameters at that particular AFC device location. In some examples, the response is a binary response for each potential channel (e.g., requested by the AFC device). In other words, the AFC device may send a request to the AFC system where the AFC device asks the AFC system whether it can operate at a particular set of operating parameters (e.g., a maximum power and a location) on any of four channels. Here, based on the set of operating parameters, the AFC system responds that the AFC device can operate on one of the four channels using the requested set of operating parameters.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with the WFA standard, when the AFC device requests to operate on the 6 GHz band, the AFC device reports its location (e.g., horizontal location and height) with 95% confidence to the AFC system in predominantly one of two manners. In the first manner, the AFC device reports its location to represent that the AFC device is static or installed/fixed at a single point. For instance, the AFC device is a wireless access point in a fixed location. In this static case, the AFC provides its location to the AFC device as an ellipse where the center of the ellipse is the fixed horizontal location (e.g., a longitude and latitude) of the AFC device and the radius of the ellipse represents the 95% confidence level for the location of that point (e.g., taking into account estimated statistical errors of a Global Positioning System measurement). Here, as part of the location, the AFC device also provides its height (e.g., as a height above ground level) and an uncertainty for that height value. In the second manner, the AFC device reports its location to represent that the AFC device is dynamic in nature (i.e., can be located at multiple points within a particular area or volume of space). In this dynamic situation, the AFC device reports its location to the AFC system as a polygon where the boundary set by the perimeter of the polygon dictates an area where the AFC device wishes to dynamically operate with 95% confidence. In other words, the polygon represents a target operating area with additional clearance such that the polygon represents the target operating area with 95% confidence (e.g., with additional clearance to account for possible statistical errors in the AFC device's location). Here, this polygon may also be referred to as a geofence since it sets a virtual boundary for the AFC device. Similar to the static situation, the AFC device also reports its height (e.g., a height above ground level) and an uncertainty measurement for that height value. In these examples, with the combination of the horizontal area, represented as either an ellipse or a polygon, and the height, the AFC device is providing a volumetric location to the AFC system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unfortunately, although the WFA standard provides for the AFC system to approve a dynamic operating area (e.g., represented by a geofence) requested by the AFC device, the AFC system's decision is rather inflexible with this standard. That is, it is quite possible for the AFC device to generate a geofence that, unbeknownst to the AFC device, interferes with a small portion of a licensed system. Here, a majority of the geofence may not interfere with licensed systems, but nonetheless since a small portion of the geofence area does interfere with a licensed system, the AFC system will deny the request for that particular geofence based on the interference. This is problematic because it burdens the AFC device with the task of creating a geofence when the AFC device does not inherently have any information regarding locations where licensed systems may interfere with a created geofence. In other words, the AFC device may prefer to simply shrink the size of a requested geofence polygon to prevent the small amount of potential interference instead of being completely denied operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">To address some of these issues, the approach herein shifts the generation of the geofence to the AFC system. In other words, instead of the AFC device requesting that a particular geofence be approved, the AFC system is configured to generate the geofence itself for the AFC device based on requested operating parameters. This approach therefore leverages the built-in knowledge that the AFC system has with regard to the operation of licensed system(s) to generate a geofence for the AFC device. By enabling the AFC system to have the ability to create a geofence for the AFC device, the AFC system enables AFC devices to be used as mobile or dynamic access points in a more robust manner. That is, the AFC system can best leverage its knowledge of licensed systems to ensure that the AFC device can operate dynamically. Moreover, this approach can reduce the frequency of communication between the AFC device and the AFC system (e.g., the AFC device has to make less requests to get approval for a geofence) and may allow an AFC device that does not have a pre-established geographic range of operation to receive a robust geographic range for operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, an AFC device <b>110</b> associated with a user <b>10</b> generates a request <b>120</b> requesting to use a licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b>. Here, the request <b>120</b> includes one or more operating parameters <b>124</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b>. The operating parameters <b>124</b> provided in the request <b>120</b> allow an AFC system <b>200</b> to identify potential interference between the AFC device <b>110</b> and one or more licensed systems <b>102</b>. Some examples of operating parameters <b>124</b> that may be provided to the AFC system <b>200</b> by the AFC device <b>110</b> include a target minimum power, the channel(s) on which the AFC device <b>110</b> can operate, a starting location (e.g., a horizontal location such as longitude and latitude), and a target operating height (or a range of target operating heights). As used herein, the target operating height refers to an operating height/altitude the AFC device <b>110</b> is above ground level. The AFC device <b>110</b> communicates the request <b>120</b> to the AFC system <b>200</b> via a network <b>130</b>. In response to the request <b>120</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> generates a response <b>150</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b>. The response <b>150</b> dictates whether the AFC device <b>110</b> can operate or not at the requested licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b> using the requested operating parameters <b>124</b> (or some variation thereof).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The AFC device <b>110</b> refers to any device that is both capable of wireless communication using a radio frequency band and capable of communication with the AFC system <b>200</b>. In this respect, the AFC device <b>110</b> may be an unlicensed device or a licensed device. In the case of a licensed device, the AFC device <b>110</b> may be a mobile licensed device that, even though it has been approved to operate on a particular licensed radio frequency band, nonetheless ensures that its mobility does not interfere with the operations of other licensed systems on the particular licensed radio frequency band. Therefore, although some examples discussed herein are from the perspective of an unlicensed AFC device, the functionality of the AFC system <b>200</b> is also applicable to operating compliance between licensed systems <b>102</b> (e.g., compliance between a licensed AFC device <b>110</b> and other licensed systems <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the AFC device <b>110</b> is a wireless access point (or simply access point (AP)) that corresponds to a networking component which allows other Wi-Fi enabled devices to connect to a network broadcasted by the AP. In some implementations, the AFC device <b>110</b> is a user device that is capable of acting as a hotspot. For example, the AFC device <b>110</b> is a mobile phone (e.g., a smartphone), tablet, laptop, or other smart device configured to provide hotspot functionality. The AFC device <b>110</b> may be configured with hotspot or AP functionality using particular hardware, firmware, software, or some combination thereof. The AFC device <b>110</b> includes data processing hardware <b>112</b> and memory hardware <b>114</b>. The memory hardware <b>114</b> includes instructions that, when executed by the data processing hardware <b>112</b>, perform operations related to automated frequency coordination and/or geofence implementation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the request <b>120</b> from the AFC device <b>110</b> dictates that the AFC device <b>110</b> is requesting to operate on the licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b> corresponding to the 6 GHz frequency band. Although this is the licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b> depicted throughout the examples, the techniques described herein can be deployed for other licensed frequency bands <b>122</b>. In other words, if the FCC (or another regulating body) approves another licensed frequency band <b>122</b> for unlicensed device use (e.g., 8 GHz or 9 GHz), the geofence request process by the AFC device <b>110</b> and the geofence generation process by the AFC system <b>200</b> may be used to determine geofences for other licensed frequency bands <b>122</b>. Since the AFC system <b>200</b> designates an area (i.e., a geofence <b>152</b>) where the AFC device <b>110</b> can operate without interfering with licensed systems <b>102</b> on a particular licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, this process is universally compatible with any licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. Therefore, although the licensed frequency band <b>122</b> of 6 GHz is pertinent today based on recent regulatory approval, the processed described for the AFC device <b>110</b> and/or AFC system <b>200</b> may also translate to coordinating AFC device operation on other licensed frequency bands <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an example of a traditional AFC system where the request <b>120</b> includes a proposed geofence <b>126</b> configured by the AFC device <b>110</b>. The proposed geofence <b>126</b> defines a target operating boundary that the AFC device <b>110</b> wishes to operate within. In other words, the AFC device <b>110</b> constructs a proposed geofence <b>126</b> based on where the AFC device <b>110</b> wants to dynamically operate and encloses this operating area with a polygon referred to as a geofence. In a traditional AFC system, the AFC system does not generate the geofence on its own accord, but rather either (i) approves the proposed geofence <b>126</b> because the proposed geofence <b>126</b> does not interfere with any licensed system <b>102</b> or (ii) denies approval for the proposed geofence <b>126</b> because the proposed geofence <b>126</b> interferes with one or more licensed systems <b>102</b>. In this sense, the response <b>150</b> from a traditional AFC system is binary in nature&#x2014;approval or not approval.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates two licensed systems <b>102</b>, <b>102</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;b where a first licensed system <b>102</b><i>a </i>corresponds to a first base station for a first mobile carrier and a second licensed system <b>102</b><i>b </i>that corresponds to a second base station for a second mobile carrier. In this example, the proposed geofence <b>126</b> from the AFC device <b>110</b> overlaps with a small amount of the operating area A<sub>O </sub>for each licensed system <b>102</b>. In other words, with respect to the first licensed system <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the proposed geofence <b>126</b> overlaps with a first operating area A<sub>O</sub>, A<sub>O1 </sub>of the first licensed system <b>102</b><i>a </i>in a first interference area A<sub>I</sub>, A<sub>I1</sub>. Similarly, the proposed geofence <b>126</b> overlaps with a second operating area A<sub>O</sub>, A<sub>O2 </sub>of the second licensed system <b>102</b><i>b </i>in a second interference area A<sub>I</sub>, A<sub>I2</sub>. Even though these interference areas A<sub>I </sub>may seem minor, the fact that any inference area exists violates the FCC framework for an AFC device. Namely, that an unlicensed device or other licensed device is not to interfere with a licensed system <b>102</b> for a particular licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. Therefore, when the traditional AFC system receives the proposed geofence <b>126</b> and determines that the proposed geofence <b>126</b> interferes with licensed systems <b>102</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;b, the traditional AFC system will generate a response <b>150</b> that informs that AFC device <b>110</b> that it cannot operate in the proposed geofence <b>126</b> using the proposed operating parameters <b>124</b> for the particular licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. As can be shown by this example, the expectation that the AFC device <b>110</b> determines its own geofence without information about the incumbent licensed system(s) <b>102</b> can make geofencing with a traditional AFC system difficult. For instance, the AFC device <b>110</b> may wind up iterating its proposed geofence <b>126</b> several times until no interference areas A<sub>I </sub>exist.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In contrast to the traditional AFC system, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an AFC system <b>200</b> that does not receive a proposed geofence <b>126</b> from the AFC device <b>110</b>, but rather the AFC system <b>200</b> generates a geofence <b>152</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b> based on the target operating parameters <b>124</b> at the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. Although this AFC system <b>200</b> is still likely to have scenarios where no geofence exists for the AFC device <b>110</b> based on the operating parameter(s) <b>124</b> of the request <b>120</b> for the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, this approach likely reduces the number of times an AFC device <b>110</b> may receive a response <b>150</b> that does not approve at least some operating boundary for the AFC device <b>110</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates that the AFC system <b>200</b> can just exclude the interference areas A<sub>I </sub>from the proposed geofence <b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> to generate a geofence <b>152</b> that closely resembles the proposed geofence <b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Here, the comparison between these figures illustrates how the AFC system <b>200</b> does not produce a geofence with some degree of interference because the AFC system <b>200</b> approaches the generation of the geofence <b>152</b> from another perspective where the geofence <b>152</b> is drawn with knowledge of operating areas A<sub>O </sub>for incumbent licensed system(s) <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, either AFC system may be in communication with a remote system <b>140</b> (e.g., a cloud-based AFC system).

The AFC system <b>200</b> may utilize these remote computing resources <b>142</b> to perform various functionality related to geofence generation and/or to incumbent licensed system(s) analysis. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the AFC system <b>200</b> is shown to include a licensed system database <b>210</b> (i.e., a database of registered systems that have a license to use the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>). The licensed system database <b>210</b> may be hosted on the remote system <b>140</b> (e.g., in a remote server) and accessible to the AFC system <b>200</b>.

Here, when none of the one or more operating parameters <b>124</b> interferes with any of the licensed systems <b>102</b> on the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> generates a geofence <b>152</b> that defines an operating boundary for the AFC device <b>110</b> to operate within based on the one or more operating parameters <b>124</b>.

In some implementations, in order to perform geofence generation, the AFC system <b>200</b> includes a licensed systems database <b>210</b> (also referred to as database <b>210</b>) and a geofence generator <b>220</b> (also referred to as a generator <b>220</b>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To determine whether any of the operating parameters <b>124</b> interfere with any of the licensed systems <b>102</b> on the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> references the licensed systems database <b>210</b> (also referred to as database <b>210</b>). The database <b>210</b> refers to a register for licensed systems <b>102</b> that includes information <b>212</b> about each licensed system <b>102</b> that has received a license for use on the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. For instance, when a licensed system <b>102</b> requests a license for a particular use on the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, the request for the license may include information <b>212</b> that defines how the requesting system intends to operate. In other words, due to the licensing process and/or information known/shared about a licensed system <b>102</b>, the database <b>210</b> includes the operating parameter(s) for each licensed system <b>102</b> as part of its information <b>212</b>. These operating parameters for a given licensed system <b>102</b> may include a location, a height (i.e., altitude above ground level), antenna characteristics, frequency of operation, and other operating parameters disclosed or identifiable about the operation of the licensed system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With the requested operating parameters <b>124</b> from the AFC device <b>110</b> (e.g., from the request <b>120</b>) and the current operating parameters included in the information <b>212</b> for each licensed system <b>102</b>, the generator <b>220</b> of the AFC system <b>200</b> is configured to compare the requested operating parameters <b>124</b> against the current operating parameters (of the existing licensed systems <b>102</b>) for potential interference. In some examples, the generator <b>220</b> identifies a location <b>124</b>, <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b> from the operation parameters <b>124</b> of the request <b>120</b> and determines interference locations <b>222</b> in an area adjacent to the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b>.

In some examples, the interference locations <b>222</b> refer to an outer boundary of a licensed system's operating area A<sub>O</sub>. In other words, the boundaries of the licensed systems <b>102</b> inform the generator <b>220</b> that the AFC device <b>110</b> cannot be given a geofence <b>152</b> that crosses these boundaries and enters into an operating area A<sub>O </sub>of a licensed system <b>102</b>. Otherwise, interference will result. With this approach, if the generator <b>220</b> determines the boundaries for the operating areas A<sub>O </sub>of licensed systems <b>102</b> in an area adjacent the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b>, the generator <b>220</b> can configure, for example, a maximum sized geofence <b>152</b> by defining the geofence boundary up to, but not including the boundaries of one or more licensed systems <b>102</b> nearby the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the generator <b>220</b> may offset the geofence <b>152</b> from the boundary of an operating area A<sub>O </sub>for a licensed device <b>102</b> by some designated tolerance (i.e., functioning as a buffer) to ensure that the geofence <b>152</b> does not interfere with a licensed device <b>102</b>. This offset process may then be repeated for all licensed systems <b>102</b> in the area adjacent to the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b> to generate the final geofence <b>152</b> communicated to the AFC device <b>110</b> with the response <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some configurations, an interference location <b>222</b> refers to an intersection of the operating area A<sub>O </sub>for one or more licensed systems <b>102</b> and an operating area A<sub>O </sub>for the AFC device <b>110</b> based on the operating parameters <b>124</b> of the request <b>120</b>. In addition to determining a boundary of an operating area A<sub>O </sub>for a licensed system <b>102</b>, the generator <b>220</b> also may determine a theoretical operating area A<sub>O </sub>for the AFC device <b>110</b> using the operating parameters <b>124</b>.

In some examples, the generator <b>220</b> is configured to search a particular area centered on the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b> (e.g., a one mile square area). This search area may be a design parameter of the generator <b>220</b> (or AFC system <b>200</b>) that is configured by an administrator of the AFC system <b>200</b>. In some examples, the AFC device <b>110</b> may designate the search area as one of the operating parameters <b>124</b> of the request <b>120</b>. Here, if the AFC device <b>110</b> does not specify a particular search area as an operating parameter <b>124</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> may be configured to use a default search area (e.g., 5 square miles).

With the interference locations <b>222</b> around the AFC device <b>110</b> defined, in some configurations, the generator <b>220</b> generates the operating boundary of the geofence <b>152</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b> by excluding the interference locations <b>222</b> from the operating boundary. In this respect, the exclusion results in the geofence <b>152</b> without areas that cause interference between the AFC device <b>110</b> and one or more nearby licensed systems <b>102</b> (e.g., the four licensed systems <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some configurations, the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b> includes a locational uncertainty <b>124</b>, <b>124</b><i>b </i>(e.g., as another operating parameter <b>124</b>) that communicates a likelihood that the AFC device <b>110</b> is in that particular location <b>124</b><i>a</i>. When the generator <b>220</b> receives a locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b</i>, the generator <b>220</b> may generate the geofence <b>152</b> based on the locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b </i>for the AFC device <b>110</b>. In these configurations, the generator <b>220</b> identifies the locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b </i>when generating the geofence <b>152</b>. For example, the generator <b>220</b> may use the locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b </i>to define the buffer (e.g., shown as A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) for the geofence <b>152</b>. Here, the buffer may refer to an area between one or more interference locations <b>222</b> (e.g., the boundary of an operating area A<sub>O </sub>for a licensed system <b>102</b>) and the geofence <b>152</b>. That is, the greater the locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b</i>, the greater the buffer area should be between the interference locations <b>222</b> and the operational boundary of the geofence <b>152</b>. In other words, if the locational uncertainty <b>124</b><i>b </i>indicates that the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>for the AFC device <b>110</b> is not very certain, the generator <b>220</b> may ensure that the geofence <b>152</b> does not interfere with a licensed system <b>102</b> by creating a larger buffer (e.g., between an interference location <b>222</b> and the final geofence <b>152</b>) and thus a smaller geofence <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the operating parameters <b>124</b> define the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the AFC device <b>110</b> according to a longitude and latitude (also referred to as a horizontal location). Here, the location <b>124</b><i>a </i>may correspond to global positioning system (GPS) data for the AFC device <b>110</b>. In other words, the AFC device <b>110</b> communicates with GPS to receive its coordinates and may pass these coordinates as an operating parameter <b>124</b> to the AFC system <b>200</b> in the request <b>120</b>. In addition to the horizontal location for the AFC device <b>110</b>, the operating parameters <b>124</b> may also include a height in the request <b>120</b>. Here, the height may be expressed as a height/altitude above sea level (i.e., an elevation) in order to be consistent with a reference plane (i.e., sea level). By including a height in addition to the horizontal location (e.g., the longitude and latitude), the AFC system <b>200</b> receives a three-dimensional or volumetric operating request <b>120</b>. In this respect, the AFC system <b>200</b> then functions to generate a volumetric geofence <b>152</b> based on the three-dimensional inputs (i.e., three-dimensional operating parameters <b>124</b>). When the request <b>120</b> includes a height for the AFC device <b>110</b>, this height may be a single height or a target range of heights. For instance, the AFC device <b>110</b> desires to operate somewhere in a range of heights between 640 feet above sea level and 800 feet above sea level. When the request <b>120</b> is a volumetric request, the generator <b>220</b> instead generates, for example, three-dimensional interference locations <b>222</b> rather than two-dimensional interference locations <b>222</b>. In some implementations, the generator <b>220</b> generates a three dimensional geofence <b>152</b> when the input is a target range of heights by dividing that range of heights into discrete bands of heights and searching the discrete bands for interference. Referring further to the example of a range of heights between 640 feet above sea and 800 feet above sea level, the AFC system <b>200</b> may generate a geofence <b>152</b> spanning a range of heights from 700-730 feet above sea level; therefore, indicating that heights ranging from 640-699 feet above sea level and 731-800 feet above sea level are not available for the particular set of operating parameters <b>124</b> in the request <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The operating parameters <b>124</b> of the request <b>120</b> may also include a parameter relating to a power for the AFC device <b>110</b>. For instance, the AFC device <b>110</b> includes an operating parameter <b>124</b> that designates a minimum operational power for the AFC device <b>110</b>. That is, the AFC device <b>110</b> signals that the geofence <b>152</b> of the response <b>150</b> cannot require that the AFC device <b>110</b> operates at a power less than the minimum operational power. In this example, if the AFC system <b>200</b> could not generate a geofence <b>152</b> that meets the minimum operational power requirements, the AFC system <b>200</b> is configured to indicate that a geofence <b>152</b> is not available that satisfies the minimum operational power. In some examples, the operating parameters <b>124</b> include a range of acceptable power levels for the AFC device <b>110</b>. In this example, the response <b>150</b> may include not only a geofence <b>152</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b>, but also an acceptable range of power levels that the AFC device <b>110</b> can use to operate while located within the geofence <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The response <b>150</b> generally includes a geofence <b>152</b> with approved operating parameters <b>154</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b>. These approved operating parameters <b>154</b> of the response <b>150</b> are &#x201c;approved&#x201d; parameters since the AFC system approves these parameters as parameters that the AFC device <b>110</b> can operate at while within the geofence <b>152</b>. In other words, if an AFC device <b>110</b> operates according to operating parameters other than the approved operating parameters <b>154</b>, the AFC device <b>110</b> may be in violation of the FCC framework (i.e., at risk of causing interference with licensed systems <b>102</b>). In some examples, these approved operating parameters <b>154</b> include one or more constraints <b>156</b> that dictate absolute conditions for operation of the AFC device <b>110</b>. Constraints <b>156</b> may be advantageous because, during operating of the AFC device <b>110</b>, there may be a reason that the AFC device <b>110</b> may deviate from its operating parameters. By communicating constraints <b>156</b>, the AFC device <b>110</b> can determine whether its deviation would cause interference with licensed system(s) <b>102</b> without having to reinitiate communication with the AFC system <b>200</b>. In other words, the AFC device <b>110</b> determines whether a particular modification to an operating parameter fails to satisfy a relevant constraint <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One such example of a constraint <b>156</b> is a power constraint <b>156</b> for the geofence <b>152</b>. Here, a power constraint <b>156</b> refers to a threshold operating power (e.g., maximum operating power) for the AFC device <b>110</b> to operate at while located within the geofence <b>152</b>. That is, if the AFC device <b>110</b> operates at a power that exceeds the threshold of the power constraint <b>156</b>, the AFC device <b>110</b> risks interfering with one or more licensed systems <b>102</b>. Therefore, in some configurations, based on the power constraint <b>156</b>, the AFC device <b>110</b> is only permitted to operate at a power equal to or less than the power constraint <b>156</b> while located in the geofence <b>152</b>. In some implementations, if the power constraint <b>156</b> is less than the minimum operational power designated by the AFC device <b>110</b> in the operating parameters <b>124</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> does not include a geofence <b>152</b> with the response <b>150</b> and instead conveys that the minimum operational power cannot be satisfied. In this respect, when the operating parameters <b>124</b> cannot be met by the AFC system <b>200</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> may either fail to return a response <b>150</b> to a request <b>120</b>, return a response <b>150</b> that indicates a rationale as to why the AFC system <b>200</b> cannot generate a geofence <b>152</b>, or return a response <b>150</b> that proposes alternative operating parameters for a particular geofence <b>152</b>. In the later case, when the AFC system <b>200</b> returns a response <b>150</b> that proposes alternative operating parameters for a particular geofence <b>152</b>, the AFC system <b>200</b> may be configured with a deviation threshold that defines how much the AFC system <b>200</b> is permitted to deviate from the submitted/requested operating parameters <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the response <b>150</b> may include more than one geofence <b>152</b> (e.g., shown as four geofences <b>152</b>, <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>). Here, each geofence <b>152</b> returned to the AFC device <b>110</b> as part of the response <b>150</b> is a permitted geofence <b>152</b> (also referred to as a recommended geofence) for the AFC device <b>110</b>. In this sense, when the response <b>150</b> includes multiple geofences <b>152</b>, each geofence <b>152</b> represents a geofence option for the AFC device <b>110</b>. In some examples, the AFC device <b>110</b> receives more than one geofence <b>152</b> as optional operational boundaries for the AFC device <b>110</b> when the AFC device <b>110</b> submits operating parameters <b>124</b> that may be combined in different permutations by the AFC system <b>200</b> to generate more than one geofence <b>152</b>. For instance, one more common scenario where this may occur is when the AFC device <b>110</b> communicates in the request <b>120</b> that it is capable of operating on more than one channel or range of frequencies within the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>. In this situation, the AFC system <b>200</b> is configured to generate a geofence <b>152</b> for each potential channel or range of frequencies. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> depicts that the AFC system <b>200</b> generates a geofence <b>152</b> for each potential channel where some area or volume adjacent the AFC device <b>110</b> exists that would not interfere with a licensed system <b>102</b>. Here, the AFC system <b>200</b> generates four geofences <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>for four channels in the licensed frequency band <b>122</b> where each geofence <b>152</b> corresponds to one of the four channels. As can be seen from this example, one or more licensed systems <b>102</b> may be operating in different ways (e.g., with different operating areas A<sub>O</sub>) on different channels. For instance, licensed system <b>2</b> does not operate on Channel B in the designated area (shown as Area <b>1</b>) which results in a second geofence <b>152</b><i>b </i>that is larger on Channel B for the AFC device <b>110</b> compared to a first geofence <b>152</b><i>a </i>on Channel A where all licensed systems <b>102</b> are operating to some degree. Similarly, on Channel C, licensed system <b>2</b> does not operate and licensed system <b>4</b> operates in a smaller operating area A<sub>O </sub>(e.g., when compared to its operating area A<sub>O </sub>of Channel A or B). This results in a third geofence <b>152</b><i>c </i>that is different from the first geofence <b>152</b><i>a </i>of Channel A and the second geofence <b>152</b><i>b </i>of Channel C (e.g., spans a different portion of Area <b>1</b>). On Channel D, licensed system <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> do not operate and licensed system <b>1</b> is operating in a smaller operating area A<sub>O </sub>(e.g., when compared to its operating area A<sub>O </sub>of Channels A, B, and C). This results in a fourth geofence <b>152</b><i>d </i>that is different yet from the other geofences <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and spans almost &#x2154;<sup>rd </sup>of the Area <b>1</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> depicts geofences <b>152</b> for discrete channels (e.g., channels A&#x2212;D), the AFC system <b>200</b> can also generate different geofences <b>152</b> for different ranges of frequencies (e.g., within a single channel or among multiple channels). For instance, a channel may include the frequencies of 5800 MHz to 6400 MHz and the AFC system <b>200</b> outputs two geofences <b>152</b>, a first geofence <b>152</b> that can operate on the range of frequencies of 5925-6125 MHz and a second geofence <b>152</b> that can operate on the range of frequencies of 5925-6025 MHz. In this example, the first geofence <b>152</b> may be a one kilometer area centered around the AFC device <b>110</b> while the second geofence <b>152</b> may be a two kilometer area centered around the AFC device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Returning to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, with the generator <b>220</b> generating these geofences <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>for each Channel A-D, the AFC device <b>110</b> can then select which geofence <b>152</b> it prefers to operate on. For instance, the AFC device <b>110</b> may choose to operate on Channel C because the AFC device <b>110</b> prefers to operate more Easterly than the other geofences <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In some implementations, when there are multiple geofences <b>152</b> possible, the AFC system <b>200</b> is configured to suggest a geofence <b>152</b> that the AFC system <b>200</b> believes is most optimal (e.g., based on optimization criteria). For instance, this approach may minimize a potential selection burden for the AFC device <b>110</b>. That is, some consumers may not feel as though they possess the knowledge to make a geofence selection and may prefer that the AFC system <b>200</b> identifies an optimal geofence <b>152</b>. One such example of the optimization criteria may be that the AFC system <b>200</b> determines the geofence <b>152</b> with the greatest area or volume and the response <b>150</b> reflects that this geofence <b>152</b> with the greatest area or volume is the leading recommendation by the AFC system <b>200</b>. In some configurations, when the AFC system <b>200</b> generates multiple geofences <b>152</b>, the AFC device <b>110</b> may be configured to select an alternative geofence <b>152</b> that is different from the recommendation set forth by the AFC system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example arrangement of operations for a method <b>300</b> of generating a geofence <b>152</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b> using the AFC system <b>200</b>. At operation <b>302</b>, the method <b>300</b> receives a geofence request <b>120</b> from an AFC device <b>110</b>. The geofence request <b>120</b> requests to use a licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b> and includes one or more operating parameters <b>124</b> for the AFC device <b>110</b>. At operation <b>304</b>, the method <b>300</b> determines whether any of the one or more operating parameters <b>124</b> interfere with any licensed devices <b>102</b> on the licensed radio frequency band <b>122</b>. When none of the one or more operating parameters <b>124</b> interfere with any of the licensed devices <b>102</b> on the licensed frequency band <b>122</b>, at operation <b>306</b>, the method <b>300</b> generates, based on the one or more operating parameters <b>124</b>, a geofence <b>152</b> defining an operating boundary for the AFC device <b>110</b> to operate within. At operation <b>308</b>, the method <b>300</b> communicates a response <b>150</b> to the geofence request <b>120</b> to the AFC device <b>110</b> where the response <b>150</b> includes the geofence <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic view of an example computing device <b>400</b> that may be used to implement the systems (e.g., the AFC system <b>200</b>) and methods (e.g., the method <b>300</b>) described in this document.
