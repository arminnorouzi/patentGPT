The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of such a scored tablet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many pharmaceutical dosage forms are provided as scored tablets that can be manually broken by the patient along a site of mechanical weakness such as a breaking score thereby providing two halves each containing essentially 50% of the dose of the pharmacologically active ingredient. The breaking of such pharmaceutical dosage forms can serve different purposes. In certain instances it can be desirable to begin the treatment with a reduced dose of the pharmacologically active ingredient and to subsequently increase the dose, i.e. to titrate the pharmacologically active ingredient during a titration phase, followed by a treatment phase where the administered dose is kept constant. In other instances it can be desirable for the ease of swallowing to break the dosage form apart and to take the fragments all together, i.e. within a couple of minutes by separate swallowing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many pharmaceutical dosage forms provide prolonged release of the pharmacologically active ingredient contained therein. In contrast to pharmaceutical dosage forms providing immediate release, such dosage forms are designed to retard the release. Retardation of release may be achieved by a film coating with an insoluble polymer having pores of defined number and size through which the pharmacologically active ingredient may by release into the environment. Alternatively, retardation of release may be achieved by a prolonged release matrix in which the pharmacologically active ingredient is embedded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When scored tablets are broken apart, the surface at the site of mechanical weakness becomes exposed. Thus, the total surface of the two halves is greater than the surface of the intact scored tablet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the one hand, when the tablet is provided with a prolonged release coating, the exposed surface at the site of mechanical weakness is uncovered and provides a significantly faster release of the pharmacologically active ingredient than the other surfaces of the two halves which are covered with the prolonged release coating. In consequence, the separate halves provide an in vitro release profile that significantly deviates from the in vitro release profile of the intact scored tablet. Therefore, prolonged release coatings are typically not suitable for scored tablets.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, when the tablet is provided with a prolonged release matrix in which the pharmacologically active ingredient is embedded, release through the exposed surface at the site of mechanical weakness typically essentially corresponds to release through the other surfaces of the two halves that are also exposed to the environment when the divisible table is intact. Nonetheless, as the total surface area is increased by breaking the tablet apart, the two halves typically show a faster release than the intact scored tablet. Thus, it makes a difference with respect to the pharmacokinetic properties whether the patent takes an intact scored tablet or whether the patient takes the two halves that were broken apart.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">W. R. Primrose et al., <i>Alteration of pharmacokinetics after halving a slow</i>-<i>release theophylline tablet</i>, Pharmatherapeutica, 1983, 3(6), 429-32 report that absorption was faster and plasma levels were higher when a 400 mg Theophylline tablet formulation was taken as two separate halves.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">V.

Halving the tablets caused a statistically significant increase in cumulative dissolution as early as 15 minutes. The difference in cumulative dissolution reached its maximum for both Ritalin-SR and generic methylphenidate extended-release tablets at 2 hours. At this time point, the percent dissolution of the whole versus halved tablets was 57% versus 74% (Ritalin-SR), respectively, and 49% versus 67% (generic), respectively.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A.

Zhao et al., <i>Tablet splitting: Product quality Assessment of metoprolol succinate extended release tablets</i>. Int J Pharm. 2010; 401(1-2):25-31. doi:10.1016/j.ijpharm. 2010.09.004 discloses that Multiple Unit Particulate System (MUPS) containing sustained release pellets compressed into a fast disintegrating matrix provide similar release of halved and intact tablets because in-vitro release is determined by the coated pellets that stay intact when splitting the MUPS tablets.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Similarly, according to M. T. Teixeira et al., <i>The Influence of Matrix Technology on the Subdivision of Sustained Release Matrix Tablets</i>. AAPS PharmSciTech. 2019 Dec. 3; 21(1):8. doi: 10.1208/s12249-019-1554-1, splitting of matrix sustained release matrix tablets is not recommended because of faster release of the split tablets; only sustained release system recommended for splitting is a Multiple Unit Particulate System (MUPS) that contains sustained release microparticles compressed into an immediate disintegrating matrix.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Summarizing therefore, splitting of sustained release matrix tablets is generally not recommended because of faster release of the split tablets.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Scored tablets can be advantageously used in dose titration, i.e. when at the beginning of therapy, the dose of the pharmacologically active ingredient is steadily to be increased until the desired therapeutically effective dose is reached. Titration can have several advantages, especially with respect to the reduction of treatment emergent adverse events (undesired side effects).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, a scored tablet containing a dose of 100 mg of a pharmacologically active ingredient may be split into two haves each containing 50 mg of a pharmacologically active ingredient. The individual haves may then be used for dose titration. For example on a first day of therapy, the first half of the split tablet may be administered and on the second day of therapy, the second half of the split tablet may be administered. If the dose is to be increased to 100 mg on the third day of therapy, this may then be achieved by administering the intact (whole, unsplit) tablet. For example, according to the prescribing information for Nucynta&#xae; ER (Tapentadol HCl extended release), the tablets should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Patients should be titrated to adequate analgesia with dose increases of 50 mg no more than twice daily every three days.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is known that during dose titration of various pharmacologically active ingredients a significant number of patients, sometimes up to 20% or more, decide to terminate treatment because of side effects that cannot be tolerated. The incidence of side effects is typically a function of the administered dose of the pharmacologically active ingredient, whereas titration may serve the purpose of slowly adapting the patient's organism to the pharmacologically active ingredient. Thus, the organism shall become used and accustomed to the pharmacologically active ingredient, as this may significantly reduce side effects. When the onset of the plasma level of the pharmacologically active ingredient is too rapid, however, the customization process does not have sufficient time resulting in an increased incidence of side effects. Thus, when scored tablets are to be used in dose titration, it is desirable that the physiological effects (therapeutic effects and possible side effects) are controlled also when only halves of the split tablet are administered. In particular, it is desirable that under physiological conditions release kinetics of the pharmacologically active ingredient from one half (i.e. 50% of the original dose contained in the whole scored tablet before it was split) proportionally correspond to release kinetics of the pharmacologically active ingredient from the whole tablet (i.e. 100% of the dose contained in the whole scored tablet).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, as some patients have problems in swallowing large tablets, it is possible that these patients even during the dose maintenance phase, i.e. after dose titration, will not take the split tablet as a whole, but will split it into two halves and for the ease of swallowing will take the two halves simultaneously or shortly after one another in order to administer the desired full dose of the pharmacologically active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">There is therefore a demand for pharmaceutical dosage forms that can be divided into two parts and that provide essentially the same in vitro release profile irrespective of whether the intact dosage form is taken or whether the two separate halves are taken.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to <i>Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for Industry on Tablet Scoring: Nomenclature, Labeling, and Data for Evaluation</i>, the split tablet should inter alia be safe to handle and not pose risk of unintended drug exposure. Modified release products for which the control of drug release can be compromised by tablet splitting should not have a scoring feature. The split tablet portions should meet the same finished-product testing requirements as for a whole-tablet product with equivalent strength. A risk assessment should be provided to justify the tests and criteria for product with the proposed functional scoring. The assessment should be undertaken on both tablets that are split nonmechanically (by hand) and tablets that are split mechanically (with a tablet splitter). Dissolution on whole versus split tablet portions should meet the similarity factor (f2) criteria according to <i>Guidance for Industry on Dissolution Testing of Immediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms </i>(f2=50&#xb7;log {[1+(1/n)&#x3a3;<sub>t-1</sub><sup>n</sup>(R<sub>t</sub>&#x2212;T<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>&#x2212;0.5</sup>&#xb7;100}). For curves to be considered similar, f2 values should be close to 100. Generally, f2 values greater than 50 (50-100) ensure sameness or equivalence of the two curves and, thus, of the performance of the test (postchange) and reference (prechange) products.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, many initially approved pharmaceutical dosage forms are no scored tablets. Thus, the initially approved dosage forms are conventional tablets, whereas it may subsequently become desirable to also provide the same pharmacologically active ingredient in form of scored tablets.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When after approval of a pharmaceutical dosage form changes are made, however, various regulatory requirements need to be satisfied. According to the European Guideline on the details of the various categories of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2008 of November 2008 concerning the examination of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products, changes in the shape or dimensions of the pharmaceutical form are included in category B.II.a.2, where scored tablets intended to be divided into equal doses are mentioned under b). Documentation to be supplied with regard to such changes inter alia include comparative dissolution data on at least one pilot batch of the current and proposed dimensions (no significant differences regarding comparability see the relevant (Human or Veterinary) guidance on Bioavailability); and justification for not submitting a new bioequivalence study according to the relevant (Human or Veterinary) guidance on Bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Typically, the in vitro dissolution profile of a changed dosage form needs to be equivalent to the in vitro dissolution profile of the initially authorized dosage form. Therefore, when the initially authorized dosage form was a tablet not equipped with scoring properties and when the newly developed changed dosage form is a scored tablet, the in vitro dissolution profile of the newly developed changed dosage form must exhibit an in vitro dissolution profile having an f2 value a generally greater than 50.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In-vitro in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) is a predictive mathematical model describing the relationship between an in-vitro property of a dosage form and an in-vivo response. IVIVC establishes a relationship between a biological property, or a parameter derived from a biological property produced from a dosage form, and a physicochemical property of the same dosage form. When an IVIVC model can be established, it may not be necessary to perform additional studies in vivo demonstration bioequivalence, bioavailability, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Post-approval changes in the composition of an approved pharmaceutical dosage form are typically regarded as more substantial than mere changes in the shape or dimensions of the pharmaceutical form. According to the European Guideline on the details of the various categories of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2008 of November 2008 concerning the examination of variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products, changes in the shape or dimensions of the pharmaceutical form are included in category B.II.a.3. Changes in the composition, i.e. different excipients or different amounts thereof, may thus require not only stability tests but additionally also bioequivalence studies where pharmacokinetic parameters are determined in vivo such as AUC, t<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, and the like. According to EMA <i>Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence</i>, a bioequivalence study is required, unless otherwise justified, if a product has been reformulated from the formulation initially approved or the manufacturing method has been modified by the manufacturer in ways that could be considered to impact on the bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, there is also a demand for means suitable for transforming an initially approved pharmaceutical dosage form into a scored tablet without significantly changing the formulation in ways that could be considered to impact on the bioavailability. In other words, there is a demand to retain the excipients and quantities of the initially approved pharmaceutical dosage form when providing a scored tablet, as this may avoid the requirement for bioequivalence studies.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">WO 03/035053 and DE 101 52 469 relate to a pharmaceutical formulation which is characterized by delayed release of the active ingredient.
