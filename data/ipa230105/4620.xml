Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system that enables a cross-browser dialog platform for the submission and verification of documentary evidence to satisfy at least one outstanding citation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Several designs for cross-browser dialog platforms have been designed in the past. None of them, however, include a system using submission and verification of documentary evidence to satisfy at least one outstanding citation or to satisfy the safety requirements of a vehicle to be operational that when verified through a Dots Per Inch Requirement using vehicle or government color placards through a network protocols for the minimum or least amount of bandwidth for clarity, a web dialog composites a new web page to enable to process. For example, to process the payment under the right category code and pay class and presenting a new web page within the dialog to be able to synchronize the database with an agency database. The agency database is associated with at least one of a state, city, county, or government jurisdiction.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">3. Description of Background</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, operating systems and their browsers like but not limited to Microsoft Windows Edge browser can require a user to download an application from their approved store. If a computing device is not updated with previous updates, the computing device can have trouble presenting a graphical user interface and its capabilities, pops ups, functions, colors, graphics, texts, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Government jurisdictions have a break down in communications within their departments in synchronizing databases for requirements associated with at least one violation to satisfy the citation or the safety requirements for a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the automation and driver-less vehicle continue to progress. There will be a system needed to process and verify the safety requirements of a vehicle directly into the database, operating system, client program, of an automated driver less-vehicle. It will be understood that this example of a driver-less is not limited to a vehicle with the capabilities of an individual taking control of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Government jurisdictions have many different databases within their own departments at County, Clerks, Collections, Courts, Traffic Tickets, Police Departments, Service Locations, etc. None of them have a way to process information in constant manner with a user's computing device if but not limited to the computing device that is being used is missing updates, is no longer receiving updates from an operating system or manufacture to receive documentation required to satisfy the citation and update the current status for at least one of a driver license, registration, insurance, or proof of compliant equipment in one central place to synchronizing databases for all the government jurisdictions in a state or country.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Government jurisdictions do not have the resources or economic means to create their own systems and technologies to keep with the constant updates of computing devices. States and local governments have outdated technologies that is not able to process different types of files so users are limited which computing devices or computer programs they can use to satisfy their citation. For example, their technologies might not be compatible on a smart phone, tablet, smart watch, and near-field communications, process all image document types, accept payment from different providers, process information in their existing case management system, etc. For example, a lot of case management systems can only process and accept a PDF document or a TIFF format. A lot of case management systems require that you send executable program in a certain amount of bits to a decompiler to process information in a case management system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Government jurisdictions within one sector may have one database for payments, a different database to store images, a different database for the Judges and courts. So, if one department wanted to sync with another, they would have to create an interface and a web dialog to wrap around another web dialog. Many government jurisdictions and agencies do not have the resources and economic means to create an interface web application, web app view, or web dialog every time a new technology emerges to satisfy requirements associated with a citation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Laws or court decisions for a specific case/citation are constantly changing requiring different payment amounts for citations, late fees, court fees, etc. Every time there is a change in Laws or fees, government jurisdiction's departments have to get approval to implement new projects to update systems and departments. So, departments have to wait to improve efficiency.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Many government jurisdictions and agencies do not have the resources and economic means to allow new technologies an interface to connect to synchronize agency databases there limiting growth in the community with businesses, putting them at a disadvantage with other counties, not being able to collect funds efficiently, etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A lot of employees within a government jurisdiction use different web browsers or outdated web browsers because of budget cuts, no tech department, outdated technologies like case management systems. Employees in different departments do not have the means to update, enable, or process other department interfaces for satisfy citations in a consistent manner for communication for interfaces or deploy new technologies within existing interfaces. A lot of systems can create confusion if too many options are available for a particular citation to be satisfied. A user can click on the wrong category or allocation code creating an inappropriate dollar might to be paid or to synchronize to the wrong agency database. These scenarios can cause a lot of problems to a user not being able to use their vehicle or a government agency not being able to collect the correct fine amount or overcharging a user/customer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Many instances happen where an individual in a court proceeding presents requirements regarding a citation or the safety of a vehicle, and a court process information but that information does not reflect in a timely manner to be paid and synchronize an agency database. Also, the opposite can happen where a court proceeding is not able to access the updated requirements submitted by a user, computing device, computing mechanism, operating system, or client program. Therefore, a court proceeding might have to be delayed or additional court fees may be applied.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It could be very expensive for government agencies to but not limited to in trying to keep up with new technologies, assigning employee roles, allocating payment codes, categories for agency databases, etc.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
