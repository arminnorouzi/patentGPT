High Moisture Extrusion (HME) is a food processing method that may be used to generate a food product that has meat-like structure (e.g., a fibrous texture similar to animal meat) using non-animal proteins such as plant proteins (e.g., soybean proteins, wheat gluten, cottonseed proteins, other plant proteins), bacterial proteins, and the like. The processing of non-animal proteins, such as plant proteins, into a meat analog using High Moisture Extrusion (HME) may be referenced as a fibrous texturate herein. During High Moisture Extrusion (HME) a temperature in an extruder (i.e., extruding may be the end step before shaping the food product) may be high (e.g., up to 170&#xb0; C.). If spices and flavors are added before the extruding step (i.e., before the extruder), a taste profile of the food product may be damaged or even destroyed by the high temperature (e.g., up to 170&#xb0; C.) in the extruder. Moreover, even if a relatively heat stable flavor could be identified, a high dose of the relatively heat stable flavor would be necessary. Thus, adding flavor (i.e., the taste of the food product) to the food may be done after extrusion of the High Moisture Extrusion (HME) food product. For example, adding spice, marinades, flavors (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring, and the like) to the High Moisture Extrusion (HME) food product after extrusion. One way to add the flavoring (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring, and the like) is using a batch mixer including a vacuum tumbler, which heats and mixes the raw ingredients. As the fibrous texturate is relatively compact during batch mixing, an ordinary user has problems getting the flavoring (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring, and the like) into the fibrous texturate pieces (i.e., chunks of fibrous texturate). However, an ordinary user is aware having the flavoring (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring, and the like) throughout the fibrous texturate is critical for a good quality food product with meat-like structure and taste. For example, if the taste of a food product is only on the surface of the fibrous texturate pieces (i.e., chunks of fibrous texturate), the flavor flavors (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring) would disappear for a consumer after consuming the initial top layer, resulting in a poor-quality food product with incomplete flavoring throughout the food product. Moreover, the poor-quality food product with incomplete flavoring does not have the desired flavoring (e.g., beef flavoring, chicken flavoring, and the like) throughout the fibrous texturate that is critical for a good quality food product with meat-like structure and taste.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various embodiments systems and methods of the present technology solve this problem of a poor-quality food product with incomplete flavoring throughout the food product by heating the chunks (i.e., chunks of fibrous texturate) using a vacuum cooking food processing system including a vacuum tumbler with a water-based flavor solution so that the chunks are activated for absorbing the water-based flavor solution resulting in a flavor profile throughout the food product. Furthermore, various embodiments include a vacuum tumbler to further enhance absorption of the water-based flavor solution. For example, using a vacuum tumbler induces an expanding of the chunks (i.e., chunks of fibrous texturate) by decreasing steam pressure to increase vacuuming so that the water-based flavor solution is more easily absorbed into the chunks. In some instances, oil-based flavor is included in the flavoring. Moreover, vacuum cooking of the food product results in the food product being more tender resulting in a good quality food product with meat-like structure and taste. Additionally, systems and methods of the present technology enhance absorption of the water-based flavor solution by the chunks (i.e., chunks of fibrous texturate) by decreasing steam injection into the vacuum tumbler during the heating phase with the steam collapsing directly in the tumbler, which also makes a good quality food product by making the food product more tender. Moreover, the present technology including using a vacuum tumbler enables sensitive formulations (e.g., with only a small amount of flavoring) because of the enhanced absorption by the chunks resulting in enhancement of the flavor profile of the food product.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a top view of a system for vacuum cooking a non-animal protein, High Moisture Extrusion (HME) food product using steam injection, according to various embodiments of the present technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the following elements: main operation panel <b>1</b> (e.g., may include a touch screen user interface), main switch <b>2</b>, emergency stop <b>3</b>, a power inlet <b>4</b>, an air inlet <b>5</b>, mixing motor cable <b>8</b>, pneumatic cylinder <b>10</b>, a steam injector <b>13</b> (e.g., a steam lance), a first safety valve <b>14</b>, a second safety valve <b>15</b>, a vacuum sensor <b>16</b>, vacuum valve <b>17</b> (e.g., a pneumatic vacuum valve), pneumatic release valve <b>18</b>, direct steam <b>20</b> (e.g., flange), steam double jacket <b>21</b>, condensate return <b>22</b> (e.g., thread may be 1 inch in diameter), supply water <b>23</b> (e.g., hose nipple may be 0.5 inches in diameter), foldable lift <b>24</b>, dosing steam nozzle <b>25</b> (e.g., dosing steam nozzle may be 0.5 inches in diameter), water ring pump inflow <b>27</b> (e.g., thread may be 0.5 inches in diameter), water ring pump return <b>28</b> (e.g., thread may be &#xbe; inches), and vacuum tumbler <b>29</b>.
