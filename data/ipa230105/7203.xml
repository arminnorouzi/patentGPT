num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to electronic devices, and more specifically, to image sensors for electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A CMOS image sensor which includes an array of pixels is used to convert incident light into electrical signals. There are two types of CMOS image sensors, electronic rolling shutter sensors and electronic global shutter sensors. An electronic rolling shutter sensor starts exposing the array of pixels line by line, reads electrical signals of the pixels line by line, and finishes reading electrical signals of a frame before the exposure time of the next frame, such that the starting time of exposure of each line is different while the exposure time of each line is the same. This shutter mechanism produces image distortion when capturing images of moving objects. Electronic global shutter sensors can solve image distortion. In an electronic global shutter sensor, all lines begin and stop their exposure at the same time. It is difficult to read all electrical signals from the entire array of pixels simultaneously, so the electronic global shutter sensors need to store the unread electrical signals of a frame in the pixels without affecting the exposure of next frame.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are two ways for electronic global shutter sensors to store electrical signals converted from the incident light. One is to convert the incident light into voltage signals and store the voltage signals in the pixels. The other is to convert the incident light into charges and store the charges in the pixels. Storing the electrical signals as voltage signals has been implemented in both front-illuminated image sensors and back-illuminated image sensors due to the simple implementation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a conventional circuit of a pixel in an electronic global shutter sensor. Before the end of the exposure time for one frame, the first transistor Sample<b>1</b> and the second transistor Sample<b>2</b> in all pixels are turned on, and the first capacitor C<b>1</b> samples the reset signal voltage at point FD through the source follower M<b>2</b>. After sampling, the transfer gate TX is turned on, and the photon-generated electrons are transferred from the pinned photodiode to the point FD. The photon-generated electrons generate a voltage drop in the capacitance of the point FD. The second transistor Sample<b>2</b> is turned on again, and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> re-samples the image signal voltage of the point FD through the source follower M<b>2</b>. After the global sampling is over, the bus switch Select of each row is turned on, and the reset signal voltage Vreset is read out first. Then the first transistor Sample<b>1</b> is turned on, and the average signal (Vsignal+Vreset)/2 is read out.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the conventional pixel circuits such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the image signal sampled and stored in the capacitor C<b>2</b> cannot be read out quickly, completely, and directly due to the limitation of the pixel structure. The signal output range is also limited by this structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of pixel circuits, image sensors, image pickup devices and methods for capturing images are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some examples, a pixel circuit comprises a source module, a sampling module, a first switch module, and a second switch module.

As the electrical signal and the reference signal are both sampled and the image signal of the pixel can be derived from the electrical signal and the reference signal, the offset variation induced by different devices in the pixel circuits can be cancelled. As the two sampling time points (the first time point and the third time point) are very close, and the signal holding time for each of the sampling units (<b>3131</b>, and <b>3132</b>) are similar, the parasitic light influence on two sampling units <b>3131</b> and <b>3132</b> may be the same. Therefore, the parasitic light sensitivity can be effectively suppressed through correlated double sampling, and the fixed deviation noise of the difference between the two sampling readouts can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic diagram of a pixel circuit <b>41</b>, in accordance with various embodiments.

The main difference between the pixel circuit <b>161</b> and other pixel circuits described herein (such as the pixel circuits <b>51</b>, <b>101</b>, and <b>141</b>) is that the transistor M<b>7</b> is not provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, and the drain of the transistor M<b>5</b> (the third source follower) is coupled to a pulsed power supply to replace the power supply.

The timing sequence diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is basically the same as that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The main difference is that the signal timing of the pulsed voltage source VSF_PULSE replaces that of the control signal PC. The pulsed power supply VSF_PULSE needs to fall from a high level to a low level and then recovery to a high level twice in the sampling period. The first falling of the pulsed voltage source VSF_PULSE in the global sampling period of each frame may be at a timing when the control signal RST is at a high level after time T<b>1</b>, or after the control signal RST falls to a low level. Before time T<b>2</b>, the floating node FD is reset, the pulsed voltage source VSF_PULSE falls to a low level, and the first terminal (node A) and the second terminal (node B) are pulled to a low level corresponding to the pulsed power supply VSF_PULSE level. Thus, the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are reset. Similarly, before time T<b>2</b>, the pulsed power supply VSF_PULSE is restored to a high level, and the working state of the transistor M<b>5</b> reverts to the source follower state. The transistor M<b>2</b> is turned off at time T<b>2</b>. The reset signal has been sampled and held in the capacitor C<b>2</b> since time T<b>2</b>. Before sampling by the capacitor C<b>1</b> at time T<b>4</b>, the pulsed power supply VSF_PULSE needs to fall to a low level again, and then rise to a high level again, which causes the second terminal (node B) to reset and be ready to begin sampling of the electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">As mentioned above, the present disclosure is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments.
