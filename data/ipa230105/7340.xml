Exemplary application modules which reside above abstraction layer <b>404</b> may include as required for a particular embodiment transport and session layer protocol and interface management <b>428</b>; AV output management <b>424</b>; input/output processing and routing <b>440</b>; a miscellaneous services module <b>426</b> to support closed captioning, display configuration, OSD, etc.; remote control command decoder <b>430</b>; and device resource management <b>442</b>. Additionally, in keeping with the teachings of this invention, the exemplary TV programming may include audio and visual event detector modules <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, for example voice and/or image recognition engines or the like; user event processing <b>436</b>; and a user statistics gathering and reporting module <b>438</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Under the control of such TV programming, smart TV appliance <b>200</b> may for example receive an incoming AV media stream from one of the input ports <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> to be processed, buffered, separated into audio and video components, and routed to outputs <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> for rendering on TV display screen <b>322</b> and loudspeaker(s) <b>324</b>; may receive commands from remote control interface <b>316</b> which are decoded and acted upon, for example to select an input media stream, adjust audio volume, etc.; may manage a connection to the Internet through Ethernet or WiFi interface <b>310</b> to enable browsing for content, download of software updates, video telephony utilizing inputs from camera <b>122</b> and microphone <b>120</b>; etc. Additionally, in accordance with the teachings herein, the exemplary TV programming may receive and process input signals from controlling device <b>204</b>, camera <b>122</b> and/or microphone <b>120</b> in order to detect user presence, identify individual users, and/or receive user command input, as will described hereafter. As will be appreciated, while in the illustrative embodiment the source of audio input signals may comprise a microphone <b>120</b> and associated interface <b>314</b> provisioned as part of a smart TV appliance <b>200</b>, in alternative embodiments audio input signals may be captured by any other appliance in the system and forwarded to appliance <b>200</b> for processing, or may originate from a microphone provisioned in a controlling device such as remote control or smartphone <b>204</b>, the output of which microphone may, by way of example, be digitized and/or processed by controlling device <b>204</b> and wirelessly forwarded to smart TV appliance <b>200</b> via remote control interface <b>326</b>, WiFi interface <b>310</b>, Bluetooth interface <b>328</b>, or any other means as appropriate for a particular implementation. In an exemplary embodiment the user event processing module <b>436</b> of the TV programming of TV appliance <b>200</b> (hereafter &#x201c;event processing&#x201d;) may act as illustrated in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> upon occurrence of a user-related event. First, at step <b>502</b> it may be determined if the event constitutes receipt of a remote control command, as may be reported by remote control command decoder <b>430</b>. As will be appreciated, remote control commands may be received via any or all of RC interface <b>420</b> (e.g., infrared or RF4CE signals or the like), Ethernet/WiFi interface <b>414</b>, or Bluetooth interface <b>416</b>, depending on the particular embodiment and the particular controlling device currently in use. If it is determined that the event constitutes receipt of a remote control command, at step <b>540</b> the requested functional operation may be executed. By way of example without limitation, such operations may include adjustment of output audio volume to be performed by AV management module <b>424</b>, selection of a new media input stream to be performed by I/O and routing module <b>440</b>, etc. In some embodiments, received remote control commands may also comprise requests to direct the functional operation of other connected appliances, for example control of DVD player <b>106</b> or STB <b>104</b> via CEC commands to be issued by interface management module <b>428</b> over HDMI connections <b>130</b>; or alternatively via a connected IR blaster or a LAN as described for example in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/657,176 &#x201c;System and Method for Optimized Appliance Control,&#x201d; of common ownership and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Upon completion of the requested command function, at step <b>542</b> it may next be determined if the command function just performed comprised a change in the media stream being rendered by TV <b>200</b>, for example selection of a new input port <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>; a change to the selected broadcast channel or DVR playback of STB <b>104</b>; a change to an internet media source, etc. If so, at step <b>544</b> data regarding this event may be conveyed to user statistics module <b>438</b> for logging and ultimate reporting to database server <b>128</b>. As will be appreciated, the data logged regarding the new content stream may comprise some or all of the command parameters themselves, e.g., an STB channel number and timestamp; metadata items obtainable from the content source device or channel such as a DVD title, streaming video URL, etc.; a sample of the audio or video content itself for analysis as is known in the art and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,986,913, 7,627,477 or 7,346,512; or any other data which may be suitable for identification purposes. If it is determined that the executed function did not comprise any change to the current media stream, at step <b>546</b> it may next be determined if the executed function comprised a reportable event, such as for example powering TV <b>200</b> (or any other connected device) on or off, issuing a fast forward command during DVR playback, etc. If so, this event may also be reported to user statistics module <b>438</b> for logging, after which processing of the remote control command is complete. In this regard, it will be appreciated that reportable appliance events such as powering an attached device on or off may also be separately initiated via for example direct communication to an appliance from its own remote control. Accordingly, though not illustrated, where such events are detectable, for example via HDMI status, absence or presence of video or audio signals, etc., these events may also be reported and logged.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the reported event is not a remote control command, at step <b>504</b> the event processing may next determine if the reported event constitutes an image change event reported by visual event detection module <b>432</b> in response to analysis of image data received from camera <b>122</b> via camera driver <b>422</b>. Such image processing may utilize for example the techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,534,917, 6,829,384, 8,274,535, WIPO (PCT) patent application publication WO2010/057683A1, or the like, and may for example periodically monitor an image comprising the field of view of camera <b>122</b> in order in order to initiate image analysis in response to detection of any variation in image data which exceed a certain threshold value. If it is determined that the event is a report of a detected image change, at step <b>518</b> it is next determined if the event comprises the departure or imminent departure of a user from the viewing environment of TV <b>200</b>. If so, various actions may be taken by event processing <b>436</b> as appropriate. By way of example, if the departing user is the sole viewer (or, in some embodiments, the primary user, i.e. the user who initiated the current viewing session) the event processing may be adapted to issue a &#x201c;pause&#x201d; command to the source of the current media stream. Other actions may include without limitation activating the recording function of a DVR, logging off a Web site, etc., as appropriate for a particular embodiment and configuration. If such an action is to be taken, at step <b>520</b> in the illustrative embodiment the event processing may cause display of a request for confirmation on TV screen <b>322</b>, e.g. &#x201c;Would you like to pause this show? (Y/N).&#x201d; If confirmed by the user at step <b>522</b>, which confirmation may take the form of a gesture, spoken command, remote control input, etc., or, in those embodiments where the default is to take action, a timeout, at step <b>528</b> the indicated action may be executed. In this context it will be appreciated that in embodiments where voice or gesture responses are expected, the performance accuracy of audio and/or visual event detection modules <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> may be improved by indicating a range of possible responses (e.g., &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no&#x201d; in this instance) to these modules in advance, thereby limiting the number of sound or gesture templates which need to be matched. Also, in some embodiments where voice input may be utilized, the sound level of TV audio output <b>320</b> may be temporarily lowered to reduce background noise. Thereafter, at step <b>530</b> data regarding the change in user, including user identity where this is determinable, for example via use of techniques such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,551,756, 7,702,599, or the like, may be conveyed to statistic gathering module <b>438</b> for logging, after which processing is complete.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the detected image change event is not a user departure, at step <b>524</b> the event processor may next determine if the reported event comprises the arrival of a new or additional user in the TV viewing environment and if so take appropriate action. By way of example, some embodiments may be adapted to allow a viewer to invoke a &#x201c;private viewing&#x201d; status which may cause the current content to be automatically muted, paused, switched, etc. in the event an additional user enters the viewing environment. In such embodiments, at step <b>526</b> it may be determined if such a status currently exists. If so at step <b>528</b> the appropriate action may be executed, after which data regarding the user arrival, including user identity where this is determinable, may be conveyed to statistic gathering module <b>438</b> for logging, and event processing is complete. By way of further example without limitation, re-entry of a user into a viewing environment may trigger an offer to resume playback of previously paused content; or in a multi-room, multi-device household in which appliances are networked together and equipped with viewer recognition, the entry of a user into one viewing environment may cause the event processor in that environment to query other event processors and/or statistic modules elsewhere in the household to determine if that user has recently departed another environment, and if so, offer to resume playback of a content stream which was previously paused in that other environment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the detected image change event is not a user arrival or departure, at steps <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> it may next be determined if the reported event comprises a detectable gesture, a detectable gesture in this context comprising a user action or motion which either by pre-programming or a learning process has been identified to visual event detection module <b>432</b> as having significance as user input. If the reported event is determined to be associated with an operational command function, for example &#x201c;pause&#x201d;, &#x201c;mute&#x201d;, &#x201c;channel up&#x201d;, etc., processing may continue at step <b>540</b> to execute the command as described previously. If the reported event is determined to be a preparatory gesture, appropriate anticipatory action may be taken at step <b>538</b>. In this context, a preparatory gesture may comprise without limitation any preliminary motion or gesture by a user which may be interpreted as a possible indication of that user's intent to perform an action, for example standing up, reaching for or setting down a remote control device, beckoning an out of sight person to enter the room, picking up a phone, etc. Anticipatory actions may include for example pre-conditioning visual and/or audio detection modules <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> to favor certain subsets of templates for matching purposes; modifying an on-screen menu from a format optimized for gesture control to one optimized for navigation via a keyboarded device such as a remote control, or vice-versa; reducing or muting audio volume; signaling a remote control device exit a quiescent state, to turn on or shut off its backlight, or the like; etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">If the reported event is not an image change event, at step <b>506</b> the event processing may next determine if the reported event constitutes a sound recognition event reported by audio event detection module <b>434</b>. Speech or sound recognition by module <b>434</b> may utilize for example the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,603,276, WIPO (PCT) patent application publication WO2002/054382A1, or the like. If the event is a sound recognition event, at step <b>512</b> it may be determined if the decoded sound constitutes a voice command issued by a user. If so processing may continue at step <b>540</b> to execute the desired command as described previously. If not a voice command, at step <b>514</b> it may be determined if the reported event constitutes a trigger sound. In this context a trigger sound may be an instance of a non-vocal audio signal received via microphone <b>120</b> which either by pre-programming or via a learning process has been assigned a command or an anticipatory action. By way of example without limitation, trigger sounds may include a phone or doorbell ringing, a baby monitor, smoke alarm, microwave chime, etc. If the reported sound event is a trigger sound, the appropriate action, such as muting the television, etc., may be taken at step <b>516</b>. The system can be also be programmed to recognize various sounds and or spoken words/phrases as being indicative of a preparatory event whereupon one or more of the system components will be readied via an anticipatory action as described above. By way of example, a spoken phrase such as &#x201c;let's see what else is on&#x201d; may be recognized as a preparatory event whereupon an anticipatory action may be executed to place a remote control device into a state wherein the remote control device is readied to receive input in anticipation of its use or a spoken phrase such as &#x201c;come here,&#x201d; the sound of a door bell, or the like may be recognized as a preparatory event whereupon an anticipatory action may be executed to ready the system to look for an anticipated event, e.g., a specific gesture, such as a user standing up, leaving the viewing area, etc. whereupon the appropriate response action to the sensed event that was anticipated, e.g., pausing the media, may be performed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the event that an anticipated event is not performed within a predetermined period of time, the system may execute, as needed, further actions, such as restorative action, to place the system into a state as desired, e.g., to return one or more components of the home entertainment system to a state where the component(s) is no longer looking for the occurrence of the anticipation event.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the reported event is not a sound recognition event, at step <b>508</b> the event processing may next determine if the reported event comprises a wireless device such as for example a smart phone, tablet computer, game controller, etc., joining into or dropping from a LAN or PAN associated with smart TV <b>200</b> or other appliance in the system. If such devices have been previously registered with the TV programming, such activity may be used to infer the presence or absence of particular users. Such information may then be processed in a similar manner to user image detection (e.g., processed as a user being added or departing) continuing at step <b>518</b> as previously described.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Finally, at step <b>510</b> the event processor may process any other event report activity as consistent with a particular embodiment. For example, in some embodiments users may be provisioned with personal remote control devices which embed user identification data in their command transmissions, such as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/225,635 &#x201c;Controlling Devices Used to Provide an Adaptive User Interface,&#x201d; of common ownership and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, in which case user presence reporting events may be generated by remote control interface <b>420</b>. In other embodiments technologies such as infrared body heat sensing such as proposed in the art for use in automatic unattended power-off applications may be further adapted for the purposes described herein. Additional sources of activity events may also include data received from other household equipment such as security, lighting, or HVAC control systems equipped with occupancy sensors; entryway cameras; driveway sensors, etc., where appropriate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Statistic gathering module <b>438</b> may be adapted to report the data conveyed to it during the event processing steps described above to a centralized service, e.g., hosted on Internet connected server device <b>128</b>, for aggregation and analysis of user viewing habits and preferences. Depending on the particular embodiment such reporting may be performed on an event-by-event basis, or alternatively the data may be accumulated and reported at predetermined time intervals or only upon receipt of a request from the server device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By way of example, in an illustrative embodiment data reported to statistic gathering module <b>438</b> may be formatted into several different event record classes and types for uploading to server device <b>128</b>. Exemplary record classes may comprise user events, e.g., as may be reported at step <b>530</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; appliance events, e.g., as may be reported at step <b>548</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; and content events, e.g., as may be reported at step <b>544</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As will be appreciated, different or additional event classes may be appropriate in alternate embodiments and accordingly the above classifications are presented by way of example only and without limitation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to Table 1 below, user event record types may include addition (i.e., arrival) of user to the viewing area and deletion (i.e., departure) of a user from the viewing area. As illustrated, each of these record types may include timestamp data and a user ID. The timestamp illustrated is suitable for use in applications where the server device is already aware of the geographical location of the reporting system, e.g., as a result of an initial setup procedure, by URL decoding, etc. In embodiments where this is not the case, the timestamp field may include additional data such as a time zone, zip code, etc., where required. User identity may be any item of data which serves to uniquely identify individual users to facilitate viewing habit and preference analysis at server <b>128</b>. By way of example, user ID data may comprise identities explicitly assigned during a setup/configuration process; random numbers assigned by the system as each distinct user is initially detected; a hash value generated by a facial or voice recognition algorithm; a MAC address or serial number assigned to a smart phone or tablet computer; etc. as appropriate for a particular embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>User event record</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Event type</entry><entry>Time stamp</entry><entry>User ID</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>User:add</entry><entry>yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss</entry><entry>xxxxxxxx</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>User:delete</entry><entry>yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss</entry><entry>xxxxxxxx</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Referring now to Table 2, appliance event records may comprise record types indicative of events reported to, functional commands issued to, and/or operations performed by various controlled appliances, e.g., as reported at step <b>548</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.
