Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material onto which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself can be patterned. Materials added on top of the substrate can be patterned or can remain unpatterned. Furthermore, the substrate can include a wide array of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, etc. Alternatively, the substrate can be made from an electrically non-conductive material, such as a glass, a plastic, or a sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure, or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layer thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers.

The range of values can be due to slight variations in manufacturing processes or tolerances. As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; indicates the value of a given quantity that can vary based on a particular technology node associated with the subject semiconductor device. Based on the particular technology node, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within, for example, 10-30% of the value (e.g., &#xb1;10%, &#xb1;20%, or &#xb1;30% of the value).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, the term &#x201c;3D memory device&#x201d; refers to a semiconductor device with vertically-oriented strings of memory cell transistors (i.e., region herein as &#x201c;memory strings,&#x201d; such as NAND strings) on a laterally-oriented substrate so that the memory strings extend in the vertical direction with respect to the substrate. As used herein, the term &#x201c;vertical/vertically&#x201d; means nominally perpendicular to a lateral surface of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Various embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure provide a 3D memory device with through array contact (TAC) structures for a memory array (also referred to herein as an &#x201c;array device&#x201d;). The TAC structures allow contacts between the memory and various peripheral circuits and/or peripheral devices (e.g., page buffers, latches, decoders, etc.) to be fabricated in a limited number of steps (e.g., in a single step or in two steps), thereby reducing the process complexity and manufacturing cost. The disclosed TACs are formed through a stack of alternating dielectric layers, which can be more easily etched to form through holes therein compared with a stack of alternating conductor and dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The TACs can provide vertical interconnects between the stacked array device and peripheral device (e.g., for power bus and metal routing), thereby reducing metal levels and shrinking die size. In some embodiments, the TACs can be interconnected with various lines in a top conductor layer and/or a bottom conductor layer, which are suitable for those 3D memory architectures in which the array device and the peripheral device formed on different substrates are formed sequentially or joined by hybrid bonding in a face-to-face manner. In some embodiments, the TACs in the through array contact structures disclosed herein are formed through a stack of alternating dielectric layers, which can be more easily etched to form through holes therein compared with a stack of alternating conductor and dielectric layers, thereby reducing the process complexity and manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an exemplary 3D memory device <b>100</b> in the plan view, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> can include a plurality of channel structure regions (e.g., memory planes, memory blocks, memory fingers, etc., which are described in detail in connection with various figures below), while one or more TAC structures can be formed between two neighboring channel structure regions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> can include four or more memory planes <b>110</b>, each of which can include a plurality of memory blocks <b>115</b>.
