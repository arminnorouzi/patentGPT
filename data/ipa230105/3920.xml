AR coating), a method of using them together, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among them, in the case of AG coating, although the absolute amount of reflected light is equivalent to that of common hard coatings, a low reflection effect can be obtained by reducing the amount of light entering the eyes using light scattering through unevenness. However, since the AG coating has lowered screen sharpness due to the surface unevenness, recently, many studies are being conducted on AR coating.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As films using the AR coating, those having a multi-layered structure in which a hard coating layer (high refractive index layer), a low reflective coating layer, etc. are stacked on a substrate film are being commercialized. However, since the method of forming multiple layers conducts individual processes for forming each layer, it has a disadvantage in terms of lowered scratch resistance due to weak interlayer adhesion (interface adhesion).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, previously, in order to improve scratch resistance of the low refractive index layer included in the anti-reflective film, a method of adding various particles of a nanometer size (for example, silica, alumina, zeolite, etc.) was mainly attempted. However, when nanometer-sized particles are used, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to simultaneously increase scratch resistance while lowering the reflectance of the low refractive index layer, and due to the nanometer-sized particles, the anti-fouling property of the surface of the low refractive index layer is significantly deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in order to reduce the absolute reflection amount of incident light from the outside and improve the anti-fouling property as well as scratch resistance of the surface, many studies are being conducted, but the property improvement degree resulting therefrom is unsatisfactory.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides an anti-reflective film that can simultaneously realize high scratch resistance and anti-fouling properties while having high light transmittance, and that has colorless and transparent properties while realizing low reflectance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure also provides a polarizing plate including the anti-reflective film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure further provides a display device including the anti-reflective film.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure further provides an organic light emitting diode display device including the anti-reflective film.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an anti-reflective film comprising: a hard coating layer; and a low refractive index layer, wherein a particle-mixed layer containing both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles and having a thickness of 1.5 nm to 22 nm exists in the low refractive index layer, and wherein the anti-reflective film has a ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm of 1.3 to 2.7.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a polarizing plate comprising the above-mentioned anti-reflective film and a polarizer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a display device comprising the above-mentioned anti-reflective film.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an organic light emitting diode display device comprising the above-mentioned anti-reflective film.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Now, an anti-reflective film, a polarizing plate, a display device, and an organic light emitting diode display device according to specific embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present specification, a photopolymerizable compound collectively refers to a compound that causes a polymerization reaction if light, for example visible rays or ultraviolet rays, is irradiated thereto.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, a fluorine-containing compound refers to a compound containing at least one fluorine element in the compound.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the &#x201c;(meth)acryl&#x201d; means including both acryl and methacryl.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The &#x201c;(co)polymer&#x201d; means including both copolymer and homopolymer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, silica hollow particles are silica particles derived from a silicon compound or an organosilicon compound, wherein an empty space exists on the surface and/or inside of the silica particles.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the low refractive index layer may refer to a layer having a low refractive index as compared with another layer in the anti-reflective film, for example, a hard coating layer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the low refractive index layer may have a refractive index of 1.65 or less, or 1.60 or less, or 1.57 or less, or 1.55 or less, or 1.53 or less at a wavelength of 550 nm.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, an anti-reflective film is provided, including: a hard coating layer; and a low refractive index layer, wherein a particle-mixed layer containing both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles and having a thickness of 1.5 nm to 22 nm exists in the low refractive index layer, and wherein the anti-reflective film has a ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm of 1.3 to 2.7.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the anti-reflective film including the low refractive index layer and the hard coating layer has a low refractive index, for example, a reflectance of 1.5% or less at a wavelength of 550 nm, the reflectance in a blue region is higher than the reflectance in a green region. As a result, the anti-reflective layer may have a blue color and thus have an opacity or color property to the extent that it is not suitable for application to a polarizing plate or a display device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, the present inventors conducted studies on an anti-reflective film, confirmed through experiments that if a particle-mixed layer containing both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles and having a predetermined thickness in the low-refractive layer is included in the anti-reflective film, the bluishness can be significantly reduced while realizing low reflectance, and the colorless and transparent properties can be realized, thereby completing the present disclosure. In addition, the anti-reflective film can have a high light transmittance together with the above-described characteristics, and also can simultaneously high scratch resistance and anti-fouling properties.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, due to the existence of the particle-mixed layer, the anti-reflective film can have colorless and transparent properties while realizing a low reflectance. As the low refractive index layer includes hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles, it is possible to simultaneously realize high scratch resistance and anti-fouling properties while having high light transmittance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, the anti-reflective film may have a characteristic that the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm is 1.3 to 2.7, or 1.5 to 2.5.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the anti-reflective film satisfies a characteristic that the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm is 1.3 to 2.7, or 1.5 to 2.5, or 1.40 to 2.30, the anti-reflective film can have optical characteristics that the reflectance in a blue region is lower than the reflectance in a green region, thereby capable of having colorless and transparent properties while realizing a low reflectance.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm that the anti-reflective film has exceeds 2.7, the anti-reflective film may have a blue color, and thus may have an opacity or color property to the extent that it is not suitable for application to a polarizing plate or a display device. In particular, in the case of an anti-reflective film in which the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm exceeds 2.7, the color reproduction capability of the organic light emitting diode display device may be deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a range where the anti-reflective film satisfies the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm of 1.3 to 2.7, the reflectance of the anti-reflective film at a wavelength of 550 nm may be more than 0.5% and 1.5% or less, or 0.55% to 1.35%, or 0.59 to 1.32%, and the reflectance of the anti-reflective film at a wavelength of 400 nm may be 1.0% to 3.50%, or 1.20% to 2.60%.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, the anti-reflective film includes the particle-mixed layer having a predetermined thickness in the low refractive index layer, and thus the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm that the anti-reflective film has may be 1.3 to 2.7, or 1.5 to 2.5. Thereby, the anti-reflective film can have a characteristic that the absolute value of b* in a CIE Lab color space is 4 or less, or 3 or less, or 2 or less, or 1.5 or less.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">More specifically, the anti-reflective film includes the particle-mixed layer in the low refractive index layer, and thus the absolute value of b* in the CIE Lab color space is 4 or less, or 3 or less, or 2 or less, or 1.5 or less.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each numerical value in the CIE Lab color space can be measured by applying a general method of measuring each coordinate of the color space, and for example, can be measured according to a manufacturer's manual after positioning an equipment with an integrating sphere type detector (spectrophotometer) (ex. CM-2600d, KONICA MINOLTA) at a measuring position. In one example, each coordinate of the CIE Lab color space may also be measured under a state where the polarizer or polarizing plate is attached to a liquid crystal panel, for example, a highly reflective liquid crystal panel, or may also be measured for the polarizer or polarizing plate itself.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The CIE Lab color space is a color space in which the CIE XYZ color space is nonlinearly transformed based on human visual antagonistic theory. In this color space, the L value represents brightness, where if the L* value is 0, it represents black, and if the L* value is 100, it represents white. Also, if the a* value is a negative number, the color becomes a color slated to green and if it is a positive number, the color becomes a color slanted to red or violet. Furthermore, if the b* value is a negative number, the color becomes a color slanted to blue and if the b* value is a positive number, the color becomes a color slanted to yellow.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">That is, as the anti-reflective film has a characteristic that the absolute value of b* value in the CIE Lab color space is 4 or less, or 3 or less, or 2 or less, or 1.5 or less, it can realize low reflectance and significantly reduce the degree of red or blue color while realizing low reflectance, thereby having a colorless and transparent property.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">More specifically, the reflectance of the anti-reflection film at a wavelength of 550 nm may be more than 0.5% and 1.5% or less, or 0.55% to 1.35%, or 0.59 to 1.32%, it can have a characteristic that the absolute value of the b* value in the CIE Lab color space is 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less, or 1.5 or less, even while realizing such a low reflectance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this manner, as the absolute value of the b* value in the CIE Lab color space is maintained at a low level while realizing a low reflectance, the anti-reflective film can be easily applied to a display having a high contrast ratio and brightness, and can realize high performance with high color reproduction rate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to have the above-mentioned characteristics of the anti-reflective film, a particle-mixed layer containing both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles and having a thickness of 1.5 nm to 22 nm, or 2.0 nm to 20 nm, or 2.2 nm to 18.5 nm may exist in the low refractive index layer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the thickness of the particle-mixed layer is too small, canceling interference does not sufficiently occur in the anti-reflective layer, and the absolute value of the b* value may exceed 4.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, even when the thickness of the particle-mixed layer is too thick, the absolute value of the b* value in the CIE Lab color space that the anti-reflective film has may exceed 4, and thus the optical properties such as transparency of the anti-reflective film may be deteriorated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Meanwhile, as described above, the particle-mixed layer includes both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles, and the volume ratio or distribution aspects thereof is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The refractive index or thickness of the particle-mixed layer can be confirmed through various optical measurement methods, and for example, it can also be confirmed by using a method of fitting a polarization ellipticity measured by an ellipsometry method to a diffusion layer model.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The polarization ellipticity and related ellipsometry data (&#x3c8;, &#x3bb;) measured by the ellipsometry method can be measured using commonly known methods and apparatuses. For example, ellipsometry measurements can be performed for the particle-mixed layer or other regions included in the low refractive index layer at an incident angle of 70&#xb0; in a wavelength range of 380 nm to 1000 nm using a J. A. Woollam Co. M-2000 apparatus.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The measured ellipsometry data (&#x3c8;, &#x3bb;) can be fitted to a diffuse layer model for the mixed layer and to a Cauchy model of Equation 1 for the lower layer and upper layer of the mixed-layer using Complete EASE software, so that MSE becomes 5 or less.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For the particle-mixed layer including both the hollow inorganic nanoparticles and the solid inorganic nanoparticles, the thickness and the like may not be defined by fitting the measured ellipsometry data to the Cauchy model of Equation 1.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the range of the thickness and refractive index of the particle-mixed layer included in the low refractive index layer satisfies the above range, it can alleviate the abrupt difference in refractive index between each layer, whereby the anti-reflective film can maintain the absolute value of the b* value in the CIE Lab color space at a low level while realizing a low reflectance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Meanwhile, by adjusting the composition of the binder resin included in the low refractive index layer, the type or content of particles, the specific process (for example, coating speed, coating method or drying conditions, etc.) in forming the low refractive index layer, the characteristics of the hard coating layer, and the like, it is possible to form a particle-mixed layer in the low refractive index layer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Such an example is merely an example of a method or means for forming the particle-mixed layer, and even if the above methods and means are to be used simultaneously, the particle-mixed layer is not formed in the low refractive index layer. These can be adjusted according to the detailed materials for forming the low refractive index layer and the content thereof, the thickness of the low refractive index layer, the detailed materials of the hard coating layer and the content thereof, the surface characteristics and thickness of the hard coating layer, and the like. That is, the existence of the particle-mixed layer in the low refractive index layer and the effect resulting therefrom can be realized based on the description or examples of the specification.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the hard coating layer contained in the anti-reflective film can include a binder resin including a photocurable resin and organic or inorganic fine particles dispersed in the binder resin. When a low refractive index layer including a binder resin, hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles is formed on the hard coating layer through predetermined conditions, the particle-mixed layer may exist.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the hard coating layer included in the anti-reflective film may have a surface energy of more than 34 mN/m, or more than 34 mN/m and 60 mN/m or less, 34.2 mN/m or more and 59 mN/m or less, or 34.5 mN/m or more and 58 mN/m or less, or between 35 mN/m and 55 mN/m. When a low refractive index layer including a binder resin, hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles is formed on the hard coating layer having a surface energy in such numerical range, the above-mentioned mixed-particle layer may be formed in the process of fitting the surface energy in the low refractive index layer due to the high surface energy of the interface.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The surface energy of the hard coating layer can be obtained by adjusting the surface properties of the hard coating layer.

id="p-0242" num="0227">As shown in Table 3, it was confirmed that the anti-refractive films of Examples, in which a particle-mixed layer containing both hollow inorganic nanoparticles and solid inorganic nanoparticles and having a thickness of 1.5 nm to 22 nm exists in the low refractive index layer, realize a reflectance of 1.5% or less at a wavelength of 550 nm, and also the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm is 1.3 to 2.7.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0228">Further, from the results of Table 3, it was confirmed that the anti-reflective films of Examples are phase-separated so as to divide the regions in which the hollow inorganic nanoparticles and the solid inorganic nanoparticles are mainly distributed while including the mixed layer in the low refractive index layer, and thus the anti-reflective films realizes high scratch resistance and excellent anti-fouling properties, and at the same time, the absolute value of b* in the CIE Lab color space has a low color value of 4 or less, which can have colorless and transparent properties.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0229">On the contrary, as shown in Table 4, in the anti-reflective films of Comparative Examples, it appears that regions where the hollow inorganic nanoparticles and the solid inorganic nanoparticles are mainly distributed are divided, and thus not unevenly distributed (phase separated), confirming that scratch resistance or anti-fouling properties are not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0230">In addition, from the results of Table 4, it appears that a particle-mixed layer having a thickness of more than 22 nm exists in the low refractive index layer of the anti-reflective films of Comparative Examples, or the particle-mixed layer is located excessively close to or too far from the hard coating layer, and it was confirmed that in the anti-reflective films of these Comparative Examples, the ratio of the reflectance at a wavelength of 400 nm to the reflectance at a wavelength of 550 nm exceeds 2.7, the films show a blue color and have an opacity or color property to a degree that is not suitable for application to a polarizing plate or a display device.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001"
