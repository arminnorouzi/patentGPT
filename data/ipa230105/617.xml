According to the intraocular lens that collects the incident light to a single focal point, an object can be easily seen at high resolution, compared to an intraocular lens that collects the incident light that is incident on a lens part, to multiple focal points.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, a technique that realizes an appropriate resolution even in a case in which defocus is caused to some extent has been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-121433 discloses an intraocular lens that expands the depth of focus (focal depth) by forming at least one surface of the lens part to be non-spherical shape, so that the deterioration of the resolution is suppressed even in the defocus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first aspect to be solved by the present disclosure is now described. It has been found based on various simulation and examination that a large amount of light is not recognized by a wearer, among the light passing through the lens part to the retina in a case in which a method for expanding the depth of focus of the intraocular lens is inappropriate. In a case in which a large amount of light is not recognized by a wearer, a superior field of vision (visual field) is hardly obtained. Thus, it is desired to expand the depth of focus of the intraocular lens using an appropriate method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The second aspect to be solved by the present disclosure is now described. It has been found based on various simulation and examination that a superior field of vision is hardly obtained in a case in which a method for expanding the depth of focus of the intraocular lens is inappropriate. For example, a method may be considered that adds different refractive powers to a peripheral portion and a center portion of the lens part so as to expand the depth of focus. However, a radius of a pupil of a human being varies in a range of approximately 1-8 mm. In the method that adds different refractive powers to the peripheral portion and the center portion of the lens part, when the pupil of a wearer becomes small, a rate of light passing through the peripheral portion of the lens part to the retina becomes small, compared to a case in which the pupil is large. Accordingly, when the pupil becomes small, a superior field of vision corresponding to the refractive power in the peripheral portion of the lens part is hardly obtained.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the broad principles derived herein provide an intraocular lens that decreases an amount of light, which is not recognized by a wearer, among the light passing through the lens part and that appropriately expands the depth of focus.

The regions include the first region, the second region and the outer region. The first region is a circular region located at the centermost position. The first refractive power is uniformly added to the first region regardless of the distance from the axis. The second region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the first region at an outer side of the first region. The refractive power that is increased or decreased from the first refractive power as the distance from the axis becomes larger, is added to the second region. The outer region is a ring-like region located at an outer side of the second region. The reference refractive power for focusing on a far point is added to the outer region. The MTF curve at spatial frequency of 50 lp/mm relating to light passing through a region having a radius of 1.5 mm around the axis of the lens part has one maximal value and no minimal value in a range of a defocusing value of &#x2212;0.5 D to 0.5 D, as the position of which the MTF becomes the maximum is defined as a reference (0 D).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, it may be designed that the refractive power becomes strong as being closer to the axis in the center portion of the lens part so as to expand the depth of focus of the intraocular lens. However, in such a case, an amount of light that passes through a portion of which the refractive power becomes the maximum (a portion around the axis) is extremely small. Accordingly, a wearer cannot recognize the light passing through the portion around the axis and thus cannot recognize the field of vision corresponding to the maximum refractive power. Such a problem may also cause in a design in which the refractive power becomes small as being closer to the axis in the center portion of the lens part. In such designs, the light passing through the portion around the axis is not recognized by a wearer and thus loss of light might cause.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, the intraocular lens exemplarily described in the present disclosure has the first region, the second region and the outer region and fulfills the requirement for intraocular lenses that collects much incident light that is incident on the lens part, in the vicinity of a specified focal point (in the following embodiments, a single focal point), so that the depth of focus of the intraocular lens is expanded. The requirement for intraocular lenses is that the MTF curve at spatial frequency of 50 lp/mm has one maximal value and no minimal value in a range of a defocusing value of &#x2212;0.5 D to 0.5 D, as the position of which the MTF becomes the maximum is defined as a reference (0 D). Here, the first refractive power is uniformly added to the first region located at the centermost position, regardless of the distance from the axis. Thus, a wearer can appropriately recognize a field of vision corresponding to the first refractive power, compared to a configuration in which the refractive power is changed (namely, decreased or increased) at a position slightly apart from the axis O. Accordingly, an amount of light that is not recognized by a wearer is decreased, so that a superior field of vision can be easily obtained. Further, a wearer can also obtain the field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power closer to the first refractive power, using the light passing through the second region. Consequently, according to the technique of the present disclosure, the depth of focus can be appropriately expanded while decreasing an amount of the light that is not recognized by a wearer, among the light passing through the lens part.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The range of the defocusing value in which the above-describe MTF curve has one maximal value and no minimal value, may be changed. For example, the MTF curve may have one maximal value and no minimal value in a range of the defocusing value of &#x2212;1.0 D to 0.5 D. Or alternatively, the MTF curve may have one maximal value and no minimal value in a range of the defocusing value of &#x2212;1.5 D to 0.5 D. In these cases, the intraocular lens can be realized that the field of vision is hardly deteriorated even in a case in which defocus is largely caused.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The description of &#x201c;the refractive power is uniformly added to a region regardless of the distance from the axis&#x201d; used in the present disclosure is not limited to a configuration in which the refractive power is strictly uniform within the region. That is, the scope of the invention of the present disclosure also encompasses a configuration in which the refractive power slightly varies within the region in order for correction of the aberration or the like. For example, a change rate of the refractive power within the region (for example, a ratio of the maximum value to the minimum value of the refractive power within the region) may be within a range of &#xb1;15%, preferably a range of &#xb1;10%. Further, the reference refractive power added to the outer region may vary to some extent within the outer region in order for the correction of the aberration or the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A change rate of the area of the second region relative to the area of the first region may be set within a range of &#xb1;50%.

In this case, the area of each of the first region and the second region is sufficiently secured.

That is, the depth of focus of the intraocular lens is further preferably deepened (expanded).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first refractive power added to the first region may be a strong refractive power stronger than the reference refractive power. In the second region, the refractive power may be decreased from the strong refractive power in the first region as the distance from the axis becomes larger. In the intraocular lens, the aberration is hardly caused in the vicinity of the axis, compared to the peripheral portion of the lens part. As the refractive power is stronger, the aberration or the like largely affects the field of vision of a wearer. Thus, by adding the strong refractive power stronger than the reference refractive power to the first region that is a central region in which the aberration is hardly caused, the influence of the aberration or the like to the field of vision of a wearer can be decreased, compared to a configuration in which the reference refractive power is added to the first region.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The regions in the lens part may further include a third region, a fourth region, a fifth region and a sixth region. The third region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the second region at an outer side of the second region. The reference refractive power is added to the third region. The fourth region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the third region at an outer side of the third region. The fifth region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the fourth region at an outer side of the fourth region. The strong refractive power is added to the fifth region. The sixth region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the fifth region at an outer side of the fifth region and located adjacent to the outer region at an inner side of the outer region. In the fourth region, the refractive power is increased from the reference refractive power in the third region to the strong refractive power in the fifth region as the distance from the axis becomes larger. In the sixth region, the refractive power is decreased from the strong refractive power in the fifth region to the reference refractive power in the outer region as the distance from the axis becomes larger.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this case, the strong refractive power region (the first region), the transition region (the second region), the reference refractive power region (the third region), the transition region (the fourth region), the strong refractive power region (the fifth region), the transition region (the sixth region), and the reference refractive power region (the outer region) are arranged in this order from the inner side toward the outer side. That is, two strong refractive power regions are arranged inside the ring-like outer region, and the reference refractive power region is arranged between the two strong refractive power regions. Thus, even when the pupil of a wearer is not largely expanded (namely, the pupil is smaller than the outer region), the light to the retina easily and appropriately passes through each of the strong refractive power region, the reference refractive power region, and the transition region. As a result, an appropriate field of vision can be further easily obtained regardless of the change of the size of the pupil of a wearer. Further, an increase of the aberration caused by increasing the number of regions can be suppressed, compared to a configuration having seven or more regions inside the outer region. The strong refractive power in the first region need not necessarily be strictly identical to the strong refractive power in the fifth region, which will be described in detail later.

A first refractive power is added to the first region. The second region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the first region at an outer side of the first region. The third region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the second region at an outer side of the second region. A third refractive power that is different from the first refractive power is added to the third region. The fourth region is a ring-like region located adjacent to the third region at an outer side of the third region.

The requirement for intraocular lenses is that the MTF curve at spatial frequency of 50 lp/mm has one maximal value and no minimal value in a range of a defocusing value of &#x2212;0.5 D to 0.5 D, as the position of which the MTF becomes the maximum is defined as a reference (0 D). Here, the first refractive power added to the first region is different from the third refractive power added to the third region. The refractive power in the second region varies to be opposite to the change of the refractive power in the fourth region as the distance from the axis becomes larger. Further, the first region the second region, the third region and at least a part of the fourth region are arranged within a region having a radius of 1.5 mm corresponding to a radius of the pupil of a human being in a state in which the pupil is contracted to some extent. Thus, even when the pupil of a wearer is contracted to some extent, the light to the retina passes through each of the first region to which the first refractive power is added, the third region to which the third refractive power is added, and the transition regions (the second region and the fourth region) in which the refractive power varies between the first refractive power and the third refractive power.

As a result, the area of each of the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> is sufficiently secured. In the second embodiment, the area of each of the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> is set to 0.6 mm<sup>2 </sup>or more, so that the area of each of the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> is sufficiently secured. Thus, both of the field of vision corresponding to the first refractive power and the field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power closer to the first refractive power are further appropriately and easily obtained.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The area of the each of the second region R<b>2</b> and the fourth region R<b>4</b> is equal to or larger than the area of the first region R<b>1</b>. As a result, the area of each of the second region R<b>2</b> and the fourth region R<b>4</b> in which the refractive power varies in response to the distance from the axis O is appropriately secured. Thus, the field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power closer to the first refractive power is appropriately obtained. That is, the depth of focus of the intraocular lens <b>1</b> is further appropriately expanded.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the second embodiment, the area of each of the third region R<b>3</b> and the fourth region R<b>4</b> is also set to 0.6 mm<sup>2 </sup>or more, so that the area of each of the third region R<b>3</b> and the fourth region R<b>4</b> is sufficiently secured. Thus, even when the pupil is smaller than the outer region RO, an appropriate field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power between the reference refractive power and the strong refractive power is easily obtained.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Countermeasure to Change of Size of Pupil</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The refractive power in the second region R<b>2</b> is changed as the distance from the axis O becomes larger, to be opposite to the change of the refractive power in the fourth region R<b>4</b>. Further, the first region R<b>1</b>, the second region R<b>2</b>, the third region R<b>3</b>, and at least a part of the fourth region R<b>4</b> are arranged within a region having a radius of 1.5 mm corresponding to a radius of the pupil of a human being that has been contracted to some extent. Thus, even when the pupil of a wearer is contracted to some extent, the light to the retina passes through the first region R<b>1</b> to which the first refractive power is added, the third region R<b>3</b> to which the third refractive power is added, and the transition region (the second region R<b>2</b> and the fourth region R<b>4</b>) in which the refractive power varies between the first refractive power and the third refractive power. Accordingly, an appropriate field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power between the first refractive power and the third refractive power can be easily obtained regardless of the change of the size of the pupil of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Specifically, in the second embodiment, the first refractive power that is added to the first region R<b>1</b> is the reference refractive power, and the third refractive power that is added to the third region R<b>3</b> is the strong refractive power. In this case, the number of the regions arranged inside the outer region RO is four which is as small as possible. As the number of the regions becomes smaller, an amount of the aberration is easily suppressed. Thus, by setting the number of the regions arranged inside the outer region RO to four, an appropriate field of vision can be easily obtained regardless of the size of the pupil of a wearer while restricting the aberration from causing.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the second embodiment, the first region R<b>1</b>, the second region R<b>2</b>, and a part of the third region R<b>3</b> are arranged within a region having a radius of 1.0 mm around the axis O of the lens part <b>2</b>. As described above, in a light environment, the pupil of a human being is contracted to a radius of approximately 1.0 mm or less. In a case in which the first region R<b>1</b>, the second region R<b>2</b>, and at least a part of the third region R<b>3</b> are arranged within a region having a radius of 1.0 mm around the axis O, the light to the retina passes through each of the first region R<b>1</b>, the second region R<b>2</b>, and the third region R<b>3</b> even in an extremely light environment. Thus, even when the pupil of a wearer is contracted to be extremely small, an appropriate field of vision corresponding to the range of the refractive power between the reference refractive power and the strong refractive power can be easily obtained.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The techniques disclosed in the above-described embodiments are merely examples.
