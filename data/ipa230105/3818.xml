CN 202110752976.4, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure is directed to a method for magnetic resonance imaging of an object, wherein spins of a first material of the object and spins of a second material of the object are excited, a first spin echo signal is acquired when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include a first phase difference, which is given by &#x394;, a second spin echo signal is acquired and a first image for the first material and/or a second image for the second material is generated by a computing unit depending on the first spin echo signal and the second spin echo signal. The disclosure is further directed to a corresponding magnetic resonance imaging system and a computer program product.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Different materials or molecules, in particular water molecules and fat molecules, have slightly different nuclear spin resonance frequencies. Therefore, when performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, their spins go in-phase and out-of-phase with each other over time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The time points of different material spins being in-phase or having opposed phases depend on the field strength of the MRI main magnetic field. The interval between an in-phase and an out-of-phase condition decreases linearly with increasing field strength B: &#x394;t=1/(2*B*&#x3b3;*3.4*10-6), wherein &#x3b3; denotes the gyromagnetic ratio.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A post-processing algorithm can then separate fat and water-related signals to create two images displaying fat and water fractions only, respectively. This technique is known as Dixon imaging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Depending on the details of the used acquisition sequence, a rewinding gradient may be applied to compensate for the momentum asymmetry resulting from the in-phase and out-of-phase readouts. This may be done for example when using spin echo or turbo spin echo acquisition sequences. However, such rewinding has the drawback of an increased acquisition time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the potentially asymmetric gradient activity may lead to an increased occurrence of eddy currents and/or gradient nonlinearity effects and corresponding artifacts in the reconstructed image.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an objective of the present disclosure to reduce the acquisition time and/or effects leading to artifacts in material specific spin echo based MRI. This objective is achieved by the subject matter of embodiments as discussed herein, including the claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is based on the idea to acquire two spin echo signals at respective times, where the spins of the first material and the spins of the second material include a phase difference &#x394; and &#x2212;&#x394;, respectively, wherein A is different from 0 and different from &#x3c0;. These signals are used instead of in-phase and opposed-phase signals to separate the different material influences. In this way, a more symmetric gradient activity may be achieved and/or less acquisition time is required.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the disclosure, a method for MRI of an object is provided. Therein, spins of a first material of the object and spins of a second material of the object are excited, e.g. by applying one or more excitation RF pulses to the object. A first spin echo signal is acquired when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include a first phase difference, which is given by &#x394;. A second spin echo signal is acquired when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include a second phase difference, which is given by &#x2212;&#x394;. An absolute value of &#x394; is greater than zero and smaller than &#x3c0;, in other words, it lies within the interval ]0,&#x3c0;[. A first image for the first material, e.g. a first MRI image, for example a first spatial MRI image, and/or a second image for the second material, e.g. a second MRI image, for example a second spatial MRI image, is generated by a computing unit depending on the first spin echo signal and the second spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may be based on a spin echo acquisition technique or a turbo spin echo acquisition technique.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The spins of the first and the second material can be understood as respective nuclear spins within a spatial region subject to the excitation RF pulse.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">RF pulses denote pulses of electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency (RF) range. RF pulses may therefore have frequencies, e.g. in the range from 20 kHz to 300 GHz. In the MRI context, RF frequencies in the range from 100 kHz to 1 GHz, e.g. from 1 MHz to 1 GHz, are commonly used.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The one or more excitation RF pulses correspond e.g. to 90&#xb0; pulses generated by one or more respective excitation coils to flip the spins by 90&#xb0; from the direction of a static main magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As an example, the first and the second spin echo signal are acquired during a single spin echo or turbo spin echo acquisition period. In other words, an echo time of the first spin echo signal differs from an echo time of the second spin echo signal. The echo time may for example be defined with respect to a corresponding refocusing RF pulse or 180&#xb0;-RF pulse, which is applied after the one or more excitation RF pulse are applied and before the first and the second spin echo signals are acquired. For instance, the first spin echo signal may be acquired prior to the acquisition of the second spin echo signal. In other words, the echo time of the first spin echo signal may be smaller than the echo time of the second spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The phase difference &#x394; is defined such that it is positive and smaller than &#x3c0;. However, an analogous further phase difference &#x394;&#x2032; may be considered as well, which would then be negative and greater than &#x2212;&#x3c0;. In this case, the first spin echo signal corresponds to a situation where the spins of the different materials include a further first phase difference given by &#x394;&#x2032;, and the second spin echo signal corresponds to a situation where the spins of the different materials include a further second phase difference given by &#x2212;&#x394;&#x2032;. However, this is merely a matter of definition and does not alter the inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As a consequence of excluding the boundary values of zero and &#x3c0; for the value of &#x394;, the excited spins of the first and the second material are neither exactly in-phase nor exactly in an opposed phase condition when acquiring the first and the second spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The spins of the first and second material being in-phase can be understood as the respective spins including a phase angle of 0. The spins being out-of-phase can be understood as the spins having opposite phases or including a phase angle of &#x3c0;.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, the absolute value of &#x394; lies within an even smaller range, for example with the interval [&#x3c0;/6,5&#x3c0;/6], within the interval [&#x3c0;/4,3&#x3c0;/4], etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and the second spin echo signals are acquired by applying respective read-out gradients, i.e. magnetic field gradients, and, for example, respective slice selection gradients and, e.g. respective phase gradients in respective directions and by reading out the signals of respective acquisition coils.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, magnetic field gradients can be applied in three spatial directions by means of corresponding gradient coils. Here and in the following, an axis perpendicular to the plane of the desired tomography slices is denoted as slice selection direction or, without restriction of generality, as the z-direction. A corresponding magnetic field gradient in this direction is denoted as a slice selection gradient or Gz. The slice selection gradient is, e.g., applied during the excitation of the spins by the excitation RF pulses.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A direction perpendicular to the slice selection direction, without restriction of generality the y-direction, is denoted as phase encoding direction and the respective gradient is denoted as a phase gradient or Gy. The phase gradient defines a dephasing for each respective k-space line, for example in the y-direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The direction perpendicular to the slice selection direction and to the phase selection direction is denoted as the read-out direction, without restriction of generality as x-direction. A magnetic gradient in the read-out direction is denoted as a read-out gradient or Gx.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As an example, the first material may correspond to or comprise fat molecules while the second material may correspond to or comprise water molecules.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By applying the one or more excitation RF pulses, spins of both materials are excited.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, since protons of different materials, for example of water and fat molecules, may have slightly different resonance frequencies with respect to the nuclear spin position, their spins go in-phase and out-of-phase with each other as a function of time.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Acquiring the spin echo signals comprises e.g. recording the respective signal intensities in k-space, also denoted as momentum space, or over time, respectively, by means of respective read-out coils.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method according to the disclosure has the advantage that the echo times of the first and the second spin echo signals are symmetrically shifted with respect to an in-phase time instance, which corresponds to a situation where the spins of the first and the second material are in-phase or, in other words, include a phase difference of zero. Consequently, the gradient activity during the acquisition is more symmetric as in known methods, which reduces eddy currents and effects due to gradient nonlinearity. Rewinding gradients for compensating the momentum asymmetry may be omitted, which leads to a reduced acquisition time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to several implementations of the method, a first read-out gradient lobe, which is centered at a first read-out center time, is applied to acquire the first spin echo signal and a second read-out gradient lobe, which is centered at a second read-out center time, is applied to acquire the second spin echo signal. The first read-out center time precedes the in-phase time, wherein the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material are in phase at the in-phase time. The second read-out center time succeeds the in-phase time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Therein, the time difference between the latest refocusing RF pulse and the first read-out center time corresponds to the first echo time of the first spin echo signal. The time difference between the latest refocusing RF pulse and the second read-out center time corresponds to the second echo time of the second spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As an example, the time difference between the in-phase time and the first read-out center time is equal to the time difference between the second read-out center time and the in-phase time and defines the absolute value of &#x394;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here and in the following, applying a gradient lobe can be considered to comprise switching on a magnetic field gradient over a respective time period without a change in polarity of the gradient.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As an example, the first read-out gradient lobe and the second read-out gradient lobe are applied in read-out direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to several implementations, the first read-out gradient lobe and the second read-out gradient lobe have opposite polarities.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to several implementations, a refocusing RF pulse is applied before acquiring the first spin echo signal and second spin echo signal and, e.g., after applying the at least one excitation RF pulse.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other words, the refocusing RF pulse is applied before the first read-out gradient lobe and before the first read-out gradient lobe are applied.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, there may be no further excitation RF pulse nor is there a further refocusing RF pulse being applied between the first read-out gradient lobe and the second read-out gradient lobe. Such a sequence may be considered as a fast Dixon acquisition scheme. For instance, the echo signals are centered around zero transitions of the momentum in read-out direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to several implementations, a pre-phasing gradient lobe is applied, e.g. after the at least one excitation RF pulse.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The pre-phasing gradient lobe may, e.g., be applied in read-out-direction. It may be used to adjust the sampling position in k-space by causing a respective momentum change. A momentum change due to a gradient lobe is proportional to a time integral over the respective magnetic field gradient during the time period of the lobe. Therefore, the amplitude and the duration of the respective gradient lobes uniquely define the respective momentum changes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to several implementations, the pre-phasing gradient lobe is applied prior to the refocusing RF pulse. The pre-phasing gradient lobe and the read-out gradient lobe may have the same polarity.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to several implementations, the pre-phasing gradient lobe is applied after the refocusing RF pulse and before acquiring the first spin echo signal and before acquiring the second spin echo signal. The pre-phasing gradient lobe and the read-out gradient lobe may have different polarities.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this way, the time between the pre-phasing gradient lobe and the first and the second spin echo signals is reduced. Consequently, artifacts due to dynamic effects in the object, such as pulsating cerebrospinal fluid, may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to several implementations, a third spin echo signal is acquired when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include the second phase difference. A fourth spin echo signal is acquired when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include the first phase difference, e.g. after acquiring the third spin echo signal. The first image and/or the second image is generated by the computing unit depending on the first spin echo signal, the second spin echo signal, the third spin echo signal, and the fourth spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As one example, a further refocusing RF pulse is applied after acquiring the first and the second spin echo signal and prior to acquiring the third and the fourth spin echo signal. For example, in case the pre-phasing gradient lobe is applied after the refocusing RF pulse, a time delay corresponding to a duration of the pre-phasing gradient lobe may be present between applying the further refocusing RF pulse and before acquiring the third and the fourth spin echo signal. In this case, it may be ensured that the echo times of the first and the third spin echo signal are equal and the echo times of the second and the third spin echo signals are equal.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By taking into account the first, the second, the third, and the fourth spin echo signals for image reconstruction, an improved image quality may be achieved. For instance, the individual spin echo signals may be combined, averaged, weighted, etc. for the image reconstruction. Also phase corrections, for example similar as in turbo gradient spin echo, TGSE, acquisitions, may be implemented in the image reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Apart from the first, the second, the third, and the fourth spin echo signals, further echo sequences may be carried out and processed to obtain the first and/or the second image.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to several implementations, a third read-out gradient lobe, which is centered at a third read-out center time, is applied to acquire the third spin echo signal. A fourth read-out gradient lobe, which is centered at a fourth read-out center time, is applied to acquire the fourth spin echo signal. The third read-out center time precedes a further in-phase time, wherein the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material are in phase at the further in-phase time. The fourth read-out center time succeeds the further in-phase time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Therein, the time difference between the further refocusing RF pulse and the third read-out center time corresponds to the third echo time of the third spin echo signal. The time difference between the further refocusing RF pulse and the fourth read-out center time corresponds to the fourth echo time of the fourth spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For instance, the time difference between the further in-phase time and the third read-out center time is equal to the time difference between the fourth read-out center time and the further in-phase time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the third read-out gradient lobe and the fourth read-out gradient lobe are applied in read-out direction and/or have opposite polarities. For instance, the first read-out gradient lobe and the third read-out gradient lobe have opposite polarities. As one example, the second read-out gradient lobe and the fourth read-out gradient lobe have opposite polarities. In other words, the first and the fourth read-out gradient lobes have the same polarity and the second and the third read-out gradient lobes have the same polarity.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spin echo signals with the same echo time, also denoted as dephasing time, namely the first and the third spin echo signal as well as the second and the fourth spin echo signal, may therefore be acquired with opposite read-out polarities. The resulting phase differences may be addressed for reconstructing the first and/or second image.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">To this end, spin echo signals with the same echo time but different readout polarity may be considered within a common k-space and to a same k-space and respective phase corrections, for example TGSE-like phase corrections, may be performed before the separation of contributions from the different materials. A reference scan without phase encoding may be performed upfront. Such implementations allow for an improved flexibility for reordering.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other implementations, only spin echo signals with the same echo time and the same readout polarity may be considered in a common k-space. In other words, one k-space is sampled for each readout polarity. After a 2D phase correction of these k-spaces, complex averaging may be applied to obtain a single k-space. Afterwards, the separation of contributions from the different materials may be performed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a further aspect of the disclosure, an MRI system is provided. The system comprises an MRI scanner and a control unit, which is configured to control the MRI scanner to apply an excitation RF pulse to an object in order to excite spins of a first material of the object and spins of a second material of the object. The control unit is configured to control the MRI scanner to acquire a first spin echo signal when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include a first phase difference, which is given by &#x394;, and to acquire a second spin echo signal when the excited spins of the first material and the excited spins of the second material include a second phase difference, which is given by &#x2212;&#x394;, wherein an absolute value of &#x394; lies within the interval ]0,&#x3c0;[. The system comprises a computing unit, which is configured to generate a first image for the first material and/or a second image for the second material depending on the first spin echo signal and the second spin echo signal.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The computing unit may, for example, comprise the control unit at least partly, or vice versa, or the computing unit and the control unit may be implemented separately from each other.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The MRI scanner can be understood as a device comprising respective coils for generating RF pulses, such as the excitation RF pulse and the refocusing RF pulse, and coils for generating the main magnetic field, as well as respective field gradients in three spatial dimensions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further implementations of the MRI system according to the disclosure follow directly from the various implementations of the method according to the disclosure, and vice versa. For example, the MRI system according to the disclosure is configured or programmed to perform a method according to the disclosure, or the MRI system performs a method according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the disclosure, a computer program comprising instructions is provided. When the computer program or the instructions, respectively, are executed by a MRI system according to the disclosure, the instructions cause the MRI system to carry out a method according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the disclosure, a computer readable storage medium storing a computer program according to the disclosure is provided.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The computer program and the computer readable storage medium can be considered to represent respective computer program products.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A computing unit may e.g. be understood as a data processing device. The computing unit can therefore e.g. process data to perform computing operations.
