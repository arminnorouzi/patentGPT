Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of nanotechnology. More particularly, the invention provides thin, heavy metal-free nanostructure color conversion films that have high photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of greater than 32% at a peak emission wavelength of 480-545 nm, when excited using a blue light source with a wavelength about 450 nm.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Efficient conversion of color is important for lighting and display applications. In display applications, a blue light source with a wavelength around 450 nm is most commonly used as a backlight. Most applications require materials free from heavy metals such as Cd and Pb.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Increased efficiency leads to less wasted power as well as increased emission. Color conversion thin films are characterized by photon conversion efficiency (PCE), which is defined as the number of emitted photons divided by the number of source photons. Green heavy metal free QD color conversion films used for displays typically have poor performance due to their limited absorption in blue light where they are excited. Blue absorption is often inherently limited by the material system being used, which results in a much thicker film being required to absorb sufficient 450 nm light.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The thin films formed by deposition of QD inks are typically cured by UV irradiation. In many cases, this is followed by thermal processing at 180&#xb0; C. for up to 1 hour in the presence of air. Photon conversion efficiency of these films is limited by a combination of poor absorption and poor light conversion due to instability through these processing steps.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need remains in the art for Ag/In/Ga/S (AIGS) nanostructures with high band edge emission (BE), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), high quantum yield (QY), and reduced red-shifting, and which are useful in preparing films that have high (greater than 32%) photon conversion efficiency (PCE) at a peak emission wavelength between 480 and 545 nm, using an excitation wavelength of about 450 nm.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides thin, heavy metal-free nanostructure color conversion films that have high photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of greater than 32% at a peak emission wavelength of 480-545 nm, when excited using a blue light source with a wavelength about 450 nm. This is accomplished by using Ag/In/Ga/S (AIGS) nanostructures in an ink formulation containing one or more ligands, with all handling of the inks, followed by deposition, processing and measurement of films being done in an oxygen-free environment prior to being exposed to blue or ultraviolet light. In some embodiments, the AIGS nanostructures have a FWHM of 28-38 nm. In other embodiments, the AIGS nanostructures have a FWHM of less than 32 nm. This narrow FWHM is accomplished by adding at least one polyamino-ligand to AIGS nanostructures and making a film layer, with all handling of the nanostructure inks, deposition of the inks, processing and measurement of the films being done in an oxygen-free environment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thin films formed by deposition of QD inks are typically cured by UV irradiation. In many cases, this is followed by thermal processing at 180&#xb0; C. for up to 1 hour in the presence of air. It has been discovered that photon conversion efficiency is reduced by poor absorption and poor light conversion due to instability through these processing steps.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein are films comprising AIGS nanostructures, in an ink formulation comprising at least one ligand, that achieve PCEs of greater than (&#x3e;) 32% after thermal processing. In some embodiments, provided is a film comprising AIGS nanostructures, at least one ligand, and exhibit a PCE of greater than 32% at a peak emission wavelength of 480-545 nm, when excited using a blue light source with a wavelength of 450 nm. The PCE is calculated by integrating the emission spectrum from 484 nm to 700 nm, with the green portion being defined as 484-588 nm. In some embodiments, the films are thin (5-15 &#x3bc;m) color-conversion films.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These films, as prepared, have good (&#x3e;95%) blue light absorption at about 450 nm but moderate emission properties.

The following definitions supplement those in the art and are directed to the current application and are not to be imputed to any related or unrelated case, e.g., to any commonly owned patent or application. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are described herein. Accordingly, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a nanostructure&#x201d; includes a plurality of such nanostructures, and the like.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein indicates the value of a given quantity varies by +/&#x2212;10% of the value. For example, &#x201c;about 100 nm&#x201d; encompasses a range of sizes from 90 nm to 110 nm, inclusive.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">A &#x201c;nanostructure&#x201d; is a structure having at least one region or characteristic dimension with a dimension of less than about 500 nm. In some embodiments, the nanostructure has a dimension of less than about 200 nm, less than about 100 nm, less than about 50 nm, less than about 20 nm, or less than about 10 nm. Typically, the region or characteristic dimension will be along the smallest axis of the structure. Examples of such structures include nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, branched nanostructures, nanotetrapods, tripods, bipods, nanocrystals, nanodots, quantum dots, nanoparticles, and the like. Nanostructures can be, e.g., substantially crystalline, substantially monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, each of the three dimensions of the nanostructure has a dimension of less than about 500 nm, less than about 200 nm, less than about 100 nm, less than about 50 nm, less than about 20 nm, or less than about 10 nm.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The term &#x201c;heterostructure&#x201d; when used with reference to nanostructures refers to nanostructures characterized by at least two different and/or distinguishable material types. Typically, one region of the nanostructure comprises a first material type, while a second region of the nanostructure comprises a second material type. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure comprises a core of a first material and at least one shell of a second (or third etc.) material, where the different material types are distributed radially about the long axis of a nanowire, a long axis of an arm of a branched nanowire, or the center of a nanocrystal, for example. A shell can but need not completely cover the adjacent materials to be considered a shell or for the nanostructure to be considered a heterostructure; for example, a nanocrystal characterized by a core of one material covered with small islands of a second material is a heterostructure. In other embodiments, the different material types are distributed at different locations within the nanostructure; e.g., along the major (long) axis of a nanowire or along a long axis of arm of a branched nanowire. Different regions within a heterostructure can comprise entirely different materials, or the different regions can comprise a base material (e.g., silicon) having different dopants or different concentrations of the same dopant.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">As used herein, the &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; of a nanostructure refers to the diameter of a cross-section normal to a first axis of the nanostructure, where the first axis has the greatest difference in length with respect to the second and third axes (the second and third axes are the two axes whose lengths most nearly equal each other). The first axis is not necessarily the longest axis of the nanostructure; e.g., for a disk-shaped nanostructure, the cross-section would be a substantially circular cross-section normal to the short longitudinal axis of the disk. Where the cross-section is not circular, the diameter is the average of the major and minor axes of that cross-section. For an elongated or high aspect ratio nanostructure, such as a nanowire, the diameter is measured across a cross-section perpendicular to the longest axis of the nanowire. For a spherical nanostructure, the diameter is measured from one side to the other through the center of the sphere.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">The terms &#x201c;crystalline&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially crystalline,&#x201d; when used with respect to nanostructures, refer to the fact that the nanostructures typically exhibit long-range ordering across one or more dimensions of the structure. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the term &#x201c;long range ordering&#x201d; will depend on the absolute size of the specific nanostructures, as ordering for a single crystal cannot extend beyond the boundaries of the crystal. In this case, &#x201c;long-range ordering&#x201d; will mean substantial order across at least the majority of the dimension of the nanostructure. In some instances, a nanostructure can bear an oxide or other coating, or can be comprised of a core and at least one shell. In such instances it will be appreciated that the oxide, shell(s), or other coating can but need not exhibit such ordering (e.g. it can be amorphous, polycrystalline, or otherwise). In such instances, the phrase &#x201c;crystalline,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially crystalline,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially monocrystalline,&#x201d; or &#x201c;monocrystalline&#x201d; refers to the central core of the nanostructure (excluding the coating layers or shells). The terms &#x201c;crystalline&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially crystalline&#x201d; as used herein are intended to also encompass structures comprising various defects, stacking faults, atomic substitutions, and the like, as long as the structure exhibits substantial long range ordering (e.g., order over at least about 80% of the length of at least one axis of the nanostructure or its core). In addition, it will be appreciated that the interface between a core and the outside of a nanostructure or between a core and an adjacent shell or between a shell and a second adjacent shell may contain non-crystalline regions and may even be amorphous. This does not prevent the nanostructure from being crystalline or substantially crystalline as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">The term &#x201c;monocrystalline&#x201d; when used with respect to a nanostructure indicates that the nanostructure is substantially crystalline and comprises substantially a single crystal. When used with respect to a nanostructure heterostructure comprising a core and one or more shells, &#x201c;monocrystalline&#x201d; indicates that the core is substantially crystalline and comprises substantially a single crystal.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">A &#x201c;nanocrystal&#x201d; is a nanostructure that is substantially monocrystalline. A nanocrystal thus has at least one region or characteristic dimension with a dimension of less than about 500 nm.

Since gallium has a high affinity for oxygen, oxygen-containing ligands and using a gallium precursor that was not prepared under oxygen-free conditions may produce unwanted side reactions, such as gallium oxides, when Ga and S precursors are used to produce nanostructures that contain a significant gallium content.

In spin coating a small amount of material is typically deposited onto the center of a substrate loaded a machine called the spinner which is secured by a vacuum. A high speed of rotation is applied on the substrate through the spinner which causes centripetal force to spread the material from the center to the edge of the substrate. While most of the material would be spun off, a certain amount remains on the substrate, forming a thin film of material on the surface as the rotation continues. The final thickness of the film is determined by the nature of the deposited material and the substrate in addition to the parameters chosen for the spin process such as spin speed, acceleration, and spin time. For typical films, a spin speed of 1500 to 6000 rpm is used with a spin time of 10-60 seconds. In some embodiments, films are deposited at very low speeds, e.g., less than 1000 rpm. In some embodiments, the films are cast at about 300, about 400, about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800 or about 900 rpm.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Mist Deposition</heading><p id="p-0261" num="0255">In some embodiments, the nanostructure composition is deposited onto a substrate using mist deposition. Mist deposition takes place at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and allows precise control over film thickness by changing the process conditions. During mist deposition, a liquid source material is turned into a very fine mist and carried to the deposition chamber by nitrogen gas. The mist is then drawn to the wafer surface by a high voltage potential between the field screen and the wafer holder. Once the droplets coalesce on the wafer surface, the wafer is removed from the chamber and thermally cured to allow the solvent to evaporate. The liquid precursor is a mixture of solvent and material to be deposited. It is carried to the atomizer by pressurized nitrogen gas. Price, S.

The final materials subjected to ion exchange using Ga(III) chloride gave similar size and similar band-edge to trap emission properties as the starting nanostructures. Therefore, the increase in quantum yield (QY) is not simply due to increasing the trap emission component.

When encapsulated and measured, films comprising AIGS nanostructures had higher post-bake PCE values than InP, at a much lower QD loading. A further improvement in PCE was achieved by irradiating the films by placing on a blue light source (&#x2dc;6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for a period of 1 hour. Additionally, the QDCC films made with AIGS QDs exhibit a much narrower emission (FWHM&#x2dc;30 nm) compared to films made with InP QDs (FWHM 36 nm). This is a result of the lower FWHM for AIGS QDs in solution (34 nm vs 39 nm), combined with the use of mono- and poly-amino ligands that enable good dispersion in the ink resin.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" rowsep="1">TABLE 12</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>QD</entry><entry/><entry>Post-</entry><entry>Blue</entry><entry>Post-</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>QD</entry><entry>loading</entry><entry/><entry>encapsulation</entry><entry>absorption</entry><entry>180&#xb0; C.</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>type</entry><entry>in ink</entry><entry>Encapsulation</entry><entry>treatment</entry><entry>in 10 &#x3bc;m film</entry><entry>bake PCE</entry><entry>PWL</entry><entry>FWHM</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>AIGS</entry><entry>12.5%</entry><entry>No encapsulation</entry><entry>None</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>28%</entry><entry>535</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Glass</entry><entry>None</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>35%</entry><entry>535</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>encapsulation</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Glass</entry><entry>1 hr irradiation</entry><entry>&#x3e;95%</entry><entry>38%</entry><entry>535</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>encapsulation</entry><entry>with blue light</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>InP</entry><entry>&#x2002;&#x2009;30%</entry><entry>No encapsulation</entry><entry>None</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;85%</entry><entry>32%</entry><entry>540</entry><entry>36</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0385" num="0370"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the impact of encapsulation and blue light treatment over a much wider range of samples.

As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, addition of the diamine to the AIGS-monomer dispersion before ink formulation increased EQE after UV cure and POB.

The effect of diamine on improving EQE was even higher after POB. Compared with no diamine in monomer, EQE was improved by 5% with addition of 5% of diamine. With 30% of diamine addition, EQE was increased from 25% to 32% and LRR was 92%, which is similar to results seen with InP green QD films. The side effect of diamine was increase in viscosity as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.

It should be noticed that QY of AIGS nanostructures was also enhanced after thermal treatment, simulating hard bake, at 180&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes in the presence of monomer. The QY drop after 30 minutes at 180&#xb0; C. became smaller with larger addition of diamine for LE. At 50% w/w of diamine in LE, the QY before and after the thermal process were almost equal, and QY after thermal process became higher when 70% diamine was used for LE.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0389">The performance of QDCC films using these AIGS nanostructures was plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.

EQE obtained with 70% diamine addition and LE was lower than 30% and 50%. It is suspected that when higher amounts of diamine is used for LE, the amount of diamine incorporated on the AIGS surface increases, but this decreases the amount of ligands and/or monomers on AIGS surface. The observed decrease in QD mass after LE with diamine is likely the result of fewer ligands and/or monomer on QD surface. This occurs as well when the diamine is added to the monomer for LE, which results in increased ink viscosity.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0390">When these 2 approaches are used to improve film EQE, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the effect of diamine on film EQE was highest when diamine was added in both the ligand exchange and monomer dispersion. The viscosity does not necessarily depend on the total diamine amounts in ink. The highest diamine amount sample, where diamine was used in both LE and monomer dispersion, had a middle viscosity. This viscosity was lower than when the same amount of diamine was used only in LE.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0391">EQE enhancement using diamine in LE and/or monomer dispersion was tested with 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, and an additional 5 other additives listed in Table 16. All additives had similar effect on initial EQE and A1, A5 and A6 were slightly better than others when directly added with the monomer. However after hard bake, A1 and A6 were the 2 best additives in final film EQE. In addition, good EQE was obtained without using the same additive in LE and monomer addition among the listed amines. Even when the same diamine is used in LE and monomer addition, its effects in improving EQE can be different. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, A6 was effective for retaining EQE as was A1 when used in the monomer addition, however it was not as effective as when A1 was used in LE.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00016" num="00016"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 16</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>additive list</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="154pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>A1</entry><entry>1,3-Bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A2</entry><entry>1,7-Diaminoheptane</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A3</entry><entry>Cycloheptylamine</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A4</entry><entry>4,4&#x2032;-Methylenebis(2-methylcyclohexylamine)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A5</entry><entry>Cyclopentylamine</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A6</entry><entry>2-Methyl-1,5-diaminopentane</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>A7</entry><entry>4-Aminopiperidine</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0411" num="0392">While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
