APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085679 filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a vehicle seat for mounting a child seat, and more particularly, to a vehicle seat for mounting a child seat which may be mounted on a rotatable vehicle seat without a belt of the child seat being twisted.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When infants or children are in a vehicle, child seats are used to keep them safe.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The child seat provided in the vehicle may be classified into a forward-facing child seat which is provided to face the front of the vehicle, and a rearward-facing child seat which is provided to face the rear of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The child seat may be manufactured based on a standard of the international standard organization FIX (ISOFIX), and may be fixed by fastening an ISOFIX connector to an anchor member.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, recently, a vehicle seat provided in the vehicle does not face the front or rear of the vehicle, but a swivel vehicle seat that rotates so that a side of the vehicle seat faces the front or rear of the vehicle is being developed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a child seat is provided in such a swivel vehicle seat, the following problems may occur.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the swivel vehicle seat faces the front of the vehicle, a child seat belt is fixed to an anchor member of the swivel vehicle seat as in the related art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when the swivel vehicle seat rotates and then a side of the swivel vehicle seat faces the front of the vehicle, the belt (or top tether) of the child seat may be twisted, and accordingly, the child seat may not be stably provided on a swivel vehicle seat <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The information included in this Background of the present disclosure section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the present disclosure and may not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a vehicle seat for mounting a child seat which may stably install a child seat on a swivel vehicle seat which is rotatably provided with respect to a driving direction of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a vehicle seat for mounting a child seat which is rotatably provided in a vehicle body, including: a backrest frame; a seat back panel coupled to the backrest frame; and a rotation anchorage which is provided in the seat back panel and is rotatably provided with an anchorage member to which a top tether of the child seat is fastened as the vehicle seat rotates.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rotation anchorage may include: a mounting block mounted on the seat back panel; a rotating block which is rotatably provided on the mounting block and in which the anchorage member to which the top tether of the child seat is coupled is formed; a tensioner that provides an elastic force to the rotating block; and a piston device supporting the rotating block so that the rotating block is selectively rotated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tensioner may include an elastic member provided in the mounting block and providing an elastic force for rotation of the rotating block.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The tensioner may further include a head coupled to the elastic member and selectively contacting with the rotating block.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An end portion of the head may be formed to have a hemisphere shape.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The piston device may include: a piston rack which is movably provided in the mounting block in a predetermined direction, selectively supports a side surface of the rotation block, and is configured to reciprocate in a predetermined distance; a driving portion that is engaged to the piston rack and configured to provide power to move the piston rack in the predetermined distance; and a power transmitting device that couples the driving portion to the piston rack and transmits the power of the driving portion to the piston rack.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The power transmitting device may include: a worm gear connected to the driving portion; a pinion gear gear-engaged to the worm gear; and a rack gear formed in the piston rack and gear-engaged to the pinion gear.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The vehicle seat for mounting the child seat may further include a block cover fastened to the mounting block to prevent the piston device and the tensioner from being separated from the mounting block.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vehicle seat for mounting the child seat may further include a limiting device that limits a moving distance of the piston rack.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The limiting device may include: a slit formed in the piston rack; and a stopper pin formed in the block cover and slidably inserted into the slit.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The slit may be formed along a moving direction of the piston rack.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The piston rack may be provided in the mounting block to be movable in an unlocked direction to allow rotation of the rotating block and in a locked direction to limit rotation of the rotating block.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the piston rack moves up to an unlocked completion position in the unlocked direction, the rotating block may rotate in a first direction by the tensioner, and when the piston rack moves in the locked direction at the unlocked completion position, the rotating block may rotate in a second direction by the piston rack.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rotating block may be formed to have a polygonal block, and may rotate at intervals of 90 degrees according to reciprocating movement of the piston rack.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A block seating groove in which the rotating block is rotatably accommodated and a tensioner seating groove in which the tensioner is movably accommodated may be formed on a first surface of the mounting block, and a rack seating groove in which the piston rack is movably accommodated and a pinion seating groove in which the worm gear is rotatably accommodated may be formed on a second surface of the mounting block.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A driving portion supporting groove into which a locking protrusion of the driving portion is inserted may be formed on a side surface of the mounting block.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the vehicle seat for mounting the child seat according to the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure as described above, when a vehicle seat rotates according to a driving direction of a vehicle, a rotation anchorage for mounting a child seat rotates, so that it is possible to prevent a belt of the child seat from being twisted, stably installing the child seat on the vehicle seat.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The methods and apparatuses of the present disclosure have other features and advantages which will be apparent from or are set forth in more detail in the accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein, and the following Detailed Description, which together serve to explain certain principles of the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
