Typically, a sample is introduced into an ion source of the mass spectrometer to be ionized. The resulting ions are then subject to transport, confinement, and separation by various components of the mass spectrometer. Typically, radio frequency (RF) signals, as well as direct current (DC) signals, are applied to electrodes of the components to generate electric fields used to manipulate the ions for transport, confinement, and separation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, some mass spectrometers use a quadrupole mass filter, a set of four parallel rods, as a mass analyzer to separate the ions according to their m/z. Two of the four rods of the quadrupole are applied a first oscillating RF signal, and the other two rods are applied another oscillating RF signal that is 180&#xb0; out-of-phase from the first RF signal. The application of the RF signals, together with the resolving DC signal, applied in opposite polarities to the rod pairs, generates an oscillating electric field that causes the transmission of selected ions through the quadrupole based on the m/z of the ions, amplitudes of the RF and the resolving DC signals, and the frequency of the RF signals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A RF amplifier circuit can generate the RF signal with an amplitude in the thousands of volts used to generate the oscillating electric field to resolve larger masses. The accuracy and precision of the RF signal allows for the proper generation of the oscillating electric field. Analog feedback circuitry can sample the RF signal and adjust the amplifier using a feedback loop to ensure that the actual amplitude is the same as or close to the expected amplitude. Unfortunately, the analog feedback circuitry can include several components and, therefore, increases costs. Additionally, the analog feedback circuitry has a relatively slow response time. Thus, the actual amplitude of the RF signal is not quickly adjusted to the expected amplitude, thereby reducing the performance of the mass spectrometer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure includes a mass spectrometer including: a quadrupole mass analyzer;

In one example, a mass spectrometer includes an ion source used to ionize an analyte. The resulting ions are then provided to a quadrupole mass analyzer for mass analysis. The quadrupole mass analyzer includes four parallel conductive (e.g., metallic) rods. In addition to direct current (DC) resolving voltages, two of the rods are applied a radio frequency (RF) signal that is 180&#xb0; out-of-phase from an RF signal applied to the two other rods of the quadrupole. The RF signals applied to the rods oscillate within a peak-to-peak amplitude, resulting in an oscillating electric field used to manipulate the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The RF signals are generated by an RF amplifier circuit and can measure in the thousands of volts (V) during the oscillation (e.g., up to a peak-to-peak amplitude of 8000 V). The RF signals are applied to the rods via an LC circuit, or a resonant circuit, modeled to include an inductor and a capacitor coupled in series to function as a resonator to store energy, magnify the voltage, and oscillate at a specific frequency.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As previously discussed, the accuracy and the precision of the amplitude of the RF signal are important to allow for the proper generation of the oscillating electric field to manipulate the ions. That is, the amplitude of the RF signal is carefully applied to ensure that ions of a particular m/z are manipulated to transit through the quadrupole. As different ions of different m/z are selected for analysis, the amplitude of the RF signal is adjusted. Unfortunately, discrepancies between the actual and expected amplitude of the RF signal generated by the amplifier circuit can occur due to environmental factors (e.g., temperature changes), component degradation over time, or other factors.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described later in this disclosure, digital control of the amplitude of the RF signal caused by the amplifier circuit to be applied to the quadrupole is performed. For example, a controller circuit (composed of an arrangement of connected electronic components that collectively perform a desired function or operation) having digital logic functionality (e.g., implemented by a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a microprocessor, etc.) receives a digitized representation of the RF signal via an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and determines the actual characteristics of the RF signal including its amplitude. The controller circuit can then compare the actual amplitude with the expected amplitude and, if different, access memory storing information indicating how the amplifier circuit should be driven to provide the RF signal with the expected amplitude. This results in the actual amplitude of the RF signal to adjust to be closer to, or the same as, the expected amplitude. Additionally, the controller circuit can implement digital signal processing (DSP) to identify the amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the RF signal while ignoring harmonics, allowing for more accurate driving of the amplifier for generating the RF signal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also described later in this disclosure, the controller circuit can determine one or both of environmental or performance characteristics at the time including temperature of the components of the mass spectrometer (e.g., temperatures of the inductor coils of the resonant circuit or the quadrupole rods, temperature of a digital-to-analog converter) or mode of operation and how that mode of operation is being performed (e.g., how a scanning mode is performed or how a selected monitoring mode is being performed). Scanning modes can include but are not limited to full scans, product ion scans, precursor scans, and neutral loss scans. Selective monitoring modes can include but are not limited to selective ion monitoring (SIM) and selective reaction monitoring (SRM). The mode of operation can include the scan rate, the starting m/z, the ending m/z, and the time spent in that mode. The mode of operation can also include what mode of operation was performed previously or what mode of operation will be performed next. One or both of the current environmental and performance characteristics, along with one or both of historical environmental and performance characteristics, can also be used to more precisely drive the amplifier to generate the RF signal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also described later in this disclosure, differences between phases of the actual RF signal and the RF amplifier input signal used to drive the amplifier can be determined. Differences in the phases are often the result of harmonics causing the actual RF signal to be different than the expected RF signal. This can be caused by the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit drifting during temperature changes affecting the resonant circuit's capacitance or inductance. The RF amplifier input signal can be adjusted to compensate for the phase differences, resulting in the actual RF signal to be closer to, or the same as, as the expected RF signal (e.g., at the resonant frequency).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to controlling the amplitude, the frequency or phase of the actual RF signal can also be controlled using the aforementioned techniques.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By controlling the amplitude (or frequency or phase) of the RF signal via the controller circuit, the proper amplitude can be achieved much faster than when using an analog circuit to determine how to adjust the amplitude. This results in an increase in the throughput of the mass spectrometer because the &#x201c;dead time&#x201d; between scans is reduced. Additionally, fewer components are used, resulting in cost savings in comparison to using an analog circuit. Moreover, the controller circuit can record information related to the RF signal, the environment, and the performance, as well as access a history of past information, to make more informed decisions regarding how to adjust the amplitude. The controller circuit can also allow the mass spectrometer to self-calibrate to a level that is not achievable using analog techniques.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In more detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of digital control for an amplitude of a RF signal generated by an amplifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram for digital control of the amplitude of the RF signal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Resonant circuits are implemented via the inductances of the inductors and the capacitances of the rods (implementing a LC circuit) and, therefore, the voltage of RF signal <b>115</b> is magnified to provide out-of-phase RF signals <b>155</b> and <b>160</b>, for example, up to 8000 V peak-to-peak amplitude to rods <b>125</b><i>a </i>and <b>125</b><i>b</i>, and rods <b>125</b><i>c </i>and <b>125</b><i>d </i>of quadrupole <b>120</b> to generate the appropriate electric fields to manipulate ions in accordance with their m/z. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is only one type of circuit that can be implemented. For example, RF amplifier <b>115</b> can drive a primary coil which, in turn, drives secondary coils similar to inductors <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>to generate RF signals <b>155</b> and <b>160</b>. In another example, a resonant circuit need not be implemented. Rather, a non-resonant transformer or other circuit can be implemented.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, controller circuit <b>135</b> is provided a digitized representation of RF signal <b>160</b> via analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>140</b>. That is, ADC <b>140</b> receives RF signal <b>160</b> in an analog format, samples it, and generates a digital representation of RF signal <b>160</b> that is provided to controller circuit <b>135</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this is depicted as ADC <b>140</b> receiving the RF signal after inductor. Though only RF signal <b>160</b> is digitized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, RF signal <b>155</b> (which is out-of-phase with respect to RF signal <b>160</b>, as previously discussed) can also be tapped and digitized in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Though depicted as a separate circuit, the functionality of ADC <b>140</b> can be implemented within controller circuit <b>135</b>. In one example, ADC <b>140</b> can be a 20 megahertz (MHz) ADC to sample a 1 MHz waveform to sample enough points for the digital representation of RF signal <b>160</b>. By digitizing RF signal <b>160</b> using ADC <b>140</b>, new information can be determined and used to more accurately drive RF amplifier <b>110</b>, which would otherwise not be possible in analog controls that are typically used with mass spectrometers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the actual amplitude of the digitized RF signal is then determined (<b>210</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, controller circuit <b>135</b> receives the digital representation and determines the amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> by identifying the highest peak or amplitude in data representing points of the waveform or using other techniques as discussed later herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the actual amplitude is compared with the expected amplitude (<b>215</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, controller circuit <b>135</b> compares the actual amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> with the expected amplitude that RF signal <b>160</b> should be at for quadrupole <b>120</b> to generate an accurate and precise oscillating electric field that positions ions of a particular m/z within the stability region. The actual amplitude can differ than the expected amplitude due to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature of components, noise causing interference on RF signal <b>160</b> or <b>155</b>, etc.), degradation of components of the mass spectrometer, etc. If controller circuit <b>135</b> determines that the actual amplitude differs from the expected amplitude, then the actual amplitude can be adjusted to be the same as or closer to the expected amplitude by driving RF amplifier circuit <b>110</b> differently via RF input <b>105</b> (e.g., by changing the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations, a variable capacitor can be included in the resonant circuit and tuned (e.g., adjust its capacitance) to modify the amplitude. Using a variable capacitor can adjust the resonant frequency, but it would more difficult (but possible) to adjust the amplitude. Additionally, a variable inductor can be implemented in the resonant circuit and adjusted to change its inductance to modify the amplitude. By ensuring that RF signal <b>160</b> is at or close to the expected amplitude, the oscillating electric field generated by quadrupole <b>120</b> can allow for more careful selection of ions of a particular m/z to transit through for mass analysis.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, if the actual amplitude is different from the expected amplitude, controller circuit <b>135</b> further determines the current performance and/or environmental characteristics (<b>220</b>) and then determines an amplitude correction using current and historical performance and/or environmental characteristics (<b>225</b>). For example, controller circuit <b>135</b> can include memory, or have access to memory, storing information regarding how quadrupole <b>120</b> (or other components of the mass spectrometer) has performed in the past, and the environmental conditions of quadrupole <b>120</b> in the past. Under these historical conditions, amplifier <b>110</b> might have been driven differently (i.e., the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b> might be different) to provide the expected amplitude on RF signal <b>160</b>. Thus, by comparing the current performance and environmental characteristics with the historical performance and environmental characteristics, along with the actual and expected amplitudes, an amplitude correction can be determined with all the information stored in memory, for example, via a lookup table (LUT). The amplitude correction represents how much the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b> should be adjusted such that RF signal <b>160</b> is closer to the expected amplitude. Controller circuit <b>135</b> can then adjust the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b> in accordance with the amplitude correction recommended in the LUT (e.g., increase or decrease the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b> by the amplitude correction) such that the actual amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> is changed to get closer to, or even the same as, the expected amplitude. In the prior example, both performance and environmental characteristics are used. However, controller circuit <b>135</b> can use one or both of the performance and the environmental characteristics. For example, the amplitude correction can be determined using the current performance characteristics and the historical performance characteristics, but not use environmental characteristics (either current or historical). In another example, the amplitude correction can be determined using the current environmental characteristics and the historical environmental characteristics, but not use performance characteristics.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The environmental and performance characteristics can include a variety of parameters. For example, environmental characteristics can include the ambient temperature or even the temperature of specific components of the mass spectrometer. The temperatures of inductors <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b</i>, along with the temperatures of rods <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of quadrupole <b>120</b> affect the inductance and capacitance, respectively, of the resonant circuit and, therefore, any temperatures changes have an effect as to the amplitude of the RF signal applied to rods <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. Thus, controller circuit <b>135</b> can apply the amplitude correction factor by adjusting RF input <b>105</b> in view of the temperature of the component, resulting in the amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> to be closer to the expected amplitude. Additionally, the temperature of any readback circuitry (e.g., ADC <b>140</b>) or RF amplifier <b>110</b>, can also be determined and used to modify the actual amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> to get corrected towards the expected amplitude.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The performance characteristics can include how the mass spectrometer is being used. For example, a quadrupole can be operated in a scanning or jumping mode. A full scan MS is an example of a scanning mode, while SIM and SRM are examples of jumping modes. For a scanning mode, RF signal <b>160</b> is continuously varied from a starting m/z point to an ending m/z point at a particular scan rate. For a jumping mode, RF signal <b>160</b> is stepped to a voltage for a particular m/z and held there or ramped slowly over a narrow m/z range. RF signal <b>160</b> is then changed, or jumped, to a voltage for the next m/z and this repeats until all the desired ions are analyzed. As a result, the specific mode of operation, scan rates, starting and ending m/z points (or corresponding voltages or amplitudes) can be used. Thus, how quadrupole <b>120</b> of the mass spectrometer is performing at the time that the actual amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> is determined by controller circuit <b>135</b> is determined and used to apply the amplitude correction factor to RF input <b>105</b> (e.g., by changing the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The current performance and environmental characteristics, along with amplitudes of RF input <b>105</b> and RF signal <b>160</b>, can also be added to the LUT. This allows for controller circuit <b>135</b> to continually store data regarding performance and environmental characteristics, the actual amplitude, and how the amplitude correction was applied to RF input <b>105</b> (e.g., at what amplitude RF input <b>105</b> should be driven at).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">By implementing much of the functionality with digital circuitry implemented by controller circuit <b>135</b> and ADC <b>140</b>, the actual amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> can be more accurately controlled, the stability and calibration of the mass spectrometer is improved, and additional control strategies can be implemented, as discussed later herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As previously discussed, resolving DC voltages are also applied to the rods of quadrupoles. Controller circuit <b>135</b> can also adjust the resolving DC voltage applied to rods <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>if the actual resolving DC voltage is different than the expected resolving DC voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of digital control for a resolving DC voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram for digital control for a resolving DC voltage.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, resolving DC voltage driver <b>305</b> provides a DC voltage signal <b>310</b> at a particular resolving DC voltage needed by quadrupole <b>120</b> to generate the electric fields used to manipulate ions. Using voltage divider <b>315</b> to divide or scale down the voltage to a level that is safely accessible to controller circuit <b>135</b>, controller circuit <b>135</b> can then determine the actual voltage of DC voltage signal <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the actual voltage is compared with the expected voltage (<b>410</b>), the current performance and environmental characteristics are determined (<b>415</b>), and a DC voltage correction is determined using the current and historical performance and environmental characteristics (<b>420</b>). The DC voltage correction is then used to adjust the DC voltage (<b>425</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, DC voltage input <b>320</b> is adjusted such that how resolving DC voltage driver <b>305</b> drives, or generates, DC voltage signal <b>310</b> is changed so that the proper resolving DC voltage is applied to the rods. Though resolving DC voltages are discussed in the aforementioned example, a DC offset that is applied to the rods to set the kinetic energy of the ions passing through the quadrupole can also be controlled in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additional functionality enabled by controller circuit <b>135</b> includes determining how the resonant circuit is performing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of determining characteristics of a resonant circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram for determining characteristics of the resonant circuit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an impulse waveform is provided to an amplifier (<b>605</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, controller circuit <b>135</b> can generate impulse waveform <b>510</b> (e.g., a voltage pulse of a short time duration) as RF amplifier input <b>105</b>. Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, RF signal <b>160</b> is digitized (<b>610</b>) and the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit is determined (<b>615</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, frequency <b>505</b> of RF signal <b>160</b> is determined by digitizing RF signal <b>160</b> using ADC <b>140</b>. This allows for determining the frequency that the resonant circuit should resonant at, as well as allows for observation of harmonics that might be indicative of issues such as electrical cross-talk from other electrical components. The frequency of RF signal <b>160</b> provided by amplifier <b>110</b> via inductor <b>130</b><i>b </i>should be the same as or similar to the resonant frequency and, therefore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the frequency of the RF amplifier input signal can be adjusted (<b>620</b>). For example, the frequency of RF input signal <b>105</b> can be set to be the same as the resonant frequency in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Thus, controller circuit <b>135</b> can adjust not only the amplitude of RF input signal <b>105</b> (and subsequently, RF signals <b>115</b>, <b>155</b>, and <b>160</b>), but also the frequency of RF input signal <b>105</b> (and, therefore, RF signals <b>115</b>, <b>155</b>, and <b>160</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The RF signal can be digitized at both terminals of the inductor coils to provide additional information and adjustments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates another example of digital control for an amplitude of a RF signal generated by an amplifier.

By digitizing the RF signals at both terminals of inductor <b>130</b><i>b</i>, more information regarding the separate inductance and capacitance components of the resonant circuit can be identified.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously discussed, the resonant circuit is implemented via the inductances of the inductor coils and the capacitances of the rods of the quadrupole. How the inductance of the inductor coils (e.g., inductor <b>130</b><i>b</i>) has changed can therefore be independently determined by analyzing RF signals at both terminals of the inductor coil. For example, differences in the phase of RF signals <b>115</b> and <b>160</b> can be determined. This accounts for some change in the resonant frequency. However, any remaining change is accounted for by changes in the capacitance. Changes in capacitance are indicative of changes in the geometry of the corresponding quadrupole rods, which can cause a mass drift due to the improper generation of the oscillating electric field. Thus, controller circuit <b>135</b> can determine the change in the inductance, account for the remaining change in the resonant frequency and correlate that to the change in capacitance, and then adjust RF input signal <b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> accordingly. Additionally, controller circuit <b>135</b> can also adjust the resolving DC voltage (e.g., DC voltage signal <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Other techniques can also be used to determine the behavior of the resonant circuit.

The frequency of RF signal <b>160</b> can therefore be compared with the frequency that the mass spectrometer is operating to determine the change in the resonant frequency due to the change in inductance.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, how the resonant circuit is currently performing, as well as how it has performed in the past (e.g., by recording the results of the resonant frequency as impulse waveforms are provided), can be used to determine the health of the mass spectrometer. For example, identification of harmonics can be used to identify failing capacitors or inductors, including the inductors of the resonant circuit. Degradation of components can be identified over time as the resonant frequency is determined. Additionally, any of the aforementioned information determined in the examples (e.g., amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b>) can be stored and used to determine the health of the mass spectrometer. Based on the health, an alert indicating that the mass spectrometer needs maintenance can be generated (e.g., via a graphical user interface (GUI) on a monitor communicatively coupled with the mass spectrometer, via email or other communications, etc.), or even how the mass spectrometer performs can be adjusted. For example, the time to perform an operation (e.g., the scan time) can be adjusted, the voltage applied to a component can be adjusted, etc. in view of the health information. In another example, the temperature of a component (e.g., inductor coils or quadrupole rods) can be adjusted (e.g., cooled or heated via temperature adjusting devices such as fans or heaters, respectively) based on the health information as these affect the amplitude of the RF signals, as previously discussed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The adjustment of the amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> can be constantly monitored and maintained at the expected amplitude if any drifts of the amplitude occurs. However, in some implementations, if the difference between the actual and expected amplitudes is below a threshold amount, then controller circuit <b>135</b> might not make adjustments. This might be performed because there might be some small changes due to noise and maintaining the amplitude as-is might not significantly affect the performance of quadrupole <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some implementations, the amplitude of the RF signal at the fundamental frequency can be identified. For example, using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques such as a discrete cosine transform (DCT), the RF signal as captured using the ADC in the time domain can be expressed in the frequency domain. This provides the frequency components of the RF signal. Because the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform, and the harmonics are multiples of the frequency, the fundamental frequency can be identified separately from the harmonics and, therefore, the amplitude of the frequency component at the fundamental frequency can be determined. By identifying the amplitude without harmonics, a more accurate adjustment of the RF signal can be performed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram for digital control of an amplitude of a RF signal by identifying harmonics. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the RF signal is digitized (<b>805</b>) and the fundamental frequency of the RF signal is identified (<b>810</b>). For example, a DCT is applied to the digital representation of the RF signal, effectively transforming the digital representation from the time domain to the frequency domain to show the amplitudes of the frequency components of the RF signal. Alternatively, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or a fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be applied. The fundamental frequency and its harmonics can be identified from the frequency components, and the amplitude of the frequency component at the fundamental frequency can be identified (<b>815</b>). For example, the lowest frequency can be the fundamental frequency. Then, a comparison of the amplitude of the frequency component at the fundamental frequency can be done with the expected amplitude of the RF signal (<b>820</b>). That is, a comparison of the amplitudes without harmonics can be performed by comparing the amplitude of the frequency component at the fundamental frequency and the amplitude of RF input <b>105</b>. The amplitude of the RF signal can then be adjusted based on the comparison (<b>825</b>), for example, in a similar manner as described above.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Controller circuit can also identify other characteristics of RF signal <b>160</b> and make adjustments. For example, due to harmonics, the phase of RF signal <b>160</b> can be different than expected (e.g., different than the phase of the signal used to drive the RF amplifier). This occurs because, over time and as the capacitance and inductance of the resonant circuit change with temperature, the resonant frequency changes. Thus, the frequency of RF signal <b>160</b> can drift away from the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit and cause a phase difference. This, in turn, causes the amount of harmonic content to increase. Accordingly, by determining the phase of RF signal <b>160</b>, controller circuit can adjust the frequency of RF input <b>105</b> to drive RF amplifier <b>110</b> differently such that RF signal <b>160</b> is adjusted to be more in line with expectations. Thus, in addition to adjusting the amplitude of RF signal <b>160</b> to be in line with expectations, the frequency can also be adjusted to account for changes in the resonant frequency.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram for digital control of a RF signal by identifying phase differences. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the RF signal is digitized (<b>905</b>) and the phase difference between the actual phase of the RF signal and the expected phase of the RF signal is identified (<b>910</b>). For example, the phase difference between RF signal <b>160</b> and RF input <b>105</b> being used to drive RF amplifier <b>110</b> can be determined. Based on the phase difference, the frequency of the RF signal is adjusted (<b>915</b>). For example, the frequency of RF input <b>105</b> can be changed such that RF amplifier <b>110</b> is driven differently, resulting in a frequency change in RF signals <b>115</b>, <b>155</b>, and <b>160</b>. The change in frequency introduced into RF input <b>105</b> can be based on the phase difference between the actual phase of RF signal <b>160</b> and the expected phase of RF signal <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition to determining the phase differences, the amount of harmonic content of RF signal <b>160</b> can also be determined and used to adjust RF signal <b>160</b>. For example, by using a DSP technique such as DCT, as previously discussed, the different frequency components of RF signal <b>160</b> can be identified using a number of techniques including determining the total harmonic distortion (THD). This provides a value of the harmonic components of RF signal <b>160</b>, though other techniques can also be used to relay the amount of harmonic content as a particular value (e.g., the number of frequency components that are harmonics, etc.). Thus, if the amount of harmonic content exceeds a threshold, then the frequency of RF signal <b>160</b> can be changed. As RF signal <b>160</b> is adjusted closer to the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit, the amount of harmonic content would be reduced. Thus, as RF signal <b>160</b> is sampled by the ADC, the amount of harmonic content can repeatedly be determined and used to adjust the frequency until the amount of harmonic content is below the threshold amount.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">If too much harmonic content is identified, then this might be indicative of poor health of components of the mass spectrometer, for example, issues with the coils of the resonant circuit that cause the frequency of RF signal <b>160</b> to be significantly off the resonant frequency. Thus, an alert indicating that the mass spectrometer needs maintenance can be generated, as previously discussed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some implementations, controller circuit <b>135</b> can also adjust RF input <b>105</b> by introducing an out-of-phase harmonic signal to cancel or reduce a harmonic of RF signal <b>160</b>. For example, if a second harmonic is identified via the frequency components, a signal that is 180 degrees out-of-phase can be generated by controller circuit <b>135</b> and superimposed on RF input <b>105</b>. This out out-of-phase signal can attenuate the second harmonic observed on RF signal <b>160</b> due to the resulting destructive interference. Thus, the amount of harmonic content can be reduced and more accurate control of the quadrupole (or another component) can be provided.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some implementations, RF amplifier <b>110</b> can be operated in a non-linear fashion, or overdriven, to quickly achieve a steady-state RF signal.
