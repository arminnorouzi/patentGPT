For example, Patent Document 1 describes a vehicle side airbag device in which a waist bag deployed between a vehicle door and the waist of an occupant, a chest bag deployed between the vehicle door and the chest of the occupant, and an inflator that supplies gas to the waist bag and the chest bag are mounted on the vehicle seat. This vehicle side airbag device operates the inflator to provide gas to the waist bag and the chest bag, and deploys the waist bag and the chest bag at the time of a side collision of the vehicle or at the time of predicting a side collision.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP 2008-201298</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0005">In a vehicle, for example, impact from two different directions may occur, such as a side collision or a front collision. However, for example, the vehicle side airbag device described in Patent Document 1 responds only to impact from the side direction, and thus the occupant cannot be protected when impact occurs from a direction other than the side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0006">Furthermore, in order to increase the space inside the vehicle, there is a demand to thin the vehicle seat and to dispose the airbag device in the vehicle seat. However, the technology for thinning the vehicle seat while also mounting the airbag device in the vehicle seat has not been proposed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0007">The present disclosure has been conceived in view of the circumstances described above, and an object thereof is to provide an airbag device capable of protecting an occupant while making the vehicle seat thinner.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">In order to solve the above-described problems, an airbag device of the present disclosure adopts a configuration including a switching unit that switches supply of gas to either a first airbag group or a second airbag group disposed in a vehicle seat. With such a configuration, the airbag device makes it possible for the vehicle seat to be made thinner while also deploying an airbag requiring deployment to protect an occupant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">Specifically, the present disclosure relates to an airbag device that protects an occupant seated in a vehicle seat disposed in a vehicle, the airbag device including a first airbag group and a second airbag group disposed in the vehicle seat in correspondence with impacts from two different directions, the first airbag group and the second airbag group each including a plurality of airbags; a gas generation unit disposed in a seat cushion, of the vehicle seat, that supports a buttocks region of the occupant, the gas generation unit generating a gas to be supplied to the first airbag group or the second airbag group; and a switching unit that switches supply of the gas to either the first airbag group or the second airbag group.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">An airbag device of the present disclosure includes a first airbag group and a second airbag group disposed in a vehicle seat, and a gas generation unit and a switching unit disposed in a seat cushion. The airbag device protects the occupant by deploying an airbag included in the first airbag group against an impact from one direction. Furthermore, the airbag device protects the occupant by deploying an airbag included in the second airbag group against an impact from other directions different from the one direction. Thus, the airbag device can protect the occupant against impacts from two different directions. In addition, the airbag device merely needs to deploy the airbag necessary for occupant protection according to the direction of the impact, and thus each airbag merely needs to have a volume of an extent the occupant can be protected from the impact in one direction, a portion to protect in the occupant is assigned by a plurality of airbags, and the volume of each airbag can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">Furthermore, the airbag device can reduce the volume of each airbag, making it possible to reduce the amount of gas required for the deployment of the airbag, and to also miniaturize the gas generation unit. As a result, the airbag device makes it possible for the vehicle seat on which each airbag and gas generation unit are mounted to be made thinner. As described above, the airbag device can protect the occupant while making the vehicle seat thinner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">In the airbag device described above, the first airbag group may be disposed in a seat back, of the vehicle seat, that supports the back of the occupant, and at least one of the plurality of airbags constituting the second airbag group may be disposed in the seat cushion. According to the airbag device having such a configuration, by folding the plurality of airbags included in the first airbag group to reduce the bulk and disposing the airbags in the seat back, the seat back can be thinned.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">In the airbag device described above, the gas generation unit may be constituted of one gas generator, the airbag device may further include a main gas path connecting the gas generation unit and the switching unit, a first gas path connecting the switching unit and the first airbag group, and a second gas path connecting the switching unit and the second airbag group, and the plurality of airbags included in either one of the first airbag group or the second airbag group may be connected to at least either one of the first gas path or the second gas path, in series at different distances from the switching unit. According to the airbag device having such a configuration, the deployment order of the plurality of airbags can be set for occupant protection. Thus, the airbag device can protect the occupant.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">In the airbag device described above, the switching unit may be a pyro-type valve disposed in the seat cushion. The pyro-type valve is operable only by the ignition current of an explosive, and can be used as a valve for switching the gas flow path.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">In the airbag device described above, the plurality of airbags included in the first airbag group and the plurality of airbags included in the second airbag group may differ in total volume, and a valve may be disposed in the first gas path or the second gas path connecting one, of the first airbag group and the second airbag group, having a smaller total volume, and the switching unit, the valve communicating an inside of the path and an outside thereof when the inside of the path becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined pressure. In a case where gas is supplied to either the first airbag group or the second airbag group with one gas generator, the gas generator is set with the supply amount of gas (the generated amount of gas) in accordance with the airbag group having a larger total volume. Thus, when gas is supplied to the airbag group having a smaller total volume from the gas generator, it is not preferable as load is applied to each airbag included in the relevant airbag group. Thus, the load on each airbag can be reduced by providing, on either one of the gas paths, the valve that discharges excessive gas to the outside when the inside of the path becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined pressure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">In the airbag device described above, an impact from one direction, of the impacts from the two directions, may occur due to a side collision of the vehicle, the first airbag group may include a first side airbag that deploys in an occurrence side of the side collision, and a second side airbag that deploys in a side opposite to the occurrence side, the first airbag group may have a smaller total volume than the second airbag group, and the first gas path may have a larger cross-sectional area than the second gas path. In the airbag device having such a configuration, the first side airbag is deployed in the occurrence side of the side collision, and the second side airbag is deployed in the side opposite to the occurrence side. The total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the first airbag group is smaller than the total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the second airbag group. Since the volume of gas supplied from the gas generation unit cannot be changed for the cases in which the first airbag group is deployed and in which the second airbag group is deployed, the total volume of the first airbag group is made smaller than the total volume of the second airbag group, and thus the first side airbag can be deployed in a shorter period of time than airbags of the second airbag group. In addition, the first gas path can increase the flow rate of gas per unit time by increasing the cross-sectional area than the second gas path, and thus a large amount of gas can be supplied in a short period of time, and each airbag included in the first airbag group can be deployed in a relatively short period of time. Note that the cross-sectional area here is the area of the cross section in a direction orthogonal to the flow direction of the gas.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">Here, in the airbag device described above, the gas generation unit may be configured to include a first gas generator and a second gas generator, the switching unit may be a control unit configured to independently operate the first gas generator or the second gas generator based on information indicating that impact from either one of the two directions has been received, the airbag device may further include a first gas path connecting the first gas generator and the first airbag group and a second gas path connecting the second gas generator and the second airbag group, and the plurality of airbags included in either one of the first airbag group or the second airbag group may be connected to at least one of the first gas path or the second gas path, in series at different distances from the first gas generator or the second gas generator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">As in the configuration, the airbag device may include two gas generators. As a result, the airbag device can deploy both the first airbag group and the second airbag group when the vehicle is subjected to impact from both directions of the two different directions, and thus the occupant can be protected even when the vehicle is subjected to impact from both directions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">In the airbag device described above, an impact from one direction, of the impacts from the two directions, may occur due to a side collision of the vehicle, the first airbag group may include a first side airbag that deploys in an occurrence side of the side collision, and a second side airbag that deploys in a side opposite to the occurrence side, a total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the first airbag group may be smaller than a total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the second airbag group, the first gas path may have a larger cross-sectional area than the second gas path, and a volume of the gas to be generated may be smaller in the first gas generator than in the second gas generator. According to the airbag device having such a configuration, each airbag included in the first airbag group can be deployed in a relatively short period of time than each airbag included in the second airbag group, and the occupant can be protected.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0020">According to the technology of the present disclosure, it is possible to protect the occupant while making the vehicle seat thinner.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an outer appearance perspective view of a vehicle seat on which an airbag device according to a first embodiment is disposed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view (1) of a pyro-type valve provided in the airbag device according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view (2) of a pyro-type valve provided in the airbag device according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view (3) of a pyro-type valve provided in the airbag device according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an outer appearance perspective view of a vehicle seat on which an airbag device according to a second embodiment is disposed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0026">Embodiments of an airbag device according to the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the drawings.

Note that the upper right side with respect to the anchor portion is the shoulder belt <b>5</b>A, and the right side with respect to the anchor portion is the lap belt <b>5</b>B.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">The airbag device according to the present embodiment is mounted on the vehicle seat <b>1</b> to protect an occupant seated in the vehicle seat <b>1</b> disposed in a vehicle. Specifically, the airbag device according to the present embodiment includes a first airbag group <b>8</b> and a second airbag group <b>9</b> that are disposed in the vehicle seat <b>1</b> in correspondence with impacts from two different directions and that respectively include a plurality of airbags.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">The first airbag group <b>8</b> is installed in correspondence with an impact from a side direction of the vehicle. The first airbag group <b>8</b> includes a first side airbag <b>8</b>A and a second side airbag <b>8</b>B. The first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B are stored in the seat back <b>3</b>. In the airbag device according to the present embodiment, gas is supplied to the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B when the vehicle undergoes a side collision and impact occurs from the side direction of the vehicle, thus deploying the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B to protect the occupant. The first side airbag <b>8</b>A is disposed on the right side of the seat back <b>3</b>, and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B is disposed on the left side of the seat back <b>3</b>. Additionally, in the present embodiment, the vehicle seat <b>1</b> is disposed on the right side of the vehicle, and the first side airbag <b>8</b>A is deployed between the waist of the occupant and the vehicle body side surface by the supply of gas to hold the waist of the occupant, thus suppressing the waist from colliding with the vehicle body side surface. On the other hand, the second side airbag <b>8</b>B is deployed between the occupant seated in the vehicle seat <b>1</b> and the next occupant seated in the next vehicle seat installed on the left side of the vehicle seat <b>1</b> by the supply of gas, thus suppressing the head of the adjacent occupant from colliding with the occupant.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">The second airbag group <b>9</b> is installed in correspondence with an impact from a front direction of the vehicle. The second airbag group <b>9</b> includes a seat airbag <b>9</b>A and a seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B to protect the occupant against an impact from the front direction of the vehicle when the vehicle undergoes a front collision.

The gas generator <b>10</b> generates gas by combusting the gas generating agent. The airbag device according to the present embodiment deploys each airbag by supplying gas generated by the gas generator <b>10</b> to the first airbag group <b>8</b> or the second airbag group <b>9</b>. Note that the gas generator <b>10</b> may be a hybrid-type in which compressed air and gas generating agents are enclosed inside to supply compressed gas and combustion gas; or a stored-type consisting only of compressed gas.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">Furthermore, the airbag device according to the present embodiment includes a pyro-type valve <b>11</b> that switches supply of gas to either the first airbag group <b>8</b> or the second airbag group <b>9</b>. In the present embodiment, the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> is an example of a switching unit. The pyro-type valve <b>11</b> instantaneously obtains a large kinetic energy. The pyro-type valve <b>11</b> is operable only by the current for igniting an explosive, and operates with small power compared to an electromagnetic valve. Note that an electromagnetic valve may be used for the switching unit. Furthermore, a detailed configuration of the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> will be described later.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">Furthermore, the airbag device according to the present embodiment includes a main gas path <b>12</b> connecting the gas generator <b>10</b> and the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>, a first gas path <b>13</b> connecting the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> and the first airbag group <b>8</b>, and a second gas path <b>14</b> connecting the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> and the second airbag group <b>9</b>. The main gas path <b>12</b> is disposed in the seat cushion <b>2</b>, and the first gas path <b>13</b> and the second gas path <b>14</b> are disposed inside across from the seat cushion <b>2</b> to the seat back <b>3</b>. The gas supplied from the gas generator <b>10</b> moves through the main gas path <b>12</b> to the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. The pyro-type valve <b>11</b> can switch supply of gas to either the first airbag group <b>8</b> or the second airbag group <b>9</b>. The gas is supplied to the first airbag group <b>8</b> through the first gas path <b>13</b>, and the gas is supplied to the second airbag group <b>9</b> through the second gas path <b>14</b>. The airbag device according to the present embodiment deploys the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B of the first airbag group <b>8</b> when an impact occurs from the side direction of the vehicle, and deploys the seat airbag <b>9</b>A and the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B of the second airbag group <b>9</b> when an impact occurs from the front direction of the vehicle. As a result, the airbag device can protect the occupant even when either the side collision or the front collision has occurred.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">Next, a connection mode of the first airbag group <b>8</b> with respect to the first gas path <b>13</b> and a connection mode of the second airbag group <b>9</b> with respect to the second gas path <b>14</b> will be described. In the first gas path <b>13</b>, the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B included in the first airbag group <b>8</b> are connected in series at different distances from the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. Note that the distance here is the distance along the first gas path <b>13</b>. In the present embodiment, the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B are connected to the first gas path <b>13</b> in order from the one closer in distance along the first gas path <b>13</b>, with respect to the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. Thus, the airbag device according to the present embodiment can first deploy the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and then deploy the second side airbag <b>8</b>B when an impact from the side direction (the right side direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) occurs in the vehicle. The airbag device first deploys the first side airbag <b>8</b>A to hold the waist of the occupant seated in the vehicle seat <b>1</b>, and then deploys the second side airbag <b>8</b>B to suppress the head of a next occupant from colliding with the occupant. This enables the airbag device according to the present embodiment to protect the occupant seated in the vehicle seat <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">In the second gas path <b>14</b>, the seat airbag <b>9</b>A and the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B included in the second airbag group <b>9</b> are connected in series at different distances from the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. Note that the distance here is the distance along the second gas path <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, the seat airbag <b>9</b>A and the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B are connected to the second gas path <b>14</b> in such an order from the one closer in distance along the second gas path <b>14</b> with respect to the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. Specifically, the second gas path <b>14</b> includes an upstream gas path <b>14</b>A connecting the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> and the seat airbag <b>9</b>A, and a downstream gas path <b>14</b>B connecting the seat airbag <b>9</b>A and the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B. When gas is supplied to the second airbag group <b>9</b>, gas is supplied to the seat airbag <b>9</b>A through the upstream gas path <b>14</b>A, and gas is supplied to the downstream gas path <b>14</b>B via the seat airbag <b>9</b>A. Then, gas is supplied from the downstream gas path <b>14</b>B to the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B. In the airbag device according to the present embodiment, the seat airbag <b>9</b>A is first deployed and then the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B is deployed when an impact from the front direction occurs in the vehicle. As a result, the airbag device causes the seat airbag <b>9</b>A to be deployed before the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B when an impact from the front direction occurs in the vehicle, thus securing the buttocks region of the occupant and suppressing the occupant from moving forward. Note that in the second airbag group <b>9</b>, the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B and the seat airbag <b>9</b>A may be connected to the second gas path <b>14</b> in such an order from the one closer in distance with respect to the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. In this case, when an impact from the front direction occurs in the vehicle, the airbag device may deploy the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B before the seat airbag <b>9</b>A to hold from the chest to the abdomen of the occupant first.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">Note that, the main gas path <b>12</b>, the first gas path <b>13</b>, and the second gas path <b>14</b> are formed of, for example, a predetermined metal, but may be formed of a flexible member such as rubber, or a frame pipe of the vehicle seat <b>1</b> may be used. Furthermore, the connecting portion of the seat cushion <b>2</b> and the seat back <b>3</b> in the first gas path <b>13</b> may be formed of a flexible member such as rubber, and even when the seat back <b>3</b> is inclined from the initial position, each gas path is prevented from breaking.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">In addition, in the first airbag group <b>8</b>, the first side airbag <b>8</b>A is disposed on the side surface side of the vehicle body and thus is deployed in the occurrence side of the side collision, and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B is deployed in the side opposite to the occurrence side. Furthermore, the total volume of the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B included in the first airbag group <b>8</b> is smaller than the total volume of the seat airbag <b>9</b>A and the seatbelt airbag <b>9</b>B included in the second airbag group <b>9</b>. This is because between the spacing between the vehicle side surface and the occupant and the spacing between the occupant and the structure in front thereof, the spacing between vehicle side surface and the occupant is relatively narrower, and the first side airbag <b>8</b>A deployed between the vehicle side surface and the occupant needs to be more quickly deployed than each airbag of the second airbag group <b>9</b>. Since the volume of gas supplied from the gas generator <b>10</b> cannot be changed for the cases in which the first airbag group <b>8</b> is deployed and in which the second airbag group <b>9</b> is deployed, the total volume of the first airbag group <b>8</b> is made smaller than the total volume of the second airbag group <b>9</b>, and thus the first side airbag <b>8</b>A can be deployed in a shorter period of time than airbags of the second airbag group <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">Furthermore, in the first gas path <b>13</b> connecting the first airbag group <b>8</b> which, in the first airbag group <b>8</b> and the second airbag group <b>9</b>, has a smaller total volume, and the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>, a valve <b>15</b> is disposed that communicates the inside of the path and the outside thereof when the inside of the path becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined pressure. An electromagnetic valve, for example, is used as the valve <b>15</b>. The valve <b>15</b> is controlled and opened by a control circuit when a pressure sensor (not illustrated) disposed in the first gas path <b>13</b> detects that the pressure is greater than or equal to the predetermined pressure. The control circuit is, for example, an ECU <b>16</b> to be described later. In this case, the pressure sensor is electrically connected to the ECU <b>16</b>. In a case where gas is supplied to either the first airbag group <b>8</b> or the second airbag group <b>9</b> with one gas generator <b>10</b>, as with the present embodiment, the gas supply amount is set in the gas generator <b>10</b> in accordance with the second airbag group <b>9</b> having a larger total volume. Thus, when gas is supplied from the gas generator <b>10</b> to the first airbag group <b>8</b> having a smaller total volume, it is not preferable as load is applied to each airbag included in the first airbag group <b>8</b>. Thus, the load on each airbag can be reduced by providing, on the first gas path <b>13</b>, the valve <b>15</b> that discharges excessive gas to the outside when the inside of the path becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined pressure. Furthermore, instead of the valve <b>15</b>, a weakened part that opens when the inside of the first gas path <b>13</b> becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined pressure may be formed in the first gas path <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">Furthermore, in the airbag device according to the present embodiment, the first gas path <b>13</b> is formed with a larger cross-sectional area than the second gas path <b>14</b>. Note that the cross-sectional area here is the area of the cross section in a direction orthogonal to the flow direction of the gas. The flow rate of gas per unit time can be increased as the cross-sectional area of the gas path becomes larger, and thus a large amount of gas can be supplied in a short period of time, and the airbag connected to the relevant gas path can be deployed in a relatively short period of time. In the present embodiment, by forming the first gas path <b>13</b> to have a larger cross-sectional area than the second gas path <b>14</b>, when deploying the airbags, each airbag included in the first airbag group <b>8</b> can be deployed in a shorter period of time than each airbag included in the second airbag group <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">Next, the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref> are cross-sectional views taken along the axial direction of the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> in a state in which gas is supplied to the first airbag group <b>8</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> in a state in which gas is supplied to the second airbag group <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">The pyro-type valve <b>11</b> has a cylinder <b>111</b> formed of metal and having a hollow columnar shape.

The ECU <b>16</b> is electrically connected to a sensor <b>17</b> that is mounted on the vehicle to detect a front collision and a sensor <b>18</b> that is mounted on the vehicle to detect a side collision. The ECU <b>16</b> transmits a control signal to the airbag device when the sensor <b>17</b> detects a side collision or when the sensor <b>18</b> detects a front collision. This control signal is specifically the ignition current for each igniter of the gas generator <b>10</b> and the pyro-type valve <b>11</b>.

In addition, even when the occupant seated in a vehicle seat behind the vehicle seat <b>1</b> moves forward by inertial force and collides with the seat back <b>3</b> at the time of a front collision of the vehicle, the degree of damage of the occupant can be minimized as the gas generator <b>10</b> and the pyro-type valve <b>11</b> made of relatively hard metal are not disposed in the seat back <b>3</b>. Furthermore, the airbag device according to the present embodiment merely needs to deploy the airbag necessary for occupant protection according to the direction of impact, and therefore, each airbag merely needs to have a volume of an extent that can protect the occupant from an impact in one direction, and the volume of each airbag can be reduced. Furthermore, the airbag device protects the required protecting portion with an independent airbag, and thus the volume of each airbag can be reduced.

For example, when the ECU <b>16</b> determines that the vehicle has received an impact from the side direction and the control unit <b>22</b> receives such information, the control unit <b>22</b> operates the first gas generator <b>20</b> to deploy each airbag of the first airbag group <b>8</b>. In addition, when the ECU <b>16</b> determines that the vehicle has received an impact from the side direction and the control unit <b>22</b> receives such information, the control unit <b>22</b> operates the second gas generator <b>21</b> to deploy each airbag of the second airbag group <b>9</b>. Furthermore, when the ECU <b>16</b> determines that the vehicle has received an impact from both the side direction and the front direction and the control unit <b>22</b> receives such information, the control unit <b>22</b> operates the first gas generator <b>20</b> and the second gas generator <b>21</b> to deploy both the airbags of the first airbag group <b>8</b> and the airbags of the second airbag group <b>9</b>. Note that the operation timing of the first gas generator <b>20</b> and the second gas generator <b>21</b> may be determined depending on whether to simultaneously deploy the first airbag group <b>8</b> and the second airbag group <b>9</b> or to deploy one of the airbag groups first, or the operation timing of the gas generator that supplies gas to the airbag group may be determined based on the deployment timing of the airbag group to be deployed later.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">Thus, for example, the airbag device according to the present embodiment can deploy both the first airbag group <b>8</b> and the second airbag group <b>9</b> when, for example, the vehicle undergoes multiple collisions and is subjected to impact from both the side direction and the front direction. As a result, the airbag device can protect the occupant even when the vehicle is subjected to impact from both the side direction and the front direction.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">Moreover, the airbag device according to the present embodiment includes the first airbag group <b>8</b> and the second airbag group <b>9</b> disposed in the vehicle seat <b>1</b>, and the first gas generator <b>20</b>, the second gas generator <b>21</b>, and the control unit <b>22</b> disposed in the seat cushion <b>2</b>. The airbag device makes it possible for the seat back <b>3</b> to be made thinner by providing, in the seat back <b>3</b>, the first side airbag <b>8</b>A and the second side airbag <b>8</b>B, whose bulk can be reduced by folding, and having the first gas generator <b>20</b>, the second gas generator <b>21</b>, and the control unit <b>22</b> disposed in the seat cushion <b>2</b>. As described above, the airbag device according to the present embodiment can protect the occupant while making the vehicle seat <b>1</b> thinner.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Other Examples</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0062">The embodiments according to the present invention have been described, but various embodiments described above can be combined as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">Furthermore, the total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the second airbag group <b>9</b>, the total volume of the plurality of airbags included in the first airbag group <b>8</b>, may be reduced. In this case, the valve <b>15</b> may be disposed in the second gas path <b>14</b>, and the second gas paths <b>14</b>, <b>24</b> may be formed to have a larger cross-sectional area than the first gas paths <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">Each aspect disclosed in the present specification can be combined with any other feature disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0065"><b>1</b> Vehicle seat</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0066"><b>2</b> Seat cushion</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0067"><b>3</b> Seat back</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0068"><b>4</b> Headrest</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0069"><b>5</b> Seatbelt</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0070"><b>6</b> Retractor</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0071"><b>7</b> Fixing portion</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0072"><b>8</b> First airbag group</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0073"><b>9</b> Second airbag group</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0074"><b>10</b> Gas generator</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0075"><b>11</b> Pyro-type valve</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0076"><b>12</b> Main gas path</li>    <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0077"><b>13</b> First gas path</li>    <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0078"><b>14</b> Second gas path</li>    <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0079"><b>15</b> Valve</li>    <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0080"><b>16</b> ECU</li>    <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0081"><b>17</b> Sensor</li>    <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0082"><b>18</b> Sensor</li>    <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0083"><b>20</b> First gas generator</li>    <li id="ul0002-0020" num="0084"><b>21</b> Second gas generator</li>    <li id="ul0002-0021" num="0085"><b>22</b> Control unit</li>    <li id="ul0002-0022" num="0086"><b>23</b> First gas path</li>    <li id="ul0002-0023" num="0087"><b>24</b> Second gas path</li>    <li id="ul0002-0024" num="0088"><b>111</b> Cylinder</li>    <li id="ul0002-0025" num="0089"><b>112</b> Gas inlet</li>    <li id="ul0002-0026" num="0090"><b>113</b> First gas outlet</li>    <li id="ul0002-0027" num="0091"><b>114</b> Second gas outlet</li>    <li id="ul0002-0028" num="0092"><b>115</b> Piston</li>    <li id="ul0002-0029" num="0093"><b>116</b> Inner tube member</li>    <li id="ul0002-0030" num="0094"><b>117</b> Igniter</li>    <li id="ul0002-0031" num="0095"><b>118</b> Fixing portion</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
