In order to make the object, technical scheme and advantages of the present invention clearer, the present invention will be further described in detail with reference to the drawings and specific embodiments. It should be understood that the specific embodiments described herein are only configured to explain the present invention, and are not configured to limit the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. The following description of the embodiments is only for providing a better understanding of the present invention by illustrating examples of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that in this document, relational terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are only used to distinguish one entity or operation from another entity or operation, and do not necessarily require or imply any such actual relationship or order between these entities or operations. Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or any other variation thereof are intended to cover non-exclusive inclusion, so that a process, method, article or device including a series of elements includes not only those elements, but also other elements not explicitly listed, or elements inherent to such process, method, article or device. Without further restrictions, the elements defined by the sentence &#x201c;including . . . &#x201d; do not exclude the existence of other identical elements in the process, method, article or device including the elements.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At present, personalized pictures provided by users can be used as card surface pictures of smart cards. For example, the smart cards may be bank cards, membership cards, subway cards, or the like.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Take a bank card as an example. In addition to the card surface picture, the bank card also contains necessary contents such as a chip, bank emblem, bank card account number, user name, bank card validity period, and an institution to which the bank card belongs. However, a position of the necessary contents of the bank card in the card surface needs to meet certain regulations or meet the requirements of the bank card institutions. Images in personalized pictures submitted by users, for example, the personalized pictures include a bird, which the user needs to display on the bank card. However, some necessary contents of the bank card may block the images that users want to display. Therefore, the images that users want to display need to be in a certain positional relationship with the necessary contents of the bank card. For example, if the user wants to take a character picture as the card surface picture of the bank card, the face region of the figure picture cannot be blocked by the necessary contents of the bank card when fabricating the bank card. If this appears, it will affect the beauty of the bank card and reduce the user experience.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to ensure that the card surface of the bank card meets the relevant requirements and meets the personalized needs of users, it is needed to manually review the card surface picture selected by the user. However, it is inefficient to manually review the card surface picture of the smart card.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Therefore, embodiments of the present invention provide a method, an apparatus, a device, and a storage medium for detecting a card surface picture. In the method for detecting a card surface picture, a user can upload a customized picture to a server through a terminal device, and the customized picture may be a character picture, a cartoon picture, a plant picture, or an art word picture. After receiving the customized picture uploaded by the user, the server detects the conformity of the customized picture uploaded by the user by using the method for detecting a card surface picture. In response to that the customized picture is unqualified, the server feeds back a detection result to the terminal device, and the user re-uploads a new customized picture based on the detection result received by the terminal device. For example, the size and shape of a previously uploaded customized picture can be modified and the like. In response to that the customized picture is qualified, the customized picture can be used as the card surface picture of the smart card and the review is passed. The server sends the customized picture to a card fabrication data server, and the card fabrication data server makes a smart card based on the customized picture.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Users can also upload a customized picture to the terminal device, and the terminal device detects the conformity of the customized picture uploaded by the user by using the method for detecting a card surface picture. In response to that the customized picture is unqualified, the terminal device can generate prompt information to prompt the user that the customized picture is unqualified, and the user can adjust a position of the image to be shown in the customized picture or replace the customized picture. In response to that the customized picture is qualified, the terminal device can send the customized picture and user information to the server. The server can check whether there is any illegal information in the user information, for example, whether the ID number of the user is a forged ID number, whether the user commits illegal acts, etc. After the user information is approved, the server sends the customized picture to a card fabrication data server. The terminal device can also directly send the customized picture to the card fabrication data server after the customized picture is detected to be qualified by the method for detecting a card surface picture. The card fabrication data server makes a smart card according to the customized picture.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The following firstly describes a method for detecting a card surface picture provided by an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic flow chart of a method for detecting a card surface provided by an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method for detecting a card surface picture includes: S<b>101</b>: identifying region information of an image to be shown in a target picture.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment of the present invention, the target picture is a user-customized picture, which can be used as a card surface picture of a prefabricated card, wherein the target picture can be a character picture, a cartoon picture, a plant picture, or a word art picture. The image to be shown may be a character head in a character picture, an animal head in an animal picture, a cartoon image in a cartoon picture, a plant image in a plant picture, a word of art in a word art picture, and the like. The region information may be a size of the region and a shape of the region of the image to be shown. The target picture may include at least one image to be shown. For example, the target picture may be a family photo, and there are 5 people in the family photo, so the head region of these 5 people are all images to be shown. The prefabricated cards may be bank cards and subway cards customized by users.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Before identifying the target picture, it is firstly needed to obtain the target picture uploaded by the user. After obtaining the target picture, it is needed to identify the image to be shown in the target picture and determine the region information of the image to be shown. In an embodiment, artificial intelligence can be used to identify the image to be shown. For example, if the image to be shown in the target picture is a face image, then face recognition can be used to identify the image to be shown.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At S<b>102</b>, a picture to be detected is generated according to the region information of the image to be shown.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A specific process of generating the picture to be detected may as follows: generating a first picture having the same size as the prefabricated card, and the first picture may be transparent, that is, pixel values of the first picture may be first pixel values corresponding to colorless and transparent. After obtaining the first picture, drawing the first region on the first picture according to the identified region information of the image to be shown. The first region is a region corresponding to the image to be shown, including a size and a shape of the region corresponding to the image to be shown. The shape of the first region may be rectangular, circular, or an outline shape of the image to be shown. After drawing the first region on the first picture, a picture to be detected is obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Herein, a region of the picture to be detected other than the first region may also be transparent. The first region may be filled with a color, such as yellow. The pixel values of the region filled with the color are pixel values corresponding to yellow, i.e., second pixel values.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At S<b>103</b>, the picture to be detected and a preset picture are synthesized to obtain a synthesized picture, wherein the synthesized picture includes the first region and a second region.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">After generating the picture to be detected, the synthesized picture needs to be generated based on the picture to be detected and the preset picture. Before generating the synthesized picture, an embodiment of the present invention further provides a method for specifically generating the preset picture, specifically including: identifying region information and location information of a content region on a prefabricated card; generating a second picture having the same size as the prefabricated card; and drawing the second region on the second picture to generate a preset picture according to the region information and the positional information of the content region.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment of the present invention, taking a bank card as an example, the bank card includes a chip, and may also include necessary contents such as bank emblem, bank card account number, user name, bank card validity period, and institution to which the bank card belongs. Each necessary content occupies a certain region on the bank card, which may be expressed as a rectangular box.

The necessary contents in the content region may include user-customized content.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Generating the second picture having the same size as the prefabricated card. The second picture may be transparent, that is, a pixel value of the second picture is a first pixel value corresponding to colorless and transparent.

The synthesized picture includes the first region and the second region. The first region and the second region in the synthesized picture may overlap with each other. If the first region and the second region in the synthesized picture overlap with each other, the necessary contents corresponding to the second region block the image to be shown corresponding to the first region, that is to say, the target picture is unqualified. For example, if the first region is yellow and the second region is blue, the overlapped region is green. Then, if the second region blocks the first region, a pixel value corresponding to green will be detected. A region of the synthesized picture other than the first region and the second region may be transparent.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At S<b>104</b>, in response to that it is detected that a fourth pixel value is contained in the synthesized picture, it is determined that the target picture is unqualified.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is detected whether a fourth pixel is synthesized in the synthesized picture. The region of the synthesized picture other than the first region and the second region is transparent. For example, the first region is yellow and the second region is blue. If the first region and the second region do not overlap, only yellow and blue are contained in the synthesized picture. If the first region and the second region have an overlapping part, the superimposed color of yellow and blue is green. If a pixel value corresponding to green is detected, the target picture is unqualified. At this time, a detection result may be fed back to a user, so that the user provides a qualified target picture, and prevents the image to be shown from being blocked by the necessary contents, thereby improving the user experience. If no pixel value corresponding to green is detected, the target picture is qualified. The embodiment of the present invention determines the conformity of the target picture by detecting pixel values corresponding to different colors in the synthesized picture, so that the error rate can be low, and the review speed of the picture can be improved.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, in order to make the image to be shown be completely synthesized in the synthesized picture, that is to say, the image to be shown may be completely displayed on the card surface of the prefabricated card after the prefabricated card is completed, thereby improving the user experience, it is needed to detect whether the image to be shown is completely synthesized in the synthesized picture.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Specifically, pixel values of a preset edge region of the preset picture are fifth pixel values; the method further includes: in response to that it is detected that a preset edge region of the synthesized picture includes a sixth pixel value, determining that the target picture is unqualified.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an embodiment of the present invention, for example, the preset edge region of the preset picture may be filled with red, where the preset edge region is a region within each edge of the preset picture. The region of the preset edge region is small. For another example, if a region to be detected is yellow, and if orange is detected in the synthesized picture, the first region overlaps with the preset edge region, so the first region corresponding to the image to be shown may not be completely synthesized on the synthesized picture, that is to say, the target picture is unqualified.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The preset edge region may also be blue. If the first region overlaps with the preset edge region, the overlapping region is green.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The unqualified target picture may be due to an incorrect placement of the image to be shown in the picture to be detected. A position of the first region in the picture to be detected may be adjusted. Of course, the picture position may also be adjusted for other reasons, so as to adjust the position of the first region in the picture to be detected, and then the preset picture and the picture to be detected are synthesized again to obtain a new synthesized picture. A pixel value of the new synthesized picture is detected.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In response to that it is detected that a number of the adjustments of the first region have reached a preset number of the adjustments and the target picture is still unqualified, replacement prompt information is generated to prompt the user to replace the target picture. Then, according to the method for detecting a card surface picture of S<b>101</b>-S<b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the conformity of the replaced target picture can be detected.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, the method for detecting a card surface picture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may also be applied to a terminal device, where the terminal device may detect the conformity of the target picture in real time. After the terminal device receives the target picture uploaded by a user, the terminal device may display a location of the target picture to the user in real time through an application or a web page. The user may also intuitively understand the adjustment method of the target picture and then adjust the picture. For example, the application of the terminal device is provided with a display region in the same size as the prefabricated card. The display region may also include the content region of the prefabricated card. The display region may display a relative position between the image to be shown in the target picture and the content region when the card is made. Meanwhile, the terminal device also detects the conformity of the target picture by adopting the method for detecting a card surface picture of S<b>101</b>-S<b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In response to that it is detected that the target picture is unqualified, an adjustment prompt message is generated, which is used to prompt the user to adjust the position of the target picture and the way in which the user adjusts the target picture. For example, the adjustment prompt message may be to adjust the target picture to the left by about 2 cm.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the method for detecting a card surface picture provided by the embodiment of the invention, the region of the image to be shown in the target picture and the content region in the prefabricated card are synthesized on the synthesized picture.
