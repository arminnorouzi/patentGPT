Introduction</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0026">Disclosed herein are pharmaceutical compositions (such as topical compositions) comprising an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises a liquid oil component; one or both of a cross-linked homopolymer based on acrylic acid and a cross-linked copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters; and water. In some embodiments, the composition is a vehicle for the delivery of an active agent. As detailed herein, it has been discovered that cross-linked polymers based on acrylic acid form emulsions that provide stable conditions where emulsion droplets retain their distribution across time and temperature, active pharmaceutical ingredients retain their chemical integrity even without the presence of stabilizing agents, such as sequestering or anti-oxidant agents, and dermal and ocular disposition of a given active pharmaceutical ingredient can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">Furthermore, as detailed herein, it has been surprisingly discovered that cross-linked homopolymers based on acrylic acid can function as a first emulsifier to form a stable emulsion with an oil component, even in the absence of a surfactant or another polymeric component (i.e., without a second emulsifier). Thus, in another aspect, the present disclosure relates to compositions comprising a liquid oil component, a cross-linked homopolymer based on acrylic acid as a first emulsifier, and water, wherein the amount of the cross-linked homopolymer based on acrylic acid is sufficient to form a stable oil-in-water emulsion in the absence of a surfactant or another polymeric component (e.g., cross-linked copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">II. Definitions</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0028">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; when used to modify an amount specified in a numeric value or range, indicate that the numeric value as well as reasonable deviations from the value known to the skilled person in the art, for example, &#xb1;20%, &#xb1;10%, or +5%, or &#xb1;2.5%, or 1%, or &#xb1;0.5%, are within the intended meaning of the recited value.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;cross-linked homopolymer based on acrylic acid&#x201d; refers to a polymer comprising acrylic acid polymer chains that are cross-linked to each other. In some embodiments, the homopolymer is a predominantly high molecular weight cross-linked homopolymer of acrylic acid as described herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;cross-linked copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters&#x201d; refers to a polymer comprising acrylic acid and acrylic acid ester copolymers (e.g., block copolymers) that are cross-linked to each other. In some embodiments, the copolymer is a predominantly high molecular weight cross-linked copolymer of acrylic acid and alkyl acrylate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;active agent&#x201d; refers to a chemical material or compound that induces a desired pharmacological or physiological effect, and include agents that are therapeutically effective, prophylactically effective, or cosmeceutically effective. The term also encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives and analogs of those active agents specifically mentioned herein, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, inclusion complexes, analogs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of an agent (e.g., an active agent) that treats, alleviates, abates, or reduces the severity of symptoms of disease in a subject. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an agent (e.g., an active agent) diminishes symptoms, makes an injury, disease, or condition (e.g., a skin disorder) more tolerable, slows the rate of degeneration or decline, or improves a patient's physical or mental well-being. The effect of treatment can be compared to an individual or pool of individuals not receiving the treatment, or to the same patient prior to treatment or at a different time during treatment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">The term &#x201c;administer&#x201d; refers to a method of delivering agents, compounds, or compositions to the desired site of biological action. These methods include, but are not limited to, topical delivery or ocular delivery. In some embodiments, a composition as disclosed herein is administered topically (e.g., by applying a thin film of a lotion formulation to the affected area, such as the face, back, neck or shoulders of a subject with acne).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">The terms &#x201c;subject,&#x201d; &#x201c;individual,&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; as used interchangeably herein, refer to a mammal, including but not limited to humans, non-human primates, rodents (e.g., rats, mice, and guinea pigs), rabbits, dogs, cows, pigs, horses, and other mammalian species. In some embodiment, a subject, individual, or patient is a human.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">III. Compostions</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0035">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides compositions such as topical compositions comprising a liquid oil component and one or both of a cross-linked homopolymer based on acrylic acid and a cross-linked copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters, wherein the composition is an oil-in-water emulsion. In some embodiments, the composition is a vehicle for the delivery of an active agent. In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a lotion (e.g., an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion). In some embodiments, the composition is formulated as a cream.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">Compositions Comprising Polymeric Emulsifiers</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">Compositions according to the present disclosure generally include a cross-linked homopolymer as the first emulsifier.

Table 4 was manufactured according to the following manufacturing process:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0130">A polymeric phase is made. In a suitable manufacturing vessel, purified water, Carbomer homopolymer type A (Carbopol 981), and Carbomer copolymer type B (Pemulen TR-1) are added and mixed until the contents are dispersed. Next, mineral oil is added and mixed.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0131">Next, a moisturizing agent is prepared. Ina separate suitable vessel, sodium hyaluronate and purified water are added and mixed until the sodium hyaluronate is dissolved. The contents of the vessel containing the sodium hyaluronate is added to the polymeric phase and the contents are mixed.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0132">Next, a preservative phase is prepared. In a separate suitable vessel, glycerin is added and mixed while heating. Next, methylparaben and benzyl alcohol are added to the vessel and the contents are mixed until dissolved. The preservative phase is added to the vessel containing the polymeric phase, rinsed with glycerin, and mixed.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0133">Next, an active phase is prepared. In a separate suitable vessel, purified water and glycerin are added, mixed, and blanketed with nitrogen. Next, under yellow lighting, butylated hydroxytoluene, octoxynol 9, and tretinoin are added to the vessel. The contents are mixed and then milled with recirculation. Under yellow lighting, the contents of the vessel containing the active phase are transferred to the vessel containing the polymeric phase, rinsed with purified water, and mixed. Next, under yellow lighting, soluble collagen is added to the vessel containing the polymeric phase and mixed.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0134">Next, a neutralizing agent is prepared. In a separate suitable vessel, trolamine and purified water are added and mixed to form a solution having a pH of 5.0-6.0.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0135">Next, under yellow lighting, the contents of the vessel containing the polymeric phase are transferred to a new vessel, rinsed with purified water, agitated, and recirculated under nitrogen. The pH of the composition is determined and the pH is adjusted with the neutralizing agent as necessary. The contents of the vessel are then transferred to a bulk storage container for filling secondary packaging.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0136">Viscosity is determined in accordance with the current USP general chapter for viscosity determination. The test conditions include a temperature of 23&#xb0; t 2&#xb0; C., spindle 27, and a speed of 12 rpm. Typical viscosity of compositions of the present invention are in the range of about 9000 to about 11000 cP. Depending on the amounts of various components, viscosity values can range from about 2500 cP to about 18000 cP.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0137">Clinical Studies</p><p id="p-0119" num="0138">A tretinoin lotion formulated as disclosed in Table 4 above was tested in comparison to a vehicle lotion and in comparison to a commercially available tretinoin gel, ATRALIN&#xae; (0.05% tretinoin). As described herein, the tretinoin lotion demonstrated an unexpectedly improved local tolerability (i.e., low irritation) profile as compared to ATRALIN&#xae; gel.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0139">The safety and efficacy of once daily use of tretinoin lotion for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in subjects 9 years and older with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The trials compared 12 weeks of treatment with tretinoin lotion to the vehicle lotion. ATRALIN&#xae; gel and ATRALIN&#xae; gel vehicle were evaluated clinically in separate studies from the tretinoin lotion. The co-primary efficacy endpoints of absolute change in non-inflamatory lesion count, absolute change in inflammatory lesion count, and &#x201c;treatment success&#x201d; were assessed at Week 12. Treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the Evaluators Global Severity Score (EGSS) score and an EGSS score equating to &#x201c;clear&#x201d; or &#x201c;almost clear.&#x201d; Table 5 sets forth the EGSS scale that is used to assess the severity of the disease state.
