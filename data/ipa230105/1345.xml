air has been known in the art. Patent Document 1 discloses an air purifier that purifies contaminated air containing a volatile organic compound (VOC) generated in a clean room of an electronic device manufacturing plant or any other similar space. The air purifier includes a rotor (treater) having a treatment zone and a desorption zone, and a heater.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Passing room air through the treatment zone in the air purifier causes the VOC contained in the room air to be adsorbed onto an adsorbent. Thus, the VOC is separated and removed from the room air. Passing outside air heated by a heater (heating section) through the desorption zone in the air purifier increases the temperature of the desorption zone. Thus, the VOC is desorbed from the adsorbent in the desorption zone. In this manner, the rotor is regenerated to be able to adsorb the VOC again.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2017-51889</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of the present disclosure is directed to an air treatment device including: a treater (P) configured to capture a toxic substance contained in target air; a regenerator (R) configured to remove the toxic substance from the treater (P); a detector (<b>60</b>) configured to detect an index correlated with a concentration of the toxic substance contained in room air; and a control unit (<b>90</b>) configured to control the regenerator (R) according to a detection value detected by the detector (<b>60</b>).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a general configuration of an air treatment device according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a control operation performed by a control unit according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a general configuration of an air treatment device according to a second embodiment, and illustrates a state of the air treatment device that is performing a first operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a state of the air treatment device that is performing a second operation, and corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating relationship between a control unit according to the second embodiment and its peripheral devices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a timing chart showing how first and second adsorption columns operate.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An air treatment device (<b>10</b>) of a first embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The air treatment device (<b>10</b>) of this embodiment removes a toxic substance contained in air in an indoor space (<b>11</b>) of a building or any other similar construction (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;room air (RA)&#x201d;) to purify the air, and supplies the air from which the toxic substance has been removed, as supply air (SA), to the indoor space (<b>11</b>).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The indoor space (<b>11</b>) has an air return port (<b>11</b><i>a</i>) and an air supply port (<b>11</b><i>b</i>).

The outdoor air (OA) that has flowed into the first regeneration path (<b>31</b>) passes, as regeneration air, through the second fan (F<b>2</b>), and flows into the heater (H).

In the second operation, the sixth on-off valve (<b>46</b>) is opened, and the fifth on-off valve (<b>45</b>) is closed, thereby making the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>) communicate with the air supply port (<b>11</b><i>b</i>) of the indoor space (<b>11</b>). In the second operation, the fourth on-off valve (<b>44</b>) is closed, and the third on-off valve (<b>43</b>) is opened, thereby making the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) communicate with the suction pump (<b>80</b>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the second operation, an adsorption operation intended for the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>) and a regeneration operation and a resting operation both intended for the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) are performed. In the second operation, while the adsorption operation is being performed in the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>), the regeneration operation is performed in the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>), and then the resting operation is performed.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the adsorption operation, the fan (F) supplies target air through the first treatment path (<b>21</b>) and the second relay path (<b>72</b>) to the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>). In the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>), carbon dioxide contained in the supplied target air is adsorbed by the adsorbent. As a result, in the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>), treated air having a lower carbon dioxide concentration than the target air is produced. The produced treated air flows out of the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>), flows through the second treatment path (<b>22</b>), and is supplied, as supply air (SA), to the indoor space (<b>11</b>). The adsorption operation is executed over the predetermined first time.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the regeneration operation, the suction pump (<b>80</b>) is actuated to suck air from the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>). The internal pressure of the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) decreases to desorb carbon dioxide from the adsorbent. As a result, in the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>), exhaust air (EA) having a higher carbon dioxide concentration than the target air is produced. The produced exhaust air (EA) flows from the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) into the first relay path (<b>71</b>) and the suction passage (<b>81</b>), and is sucked into the suction pump (<b>80</b>). The suction pump (<b>80</b>) discharges the sucked exhaust air (EA) to the outside of the room. The regeneration operation is performed over the predetermined second time. When the duration of the regeneration operation reaches the second time, the suction pump (<b>80</b>) stops.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The resting operation is performed for the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) that has finished undergoing the regeneration operation. In the resting operation, the fifth on-off valve (<b>45</b>) is opened with the suction pump (<b>80</b>) at rest. Opening the fifth on-off valve (<b>45</b>) allows the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) to have a pressure equal to that of the supply air (SA). The first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) having a pressure equal to that of the supply air (SA) causes the flow of air in the suction passage (<b>81</b>) to stop.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Here, the predetermined first time during which the adsorption operation intended for the first adsorption column (<b>47</b>) in the first operation or the adsorption operation intended for the second adsorption column (<b>48</b>) in the second operation is performed is adjusted according to the carbon dioxide concentration detected by the detector (<b>60</b>). The predetermined second time during which the regeneration operation intended for the first adsorption column (<b>48</b>) in the first operation or the regeneration operation intended for the second adsorption column (<b>47</b>) in the second operation is performed is fixed irrespective of the carbon dioxide concentration detected by the detector (<b>60</b>).

In other words, the lower the carbon dioxide concentration in the indoor space (<b>11</b>) is, the longer the time during which the suction pump (<b>80</b>) is at rest per predetermined time becomes.
