For carrying out a magnetic resonance measurement, the examination object is usually positioned in a strong and homogeneous static magnetic field (BO field) of a magnetic resonance imaging device. The static magnetic field may comprise magnetic field strengths of 0.2 Tesla to 7 Tesla, thus aligning nuclear spins inside the examination object along the static magnetic field. For triggering so-called nuclear spin resonances, radiofrequency excitation pulses are emitted into the examination subject. Each radiofrequency excitation pulse causes a magnetization of nuclear spins within the examination object to deviate from the static magnetic field by an amount which is known as the flip angle. A radiofrequency excitation pulse may comprise an alternating (electro-)magnetic field with a frequency which corresponds to the Larmor frequency at the respective static magnetic field strength. Excited nuclear spins may exhibit a rotating and decaying magnetization (nuclear magnetic resonance), which can be detected using dedicated radiofrequency antennas. For spatial encoding of measured data, rapidly switched magnetic gradient fields are superimposed on the static magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The received nuclear magnetic resonances are typically digitized and stored as complex values in a k-space matrix. This k-space matrix can be used as a basis for a reconstruction of magnetic resonance images and for determining spectroscopic data. A magnetic resonance image is typically reconstructed by means of a multi-dimensional Fourier transformation of the k-space matrix.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During an imaging examination, the patient is typically enclosed in a bore or a pair of magnets of the magnetic resonance imaging device. Due to spatial restrictions within the bore or a space between the pair of magnets, magnetic resonance imaging provides limited use for surgical procedures or biopsies. As the patient needs to be positioned inside the magnetic resonance imaging device, a size of the bore as well as other dimensions of the magnetic resonance imaging device are dictated by the size of the human body. From a cost and/or space utilization perspective, this may be unsatisfactory, especially if the examination is restricted to a body region of the patient, which is significantly smaller than an imaging volume provided by the magnetic resonance imaging device. Furthermore, patients with a claustrophobic condition and children may not tolerate being positioned in a confined imaging space associated with conventional magnetic resonance imaging devise for a prolonged period of time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the disclosure to provide a magnetic resonance imaging device with enhanced openness and/or accessibility for imaging of dedicated body regions of a patient. This object is achieved by a magnetic resonance imaging device according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device comprises a field generation unit configured to provide a magnetic field in an imaging volume of the magnetic resonance imaging device, wherein the field generation unit comprises at least one magnet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A field generation unit may comprise one magnet or a plurality of magnets required for performing a magnetic resonance measurement. For example, the field generation unit may comprise at least one magnet configured to generate a static magnetic field inside an imaging volume of the magnetic resonance imaging device. A static magnetic field may be a main magnetic field and/or a BO-field of the magnetic resonance imaging device. The static magnetic field may comprise either an essentially homogeneous magnet field or a predetermined magnetic gradient field. In a further example, the field generation unit comprises at least one gradient coil for generating a temporary magnetic gradient field inside the imaging volume. It is also conceivable, that the field generation unit includes at least one radiofrequency antenna for emitting radiofrequency excitation pulses in a power and frequency range of a magnetic resonance measurement into an image acquisition region of the magnetic resonance imaging device. The at least one radiofrequency antenna may further be configured to receive magnetic resonance signals (nuclear magnetic resonance) from the image acquisition region. In one aspect, the at least one magnet may be configured as a main magnet for generating a static magnetic field inside the imaging volume. However, the at least one magnet may also correspond to a gradient coil, a set of gradient coils and/or a radiofrequency antenna of the magnetic resonance imaging device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An imaging volume may be characterized by a predefined magnetic field direction and/or a predefined magnetic field strength. For example, the imaging volume may comprise a volume with a substantially uniform magnetic field direction and/or magnetic field strength. Such a volume may be an isocenter of the magnetic resonance imaging device. It is also conceivable, that the imaging volume comprises a predefined magnetic gradient field. Such a magnetic gradient field may be used for spatial encoding of magnetic resonance signals acquired from an examination object positioned within the imaging volume.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet comprises a concave shape.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet may be a pole face of the at least one magnet. A pole face may be characterized by a terminating surface of the at least one magnet. It is conceivable, that a magnetic field strength at the pole face of the at least one magnet is particularly high. A pole face may also represent a side of the at least one magnet, which is directed towards or away from the imaging volume. In the case of a permanent magnet, a pole face may be a terminating surface of a north pole and/or a south pole. Particularly, the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet may relate to a surface of a magnetic material of the at least one magnet. In case the at least one magnet comprises resistive wires or superconducting wires, the pole face may relate to a surface of an imaginary membrane, an imaginary envelope or an imaginary envelope curve circumferentially enclosing the magnet.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet may be shaped such a way, that a perpendicular distance between a line oriented along a main direction of magnetic field lines within the imaging volume and the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet varies in the main direction of the magnetic field lines. It is conceivable, that the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet is characterized by an arc of a circle or an ellipse. For example, the surface directed towards the imaging volume may comprise the shape of a &#x201c;U&#x201d; or a &#x201c;C&#x201d;. In one aspect, the imaging volume is positioned within a recess or an indentation provided by the concave surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. A cross-section of the recess or indentation may comprise the shape of a parabola, a hyperbola, or a part of an ellipse or a circle. In one aspect, a topology or shape of the at least one magnet may correspond to a saddle. The at least one magnet may be designed to accommodate a pelvic region of a patient sitting upon the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. According to a further aspect, the at least one magnet may comprise the shape of a curved beam or a hyperboloid. The curved beam may be oriented along a sagittal plane of a patient sitting on the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. The shapes of a &#x2018;U&#x2019;, a &#x2018;C&#x2019; and/or a curved beam may be regarded as saddle-shapes within the meaning of the current disclosure. In one aspect, the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet may comprise a concave shape along an anterior-posterior direction of the patient and a convex shape along a left-right direction of the patient. However, the at least one magnet may also be designed to accommodate other body regions of the patient, such as a facial region, a head region, an extremity, a breast region and the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A direction of access to the imaging volume is oriented essentially perpendicular to a main direction of magnetic field lines in the imaging volume.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The direction of access to the imaging volume may be characterized by a substantially straight line leading from an arbitrary point in an environment, particularly an examination room, to a center of the imaging volume. Preferably, a trajectory defined by the line is unobstructed by components of the magnetic resonance imaging device. The direction of access relates to a trajectory along which a patient can enter the imaging volume.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The at least one magnet may confine the imaging volume in at least one spatial direction in such a way, that accessing or entering the imaging volume from a direction substantially corresponding to the at least one spatial direction is impractical or impossible. For example, the at least one magnet may bar or block an access to the imaging volume in any direction oriented in parallel with the main direction of magnetic field lines in the imaging volume. The at least one magnet preferably provides access to the imaging volume along at least two perpendicular spatial directions. The two perpendicular spatial directions may be oriented essentially perpendicular to the main direction of magnetic field lines in the imaging volume. The main direction of magnetic field lines in the imaging volume may be characterized by an average or a mean direction of a plurality of magnetic field vectors within the imaging volume.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device comprises a supporting structure configured for providing structural support to the field generation unit. The supporting structure may comprise a positioning unit configured to adjust a position and/or an orientation of the field generation unit in at least one or at least two spatial directions. Particularly, the positioning unit may be configured to position the field generation unit along one axis or along two perpendicular axes of a cartesian coordinate system. Preferably, the positioning unit is configured to position the field generation unit along three perpendicular axes of a cartesian coordinate system. For example, the positioning unit may comprise a rail system and/or a telescope system configured to transport the field generation unit along predetermined trajectories.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The positioning unit may further comprise a hinge and/or a movable joint configured for adjusting an orientation of the field generation unit. For example, the positioning unit may be configured to adapt a position and/or orientation of the field generation unit relative to a target anatomy of a patient. The patient may rest in a predefined posture, such as a lying position, a sitting position or a standing position, while the field generation unit is positioned and/or oriented relative to the patient. An adjustment of the position and/or orientation of the field generation unit may involve adjusting a position of the imaging volume to cover at least a part of the target anatomy of the patient. The patient may also be placed on a patient positioning device configured for positioning the patient in a desired relative position and/or orientation to the magnetic resonance imaging device. In providing a positioning unit, the position of the imaging volume of the magnetic resonance imaging device may favorably be adapted to a cover a target anatomy of an immobile or disabled patient.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further aspect, the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device may comprise a stray field containment unit configured to align a magnetic stray field of the field generation unit in such a way, that a magnetic field strength and/or a magnetic field homogeneity in a center of the imaging volume is increased.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, the stray field containment unit comprises a backing plate attached to the at least one magnet, wherein the backing plate comprises a ferromagnetic material and wherein the backing plate is attached to a surface directed away from the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. Preferably, the backing plate fully encloses or covers the surface directed away from the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. In a further aspect, the stray field containment unit comprises a yoke attached to the at least one magnet, wherein the yoke comprises a ferromagnetic material. Examples for ferromagnetic materials are iron, cobalt, nickel, but also lanthanoids, gadolinium and the like. Ferromagnetic materials may be deployed as a solid material or as a fluid. In an aspect, the backing plate and/or the yoke are made of iron, an iron alloy or any other material with a high magnetic permeability.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The yoke may represent a at least a part of the supporting structure. Thus, the yoke may provide structural support to the field generation unit and/or maintain a predefined shape of the at least one magnet. Particularly, the yoke may be configured to counteract attractive magnetic forces of sections of the at least one magnet. It is conceivable, that the yoke is attached to the surface directed away from the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. The yoke and/or the backing plate may comprise a concave shape to match a concave surface directed away from the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. In an aspect, the backing plate and/or the yoke act as a supporting structure according to an aspect described above. Particularly, the supporting structure, the backing plate and/or the yoke may be designed to enhance, restrict or shape a magnetic field of the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device. In providing a stray field containment unit according to an aspect described above, an alignment of the magnetic stray field can advantageously be achieved without limiting or compromising the accessibility of the imaging volume. As a further advantage, characteristics of the magnetic field within the imaging volume may favorably be improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect, the stray field unit further comprises a shield coil configured to align the magnetic stray field of the field generation unit in such a way, that a magnetic field strength and/or a magnetic field homogeneity in a center of the imaging volume is increased. The shield coil favorably comprises one or more coils are wires, which are arranged in a curved plane corresponding to the concave shape of the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. In an aspect, the shield coil is positioned adjacent to the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In providing at least one magnet with a concave surface directed towards the imaging volume, an openness of the field generation unit may favorably be enhanced in comparison to conventional magnetic resonance imaging devices. Thus, an access to the imaging volume may be facilitated, while still providing a sufficient coverage of a diagnostically relevant body region of a patient with magnetic material. Particularly, the disclosed magnetic resonance device may provide an easy and/or optimized access of a specific body region of a patient to the imaging volume with limited compromises regarding image quality and/or image acquisition time. Further advantages of the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device may be constituted by a cost and/or weight reduction in comparison to conventional magnetic resonance imaging devices.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one aspect of the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device, the at least one magnet is designed to provide access to the imaging volume along at least two perpendicular spatial directions, wherein each of the two perpendicular spatial directions is oriented essentially perpendicular to the main direction of magnetic field lines in the imaging volume.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the imaging volume may be at least partially embedded within the recess or indentation provided via the concave surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet. In an aspect, the at least one magnet comprises the shape of a curved beam, at least partially enclosing the imaging volume along a trajectory defined by the concave surface directed towards the imaging volume. The curved beam may comprise an arched outline or contour, at least partially enclosing the imaging volume. Preferably, the at least one magnet substantially encloses the imaging along an arc of a cross-section of an imaginary sphere with a center and a volume corresponding to a center and a volume of the imaging volume. Thus, the imaging volume may favorably be accessible from at least two directions oriented perpendicular to the main direction of magnetic field lines within the imaging volume. In an alternative aspect, the surface directed towards the imaging volume of the at least one magnet may also comprise a more three-dimensional shape, such as an inner surface of a cone or a hemisphere. Thus, the at least one magnet may enclose a larger part of the surface of the imaging volume. It is conceivable, that a maximum of 75%, 60%, 45% or 30% of an outer surface of the imaging volume is enclosed by the at least one magnet.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In providing access to the imaging volume along at least two perpendicular spatial directions, multiple ways of entering the imaging volume may be offered to a patient. Thus, a maximum number of body regions of a patient, which may be imaged via the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device, may favorably be increased. In offering multiple ways and/or directions of accessing the imaging volume, different groups of patients, such as children, elderly and/or disabled people, may favorably enter the imaging volume in a most comfortable manner.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further aspect of the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device, a shape of the imaging volume is adapted to a shape of a target anatomy of a patient.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The at least one magnet may be shaped in such a way, that the imaging volume is non-spherical. Preferably, the at least one magnet is shaped in such a way, that the shape of the imaging volume corresponds to the shape of a target anatomy of a patient. A target anatomy may comprise, for example, a jaw region, a jaw, an eye region, an eye, a part of a spine, a prostate, a heart, a brain or other organs or anatomies. Particularly, the at least one magnet may be shaped in such a way, that the imaging volume provided via the at least one magnet may take into account a variance in anatomical sizes, shapes and/or orientations of the target anatomy. For example, the at least one magnet may be adapted to key variance parameters of a target anatomy. Thus, the shape of the imaging volume provided via the at least one magnet may differ from an actual shape of a target anatomy, but fully cover the target anatomy, when the patient is positioned correctly relative to the disclosed magnetic resonance imaging device. It is also conceivable, that the imaging volume provided via the at least one magnet reduces a volume of any tissue different from tissue of the target anatomy.

The two positioning aids <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are configured for supporting the arms and the feet of the patient <b>15</b> in a predetermined position over the course of the magnetic resonance measurement. In the shown example, a position and/or orientation of the positioning aids <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be adapted automatically via the control unit <b>20</b>. For this purpose, the processing unit <b>24</b> may receive a body height, a body weight, a gender, an age and/or other patient information from a source (e.g., a hospital information system) and output control information to the control unit <b>20</b> in dependence of the patient information.

In contrast, the positioning aids <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d </i>may be cushions, which passively support the patient <b>15</b> to maintain the correct posture. Preferably, the positioning aids <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d </i>comprise a hard foam preventing the patient from moving during the magnetic resonance measurement.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0122">In the shown example, the field generation unit <b>12</b> comprises a magnet <b>13</b> as well as a first gradient coil <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a second gradient coil <b>28</b><i>b</i>. The first gradient coil <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the second gradient coil <b>28</b><i>b </i>are positioned adjacent to the surface directed towards the imaging volume <b>30</b> of the magnet <b>13</b>.

It is also conceivable, that a reduction of magnetic material in a region below the imaging volume <b>30</b> (e.g., along the Y-direction) does not overly compromise or constrain a provision of a homogenous main magnetic field within the imaging volume <b>30</b>. Thus, the concept of increasing the density of magnetic material in the outer flanks of the concave or &#x2018;U&#x2019;-shaped magnet <b>13</b> may also represent a design criterium for gradient coils <b>28</b> as well as radiofrequency antennas <b>19</b> positioned adjacent to the magnet <b>13</b>.
