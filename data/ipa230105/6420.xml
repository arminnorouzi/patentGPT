In the VCSEL element, a constriction structure is provided to collect a current flowing through the active layer and light generated in the active layer on a predetermined region.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">For example, the constriction structure of a GaAs VCSEL element is generally an oxidized constriction structure obtained by oxidizing part of an AlAs layer close to the active layer to AlO with water vapor. This oxidized constriction structure is a structure having a small diffraction loss and excellent productivity, but it is difficult to control the oxidization depending on the process quality level at the time of forming a mesa (plateau-like structure). When the oxidization rate locally fluctuates, the optical aperture (OA) diameter varies and the beam properties are affected. Specifically, the pitch of the VCSEL element in a realistic device design was up to 14 &#x3bc;m, and there was a limit to narrow the pitch to 10 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Further, in an InP VCSEL element, since there is no material that can be constricted by oxidization, a structure an oxidized constriction structure is formed on a GaAs substrate and wafer bonding is performed has been developed. Since also this structure has undergone an oxidization constriction process, it is necessary to form a mesa similarly to the existing structure and it is difficult to narrow the pitch.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Meanwhile, also a structure in which a constriction structure is formed in the vicinity of an active layer by wafer bonding has been reported. In accordance with Patent Literature 1, a transparent substrate is used, thermal performance is favorable because an active layer is close to a heat sink, and performance such as a threshold current, a threshold voltage, single mode stability, efficiency, and output power improved as compared with those of the existing VCSEL element is shown.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 1997-172229</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">However, in the configuration of Patent Literature 1, since a substrate on which a constriction structure has been formed is attached to a substrate on which an active layer has been provided but a DBR layer is provided also between the constriction structure and the active layer, the current confinement in the layer surface direction and the light confinement in the lamination direction are not sufficient, and there is a limit to narrow the pitch.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">In view of the circumstances as described above, it is an object of the present technology to provide a vertical cavity surface emitting laser element having a structure whose pitch can be narrowed, a vertical cavity surface emitting laser element array, a vertical cavity surface emitting laser module, and a method of producing a vertical cavity surface emitting laser element.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a vertical cavity surface emitting laser element according to an embodiment of the present technology includes: a first substrate; and a second substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The first substrate is provided with a semiconductor layer including an active layer and a first distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The second substrate is provided with a constriction layer and a second DBR layer, the constriction layer having a constriction region and an injection region having conductivity higher than that of the constriction region, the second substrate being bonded to the first substrate such that the constriction layer is adjacent to the semiconductor layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">With this configuration, in the vertical cavity surface emitting laser element, the first substrate and the second substrate are bonded to each other.
