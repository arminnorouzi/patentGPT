id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of computer technology, in particular to a method and device for sorting Chinese characters, searching for Chinese characters and constructing a dictionary.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TECHNIQUE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The sorting and searching of Chinese characters are divided into two categories: shape sequence method and phonetic sequence method. According to the shape of Chinese characters, the current shape sequence method mainly includes the radical method, the stroke and stroke order method and the number method. The phonetic sequence method is based on the pronunciation of Chinese characters, and now it is mainly the Chinese pinyin method.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since Xu Shen's &#x201c;Shuowen Jiezi&#x201d; established the radical method to sort Chinese characters more than 1,800 years ago, the radical method has been dominant until the appearance of the Chinese pinyin method decades ago. The so-called radical method is to summarize Chinese characters into hundreds of different groups, and each group selects a character or symbol as a representative, which is called a radical. When searching for a character, first determine the character's radical and its position, and then you can find the character in a similar place after the radical. If there are many characters in a group, it can also use the number of strokes and stroke order to assist in the searching of characters in the group. &#x201c;Shuowen Jiezi&#x201d; defines 540 groups, &#x201c;Kangxi Dictionary&#x201d; defines 214 groups, &#x201c;Xinhua Dictionary&#x201d; uses 189 groups, &#x201c;Etymology&#x201d; uses 250 groups, and &#x201c;Chinese Characters Radical List&#x201d; defines 201 groups. In short, the radicals of &#x201c;Shuowen Jiezi&#x201d; are defined in a more detailed and comprehensive way, and there are many classifications and combinations of radicals after that.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stroke and stroke order are sorted according to the number of strokes and the order of strokes. This method first sorts according to the number of strokes, and then according to the order of the strokes. The numbering method assigns a number to the characters according to the shape of the characters to sort them. Phonetic sequence method is based on the sound of the characters. The Chinese Pinyin method uses Roman letters to represent sounds and sort them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the main disadvantage of the traditional and widely used radical method is that the definition and position of radicals are vague and lack strict regularity. To determine what the radical of a character is, sometimes by position, sometimes by sound, sometimes by shape, sometimes by habit, sometimes by the relationship and meaning of radicals and characters, sometimes by rigid rules, and in many cases people are confused. The radical can be a single-body character, it can be a character siding, or it can be a body structure. Often looking up a few characters will run into a situation that takes a lot of time, or even has to give up in the end. The radical method makes the simple matter of looking up an unknown character in the dictionary into a matter of luck and probability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are too many characters with the same number of strokes in the stroke count and the stroke order method, which is inconvenient to find. It is generally used as an auxiliary method for other methods. The number of characters applicable to the numbering method is either limited or too many, which is hard to remember. There are many characters with the same pronunciation in pinyin, and characters with unknown or unfamiliar pronunciation cannot be retrieved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CONTENT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of this, the embodiments of the present invention provide a method and device for sorting Chinese characters, searching for Chinese characters, and constructing a dictionary, which can solve the problems of traditional radical searching method due to the unfixed definition and position of radicals and lack of strict regularity.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the Chinese character sorting method of the embodiment of the present invention mainly includes the following steps S<b>101</b> to S<b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Step S<b>101</b>: Obtain the first basic character-forming component of the Chinese character as the First Character according to the stroke order, and encode the First Character to obtain the First Character code. The First Character includes the first character-forming component of the Chinese character that can be formed independently and cannot be separated, and the first main stroke component of a Chinese character that does not include any character-forming components. In the embodiment of the present invention, the code that appears (E.g. First Character code, Chinese character double-alphabet code, Basic Component double-alphabet code, etc.) is all introduced in letter form as an example. In the specific implementation, the coding form can be flexibly set according to the needs, for example: combination of letters and numbers, combination of letters and special symbols, etc.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the basis of the research results of modern computer technology, &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Component Specification for Information Processing&#x201d; and the attached &#x201c;Chinese Character Basic Component List&#x201d; were issued. The issuance of this standard provides a basis for establishing a new set of glyph searching methods. Among them, 560 Basic Components are defined in the &#x201c;Chinese Character Basic Components Table&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the above national standards, the component is a character-forming unit with the function of assembling Chinese characters composed of strokes. Basic Components are the smallest components that are no longer split, and are divided into basic character-forming components (itself is a character, hereinafter referred to as character-forming components) and basic non-character components (itself is not a character, hereinafter referred to as non-character components). Chinese characters can be composed of Basic Components. In other words, the 20,902 Chinese characters in the GB 13000.1 character set, including traditional characters and Japanese and Korean Chinese characters, can be composed of these 560 Basic Components.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Among these 560 Basic Components, there are a total of 225 character-forming components (decided whether it is a character-forming part according to whether a component is included in the 7,000 common characters in the &#x201c;Modern Chinese Common Character List&#x201d;). The remaining 335 are non-character components. These 335 non-character components account for about 60% of the total number of components. And except for some individual radicals, most of them are unfamiliar and unnamed physical structures.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the contrary, the 225 character-forming components are basically the single body characters that are commonly used and familiar to people. In popular reference books such as dictionaries, can these 225 character-forming components be used to search all Chinese characters without the other 335 non-character components?</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Through the disassembly and analysis of about 4,000 commonly used Chinese characters, it is found that although non-character components appear frequently in Chinese characters and are widely used as partial structure of the characters, there are very few cases where Chinese characters do not contain any character-forming components. Therefore, it is entirely possible to use the character-forming component to search the characters. In this way, people can avoid those unfamiliar and unnamed physical symbols when searching for Chinese characters.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Stroke is an auxiliary tool commonly used in Chinese character sorting and searching. Used appropriately can help users.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to mark and store each of the above 560 Basic Components in a computer, it should be very convenient if they can be represented by Roman letters in consideration of applications such as keyboard typing. However, a total of 26 letters from A to Z, including only 52 in total with upper and lower cases, which is certainly not enough. With two letters, there are 26&#xd7;26=676 different combinations, which can meet the needs of 560 components, and there are more 116 spaces for expansion. The utilization rate of double-alphabet resources is quite high, at 83% ( 560/676).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">By encoding the Basic Components of Chinese characters, each Basic Component can be determined more conveniently. In the present invention in the embodiment, it is based on the separation of character-forming components and non-character components, the arrangement of the components according to strokes, and the use of double letter code inventive concept of encoding the Basic Components of Chinese characters, specifically, the steps of encoding the Basic Components of Chinese characters to obtain the double-alphabet codes of the Basic Components include: &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Components Specification for Information Processing&#x201d; to obtain the Basic Components of Chinese characters; according to whether the Basic Components are character-forming components, the Basic Components are divided into character-forming components and non-character components, and the first sorting is performed; according to the number of strokes of the Basic Components, the second sorting is performed separately among the character-forming components and among the non-character components; after the second sorting, the Basic Components with the same number of strokes are sorted in the third sorting according to the order of the strokes included in the Basic Components; after the third sorting, the Basic Components are saved in the table to generate an ordered code table to obtain the Basic Component double-alphabet code, wherein the horizontal rows and columns of the ordered code table are respectively coded with different types of characters.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Below in conjunction with the drawings, take the double-alphabet code as an example, introducing the encoding process of the double-alphabet code of the Basic Components of Chinese characters as an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is schematic diagram of a double-alphabet code table of the Basic Components of Chinese characters according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Finally, all the above Basic Components are filled in a 25&#xd7;24 grid in order to generate an ordered code table, namely the double-alphabet code table for the Basic Components of Chinese characters in the order of the brush strokes of the Basic Components, among them, the row and column of a Basic Component determine the double-alphabet code of the component.

When constructing a double-alphabet code table for Basic Components, you can also do not separate the character-forming components from the non-character components, but mix them together and unify coding in order.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Based on Chinese character Basic Component double-alphabet code, the Chinese characters can be coded according to the specifications, and the Chinese character double-alphabet code can be obtained. In the embodiment of the present invention, splitting Chinese characters into Basic Components and obtaining the double-alphabet codes of Chinese characters according to the double-alphabet codes of the Basic Components may specifically include the following steps: according to &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Components Specification for Information Processing&#x201d; splits Chinese characters into Basic Components; according to the double-alphabet code of the Basic Components, obtain the double-alphabet code of the Basic Components included in each Chinese character; for each Chinese character, according to &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Stroke Order Specification&#x201d;, according to the stroke order of the Basic Components included in the Chinese characters, the double-alphabet codes of the Basic Components included in the Chinese characters are combined to obtain the double-alphabet codes of the Chinese characters.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In specific implementation, first, according to the &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Component Specification for Information Processing&#x201d;, Chinese characters are divided into Basic Components.

Are people willing to look for character-forming components that are not arranged at the beginning of a character when searching for a character? Through multi-person testing, it is found that people are too familiar with these character-forming components, and they like to use them to search characters, and they don't care whether they are at the beginning of a character. Therefore, this leads to an important concept of the present invention, the first basic character-forming component, abbreviated as First Character. For Chinese characters that contain character-forming components, the First Character of a Chinese character is the first character-forming component encountered in a Chinese character in the order of strokes, which is called the character-forming First Character.

It is divided into many groups according to the First Characters. Each group starts with a First Character, including all the characters containing the First Character, arranged in the order of strokes. The character searching table includes all the characters in the dictionary. The user checks the storage location of a character in the dictionary text through the First Character table and the character searching table. For an electronic dictionary, the storage location of a character in the dictionary body may be a certain page in a table of the database; for an entity dictionary, the storage location of a character in the dictionary body may be a certain page in the dictionary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the character searching table of an embodiment of the present invention, which shows one page of the character searching table of the present invention. According to the character searching table, the specific storage location of a character in the dictionary text can be queried.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">At step S<b>905</b>, according to the number of strokes of the First Character and stroke order, the table for sorting the First Characters and used for searching the First Characters is called the First Character table in the present invention. This is the first form that users need to check when searching for a character, and it is the general form for searching for a character. It tells the user all the First Characters and the number of pages in the character searching table. From this table, the user finds the First Character of a character and the storage location of the First Character in the character searching table, and then searches for the specific character in the character searching table. For electronic dictionaries, the First Character points to the character searching table through the data location pointer. Therefore, the First Character table does not need to include the page of the First Characters in the character searching table; for the physical dictionary, the character searching table has a page number, and according to Number of strokes and stroke order, when sorting the First Characters to generate the First Character table, sort the First Characters according to the number of strokes from smallest to largest; then after the first sort, sort the First Characters with the same number of strokes in the order of the strokes for the second sorting; after that, sort them according to the second sorting. After that, the First Character and the page number of each First Character in the character searching table generates the First Character table. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a First Character table of an embodiment of the present invention, in which, under each First Character in the First Character table, the page in the character searching table is marked, and the number in the box in front of the First Character indicates the stroke number of the First Character.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">In addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in the specific process of generating the dictionary, before the First Character is encoded to obtain the First Character code, the obtained First Characters can also be adjusted according to the size of the dictionary and the characters included. Specifically, judge whether to adjust the First Characters obtained according to the size of the dictionary; if so, calculate the occurrence probability of each character component in the First Characters obtained;</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">afterwards, according to the set threshold, the character-forming components that the occurrence probability is less than the threshold and will not cause confusion are deleted from the acquired First Characters; or, can merge two components which contain a same component.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the First Character code of a sample dictionary according to an embodiment of the present invention.

As shown, it contains only <b>171</b> First Characters. Under normal circumstances, if the number of characters in a dictionary is relatively small, then the number of the First Characters can also be less, the First Characters obtained can be adjusted. Specifically, firstly, the occurrence probability of each character component in the First Characters obtained should be counted. If the occurrence probability is less than a preset threshold, it indicates that the First Character constitutes few characters, the First Character can be considered not required or can be removed.
