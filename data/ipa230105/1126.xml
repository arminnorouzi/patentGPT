For example, a neurotypical adult human brain will show relatively more activity in the Delta band (e.g., 0.5-4 Hz) during sleep but relatively more Beta band activity (e.g., 12-35 Hz) when alert and actively thinking. Further, certain disorders are associated with changes in spectral composition. For example, patients with Parkinson's disease exhibit more Delta activity when awake and lesser activity across all frequency bands than neurotypicals. In another example, differences in a ratio of Theta to Beta band activity can be associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Further, individuals suffering dementia of any kind show attenuated Theta band activity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some examples, brainwaves or electrical frequency activity in a brain can be modulated or changed in response to various stimuli presented to the eyes or ears, or using tactile stimuli. For example, repetitive stimuli presented to a user at a particular frequency can encourage the electrical activity of the user's brain to shift toward the same particular frequency. This phenomenon or changing the brainwave behavior of a user is referred to as entrainment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various examples of delivering continuous auditory stimulation for entrainment have been proposed to modulate brainwaves for therapeutic effect. The auditory stimulation can be presented to a user using headphones or earphones. In some examples, the auditory stimulation is provided by modulating various aspects of a recorded audio program, such as a music program.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One form of auditory stimulation includes &#x201c;binaural beats.&#x201d; Binaural beats are an auditory illusion or brain response that is created by presenting different auditory information or source signals to respective ears of a listener. The different auditory information differs in frequency. The difference between the information presents itself to the listener as an amplitude-modulated signal resulting from the phase relationship of the source signals. The resulting &#x201c;beats&#x201d; can be perceived by the listener as an auditory beat and it can be used to entrain different rhythms or cortical potentials in the listener's brain.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that a problem to be solved includes providing auditory stimulation for entrainment without using noises that would he distracting or disruptive for a user. In an example, a solution to the problem can include using amplitude modulation of ambient sounds. In an example, the solution can include modulating existing sounds in a user's environment, for example, at selected frequencies that may not interfere with important functions like speech processing. In an example, frequencies presented to the user can be continuously modulated in a way that mimics normal, healthy brain function.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary is intended to provide a brief overview of subject matter of the present application.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the present subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the present subject matter may be practiced without some or other of these specific details. Examples merely typify possible variations. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, structures (e.g., structural components, such as modules) are optional and may be combined or subdivided, and operations (e.g., in a procedure, algorithm, or other function) may vary in sequence or he combined or subdivided.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various systems and methods discussed herein facilitate solving a technical problem of inducing particular brain behavior, or entrainment, using sounds or information in a user's environment. As such, one or more of the systems and methods described herein may obviate a need for certain efforts or computing resources that otherwise would be involved in therapy signal generation, or processing or use of other signals that could be distracting or unpleasant for a user, such as signals unrelated to the user's environment, particularly over long periods of time. As a result, resources used by one or more machines, databases, or devices (e.g., within the environment) may be reduced. Examples of such computing resources include processor cycles, network traffic, memory usage, data storage capacity, power consumption, or network bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Systems and methods discussed herein can he used to provide auditory stimulation without injecting distracting or disruptive noise into a user's environment. In an example, a solution to the problem can include using amplitude modulation of ambient sounds or other sounds existing in a user's environment. That is, ambient sounds or other acoustic information in the vicinity of the user can be used as a carrier signal for amplitude-modulated, therapeutic auditory stimulation signals. In an example, the amplitude modulation can be introduced at selected frequencies that may not interfere with important functions like speech processing. In some examples, amplitude-modulated signals can be presented to a user continuously, and can be modulated in a way that mimics normal, healthy brain function. The amplitude-modulated signals can be presented to a user as an auditory stimulation signal, such as using one or both ears, and can be used to induce particular brainwaves or brainwave behavior. The particular brainwave activity or frequency to be induced can depend upon the particular therapy or objective for delivering the stimulus.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present inventor has further recognized that a problem to be solved includes providing a tailored or user-specific auditory stimulation solution. For example, solutions using loudspeakers may take a &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; approach, assuming that everyone in a given environment may benefit from stimulation by the same audio frequencies. The present inventor has recognized that a solution to the problem can include allowing each user to receive his or her optimal frequency or frequencies, even while in the same environment as other users. In an example, the solution can include using the same ambient sound or sounds as a carrier for a variety of waveforms such as for a variety of respective users.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present solution can include or use continuous auditory stimulation that induces brainwaves to couple with, or &#x201c;entrain&#x201d; to, the frequency of presented stimuli. Such stimulation has been found to have an effect and significant potential therapeutic value in a variety of use cases, including for alertness, or for treatment of diseases or disorders such as dementias, age-related memory loss, Parkinson's Disease, sleep disorders, speech issues like stuttering, depression, or anxiety, among others, in which certain brainwave rhythms are attenuated when compared with those of &#x201c;normal&#x201d; or neurotypical brains. The present solution allows for substantially continuous brain stimulation over long periods without distracting or disrupting the user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the present solution includes amplitude modulation of ambient sound for continuous brain stimulation, for example, without using generated or recorded sounds to intrude on the user's senses, such as would otherwise mask a user's experience of the world and isolate or endanger the user. Rather, the present solution can include or use ambient sound in a user's environment as a carrier for an auditory stimulation signal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an example, the present solution can include or use frequency-selective amplitude modulation. Some frequency bands can be relatively more important for speech or other signal comprehension. Amplitude modulating frequencies in such hands can degrade speech (or other signal) comprehension and thus detract from a user's quality of life and/or can limit deployment of a potentially beneficial therapy. This problem is addressed using filtering such as to select only particular frequencies or frequency bands for modulation. In some examples, some relatively important frequencies can be unprocessed or unmodulated. In an example, the present systems and methods can be further used to augment hearing at these or other particular frequencies or frequency hands using spectral equalization, such as similarly to the way that a hearing aid can selectively tune various frequencies or bands to enhance intelligibility of particular signals. In an example, the systems and methods discussed herein can be integrated with, or used to augment various functions of, hearing aids, and can be tailored to a particular user's audiogram.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an example, the present invention can include modulating select frequency bands, such as bands below or above one or more frequency thresholds. For example, unmodulated acoustic information can correspond to human speech-related frequencies. Acoustic information above or below the speech range can be modulated, such as without detrimental effect to the user's experience or understanding of speech. Many of the examples discussed herein refer to modulation of low frequency information e.g., 200 Hz or less), however, modulation can similarly be applied to higher frequency information above the speech range, such as at frequencies above about 8 kHz.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example, the systems and methods discussed herein can he used to provide therapy in the form of &#x201c;binaural beats.&#x201d; Binaural beats are provided by presenting respective signals of slightly different frequencies to each of a listener's ears. The signals can cause the user's brainstem to produce an oscillation at a frequency that represents the difference between the two stimulation signal frequencies. For example, ambient sound can be amplitude modulated at, e.g., 400 Hz in the right ear and 406 Hz in the left ear, causing the brainstem to produce an oscillation at 6 Hz, which can be measured across the entire scalp. Binaural beats can thus be used to modulate an ambient signal for continuous auditory stimulation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example, the present solution can include using added sound when ambient sound pressure levels drop below a specified threshold level that may be needed to carry stimulation frequency(ies). For example, a noise signal (e.g., white noise, pink noise, brown noise, or other noise signal) can be generated and used as a carrier signal. In an example, the noise signal can be amplitude modulated to a desired frequency when ambient sound pressure levels in a user's environment drop below the specified threshold level that may he used or needed to otherwise carry a modulation signal, in an example, the noise signal can pass through a low pass filter along with, or can be processed separately from, the rest of the amplitude modulated signal, such as according to a user-defined filter cutoff. Using this noise-insertion or noise-bridging technique, stimulation frequencies can be presented to a user without disruption of the user's daily activities, such as throughout the entirety of the user's waking hours, allowing for an unprecedented amount of stimulation. In other words, acoustic information from a user's environment can be used for auditory stimulation when the acoustic information meets or exceeds a specified minimum threshold sound pressure level and a modulated noise signal can he used to occupy or bridge periods of time when the acoustic information does not meet the specified minimum threshold level.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example, the noise technique can be beneficial to users who suffer from tinnitus. There are many people who suffer severe tinnitus from exposure to loud sounds (e.g., veterans) and who would benefit from auditory stimulation that is evenly maintained between loud and quiet environments (those with tinnitus experience the most discomfort in quiet areas). In an example, an auditory stimulation signal to treat tinnitus can be provided at or around 10 Hz. For example, amplitude modulation of a 10 kHz masking noise can be provided to treat tinnitus by changing brain rhythms, Other signals can similarly be used. In an example, filtering techniques, such as can be helpful to treat various types of tinnitus, can be applied to ambient acoustic information or to a noise signal for use in auditory stimulation. A particular filtering technique can include providing a notch-filtered and amplitude-modulated auditory stimulation signal where the notch is centered at or near a frequency corresponding to a user's particular tonal tinnitus.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example, the present solution can include or use stimuli that are selected or designed to resemble neurotypical brainwave patterns. Some prior techniques for auditory brain stimulation make use of highly regular, sinusoidal waveforms. These waveforms, while convenient to generate and easy to find in spectrographic imagery, may not reflect the brainwaves of healthy, neurotypical individuals. Furthermore, exposure to highly symmetrical and fixed-frequency waves over long periods could be problematic for some users. In addition, the brain tends to habituate (or become increasingly less sensitive) to perfectly regular stimuli and therefore, over time, stimulation with a sinusoidal wave of unchanging amplitude can have a decreasing effect, such as leading to diminished effects of auditory stimulation. Typical brainwaves in humans can be described as &#x201c;bursty,&#x201d; meaning they happen in bursts of activity, frequently changing in amplitude, and quickly starting and stopping. Such typical brainwaves can also drift slightly in frequency throughout different bursts.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an example, systems and methods presented herein can addresses these problems and others, such as by mimicking various behaviors or features of neurotypical brainwaves. These features can be described in terms of spectrographic behavior, signal morphology, &#x201c;burstiness,&#x201d; or &#x201c;drift&#x201d; of typical or target brainwave activity. Burstiness can refer to brainwaves that are not continuous but tend to take place in bursts. Drift can refer to brainwaves that do not remain rigidly at a fixed frequency but instead drift somewhat throughout a burst or over the course of multiple bursts. In an example, the solution herein can include or use such naturalistic frequencies by recording brainwave patterns from neurotvpical brains and using those recorded waveforms or features thereof as references for amplitude modulation of other signals, including ambient acoustic signals, for delivery to a user.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates generally an example of a first auditory stimulation system <b>102</b>. The first auditory stimulation system <b>102</b> includes various components that can be used to prepare or generate an auditory stimulation signal, such as can be used to induce or augment brainwave activity in a user. As used herein, various signals are referred to in the singular form, however, plural signals can similarly or equivalently be used.
