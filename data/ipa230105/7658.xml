In NR systems, the terrestrial radio access network includes a plurality of base stations (BS), referred as next generation Node-Bs (gNBs), communicating with a plurality of mobile stations, referred as user equipment (UE). A UE may communicate with a base station (BS) or a gNB via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (DL) refers to the communication from the base station to the UE. The uplink (UL) refers to the communication from the UE to the base station. The 5G NR standard is developed by 3GPP. Channel State Information reference signals (CSI-RS) are utilized by UEs to measure and feedback the characteristics of a radio channel so that the gNB can use correct modulation, code rate, beam forming, etc. for DL data transmission.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In real developments, it is observed that the throughput drops significantly in high or medium velocity scenarios. One main reason is that the reported CSI becomes outdated due to fast channel variation. The CSI calculated for a past slot may not be useful at a later time when gNB needs to perform scheduling, especially in high velocity scenarios. To increase throughput, gNB needs to know the CSI that is good for future channels. The future CSI cannot be learned by a one-shot measurement as any channel variation requires at least two measurements to detect. The current NR specification supports consistent measurements for time/frequency tracking and beam management, but not for aperiodic CSI acquisition.

Mobile communication network <b>100</b> is an OFDM network comprising a serving base station (gNB <b>101</b>) and a user equipment (UE <b>102</b>). In 3GPP NR system based on OFDMA downlink, the radio resource is partitioned into slots in time domain, each slot is comprised of a number of OFDM symbols. Each OFDMA symbol further consists of a number of OFDMA subcarriers in frequency domain depending on the system bandwidth. The basic unit of the resource grid is called Resource Element (RE), which spans an OFDMA subcarrier over one OFDMA symbol. REs are grouped into physical resource blocks (PRBs), where each RB consists of twelve consecutive subcarriers in one slot.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Several physical downlink channels and reference signals are defined to use a set of resource elements carrying information originating from higher layers. For downlink channels, the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is the main data-bearing downlink channel in NR, while the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) is used to carry downlink control information (DCI). The control information may include scheduling decision, information related to reference signal information, rules forming the corresponding transport block (TB) to be carried by PDSCH, and power control command. For radio resource management (RRM) measurement in NR, each UE can be configured to measure synchronization signal (SS) blocks (SSB) and/or channel state information (CSI) reference signal (CSI-RS). For CSI-RS measurement, both frequency and timing resources need to be determined.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">CSI-RS are utilized by UEs to measure and feedback the characteristics of a DL channel so that gNB can use correct modulation, code rate, beam forming, etc. for DL data transmission. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in step <b>111</b>, gNB <b>101</b> provides CSI-RS configuration information, which allocates CSI-RS resources for periodic/semi-persistent or aperiodic CSI-RS transmission. In step <b>112</b>, gNB <b>101</b> transmits CSI-RS to UE <b>102</b> accordingly. In step <b>113</b>, UE <b>102</b> measures the received CSI-RS over a downlink channel, estimates the CSI, and reports the estimated CSI of the downlink channel to gNB <b>101</b>. In step <b>114</b>, gNB <b>101</b> receives the CSI reporting and schedules downlink data transmission to UE <b>102</b> based on the reported CSI.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In real developments, it is observed that the throughput drops significantly in high or medium velocity scenarios. One main reason is that the reported CSI becomes outdated due to fast channel variation.

In accordance with one novel aspect, a configuration method of CSI-RS repetition is proposed such that UE can acquire Doppler-domain information to support high velocity scenarios. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a CSI-RS resource can be configured by gNB <b>101</b> with a bursty period in which the same CSI-RS resource is repeatedly transmitted over time (e.g., step <b>111</b>).

For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS, the CSI-RS transmission has a periodicity, and the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be configured by radio resource control (RRC) signaling. For aperiodic CSI-RS, the CSI-RS transmission is triggered by a downlink control information (DCI), and the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be indicated by the triggering DCI. Upon receiving the CSI-RS transmission, UE <b>102</b> can acquire Doppler-domain information of the downlink channel based on the received CSI-RS repetitions during the bursty period to facilitate high velocity scenarios in NR systems.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of a base station <b>201</b> and a user equipment <b>211</b> that carry out certain embodiments of the present invention in a mobile communication network <b>200</b>. For base station <b>201</b>, antenna <b>221</b> transmits and receives radio signals. RF transceiver module <b>208</b>, coupled with the antenna, receives RF signals from the antenna, converts them to baseband signals and sends them to processor <b>203</b>. RF transceiver <b>208</b> also converts received baseband signals from the processor, converts them to RF signals, and sends out to antenna <b>221</b>.

The different functional modules are circuits that can be configured and implemented by software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The function modules and circuits, when executed by the processors <b>203</b> and <b>213</b> (e.g., via executing program codes <b>209</b> and <b>219</b>), for example, allow base station <b>201</b> to schedule (via scheduler <b>204</b>), precode (via precoder <b>205</b>), encode (via MIMO encoding circuit <b>206</b>), and transmit control/config information and data (via control/config circuit <b>207</b>) to UE <b>211</b>, and allow UE <b>211</b> to receive the control/config information and data (via control/config circuit <b>217</b>), measure CSI reference signal (via measurement circuit <b>216</b>), estimate CSI (via estimation circuit <b>215</b>), and report estimated CSI (via reporting circuit <b>220</b>) accordingly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one example, a CSI-RS resource can be configured by control/config circuit <b>260</b> with a bursty period in which the same CSI-RS resource is repeatedly transmitted over time. Any two repetitions of the CSI-RS resource are not overlapped in time. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS, the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be configured by radio resource control (RRC) signaling. For aperiodic CSI-RS, the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be indicated by the triggering downlink control information (DCI). UE can acquire Doppler-domain information based on the CSI-RS repetition to facilitate high velocity scenarios in NR systems.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a sequence flow of an overall procedure for CSI reference signal and resource configuration, CSI measurement, estimation, and reporting in accordance with one novel aspect. In step <b>311</b>, gNB <b>301</b> provides CSI configuration information to UE <b>302</b> for CSI acquisition and reporting. The CSI configuration information may comprise CSI-RS configuration, CSI-RS resource configuration with periodicity and CSI-RS repetition during bursty period, CSI reporting configuration, CSI reference slot for CSI measurement and computation, and CSI computation period, etc. In step <b>312</b>, gNB <b>301</b> transmits multiple occasions of CSI reference signals to UE <b>302</b> over the configured CSI-RS resources accordingly. In step <b>321</b>, UE <b>302</b> receives the multiple occasions of CSI reference signals, estimates the effective downlink channel, and performs CSI computation based on the CSI configuration information.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one novel aspect, a CSI-RS resource can be configured with a bursty period in which the same CSI-RS resource is repeatedly transmitted over time. Any two repetitions of the CSI-RS resource are not overlapped in time. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS, the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be configured by radio resource control (RRC) signaling. For aperiodic CSI-RS, the CSI-RS repetitions in the bursty period can be indicated by the triggering downlink control information (DCI). In step <b>322</b>, UE <b>302</b> reports the computed CSI to gNB based on the CSI configuration information. The reported CSI parameters may include Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and Channel Quality Index (CQI). UE <b>302</b> can acquire Doppler-domain information of the downlink channel based on the CSI-RS repetition to facilitate high velocity scenarios.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With multiple CSI-RS repetitions, UE can measure the wireless channel at different times and thus detects channel variation over time. A bursty transmission helps detect time variation in a much smaller period than the original periodicity. Although the original periodicity can be set small to have the same effect, it incurs higher overhead comparing with a short bursty period. Through Fourier transform, the time variations of the channel in time domain become Doppler shifts in Doppler domain. Usually, the Doppler shifts are sparse in Doppler domain, which facilitates noise elimination and CSI compression. Furthermore, the time variation of a channel or its Doppler-domain equivalent are needed for CSI prediction. In step <b>341</b>, gNB <b>301</b> transmits data to UE <b>302</b> over PDSCH using the determined parameters including modulation, code rate, beam forming.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A CSI-RS resource is defined with some parameters, e.g., number of ports, periodicity, bandwidth, etc. When multiple CSI-RS resources are configured, at least some of the parameters are different between two CSI-RS resources. As for CSI-RS repetitions, if they belong to the same CSI-RS resources, then all the properties are the same, except for the time-dependent parameters as they are transmitted at different times. CSI processing unit is defined as follows: If a UE supports N<sub>CPU </sub>simultaneous CSI calculations it is said to have N<sub>CPU </sub>CSI processing units (CPU) for processing CSI reports. As UE's capability is limited, the total number of CSI processing units is used to signal UE's capability so that gNB would not configure too many CSI calculations beyond UE's capability. Therefore, for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with higher layer parameter reportQuantity set to &#x2018;cri-RI-PMI-CQI&#x2019;, &#x2018;cri-RI-i1&#x2019;, &#x2018;cri-RI-i1-CQI&#x2019;, &#x2018;cri-RI-CQI&#x2019;, or &#x2018;cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI&#x2019;, the required number of CSI processing units O<sub>CPU</sub>=KN, where K is the number of CSI-RS resources and N is the number of repetitions. Note that for UE's implementation that buffers N measurements first and then calculates CSI using the N measurements, N CPUs are needed. Besides, K is the number of CSI-RS resources in the CSI-RS resource set for channel measurement.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of CSI-RS and resource configuration for periodic or semi-persistent CSI transmission to support high velocity scenario in accordance with one novel aspect. For periodic or semi-persistent CSI, the CSI-RS resource for CSI-RS transmission is configured with a periodicity in time domain. Within each period, a CSI-RS resource is configured with a bursty period, in which the same CSI-RS resource is repeatedly transmitted over time. The bursty period is less than or equal to the period. Any two repetitions of the CSI-RS resource are not overlapped in time. In a CSI-RS resource set, either all CSI-RS resources are configured with bursty period or none are configured with bursty period. All configured bursty periods have the same number of CSI-RS repetitions. All symbols of a bursty period are within the same period. The CSI-RS repetition starts from a symbol with an offset from the beginning of a slot of a bursty period. The last symbol of a CSI-RS resource configured with bursty period is the last symbol of its last repetition. For periodic CSI-RS transmission, the number of repetitions can be updated by RRC. For semi-persistent CSI-RS transmission, the number of repetitions can be updated by MAC-CE.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of CSI-RS and resource configuration for aperiodic CSI transmission to support high velocity scenario in accordance with one novel aspect. For aperiodic CSI, the CSI-RS resource for CSI-RS transmission is configured with a bursty period, in which the same CSI-RS resource is repeatedly transmitted over time. The CSI-RS transmission is triggered by a DCI, and the CSI-RS repetition is triggered at a later time. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the first slot of a bursty period is slot n+X, where n is the slot containing the triggering DCI and X is the CSI-RS triggering offset configured by RRC. For aperiodic CSI-RS transmission, the number of CSI-RS repetitions can be indicated by the triggering DCI.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of equal-distance CSI-RS repetition. The repetitions of CSI-RS in the bursty period are signalled by a symbol index s, a symbol gap d and a number N, where the CSI-RS resource is repeated every d symbols totally N times, starting from symbol s within the first slot of the bursty period. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b></figref>, s=1, d=3, and N=7, which means that the CSI-resource starts from symbol s=1 of the first slot n, and is repeated every d=3 symbols for a total of N=7 times (R<b>0</b>-R<b>6</b>) during a configured bursty period. In this embodiment, the bursty period covers slot n and slot n+1, and every neighboring CSI-RS transmission is separated by equal distance of d=3 symbols.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of slot-based CSI-RS repetition.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b></figref>, N=2, and s=1, 5, 9, 13, which means that the bursty period lasts N=2 slots, and each CSI-RS resource occurs at symbol 1, 5, 9, and 13 for each slot.
