The PP synthetic top surface layer <b>4</b> provides a temporary chemical resistance for different chemicals and acids (e.g. acetone, acetonitrile, isopropanol, methanol and 30% hydrochloric acid) typically encountered in the laboratory environment and it protects the RFID microelectronic device <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the external circuitry <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>d</i>.

That is the second antenna is nested within the first antenna to reduce the space required for accommodating the antennas and thus limit the required size for the label despite of the expanded communication functionality.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">A tamper detection function of the RFID label is realized in different ways. In both embodiments the flat support material base <b>11</b> may have a number of predefined cuts <b>8</b> distributed about its outer periphery. The cuts <b>8</b> are substantially straight cuts or incisions through or substantially through the thickness of the support material base <b>11</b>, preferably the PP synthetic top surface layer <b>4</b> but not through the metal layer <b>2</b> or the printed circuitry. The cuts must not necessarily reach through the entire material thickness but can be limited to a weakening to an extent that pulling on the label opens the cut without the possibility to re-arrange the label.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">The cuts <b>8</b> are oriented so as to be inclined with respect to an outer edge of the flat support material base in a top view. The cuts <b>8</b> are preferably oriented substantially towards a central portion of the flat support material base in the top view, not necessarily a single point but a larger area, but they may be oriented radially from one or more point(s), too. Thus, some of the cuts in the center of the longitudinal extension of the edges may have an angle of about 90&#xb0; to the edge contour whereas the other cuts are inclined with an angle different from 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">The cuts serve as security cuts that would easily break or open in case someone tries to pull off the label after the same is adhered to the surface of the respective container or piece of equipment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">The cuts <b>8</b> extend over a length between 3% and 10% of the length of the outer edge of the flat support material base <b>11</b> at which they are provided or in the direction of which they extend (X- or Y-direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Further, the cuts <b>8</b> are spaced from each other along the longitudinal direction of the outer edge by a length between 5% and 30% of the length of the outer edge of the flat support material base at which they are provided or in the direction of which they extend. For example, if the flat support material base has a rectangular outline as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref> with typical dimensions of 20 mm&#xd7;40 mm, the depth of the cuts into the label, i.e. the length in the top view, is preferably 1.5 mm and the spacing along the outer edge contour is 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">The distribution of the cuts around the periphery not only provides the safety function against tampering or removal but also imparts a certain additional flexibility to the label to accommodate different curvatures along the directions of extension of the surface to which it is to be attached and to improve long-time adherence of the label.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">In the preferred embodiment of the label <b>1</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the flat flexible support material base <b>11</b> includes an elongated flexible extension strip <b>10</b> integrally formed with the support material base <b>11</b> so as to extend from an edge in a certain direction.

The separation structure <b>9</b> is preferably in the form of a predefined tearing line formed by a number of spaced apart and aligned predefined incisions in the material. The strip <b>10</b>, in particular its width and length, is dimensioned such that it can be routed over a spout or opening or lid/plug of a container while the label is attached to a peripheral surface of the container. The strip may contain, at its distal end portion, an adhesive section <b>12</b> that may be additionally provided with a defined tearing portion <b>13</b> preventing peeling off of the adhesive section <b>12</b> without destruction of the strip in this zone.

If one tries to remove the label from the container, the conductive loop <b>5</b><i>d </i>is torn and the interruption can be detected by the RFID microelectronic device <b>5</b><i>c </i>and communicated to the outside upon interrogation as an indication of the seal breaking. This function is particularly useful if, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the conductive loop <b>5</b><i>d </i>extends over the predefined separation structure <b>9</b> (tearing line) because its interruption is indicative of a potential opening of the container after removal of the strip <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">The conductive loop may also be routed through other relevant parts of the label.
