Close proximity, as used herein, refers to at least two antennas being within their frequency-dependent near-field range (e.g., &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to those skilled in the art of antenna design), up to and including physical contact which includes capacitive high-frequency contact (e.g., &#x201c;tightly coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;AC coupled&#x201d;), and which can even include Ohmic contact (e.g., &#x201c;DC coupled&#x201d;). The close proximity of multiple antennas can lead to undesired interactions between them, which can result in de-tuning of a frequency of resonance and/or unacceptable operation of antennas, which result in formation of nulls within one or more antennas' operating bands, and/or redirection of the radiation pattern (e.g., &#x201c;beam-steering&#x201d;) of one or more antennas.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure is directed to a system that includes a first antenna and a second antenna.

In addition, it will be understood that the drawings are merely schematic representations of the invention, and some of the components may have been distorted from actual scale for purposes of pictorial clarity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with the embodiment(s) disclosed herein, one or more of a lower frequency first antenna's element(s) is segmented into small sections separated by band-stop circuitry, referred to herein as a notch circuit(s). The notch circuit(s) performs filtering in that the notch circuit(s) prevents signals of a higher frequency second antenna from achieving a resonant condition on original elements of a first antenna, which then renders the first antenna unable to support the transmission, reflection, or radiation of the higher frequency band-stop bands. Because the segments are typically too short in length to adversely affect specific frequencies of interest, they have a reduced impact on antenna performance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed in more detail below, the first antenna gets segmented, and in at least one embodiment, shortening in length and other physical and/or electrical characteristics to compensate for the addition of the notch circuit(s). The effect on the segmented antenna is typically a size reduction that ensures an aperture size-related reduction in gain, as well as a decrease in efficiency due to the higher losses in band-stop components compared to a typical radiating structure. The reduced efficiency results in a further reduction in realized gain of the segmented antenna beyond that associated with the reduction in aperture size.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">High impedance resonant circuitry, or notch circuitry, are used with one or more element(s) of the first antenna, such as a lower-frequency antenna structure. These resonant circuit(s) serve as band stops for the frequency bands used by a second antenna, such as a higher frequency antenna, in close proximity to the first antenna. The band stops are sufficiently close together that the lengths of continuous low-impedance paths are significantly shorter than a half wavelength of the frequencies used by the second antenna. These aspects are arranged to result in a reduction in interference of the second antenna by the proximity of the first antenna.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to the drawings and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, at least one embodiment is disclosed, such as an antenna system <b>100</b> that includes a first antenna <b>110</b>, such as a Quasi-Yagi Ultra High Frequency (UHF) antenna, and a second antenna <b>120</b>, such as a nested coaxial helical antenna, together forming an antenna array.
