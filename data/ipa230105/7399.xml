The above application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference, in its entirety, into the present application.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a laminated piezoelectric element.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Piezoelectric elements are used in various applications as so-called exciters (exciton) that vibrate articles to generate sound in a case where the elements are attached in contact with various articles. For example, by attaching an exciter to an image display panel, a screen, or the like and vibrating them, sound can be generated instead of a speaker.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By the way, in a case where an exciter is attached to a flexible image display device, a rollable screen, or the like, it is necessary for the exciter itself to be flexible (rollable) at least in a case where the exciter is not in use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a flexible piezoelectric element, a piezoelectric film in which a piezoelectric layer is interposed between an electrode layer and a protective layer has been proposed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, JP2014-209724A describes an electroacoustic conversion film having a piezoelectric laminate, a metal foil for extracting an upper electrode, and a metal foil for extracting a lower electrode. The piezoelectric laminate has a polymer-based piezoelectric composite material that is formed by dispersing piezoelectric particles in a viscoelastic matrix consisting of a polymer material having viscoelasticity at room temperature, an upper thin film electrode that is formed on one surface of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material and has an area of equal to or less than that of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material, an upper protective layer that is formed on a surface of the upper thin film electrode and has an area of equal to or greater than that of the upper thin film electrode, a lower thin film electrode that is formed on the opposite surface of the upper thin film electrode of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material and has an area equal to or less than that of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material, and a lower protective layer that is formed on the surface of the lower thin film electrode and has an area equal to or larger than that of the lower thin film electrode. The metal foil for extracting the upper electrode is laminated on a part of the upper thin film electrode, and at least a part thereof is located outside the plane direction of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material. The metal foil for extracting a lower electrode is laminated on a part of the lower thin film electrode, and at least a part thereof is located outside the plane direction of the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a piezoelectric film is in the form of a film and has a limited spring constant. Therefore, an output thereof is insufficient in a case where the piezoelectric film is used as an exciter. Therefore, it is conceivable that the spring constant is increased by laminating the piezoelectric film and the output is increased.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The piezoelectric film in which the piezoelectric layer is interposed between the electrode layer and the protective layer is formed into a long shape by, for example, roll-to-roll, and then cut into a desired size. In a case where the film is cut, burrs of the metal constituting the electrode layer may occur. Therefore, in a case where such piezoelectric films are laminated, it has been found that there is a problem that the electrode layers of adjacent piezoelectric films are short-circuited due to burrs since the distance between the layers is short.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve such a problem of the prior art, an object of the present invention is to provide a laminated piezoelectric element capable of suppressing a short circuit between piezoelectric films in a laminated piezoelectric element in which a plurality of layers of a piezoelectric film formed by interposing a piezoelectric layer between an electrode layer and a protective layer are laminated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve such a problem, the present invention has the following configurations.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">[1] A laminated piezoelectric element formed by laminating a plurality of layers of piezoelectric films each having a piezoelectric layer, two electrode layers between which the piezoelectric layer is interposed, and two protective layers respectively covering the electrode layers,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">in which at least a part of

In the laminated piezoelectric element <b>10</b> in which such piezoelectric films that stretch and contract isotropically and two-dimensionally are laminated, compared to a case where general piezoelectric films made of PVDF or the like that stretch and contract greatly in only one direction are laminated, the vibration plate can be vibrated with a large force, and a louder and more beautiful sound can be generated.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, the laminated piezoelectric element of the present invention is a laminate of a plurality of such piezoelectric films.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Therefore, even though the rigidity of each piezoelectric film is low and the stretching and contracting force thereof is small, the rigidity is increased by laminating the piezoelectric films, and the stretching and contracting force as the laminated piezoelectric element <b>10</b> is increased.

At this time, in a case where the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material is hard, large bending stress is generated to that extent, and a crack is generated at the interface between the polymer matrix and the piezoelectric particles, possibly leading to breakage. Accordingly, the polymer-based piezoelectric composite material is required to have suitable flexibility.

Among them, the relief due to a microbrown movement of a molecular chain in an amorphous region is referred to as main dispersion, and an extremely large relieving phenomenon is observed.
