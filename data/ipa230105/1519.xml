The solder paste is heated to melt the solder in the paste by a reflow process, thereby forming the contact between the electronic component and the substrate. After cooling and solidification of the solder, the electronic component and substrate are firmly connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Solder pastes generally contain fluxes, which, among other things, serve to dissolve the oxide layer on the surfaces of the solder powder, of the component, and of the substrate, and to thus ensure better wettability during the soldering process. Since solder pastes are predominantly processed in screen and stencil printing in the automatic production of electronic circuits, the fluxes generally additionally contain substances, such as surfactants and additives, that improve the rheological properties of the flux and thus of the solder paste.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">After the soldering process, solder residues originating from the flux remain on the electronic assemblies, which, in the case of so-called no-clean solder pastes, do not need to be removed from the soldered assemblies. However, there is a tendency toward electromigration and/or dendrite formation originating from the solder joints, leading to undesired shorts. Especially in the course of progressive miniaturization, the problem of electromigration and/or dendrite formation is becoming increasingly important due to the concomitantly increasing proximity of electronic components which must remain electrically insulated from one another.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the invention is to provide a no-clean solder paste with reduced or no tendency toward electromigration and/or dendrite formation of solder joints formed therefrom.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The applicant has been able to develop a solder paste that achieves the object with a new, specially composed flux, which is characterized by the simultaneous presence of at least two natural resins which are in particular different from one another with regard to their average molecular weight (MW) and may optionally be modified.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the invention consists in providing a solder paste consisting of 85 to 92% by weight (percent by weight) of a tin-based solder and 8 to 15% by weight of a flux, characterized in that the flux comprises<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">i) 30 to 50% by weight, based on its total weight, of a combination of at least two optionally modified natural resins,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">ii) 5 to 20% by weight, based on its total weight, of at least one low-molecular carboxylic acid; and</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">iii) 0.4 to 10% by weight, based on its total weight, of at least one amine, wherein the combination of the optionally modified natural resins has an integral molecular weight distribution of 45 to 70% by area in the molecular weight range of 150 to 550 and of 30 to 55% by area in the molecular weight range of &#x3e;550 to 10,000 in the combined GPC (gel permeation chromatogram).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">A GPC, including the mentioned combined GPC in the form of an integral molecular weight distribution, can be recorded in the usual manner known to the person skilled in the art, e.g., according to DIN 55672-1 (Mar. 2016), using crosslinked polystyrene as immobile phase, tetrahydrofuran as liquid phase, and polystyrene standards, at a temperature of 23&#xb0; C.

This new flux comprised by the solder paste according to the invention itself in turn comprises, in each case based on its total weight, i) 30 to 50% by weight of a combination of at least two optionally modified natural resins, ii) 5 to 20% by weight of at least one low-molecular carboxylic acid, and iii) 0.4 to 10% by weight of at least one amine, wherein the combination of the optionally modified natural resins has an integral molecular weight distribution of 45 to 70% by area in the molecular weight range of 150 to 550 and of 30 to 55% by area in the molecular weight range of &#x3e;550 to 10,000 in the combined GPC.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">The flux comprises i) 30 to 50% by weight, based on its total weight, of a combination (mixture) of at least two optionally modified natural resins. For the person skilled in the art, it is not necessary to explain that &#x201c;modified&#x201d; stands for a chemical modification. The optionally modified natural resins may be unmodified or modified natural resins, e.g., natural resins modified by hydrogenation, dimerization, and/or esterification of their carboxyl groups. In particular, the natural resins are natural resins of the rosin resin type, i.e., unmodified or modified rosin resins, e.g., rosin resins modified by hydrogenation, dimerization, and/or esterification of their carboxyl groups.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">As already mentioned, the combination of the at least two optionally modified natural resins has an integral molecular weight distribution of 45 to 70% by area in the molecular weight range of 150 to 550 and of 30 to 55% by area in the molecular weight range of &#x3e;550 to 10,000 in the common GPC. In other words, the % by area in the molecular weight range of 150 to 550 and the % by area in the molecular weight range of &#x3e;550 to 10,000 add up to 100% by area of the integral molecular weight distribution in the molecular weight range of 150 to 10,000.

Wetting ability:</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054">The wetting properties of solder pastes were assessed using the melting test according to IPC-TM-650 (1/95) test method 2.4.45. For this purpose, the solder pastes to be tested were applied to copper sheets (20 mm x 20 mm x 0.5 mm). If the copper sheets had an oxide layer on the surface, they were polished to the bare metal with P600 grade sandpaper and cleaned with alcohol. Copper sheets that had a bright and pure surface were cleaned only with alcohol. The prepared copper sheets were printed with the aid of a stencil. For this purpose, the stencil was pressed firmly onto the copper sheet so that the openings in the stencil were in the middle of the copper sheet. The solder paste to be tested was placed on a Japanese spatula and spread first lightly, and then with somewhat more pressure, over the openings in the stencil until there was no more solder paste left on the stencil. The stencil was then carefully removed to obtain the pattern given by the stencil. The printed copper sheet was placed for 2 minutes onto a first heating plate set at 200&#xb0; C. to a temperature below the liquidus temperature of the solder and was then immediately placed onto a second heating plate with a temperature that was approx. 50&#xb0; C. above the liquidus temperature of the solder (peak temperature). After the solder paste or solder had melted, the copper sheet was left on the heating plate for another 5 seconds and then removed and cooled.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">After the solder paste had cooled down, an assessment was made as to whether it had melted into spots corresponding to the size of the openings in the stencil or into several small spots, and whether the solder paste had sharp edges after melting. It was assessed, furthermore, whether the surface was glossy or matte.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0056">The solder pastes were divided into four classes, wherein classes 1 and 2 were classified as satisfactory results, while classes 3 and 4 represented unsatisfactory results:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057">Class 1: The re-melted area was greater than the area previously printed with solder paste.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058">Class 2: The re-melted area corresponded to the area previously printed with solder paste.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">Class 3: The re-melted area was smaller than the area previously printed with solder paste (slight dewetting can be seen).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">Class 4: The solder paste had formed one or more solder balls and had not wetted the copper sheet or was not fully melted. 2.

The result of the SIR test was assessed as stable when all resistances measured over the period of time were &#x3e;100 MO.
