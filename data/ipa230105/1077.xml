It is known to separate a pump housing into a lower housing shell and an upper housing shell and to join these two shells together during assembly. This facilitates the assembly of the components inside the housing and also service, maintenance and repairs of the pumps. Such a peristaltic pump is disclosed, for example, in CN 2 11 485 985 U.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Medical pumps are exposed to external influences during operation. Particularly noteworthy are fluids that flow out of a leaking or burst hose, for example, or other fluids to which the pump is exposed in normal hospital use. Furthermore, the pumps are exposed to contaminants, such as dust. Both fluids and dust or other contaminants can enter the interior of the housing and damage the pump's electronics, thus affecting the pump's operation. This is especially critical since the pumps deliver vital medications to patients in some cases and should therefore be particularly fail-safe. Known medical pumps are susceptible to damage from fluids and contaminants that can enter the pump housing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, the object of the disclosure is to provide a medical pump that is robust against contamination and fluids. In particular, the pump should ensure at least the IP44 protection type/standard of protection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure relates in summary to a medical pump, preferably a peristaltic pump or a syringe pump, for conveying a medical fluid, having a housing which has an upper housing shell, a lower housing shell and a front lid pivotably arranged on the housing, preferably on the lower housing shell. A seal is provided between the two housing shells which seals the housing against contamination and fluids.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The seal is mounted between a plastic shell, which is a housing part of the pump housing, and a further plastic shell, which is another housing part of the pump housing. The seal seals the pump housing against external influences. The seal extends the service life of the pump. Fluids, contaminants and external influences can generally damage the pump, in particular the electronics of the pump. However, since the seal reliably prevents these interfering influences from entering the inside of the pump, the pump has a longer service life and is generally more robust against external influences.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The connection of the housing parts, which are assembled to a housing, and the seal, which is prepared between the housing parts, is suitable for the housing to meet at least the IP44 protection class.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, the seal is a sealing bead that is preferably made of polyurethane. Polyurethane as a sealant has several advantages:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">Polyurethane has been used as a sealant for some time. Therefore, the processing and material properties of polyurethane are well known. Polyurethane is foamed, is therefore very flexible in shaping and is elastic.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, the seal is elastic during assembly and disassembly of the housing shells. After disassembly of the two housing shells, for example during repair or maintenance, the seal is still elastic. This allows the two housing shells to be reassembled after repair, and the seal seals the two assembled housing shells without having to change the seal after repair.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, the sealing bead is foamed. The seal is formed by foaming the sealing bead. The foamed seal is distinguished by very good sealing properties. Furthermore, the material of the seal is very light. A wide variety of seal geometries can be achieved by foaming.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, the seal is a tempered seal. The tempering process hardens the sealing foam and the sealing bead is formed. Tempering makes the seal resistant to mechanical damage.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, the seal extends around the entire rim of the housing shell. Since the entire housing is to be sealed, the seal also encompasses the entire circumference of the housing shell. The sealing bead thus extends once completely around the edge of the housing shell. This ensures a gap-free seal and prevents fluid/contamination from entering the housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">According to another preferred feature of the disclosure, the seal fulfills at least the IP44 protection type. IP44 is a standard that defines the protection type of devices against fluids and dust.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">According to a further preferred feature of the disclosure, there is a distance between the housing shells which has a size such that the seal is not impermissibly pressed by the housing shells and a cell structure of the seal is not damaged. Impermissible pressing of the seal is pressing that damages the seal and in particular the cell structure of the seal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">The disclosure preferably provides a method of manufacturing a peristaltic pump having one of the preceding features comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">applying the seal to exactly one first housing shell of the lower housing shell and the upper housing shell,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">tempering the seal, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0020">subsequently placing the other housing shell on the first housing shell.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The seal is only applied to one housing shell. The seal is then tempered. Only after the seal has been tempered is the other housing shell placed on the first housing shell. This allows the two housing shells to be separated for repair without damaging the seal. After repair, the two shells can simply be reassembled and the seal still seals the housing. This saves repair costs and labor time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The disclosure further provides a method of manufacturing a syringe pump according to one of the preceding features, comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0023">applying the seal to exactly a first housing shell of the lower housing shell and the upper housing shell,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0024">tempering the seal, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0025">subsequently placing the other housing shell on the first housing shell</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0026">assembling a housing side part to the composite construction of the lower housing shell and the upper housing shell.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">As with the peristaltic pump, the seal is only applied to the first housing shell and then tempered. The other housing shell is then placed on top. The housing side part is mounted on the housing. This results in a completely sealed housing for the syringe pump.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an isometric view of a peristaltic pump according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top view of an upper housing shell of the peristaltic pump;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an isometric view of a syringe pump according to a second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an isometric view of an upper housing shell of the syringe pump; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a housing side part of the syringe pump.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a medical pump <b>1</b>, in particular a peristaltic pump.

The pump <b>1</b> has a housing <b>2</b> comprising two housing shells, namely a lower housing shell <b>4</b> and an upper housing shell <b>6</b>. The pump <b>1</b> has a front lid <b>8</b> that is attached to the lower housing shell <b>4</b> and can be folded down. The front lid has a display <b>7</b> and buttons <b>9</b>. Medical pumps such as peristaltic pumps or syringe pumps are generally known, for example from CN 2 11 485 985 U. Therefore, a general description of the mode of operation of the pump is omitted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top view of the upper housing shell <b>6</b> of the peristaltic pump <b>1</b>. The upper housing shell <b>6</b> is essentially a shell that is open at the top and has an approximately rectangular outline. The upper housing shell <b>6</b> has a flat lid <b>10</b> from which side walls <b>14</b> protrude. The upper housing shell <b>6</b> is slightly convex at a rear side of the upper housing shell <b>6</b>. The rear side is the side on which a connector and a power supply (not shown) of the pump <b>1</b> are attached. At a front side opposite to the rear side, the upper housing shell <b>6</b> has a projection <b>16</b>. The projection <b>16</b> protects the front lid <b>8</b>. Inside the housing <b>2</b>, components of the medical pump <b>1</b> are arranged. These are, in part, electronic components such as the power supply, a battery, an electric motor, and electrical wiring and the like (none of which are shown). These components are susceptible to fluids and contaminants. Furthermore, peristaltic pumps <b>1</b>, for example, include a peristaltic system (not shown) for moving fluid in a tube. The peristaltic system and its drive are sensitive mechanical components and therefore susceptible to contaminations and particles that jam or block moving parts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">A seal <b>12</b> runs around the rim of the upper housing shell <b>6</b>.

The seal <b>12</b> is a sealing bead made of an elastic plastic, preferably polyurethane. The seal <b>12</b> is applied by foaming to a housing shell, preferably the upper housing shell <b>6</b>. After application of the sealing bead, the housing shell is tempered with the sealing bead. The tempering step takes place before the two housing shells are assembled. This ensures that the two housing shells can be taken apart when repairing the pump <b>1</b> without damaging the seal <b>12</b>.
