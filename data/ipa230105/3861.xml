An attenuation amount and a propagation speed when the ultrasonic wave propagates in air (outside air) are different depending on a temperature of the air (hereinafter also referred to as an &#x201c;outside air temperature&#x201d;). Therefore, if an accurate outside air temperature can be recognized (or estimated), object detection accuracy can be improved.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it is not preferable in terms of cost to install a sensor only for detecting the outside air temperature. Therefore, when an object detection unit is provided with a temperature sensor that detects an environmental temperature (atmospheric temperature), the outside air temperature can be estimated based on a temperature detected by the temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, depending on an installation position of the object detection unit, the temperature sensor may be affected by engine exhaust heat, direct sunlight, or the like, a temperature significantly higher than the outside air temperature may be detected, and the outside air temperature may not be accurately estimated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, when there are a plurality of object detection units, for example, there is a technique in which the lowest temperature among temperatures detected by the respective temperature sensors is estimated as the outside air temperature, and object detection is performed based on the outside air temperature. Accordingly, a certain effect can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of the related art include Japanese Patent No. 6413622.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the above technique in the related art, for example, there is a problem that the object detection accuracy greatly decreases when the temperature sensor that detects the lowest temperature detects an abnormally low temperature due to a failure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A need thus exists for an object detection system which is not susceptible to the drawback mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an example of this disclosure, an object detection system includes: a plurality of object detection units, in which the object detection units each include a transmission and reception unit configured to transmit an ultrasonic wave and receive a reflected wave generated by reflection of the ultrasonic wave on an object, a reception circuit unit configured to detect a signal level of the reflected wave received by the transmission and reception unit, a detection unit configured to detect the object by comparing the signal level detected by the reception circuit unit with a predetermined signal threshold value, a temperature sensor configured to detect a temperature of an environment, and a detection sensitivity adjustment unit configured to adjust detection sensitivity of the reception circuit unit based on a second lowest temperature among temperatures detected by the respective temperature sensors in the plurality of object detection units.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and additional features and characteristics of this disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description considered with the reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary and schematic diagram illustrating an appearance of a vehicle including an object detection system according to a first embodiment as viewed from above;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exemplary and schematic block diagram illustrating a functional configuration of the object detection system according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary and schematic flowchart illustrating a series of processes executed by an object detection unit according to the first embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary and schematic flowchart illustrating a series of processes executed by an object detection unit according to a second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hereinafter, embodiments (a first embodiment and a second embodiment) of an object detection system disclosed here will be described with reference to the drawings.
