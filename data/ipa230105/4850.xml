Superconducting processors may also include processors that are not intended for quantum computing. For instance, some implementations of a superconducting processor may not focus on quantum effects such as quantum tunneling, superposition, and entanglement but may rather operate by emphasizing different principles, such as for example the principles that govern the operation of classical computer processors. There may still be certain advantages to the implementation of such superconducting &#x201c;classical&#x201d; processors. Due to their natural physical properties, superconducting classical processors may be capable of higher switching speeds and shorter computation times than non-superconducting processors, and therefore it may be more practical to solve certain problems on superconducting classical processors. The present systems and methods are particularly well-suited for use in fabricating both superconducting quantum processors and superconducting classical processors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Superconducting Qubits</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Superconducting qubits are a type of superconducting quantum device that may be included in a superconducting integrated circuit. Superconducting qubits may be separated into several categories depending on the physical property used to encode information. For example, superconducting qubits may be categorized into charge, flux and phase devices. Charge devices store and manipulate information in the charge states of the device. Flux devices store and manipulate information in a variable related to the magnetic flux through some part of the device. Phase devices store and manipulate information in a variable related to the difference in superconducting phase between two regions of the device. Recently, hybrid devices using two or more of charge, flux and phase degrees of freedom have been developed. Superconducting qubits commonly include at least one Josephson junction. A Josephson junction is a small interruption in an otherwise continuous superconducting current path and is typically realized by a thin insulating barrier sandwiched between two superconducting electrodes. Thus, a Josephson junction is usually formed as a three-layer or &#x201c;trilayer&#x201d; structure. Superconducting qubits are further described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,876,248, 8,035,540, and 8,098,179.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Integrated Circuit Fabrication</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An integrated circuit is also referred to in the present application as a chip, and a superconducting integrated circuit is also referred to in the present application as a superconducting chip.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, the fabrication of superconducting integrated circuits has not been performed at state-of-the-art semiconductor fabrication facilities. This may be because some of the materials used in superconducting integrated circuits may contaminate the semiconductor facilities. For instance, gold may be used as a resistor in superconducting circuits, but gold may contaminate a fabrication tool used to produce complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) wafers in a semiconductor facility.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Superconductor fabrication has typically been performed in research environments where standard industry practices could be optimized for superconducting circuit production. Superconducting integrated circuits are often fabricated with tools that are traditionally used to fabricate semiconductor chips or integrated circuits. Due to issues unique to superconducting circuits, not all semiconductor processes and techniques are necessarily transferrable to superconductor chip manufacture. Transforming semiconductor processes and techniques for use in superconductor chip and circuit fabrication often requires changes and fine adjustments. Such changes and adjustments typically are not obvious and may require a great deal of experimentation. The semiconductor industry faces problems and issues not necessarily related to the superconducting industry. Likewise, problems and issues that concern the superconducting industry are often of little or no concern in standard semiconductor fabrication.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Any impurities within superconducting chips may result in noise which may compromise or degrade the functionality of the individual devices, such as superconducting qubits, and of the superconducting chip as a whole.

Noise may compromise or degrade the functionality of the individual devices, such as superconducting qubits, and of the superconducting processor as a whole. Noise may negatively affect qubit coherence and reduce the efficacy of qubit tunneling. Since noise is a serious concern to the operation of quantum processors, measures should be taken to reduce noise wherever possible so that a transition from coherent to incoherent tunneling is not induced by the environment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Impurities may be deposited on the metal surface and/or may arise from an interaction with the etch/photoresist chemistry and the metal. Noise may be caused by impurities on the upper surface of the quantum processor. In some cases, superconducting devices that are susceptible to noise are fabricated in the top wiring layers of a superconducting integrated circuit and are thus sensitive to post-fabrication handling. There is a risk of introducing impurities that cause noise during post-fabrication handling. One approach to reducing noise is using a barrier passivation layer, for example, an insulating layer, to overlie the topmost wiring layer. The use of a barrier passivation layer to minimize noise from impurities on the upper surface of a quantum processor is described in US Patent Application No. 2018/02219150A1.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Noise may also result from an external environment or surrounding circuitry in a superconducting processor. In a quantum processor, flux noise on qubits interferes with properly annealing the quantum processor because of the steep transition between qubit states as the flux bias is swept. Flux noise may be a result of current flowing through wiring of other devices included in the superconducting processor and may have a particularly negative effect on qubits at their respective degeneracy points. For example, flux noise may introduce errors in calculations carried out by the superconducting processor due to inaccuracies in setting flux bias and coupling strength values. Such values are important to using an integrated circuit as part of a quantum processor. Much of the static control error may be designed out of the processor with careful layout and high-precision flux sources, as well as by adding circuitry, such as an on-chip shield, to tune away any non-ideal flux qubit behavior. However, in many cases, limitations in integrated circuit fabrication capabilities may make it difficult to address noise by changing processor layout and adding circuitry. There is thus a general desire for systems and methods to fabricate integrated circuits that have reduced flux noise.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Shielding</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0012">Magnetic fields produced by external sources may cause unwanted interactions with devices in the integrated circuit. Accordingly, there may be a need for a superconducting shield proximate to devices populating the integrated circuit to reduce the strength of interference such as magnetic and electrical fields. An example of this is discussed in WO 96/09654.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">Superconducting shielding incorporated into an integrated circuit has been used to protect superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) packages from DC and AC noise, such as magnetic and electrical fields, that would otherwise interfere with operation of the integrated circuit. Regions of the integrated circuit may be unshielded to allow for communication between magnetic and electrical fields external to the SQUID package. An example of this approach is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,660.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">Superconducting shielding layers may be used in single flux quantum (SFQ) or rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) technology to separate devices from DC power lines that could otherwise undesirably bias the devices. The devices populate the integrated circuit but are separated from the DC power lines by placing a ground plane between the devices and the DC power line. Examples of this type of approach are described, for example, in Nagasawa et al., &#x201c;Development of advanced Nb process for SFQ circuits&#x201d; Physica C 412-414 (2004) 1429-1436 (herein referred to as Nagasawa) and Satoh et al., &#x201c;Fabrication Process of Planarized Multi-Layer Nb Integrated Circuits&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 15, No. 2, (June 2005).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">In SFQ circuits, ground planes and shielding layers are terminologies used interchangeably. A ground plane in SFQ integrated circuit is a layer of metal that appears to most signals within the circuit as an infinite ground potential. The ground plane helps to reduce noise within the integrated circuit and may also be used to ensure that all components within the SFQ integrated circuits have a common potential to compare voltage signals. Nagasawa shows the use of contacts between wiring layers and a ground plane throughout SFQ circuitry.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">Supercurrent flowing in superconducting wires has an associated magnetic field in the same manner as electrons flowing in normal metal wires. Magnetic fields may couple inductively to superconducting wires, inducing currents to flow. Quantum information processing with superconducting integrated circuits necessarily involves supercurrents moving in wires, and hence associated magnetic fields. The quantum properties of quantum devices are very sensitive to noise, and stray magnetic fields in superconducting quantum devices may negatively impact the quantum information processing properties of such circuits.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related thereto are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive.

Above T<sub>c</sub>, the material is non-superconducting, while below T<sub>c </sub>the material behaves as a superconductor. The critical temperature is also referred to in the present application as the transition temperature.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">One of the properties of superconductors is that they expel interior magnetic fields. If there is an external magnetic field present as a superconducting integrated circuit is cooled through a critical temperature of a constituent superconducting material, magnetic flux may become trapped within the superconducting integrated circuit, as it can no longer pass through the superconducting material to reach other locations.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">Flux trapping may, for example, occur at locations of defects or impurities in a constituent superconducting material of a superconducting integrated circuit, as well as at various structural features of a superconducting integrated circuit or constituent devices of a superconducting integrated circuit. For example, on a superconducting circuit having both superconducting and non-superconducting regions, the non-superconducting regions may become preferred places for flux to be trapped. Flux trapping may result from a cooldown dynamic of a particular structure or implementation of a superconducting integrated circuit or constituent devices of a superconducting integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">Flux trapping may occur because, below T<sub>c</sub>, flux is no longer able to migrate out of or through the superconductor, and as such, remains trapped within the superconducting integrated circuit. Trapped flux may contribute to noise within a superconducting integrated circuit. In addition, trapped flux may move the operating points of superconducting quantum interference devices and other on chip devices. It may be desirable to reduce trapped flux within a superconducting integrated circuit and/or to direct flux to safe pinning sites.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">In order to form quantum computers having sufficiently large numbers of operating components to solve complex problems, it is necessary to employ multiple superconducting components in combination. In implementing groups of nominally identical devices at different locations within a superconducting integrated circuit, it may be necessary to implement on-chip control architecture to adjust individual components. For example, magnetic digital to analogue converters may be used to compensate for individual variations in operating points. However, trapped flux may cause flux offsets that are beyond what a digital to analogue converter is able to compensate, thereby rendering the device non-functional within the circuit.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">External and/or on-chip magnetic shielding may be employed to reduce background magnetic fields during cooldown of a superconducting integrated circuit (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,441,330). This in turn reduces the amount of magnetic flux that is available to be trapped within the superconducting integrated circuit. However, as some background magnetic field typically remains (the remaining background magnetic field is also referred to in the present application as a residual magnetic field), and it is possible for elements on a superconducting integrated circuit to generate magnetic flux, external and/or on-chip shielding may not fully prevent flux trapping within integrated circuits. The resulting trapped magnetic flux may therefore be a source of noise within the superconducting integrated circuit. Further, the trapped flux may move the operating points of some superconducting devices, resulting in problematic flux offsets. As used herein &#x201c;flux sensitive components&#x201d; will refer both to components that are affected by noise within the superconducting integrated circuit generated by trapped flux, as well as those components that are affected by trapped flux shifting the operating points of these components.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">It therefore may be beneficial to design superconducting integrated circuits including elements to reduce and/or prevent the influences of flux trapping on flux sensitive components of superconducting integrated circuits. Protective ground plane holes and moats (elongated holes or recesses) may be used in the design of superconducting integrated circuits to act as safe pinning sites for trapped flux. See, for example, Robertazzi et al. FLUX TRAPPING EXPERIMENTS IN SINGLE FLUX QUANTUM SHIFT REGISTERS, IEEE Trans. On Appl. Supercond., Vol. 7, pp. 3164-3167, June 1997.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">As discussed above, magnetic flux may become trapped within a superconducting integrated circuit as a superconducting material in one or more constituent devices, traces, or other components of the superconducting integrated circuit is cooled through its critical temperature. Magnetic flux trapped within a superconducting integrated circuit may be a source of noise that introduces errors into a computational result from quantum annealing, for example. Magnetic flux trapped within a superconducting integrated circuit may also move the operating points of devices beyond the compensation limit of control devices, rendering the devices inoperable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">Magnetic flux trapping may be limited by shielding a superconducting integrated circuit from external magnetic fields. However, a residual external magnetic field, as well as induced magnetic fields from components of the superconducting integrated circuit, may still generate flux. The flux may cause noise, errors, and inoperable components, particularly should the flux become trapped near flux-susceptible superconducting devices or cause the operating points of these devices to move.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Throughout the present specification, the phrase &#x201c;flux-susceptible superconducting device&#x201d; is used to describe a superconducting device that is susceptible to noise and for which a noise-free operating environment is highly desirable for performance of a superconducting integrated circuit, for example, a quantum processor. &#x201c;Flux-susceptible superconducting device&#x201d; is also used to describe a superconducting device that is susceptible to having its operating point shifted by trapped flux, such as a qubit. It will be understood that the same device may be susceptible to both noise and shifting of its operating point. Poor performance of a flux-susceptible device may result in the quantum processor producing an inaccurate or suboptimal solution to a problem, for example, an inaccurate or suboptimal result of quantum annealing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">In some implementations, a superconducting integrated circuit includes a quantum processor, and the quantum processor includes a superconducting qubit. A qubit is an example of a superconducting device that may be considered a flux-susceptible device. Flux noise and flux trapping in proximity to a superconducting flux qubit may interfere with a performance of the quantum processor, for example, producing an inaccurate or suboptimal result, and/or producing a result that is a solution to a different problem than the one programmed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">In some implementations, a superconducting integrated circuit includes a magnetometer. A magnetometer is a device used to measure magnetic flux. A magnetometer in a quantum processor may be used to measure residual magnetic flux from external magnetic fields, as well as induced magnetic flux from components of the quantum processor. Flux noise in a magnetometer may cause little or no degradation of performance of the quantum processor. Thus, in the present specification, a magnetometer is an example of a device that may be described as less susceptible or not susceptible to noise or flux. Another example of a device that may be described as less susceptible or not susceptible to noise is a digital to analog converter (DAC). Note that the phrases &#x201c;noise-susceptible&#x201d; and &#x201c;susceptible to noise&#x201d; do not necessarily suggest that the device itself is physically more or less sensitive to noise compared to other devices that are not described as noise-susceptible. Instead, &#x201c;noise-susceptible&#x201d; is used to refer to the sensitivity of processor performance to flux noise within a given device. The sensitivity of the processor performance to flux noise is higher in noise-susceptible devices than in devices that are described as less susceptible to noise. Further, devices that are less susceptible to noise are also less susceptible to shifting of their operating points due to trapped flux.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">One approach to reducing the impact of trapped magnetic flux on the operation of a superconducting integrated circuit is to configure the circuit to provide locations in which flux may be trapped that are away from any flux-susceptible superconducting devices. These locations are also referred to in the present application as safe (or safer) pinning sites for trapped flux.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">A path of travel for magnetic flux may be incorporated into the superconducting integrated circuit that draws flux away from flux-susceptible superconducting devices during cooldown, and into safe pinning sites for trapped flux. As the path of travel of magnetic flux through the superconducting integrated circuit during cooldown will be dependent on the critical temperature of each superconducting layer, superconducting materials may be selected that provide a favorable progression of critical temperatures as the superconducting integrated circuit is cooled.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">Current flowing through a metal material stores energy both in the magnetic field of that metal and in the kinetic energy of the charge carriers (e.g., the electrons or Cooper pairs). In non-superconducting metals, the charge carriers collide frequently with the lattice and lose their kinetic energy as Joule heating. This is also referred to as scattering, and quickly releases energy. In superconducting materials, scattering is substantially reduced, as the charge carriers are Cooper pairs which are protected against dissipation through scattering. This allows for superconducting materials to store energy in the form of kinetic inductance. This phenomenon allows kinetic inductance to efficiently store energy within the superconducting metal. Kinetic inductance is at least in part determined by the inertial mass of the charge carriers of a given material and increases as carrier density decreases. As the carrier density decreases, a smaller number of carriers must have a proportionally greater velocity in order to produce the same current. Materials that have high kinetic inductance for a given area (as defined below) are referred to as &#x201c;kinetic inductance materials&#x201d;, or &#x201c;high kinetic inductance materials&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">Kinetic inductance materials are those that have a high normal-state resistivity and/or a small superconducting energy gap, resulting in a larger kinetic inductance per unit of area. In general, total inductance L of a superconducting material is given by L=L<sub>K</sub>+L<sub>G</sub>, where L<sub>G </sub>is the geometric inductance and L<sub>K </sub>is the kinetic inductance. The kinetic inductance of a superconducting film in near-zero temperatures is proportional to the effective penetration depth &#x3bb;<sub>eff</sub>. In particular, for a film with a given thickness t, the kinetic inductance of the film is proportional to the ratio of the width of the film W to the length of the film L, where length is in the direction of the current and width is orthogonal to length (note that both width and length are orthogonal to the dimension in which thickness is measured).

The refrigerator may be, for example, a dilution refrigerator and/or a cryocooler, such as a pulse tube cryocooler, also referred to in the present application as a pulse tube refrigerator. A superconducting integrated circuit may be cooled to a temperature below 1K. In some implementations, the superconducting integrated circuit is cooled to below 20 mK.
