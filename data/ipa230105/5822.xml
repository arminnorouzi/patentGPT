In the semiconductor device <b>100</b>, a semiconductor chip <b>20</b> is bonded on a top surface of a circuit pattern <b>10</b> through a bonding material <b>12</b>. A lead <b>40</b> is bonded to a top surface of the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> through a bonding material <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The lead <b>40</b> electrically connects the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> to a frame <b>30</b>. A projection <b>32</b> projects from an obverse surface of the frame <b>30</b>. A projection insertion portion <b>44</b> into which the projection <b>32</b> is to be inserted is formed in the lead <b>40</b>. The projection insertion portion <b>44</b> of the present embodiment is a through hole extending from a top surface to a back surface of the lead <b>40</b>. The lead <b>40</b> contacts directly the frame <b>30</b>. Specifically, the obverse surface of the frame <b>30</b> and the back surface of the lead <b>40</b> are in surface contact with each other. A bonding material <b>16</b> is used to bond the projection <b>32</b> to the lead <b>40</b>. The bonding material <b>16</b> is provided between a side surface the lead <b>40</b> forming the projection insertion portion <b>44</b> and the projection <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The semiconductor chip <b>20</b> is, for example, a power semiconductor chip. It is preferable that the circuit pattern <b>10</b>, the frame <b>30</b>, and the lead <b>40</b> are formed of metal such as Al, Cu, or Au, for example. An opening <b>42</b> through which the bonding material <b>14</b> is to be exposed may be formed in the lead <b>40</b>. The opening <b>42</b> is provided to inject the bonding material <b>14</b>. The diameter of the projection insertion portion <b>44</b> of the lead <b>40</b> is larger than the diameter of the projection <b>32</b>. The projection <b>32</b> is fixed to the frame <b>30</b>. The projection <b>32</b> may be a part of the frame <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of the bonding materials <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is a conductive bonding material such as solder. The bonding material <b>16</b> may be solder or a non-conductive bonding material such as silicone rubber. The bonding material <b>16</b> may contact the frame <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A method of manufacturing the semiconductor device <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment will be described. The method of manufacturing the semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes the following first to third steps. The first step is performed before the second and third steps. The second and third steps may be simultaneously performed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first step is a step of preparing the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>, the frame <b>30</b>, and the lead <b>40</b>. The frame <b>30</b> is provided spaced from the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>, and the projection <b>32</b> projects from the obverse surface of the frame <b>30</b> in the thickness direction. The lead <b>40</b> has a plate shape, and an opening is formed in one or each end of the lead <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the second step, the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> and the lead <b>40</b> are electrically connected to each other. Specifically, the lead <b>40</b> is bonded to the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> through the bonding material <b>14</b>. The bonding material <b>14</b> is melted by heating the entire semiconductor device <b>100</b>, by heating the lead <b>40</b> and the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>, or by applying laser light to the bonding material <b>14</b> to heat the bonding material <b>14</b>. This enables the lead <b>40</b> to be bonded to the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the third step, the projection <b>32</b> is inserted into the projection insertion portion <b>44</b> formed in the lead <b>40</b>, and the projection <b>32</b> and the lead <b>40</b> are bonded to each other through the bonding material <b>16</b> in a state in which the frame <b>30</b> and the lead <b>40</b> directly contact each other to be electrically connected to each other. The bonding material <b>16</b> is melted by heating the entire semiconductor device <b>100</b>, by heating the lead <b>40</b> and the frame <b>30</b>, or by applying laser light to the bonding material <b>16</b>. This enables the lead <b>40</b> to be bonded to the projection <b>32</b>. In the case where the bonding material <b>16</b> is non-conductive, the bonding material <b>16</b> is cured by being heated, so that the lead <b>40</b> and the projection <b>32</b> are bonded to each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the effect of the present embodiment will be described. In the present embodiment, the projection <b>32</b> is inserted into the projection insertion portion <b>44</b> of the lead <b>40</b>, whereby the position of the lead <b>40</b> can be prevented from being shifted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As a comparative example relative to the present embodiment, a configuration will be described in which the obverse surface of the frame <b>30</b> and the back surface of the lead <b>40</b> are bonded to each other through a bonding material, for example. This configuration may make it impossible to sufficiently fill a space between the lead <b>40</b> and the frame <b>30</b> with the bonding material in the case where the lead <b>40</b> is inclined or an amount of the bonding material is small. This may cause a risk that the sufficient bonding strength cannot be obtained. In this way, it is assumed that member variation or assembly variation results in large changes in product life and temperature cycle resistance. This may make it difficult to manage the components and production.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In contrast, in the present embodiment, the projection <b>32</b> and the lead <b>40</b> can be bonded to each other in the state in which the frame <b>30</b> and the lead <b>40</b> directly contact each other. Accordingly, the lead <b>40</b> and the projection <b>32</b> can be stably bonded to each other. This enables stable bonding even when there is the member variation or the assembly variation, whereby the product life and the temperature cycle resistance can be stabilized. Accordingly, the reliability in bonding can be improved. Additionally, the component management and the production management can be easily performed. In this way, the present embodiment makes it possible to stably produce a product capable of maintaining a sufficient bonding strength between the lead <b>40</b> and the projection <b>32</b> while preventing the position of the lead <b>40</b> from being shifted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular, when the bonding material <b>16</b> is melted with the laser light, a light amount of the laser light is large, and the resulting thermal energy of the laser light may cause expansion of the frame <b>30</b> or the bonding material <b>16</b>. Furthermore, when the bonding material <b>16</b> is melted to be used for bonding, there may be a possibility that the frame <b>30</b> is not horizontal. Even in such a case, in the present embodiment, the frame <b>30</b> and the lead <b>40</b> contact each other, whereby the projection <b>32</b> and the lead <b>40</b> can be stably bonded to each other. Accordingly, the wide control range of the laser light can be ensured. Additionally, the wide control ranges of the shape of the frame and temperature can be ensured. Accordingly, the production can be easily achieved. In the present embodiment, the lead <b>40</b> and the projection <b>32</b> are bonded to each other, whereby the bonding area can be limited. Accordingly, the mounting density can be increased.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present embodiment, the obverse surface of the frame <b>30</b> and the back surface of the lead <b>40</b> are in surface contact with each other. This can ensure a large contact area, reducing the contact resistance. Accordingly, the bonding material <b>16</b> can be non-conductive. For example, when solder is used as the bonding material <b>16</b>, the solder cracks easily occur due to stress due to repetitive temperature change. In contrast, when silicone rubber is used as the bonding material <b>16</b>, the silicone rubber is soft and absorbs the stress due to temperature change, whereby a long life of the bonding portion can be expected. The silicone rubber is generally cheaper than the solder. Therefore, a cost reducing effect can be expected.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The structure of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> and the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device <b>100</b> are not limited to those mentioned above. For example, the shape of the projection <b>32</b> is not limited to a cylindrical shape, and may be formed into a cone shape, a prism shape, or a pyramid shape. In the present embodiment, since electrical connection can be ensured by direct contact between the frame <b>30</b> and the lead <b>40</b>, the projection <b>32</b> may be non-conductive.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The semiconductor chip <b>20</b> may be made with a wide bandgap semiconductor. The wide bandgap semiconductor is, for example, silicon carbide, a gallium nitride-based material or diamond. According to the present embodiment, even in the case where the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> made with the wide bandgap semiconductor operates at a high temperature, the temperature cycle resistance can be stabilized, so that the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> can be stably operated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">These modifications can be appropriately applied to semiconductor devices and methods of manufacturing the semiconductor devices according to embodiments below. Meanwhile, for the semiconductor devices and the methods of manufacturing the semiconductor devices according to the embodiments below, dissimilarities with the first embodiment will mainly be explained as they have many similarities with the first embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a semiconductor device <b>200</b> according to a second embodiment. A lead <b>40</b> need not cover the entire periphery of a projection <b>32</b>. A projection insertion portion <b>244</b> may be a cutout formed in an end of the lead <b>40</b>. Also in this case, the lead <b>40</b> and the projection <b>32</b> can be stably bonded to each other while preventing the position of the lead <b>40</b> from being shifted.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a semiconductor device <b>300</b> according to a third embodiment. A plurality of projection insertion portions <b>44</b> may be formed in a lead <b>40</b>. At this time, a plurality of projections <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>project from a frame <b>30</b>, and are inserted into the plurality of projection insertion portions <b>44</b> in one-to-one correspondence. The number of projections <b>32</b> to be provided may be three or more.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Such a configuration can prevent the lead <b>40</b> from rotating around the projections <b>32</b> when the bonding material <b>16</b> is melted.
