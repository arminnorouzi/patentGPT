Reference characters denote like elements throughout figures and text.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of specific illustrative embodiments in which the embodiments may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In general, a distributed 5G gNodeB can be partitioned into different entities, each of which can be implemented in different ways. For example, each entity can be implemented as a physical network function (PNF) or a virtual network function (VNF) and in different locations within an operator's network (for example, in the operator's &#x201c;edge cloud&#x201d; or &#x201c;central cloud&#x201d;). A distributed 5G gNodeB can be partitioned into one or more central units (CUs), one or more distributed units (DUs), and one or more radio units (RUs). The CU and DUs together are referred to as a baseband controller (BC). Each CU can be further partitioned into a central unit control-plane (CU-CP) and one or more central unit user-plane (CU-UPs) dealing with the gNodeB Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and above layers of functions of the respective planes, and each DU configured to implement the upper part of physical layer through radio link control (RLC) layer of both control-plane and user-plane of gNodeB. In this example, each RU is configured to implement the radio frequency (RF) interface and lower physical layer control-plane and user-plane functions of the gNodeB. Each RU is typically implemented as a physical network function (PNF) and is deployed in a physical location where radio coverage is to be provided. Each DU is typically implemented as a virtual network function (VNF) and, as the name implies, is typically distributed and deployed in a distributed manner in the operator's edge cloud. Each CU-CP and CU-UP are typically implemented as virtual network functions (VFs) and, as the name implies, are typically centralized and deployed in the operator's central cloud.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Cloudification and virtualization of network elements for a 5G gNodeB brings in a lot of benefits also impose more and more challenges to the security solutions that protect the VNF hosting platform from being compromised by unauthenticated booting modules and unauthorized applications. For radio units to operate in 5G NR, they need to support authentication and security using public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates &#x26; keys in order to establish secured communications with a DU over a management plane (M-plane). This is a departure from the legacy approach of LTE where the DU and RU utilizes a pre-shared key installed at the factory as security. As such, a challenge is presented in how to securely install a unique set of digital certificate and private key in newly fabricated RUs from the recognized certificate authority (CA). Moreover, an already-deployed RU may be capable of supporting multiple carriers that may include a mix of 4G LTE and 5G carriers. These deployed RUs are installed in the field as part of operating wireless base stations, and do not have access to the Internet to be able to retrieve for themselves their digital certificate and private key to operate in 5G. Accordingly, another challenge is presented in how to securely install a unique set of digital certificate and private key in newly fabricated RUs from the recognized certificate authority (CA) into these deployed RUs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for securely providing unique digital certificate and private key allocations to a wireless base station radio units. The end-to-end approach described herein securely delivers the desired credentials to multi-band radio units whether they are newly fabricated, or already deployed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref> are block diagrams illustrating examples of a virtualized wireless base station <b>100</b> on a VNF hosting platform on which the radio units described herein may be utilized.

Moreover, the radio units (RUs) discussed herein may alternately be described in different implementations as radio points (RPs) or remote antenna units (RAUs).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the particular examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref>, the virtualized wireless base station <b>100</b> comprises a 5G gNodeB <b>100</b> partitioned into one or more central units (CUs) <b>102</b>, which include a central unit control-plane (CU-CP) <b>116</b> and one or more central unit user-planes (CU-UPs) <b>118</b>. In this example, the CU-CP <b>116</b> and CU-UPs <b>118</b> are both implemented as VNFs, but may be implemented in other ways in other implementations. The gNodeB <b>100</b> is further partition into one or more distributed units (DUs) and one or more radio units (RUs) <b>106</b>. In this example, the DUs <b>105</b> are composed of one or more DU VNFs <b>105</b>, but may be implemented in other ways in other implementations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this example the virtualized 5G gNodeB <b>100</b> is configured so that each CU <b>102</b> is configured to serve one or more DU VNF <b>105</b> and each DU VNF <b>105</b> is configured to serve one or more RUs <b>106</b>. In the particular configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref>, a single CU <b>102</b> serves a single DU VNF <b>105</b>, and the DU VNF <b>105</b> serves three RUs <b>106</b>.

In other embodiments, other numbers of CUs <b>102</b>, DUs <b>104</b>, and RUs <b>106</b> can be used. Also, the number of DUs <b>104</b> served by each CU <b>102</b> can vary from CU <b>102</b> to CU <b>102</b>. Likewise, the number of RUs <b>106</b> served by each DU can vary from DU VNF <b>105</b> to DU VNF <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, although the following embodiments are primarily described as being implemented for use to provide 5G NR service, it is to be understood the techniques described here can be used with other wireless interfaces (for example, fourth generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) service) and references to &#x201c;gNodeB&#x201d; used in this disclosure can be replaced with the more general term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; or &#x201c;base station entity&#x201d; and/or a term particular to the alternative wireless interfaces (for example, &#x201c;enhanced NodeB&#x201d; or &#x201c;eNB&#x201d;). Furthermore, it is also to be understood that 5G NR embodiments can be used in both standalone and non-standalone modes (or other modes developed in the future) and the following description is not intended to be limited to any particular mode. Also, unless explicitly indicated to the contrary, references to &#x201c;layers&#x201d; or a &#x201c;layer&#x201d; (for example, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, the Physical Layer, the MAC Layer, etc.) set forth herein refer to layers of the wireless interface (for example, 5G NR or 4G LTE) used for wireless communication between a base station and user equipment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some configurations, every RU <b>106</b> serves the same cell(s) <b>110</b>. Generally, for each cell <b>110</b> implemented by the gNodeB <b>100</b>, the corresponding BC <b>120</b> serving the cell <b>110</b> performs the LAYER-3 and LAYER-2 functions for the particular wireless interface used for that cell <b>110</b>.

Each of the RUs <b>106</b> serving that cell <b>110</b> perform the LAYER-1 functions not performed by the BC <b>120</b> (also referred to here as the &#x201c;lower LAYER-1 functions&#x201d;) as well as implementing the analog RF transceiver functions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Different splits in the wireless-interface functions between each BC <b>120</b> and the RUs <b>106</b> can be used. For example, the functional split used for downlink communications (that is, communications transmitted to the UEs <b>108</b>) can differ from the functional split used for uplink communications (that is, communications received from the UEs <b>108</b>). Also, for a given direction (downlink or uplink), the same functional split does not need to be used for all fronthaul data communicated in that direction. For example, different functional splits can be used for different channels or different resource blocks.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some configurations, each RU <b>106</b> comprises one or more radio frequency (RF) modules. Each RF module comprises special-purpose hardware (circuitry) that implements the RF transceiver functions for the wireless interface used for communicating with the UEs <b>108</b> using a particular carrier. Each RF modules also interfaces an RU module (and the RU <b>106</b>) to the one or more antennas <b>112</b> used with that particular carrier.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some configurations, each RU <b>106</b> is implemented using special-purpose hardware that comprises a multi-core general purpose processor and programmable logic (such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)). In some configurations, each RU <b>106</b> implements some of the lower LAYER-1 functions for the particular wireless interfaces used for communicating with UEs <b>108</b>. The lower LAYER-1 functions, in some configurations, are implemented using the programmable logic in the RU <b>106</b>. Also, in some configurations, each RU <b>106</b> implements a timing client to synchronize its clock to the master clock for the gNodeB <b>100</b>. The timing client, in some configurations, is implemented in software executed by the general-purpose processor in the RU <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some configurations, at least some of the RUs <b>106</b> are implemented as multi-carrier radio points. The gNodeB <b>100</b> can be implemented using only single-carrier radio points, only multi-carrier radio points, or both single-carrier radio points and multi-carrier radio points. Also, any given cell <b>110</b> can be served by only single-carrier radio points, only multi-carrier radio points, or both single-carrier radio points and multi-carrier radio points.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When an RU <b>106</b> optionally serves multiple cells <b>110</b> using multiple carriers, it may do so by implementing different RU instances (e.g., modules). For example, an RU <b>106</b> could use a different RU instance for each carrier the RU <b>106</b> implements. In some examples, each RU instance within an RU <b>106</b> may be implemented as an independent digital instance (e.g., a processing core) on one or more programmable processors in a multi-instance RU <b>106</b> within a single physical housing, e.g., where each programmable processor is a field programmable gate array (FPGA), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a microprocessor, or a digital signal processor (DSP). Each multi-instance RU <b>106</b>, may optionally have multiple ETHERNET ports, each being assigned to a different RU instance (though all RU instances in a multi-instance RU may optionally share the same IP address).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each multi-carrier radio point may optionally include multiple RF modules and be configured to serve multiple cells <b>110</b> using multiple carriers, possibly using multiple wireless interfaces or protocols, in a flexible and dynamic manner. Typically, each multi-carrier radio point is homed to a separate BC <b>120</b> for each cell <b>110</b> that it serves (and each carrier used to serve that cell <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, the virtualized gNodeB <b>100</b> is configured to provide wireless service to various numbers of user equipment (UEs) <b>108</b> using one or more cells <b>110</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref> for ease of illustration). Each RU <b>106</b> includes or is coupled to a respective set of one or more antennas <b>112</b> via which downlink RF signals are radiated to UEs <b>108</b> and via which uplink RF signals transmitted by UEs <b>108</b> are received.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one configuration (used, for example, in indoor deployments), each RU <b>106</b> is co-located with its respective set of antennas <b>112</b> and is remotely located from the DU VNF <b>105</b> and CU <b>102</b> serving it as well as the other RUs <b>106</b>. In another configuration (used, for example, in outdoor deployments), the respective sets of antennas <b>112</b> for multiple RUs <b>106</b> are deployed together in a sectorized configuration (for example, mounted at the top of a tower or mast), with each set of antennas <b>112</b> serving a different sector. In such a sectorized configuration, the RUs <b>106</b> need not be co-located with the respective sets of antennas <b>112</b> and, for example, can be co-located together (for example, at the base of the tower or mast structure) and, possibly, co-located with its serving DUs <b>104</b>. Other configurations can be used.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The virtualized gNodeB <b>100</b> is implemented using a scalable cloud environment to define a baseband controller (BC) <b>120</b> in which resources used to instantiate each type of entity can be scaled horizontally (that is, by increasing or decreasing the number of physical computers or other physical devices) and vertically (that is, by increasing or decreasing the &#x201c;power&#x201d; (for example, by increasing the amount of processing and/or memory resources) of a given physical computer or other physical device). The BC <b>120</b> can be implemented in various ways.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the BC <b>120</b> can be implemented using hardware virtualization, operating system virtualization, and application virtualization (also referred to as containerization) as well as various combinations of two or more of the preceding. The BC <b>120</b> can be implemented in other ways. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A</figref>, the BC <b>120</b> is implemented in a distributed manner. That is, the BC <b>120</b> is implemented as a distributed scalable cloud environment <b>120</b> comprising at least one central cloud <b>114</b> and at least one edge cloud <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a function is described herein as being implemented using a virtualized platform, that function could be implemented in software suitable for execution by a virtual machine instantiated on a generic server or an accelerated server.

An &#x201c;accelerated server&#x201d; refers to a general-purpose server computer that includes one or more hardware acceleration units (for example, one of more FPGAs).

Because the BC <b>120</b> and RU <b>108</b> are both in operation, there is already secure communications established between the BC <b>120</b> and RU <b>108</b>. Moreover, the RU <b>108</b> has been updated (shown at <b>310</b>) to include the OPS SDK <b>213</b> and the RU M-Plane functions that include the code for establishing and operating M-plane communication with the DU VNF <b>105</b> utilizing the RU's digital certificate and private key (once received from the OPS CA <b>220</b>). In some embodiments, the RU <b>108</b> comprises RU application code that supports M-plane Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) communication.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once the OPS SDK <b>213</b> is uploaded and executed by the processor <b>206</b>, the RU <b>108</b> has the ability to talk with the DU VNF <b>105</b> via the M-plane. The OPS SDK <b>213</b> will make an initial query to the certificate store <b>210</b> and determine that it lacks an RU set of digital certificate and private key. In response, the OPS SDK <b>213</b> sends an RU PKI status message <b>320</b> to inform the BC <b>120</b> its RU digital certificate and private key are missing.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the BC <b>120</b> receives the RU PKI status message <b>320</b> it will determine whether the RU <b>108</b> should receive a RU digital certificate and private key. That is, the network operator may determine that for the BC <b>120</b>, one or more of the currently deployed RUs <b>108</b> will not support the upgraded wireless service. For example, the network operator has elected to deploy 5G NR to some coverage areas, but not others. The BC <b>120</b> therefore sends to the DMS <b>230</b> an enable request message <b>322</b> indicating the RU <b>108</b> with the missing RU digital certificate and private key. The DMS <b>230</b>, being the management system for the wireless network, knows which BCs and RUs will be supporting the upgraded wireless service and responds to the BC <b>120</b> with an enable response message <b>324</b> that tells the BC <b>120</b> whether the RU <b>108</b> is authorized to receive an RU digital certificate and private key.

At the RU <b>108</b>, the RU digital certificate and private key response message <b>338</b> is verified, and the private key is decrypted (shown at <b>340</b>) by the OPS SDK <b>213</b>.
