Such film and television screenings serve a variety of purposes and are often conducted prior to distribution to the masses. For example, film producers may seek to conduct test screenings with a small target audience with certain demographic characteristics that are indicative of the general population at large in order to solicit feedback from the target audience prior to release of a film to the general population. Based on the feedback from the target audience, the film or television program may potentially be reshot, edited, or even rewritten to increase the probability of appealing to a target population and driving ticket sales and/or viewership numbers. Notably, the feedback may be solicited from the target audience through a variety of techniques and methodologies. For example, feedback may be solicited via in-person focus groups, written or digital surveys, phone interviews, video interviews, and other feedback solicitation methodologies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the primary way to conduct advance film and television screenings is to do so by using multiple disparate services that are often conducted by different vendors. For instance, one company may set up a reservation system to set up reservations for individuals to attend a potential screening, or, in certain cases, may go via the simpler route by using traditional spreadsheets or digital documents to manually enter information associated with each individual obtaining a reservation to attend a screening. Once the list of individuals that are selected for screening is generated, a vendor may send emails or make phone calls to such individuals indicating where the screening will take place, timing information for the screening, and other relevant screening details. If the screening is at a physical theater location, a vendor associated with the screening location will set up the screening at the dates and times specified by the other vendor. If the screening is an online screening, a different vendor may be needed to set up the online video player and ensure that the content stream associated with streaming the screening is synchronized so that all screening participants view the screening simultaneously. Once the screening is completed, yet another vendor may be utilized to obtain feedback from screening participants, such as via in-person interviews, in-person or digital surveys, focus groups, and the like. Based on at least the foregoing, current screening reservation, viewing, and feedback processes are often inefficient, cumbersome, difficult to manage, and lack uniformity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, there remains room for substantial enhancements to existing technologies and processes and for the development of new technologies and processes to enhance the film and television screening experience for not only participants, but also for businesses interested in the reactions and feedback from such participants. While currently existing processes provide for various benefits, such processes still come with various drawbacks and inefficiencies. For example, currently existing processes and technologies often require the use of multiple different vendors that use different processes that utilize different data. Additionally, existing processes fail to provide for effective measures to effectively prevent or thwart piracy and/or unauthorized behavior conducted by screening participants and malicious actors. Furthermore, existing process are often labor-intensive and require a significant amount of administrative work to facilitate. Based on the foregoing, current reservation and screening processes may be improved and enhanced to provide for more effective screening capabilities, greater quality feedback gathering capabilities, enhanced reservation capabilities, enhanced anti-piracy capabilities, and improved screening participant satisfaction. Such enhancements and improvements to methodologies and technologies may lead to enhanced participation by screening participants, higher quality feedback from screening participants. enhanced participant engagement during screenings and surveys, and increased screening and reservation process efficiencies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system and accompanying methods for facilitating a virtual screening are disclosed. In particular, the system and methods provide an end-to-end solution to process online invitations and recruitments from a database of users and/or external invitees to an advance media content screening that is hosted online in an efficient and streamlined manner. The system and methods further drive virtual screening participants to feedback gathering components of the same end-to-end solution. To that end, the system and methods may facilitate identification of users to participate in virtual screenings of media content, such by analyzing demographic information, user desire to participate in the virtual screenings, survey responses, other factors, or a combination thereof. The system and methods may generate a unique link for each user admitted to a screening and may make the link accessible to the user, such as via electronic mail, via an application, via text message, and/or via other means of communication. An admitted user may then authenticate with the system, such as via multifactor authentication, after interacting with the unique link. If a user is unable to successfully authenticate with the system, the user may be prevented from accessing the system and/or the system may generate a new link under certain circumstances. Once the admitted user successfully authenticates with the system, the system and methods may associate the unique link with an identifier of the user. For example, the unique link may be associated with an internet protocol address of the user, any device identifier of a device of the user, any type of identifier associated with the user or a device of the user, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The system and methods may include requesting a digital key for facilitating decryption of an encrypted version of the media content. For example, the media content may be encrypted using one or more digital rights management techniques and the digital key may be utilized to decrypt the encrypted media content so that it may be accessed by a user admitted to the virtual screening. The system and methods may also include requesting a digitally signed file, such as a digitally signed cookie, to facilitate access to the media content for a device of the user admitted to the virtual screening. In certain embodiments, the digitally signed file may incorporate and/or include one or more parameters that dictate how, when, and/or with what device the user may access the media content. Before the media content is streamed to the user, the system and methods may include applying a unique visual or other watermark to the media content so that use of the media content by the user may be tracked. For example, the watermark may be specific to the user and/or the user's device and may be utilized by the systems and methods to determine whether the media content was improperly transmitted to unauthorized users, systems, and/or devices, whether the media content was accessed in an unauthorized manner, whether the user copied the content, whether the user uploaded the content to an improper location, and/or whether the user altered the media content. Once the watermark is applied to the media content, the system and methods may include streaming the media content to a device of the user as part of the virtual screening of the media content. In certain embodiments, the version of the media content that is streamed to the user may be unique to that particular user. As the user is experiencing the media content and/or after the media content viewing experience has been completed, the system and methods may include providing digital surveys and/or other feedback mechanisms to obtain feedback from the user that is associated with the media content. The systems and methods may utilize the feedback to potentially alter the media content before being released to the masses. Based on the foregoing, the system and methods provide a seamless, efficient, and integrated system for identifying users for screenings, generating unique links and versions of media content for each user selected for a screening, the ability to control access to the content based on parameters and/or rules, monitoring usage of the media content, and obtaining feedback for potentially enhancing the media content.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a system for facilitating a virtual screening is provided. The system may include a memory that stores instructions and a processor that executes the instructions to perform various operations of the system. The system may perform an operation that includes identifying a user for participating in a virtual screening of media content. For example, the user may be identified by the system based on demographic information, responses to questionnaires, psychographic information, the user having preferences associated with the media content, other factors, or a combination thereof. Once the user is identified, the system may perform an operation that includes generating and transmitting a unique link to the user for facilitating access to the media content for the virtual screening at a specified time. The user may interact with the unique link, and, based on the interaction, the system may perform an operation that includes authenticating the user for the virtual screening via a multifactor authentication process. For example, the system may authenticate the user via short message service (SMS) codes, time-based codes from authenticator applications, biometric information, any other authentication techniques, or a combination thereof. Once the user is authenticated with the system, the system may perform an operation that includes associating the unique link with an identifier associated with the user. For example, the unique link may be associated with and/or locked with the internet protocol address of a device of the user to ensure that the link may only be used by the user. The system may proceed to perform an operation that includes requesting a digital key, such as a digital rights management key, to facilitate decryption of the media content. Additionally, the system may perform an operation that includes requesting a digitally signed file, such as a cookie, for facilitating access to the media content by the device of the user at the specified time and/or for a specified duration of time. The system may perform an operation that includes applying a visual or other watermark to the media content that facilitates tracking of use of the media content by the user. Furthermore, the system may perform an operation that includes streaming, during the virtual screening, the media content to the device of the user according to one or more parameters specified by the digitally signed file and by utilizing the digital key. Moreover, the system may perform an operation that includes obtaining feedback associated with the media content from the user.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a method for facilitating a virtual screening is disclosed. The method may include a memory that stores instructions and a processor that executes the instructions to perform the functionality of the method. In particular, the method may include identifying a user for participating in a virtual screening of media content. The method may also include transmitting a unique link to the user for facilitating access to the media content at a specified time. After the user interacts with the unique link, the method may include authenticating the user for the virtual screening via a multifactor authentication process. The method may proceed to include associating the unique link with an identifier associated with the user and/or a device of a user. The method may include requesting a digital key for facilitating decryption of the media content and requesting a digitally signed file for facilitating access to the media content for a device of the user at the specified time and/or for a specified duration of time. The method may include applying a visual or other watermark to the media content for facilitating tracking of use of the media content by the user and/or the device of the user. Furthermore, the method may include streaming, during a virtual screening, the media content to the device of the user according to one or more parameters of the digitally signed file and by utilizing the digital key. Moreover, the method may include obtaining feedback associated with the media content from the user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another embodiment, a computer-readable device comprising instructions, which, when loaded and executed by a processor cause the processor to perform operations, the operations comprising: identifying a user for participating in a virtual screening of media content; transmitting a unique link to the user for facilitating access to the media content at a specified time; authenticating, after the user interacts with the unique link, the user for the virtual screening via a multifactor authentication process; associating, after the authenticating, the unique link with an identifier associated with the user; requesting a digital key for facilitating decryption of the media content; requesting a digitally signed file for facilitating access to the media content for a device of the user at the specified time and for a specified duration of time; applying a visual watermark to the media content for facilitating tracking of use of the media content; streaming, during the virtual screening, the media content to the device of the user according to a parameter of the digitally signed file and by utilizing the digital key; and obtaining feedback associated with the media content from the user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features of the systems and methods for facilitating a virtual screening are described in the following detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a system for facilitating a virtual screening according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating components, functionality, and processors for facilitating a virtual screening.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating additional processes and functionality for facilitating a virtual screening.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a sample method for facilitating a virtual screening according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a machine in the form of a computer system within which a set of instructions, when executed, may cause the machine to facilitate a virtual screening according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A system <b>100</b> and accompanying methods for facilitating a virtual screening are disclosed.

In certain embodiments, the subsystems <b>200</b>-<b>300</b> may be separate from the system <b>100</b>, within the system <b>100</b>, and/or be partially within the system <b>100</b>. The subsystem <b>200</b> may be a subsystem that may be utilized by the system <b>100</b> to process, store, format, encrypt, modify, and/or deliver media content to users, such as user participating a virtual screening of media content. The subsystem <b>300</b> may be a subsystem that may be utilized by the system <b>100</b> to approve users for participating in virtual screenings and stream media content associated with such virtual screenings to such users. At <b>202</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may include obtaining a source video file (or other media file) to be streamed to a user during a virtual screening. For example, the source video file may be a movie file, a television program, a commercial, any type of media content, or a combination thereof. The source video file may be obtained from those in control of the media content, those that created the media content, a media content origin server, and/or media content repositories. At <b>204</b>, the source video file may be encrypted by utilizing any suitable encryption technique, such as, but not limited to, AES-256 encryption. Once the video source file (or other media content) is encrypted, the encrypted media content may be stored, at <b>206</b>, via an object storage service that facilitates handling, delivery, and/or availability of the video source file <b>202</b>. In certain embodiments, the object storage service may be a cloud storage service. At <b>208</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may include utilizing a computing service, which may be utilized to provide computing resources for managing the media content and/or executing code associated with managing the media content. In certain embodiments, the computing service may be a serverless computing service that operates without provisioning and/or managing servers. In certain embodiments, the computing service may be utilized to process the media content for distribution and/or other purposes as desired.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At <b>210</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may utilize a media converter to transcode the encrypted source video file into any number of output formats to facilitate streaming and/or consumption of the media content on any number of devices, any types of devices, any types of software applications, any types of mobile applications, any types of devices having different capabilities, or a combination thereof. The transcoding may also be utilized to create numerous versions of the media content that have different resolutions, qualities, frame rates, audio qualities, play lengths, and/or other characteristics. For example, the media converter may be utilized to convert the source video file into formats including, but not limited to, HLS Dash ISO, CMAF, MPEG-4, QuickTime, MPEG-3, any other format, or a combination thereof. At <b>212</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may cause the source video file to be transmitted after transcoding is conducted by the media converter. At <b>214</b>, in certain embodiments, the source video file may be provided to a deletion service to delete the source video file after the various output formats of the media content are generated. In certain embodiments, the source video file may be kept instead of being provided to a deletion service. At <b>216</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may utilize a preprocessor packager to process the various versions of the media content. Once the preprocessing is the completed, the preprocessor packager may provide the various versions of media content to a digital rights management system at <b>218</b>. The digital rights management system may inject digital rights management code and/or features into the various versions of the media content to ensure that the media content is not tampered with and/or utilized in a manner that is unauthorized. Once the digital rights management features are injected into the various versions of the media content, the versions of the media content may be provided to a A/B variant service at <b>220</b>. The A/B variant service may be utilized to generate further versions of the media content so as to determine whether certain versions of the media content are preferred by virtual screening participants over other versions. For example, the A/B variant service may generate a version of the media content that includes a particular scene and another version that has a different version of the scene or removes the scene altogether.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At <b>222</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may encrypt the various versions of the media content to secure the media content and to ensure that unauthorized access to the versions of the media content does not occur. At <b>224</b>, the versions of the media content may be provided to a cloud storage service for storing the various versions of media content and/or to prepare the versions of media content for transmission to a content delivery service. At <b>226</b>, the subsystem <b>200</b> may include providing the various versions of the media content to a content delivery service, which may be utilized to distribute the content to all the devices of users participating in virtual screenings. The content delivery service may transmit the appropriate version of the media content to the appropriate device of a particular user. For example, if a first user is to get a <b>4</b><i>k </i>version of the media content that includes an extra scene, the content delivery service may ensure that the particular version of the media content is streamed and/or delivered to the device of the first user. As another example, if a second user is to get a 1080p version of the media content that does not include a particular scene, the content delivery service will ensure distribution of the correct version of the media content to the second user. In certain embodiments, the subsystem <b>200</b> may stream all the different versions of the media content at a specified time, at random times, at staggered times, or at any other desired interval.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With regard to subsystem <b>300</b>, subsystem <b>300</b> may be utilized to approve users for virtual screenings and distribute the appropriate version of media content to each user, while also ensuring that the media content is only accessed and utilized in a manner as authorized by the system <b>100</b>. At <b>302</b>, the subsystem <b>300</b> may identify and/or approve users for inclusion in a virtual screening of media content. The subsystem <b>300</b> may generate unique links for each user to facilitate access by the user to the media content at <b>304</b>. At <b>306</b>, when a user interacts with his own unique link (e.g. such as by clicking or otherwise selecting the link), the subsystem <b>300</b> may initiate a multifactor authentication process. For example, the subsystem <b>300</b> may transmit a unique code to a device of the user, which the user must then enter into an application supporting the functionality of the system <b>100</b> in order to authenticate with the system <b>100</b>. Notably, any number of layers of authentication may be required for users. For example, the subsystem <b>300</b> and/or system <b>100</b> may require the input of time-based one-time passwords generated directly by the application supporting the functionality of the system <b>100</b> or by a separate application, such as an authenticator application, that generates unique codes at selected or random time intervals. In certain embodiments, other layers of authentication may be utilized as well. For example, biometric authentication, such as, but not limited to, iris scans, fingerprint scans, heart rate scans, temperature measurements, user health profiles, body measurement information, and/or other biometric information may be utilized to authenticate the user into the system <b>100</b> in combination with other forms of authentication. Once the user successfully authenticates with the system <b>100</b>, the subsystem <b>300</b> may lock the unique link to an identifier associated with the user, at <b>308</b>. For example, an internet protocol address (or any other identifier associated with the user) may be locked to the specific link for accessing the media content so that only a device having the internet protocol address locked to the link may be able to access the media content associated with the link.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>310</b>, a request for a digital rights management key (or other key for decrypting media content) may be sent so that the user's device (or other component of system <b>100</b>) may decrypt an encrypted version of the media content to be streamed to the user. At <b>312</b>, a digitally signed file (e.g. a cookie or other file) may also be requested by the system <b>100</b> to ensure that a valid signature from an authorized user for screening the media content is present prior to delivering the media content to the user. The receipt of a valid digitally signed file, which may include the name-value pairs provided by the system prior to transmission of the digitally signed file, may be utilized to confirm that the correct user is attempting to access a particular version of the media content. If an invalid signature is present or an invalid file is provided, the system <b>100</b> and/or subsystem <b>300</b> may prevent a user from accessing the media content. The digitally signed file may also dictate the conditions by which the user may access the media content (e.g. time, place, duration, whether copies may be made, whether the media content may be streamed to others, etc.). If the digitally signed file is provided with a valid signature, the subsystem <b>300</b> may apply one or more watermarks to the media content intended for streaming to the user, at <b>314</b>. The watermark may be utilized by the system <b>100</b> and/or subsystem to track usage of the media content by the user, such as whether the media content was transmitted to others by the user, whether the media content was duplicated, whether the media content was modified, and/or if anything unauthorized was performed with respect to the media content.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the watermark is applied to the media content, the subsystem <b>300</b>, at <b>320</b>, may include streaming the media content intended for that particular user to the user's device during a virtual screening. In certain embodiments, before the media content is streamed to the user, the subsystem <b>300</b> may generate A/B variants of the media content at <b>316</b>. At <b>318</b>, the subsystem <b>300</b> may mix segments of the media content with encoded data and then stream the media content including the mixed segments and encoded data to the user for viewing at <b>320</b>. The user may then provide feedback relating to the viewing of the media content, which may then be utilized by the system <b>100</b> to potentially modify the content. In certain embodiments, different versions of the media content (e.g. A/B variants) may be presented and streamed to the user at different times, side-by-side, and/or in different manners. In certain embodiments, the functionality provided by subsystem <b>200</b> may be combined with the functionality of sub system <b>300</b> and/or system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Notably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> may perform any of the operative functions disclosed herein by utilizing the processing capabilities of server <b>160</b>, the storage capacity of the database <b>155</b>, or any other component of the system <b>100</b> to perform the operative functions disclosed herein.

Furthermore, in certain embodiments, substantial portions of the functionality and operations of the system <b>100</b> may be performed by other networks and systems that may be connected to system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Notably, the system <b>100</b> may execute and/or conduct the functionality as described in the method(s) that follow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an exemplary method <b>400</b> for facilitating a virtual screening of media content is schematically illustrated. The method <b>400</b> and/or functionality and features supporting the method <b>400</b> may be conducted via an application of the system <b>100</b>, devices of the system <b>100</b>, processes of the system <b>100</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, or a combination thereof. The method <b>400</b> may include steps for identifying users for participating in virtual screenings, generating unique links for users to obtain access to media content associated with a virtual screening, authenticating the users into the system <b>100</b> facilitating the virtual screening, associating the unique link to the particular user and/or the user's device, using digitally signed files to control access to the media content, applying watermarks to track usage of the content, streaming the media content to the user participating in the virtual screening, and obtaining feedback and reactions from the user through a variety of feedback solicitation techniques and/or processes. The processes facilitated by the method <b>400</b> allow for an integrated and seamless virtual screening reservations, media content distribution, and feedback gathering and analysis all by utilizing the same system <b>100</b>. Those conducting the screenings of the media content may utilize the feedback from screening participants to enhance the media content, alter the media content, and/or create a new version of the media content prior to distribution of the media content to the masses. Additionally, over time, the feedback collected via the method <b>400</b> may be utilized to train the system <b>100</b> over time to detect which users would prefer which types of media content, the types of reactions that a specific type of user (e.g. demographic or other characteristics) may have to certain types of media content, and/or to potentially generate different versions of the media content on the fly based on feedback, inputs, and/or by request.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The steps of method <b>400</b> may be performed in any desired sequence, however, in a preferred embodiment, the method <b>400</b> may proceed as follows: At step <b>402</b>, the method <b>400</b> may include identifying a user for participating in a virtual screening of media content provided by the system <b>100</b>. For example, a movie studio may host media content (e.g. a portion of a movie and/or an entire movie) in the system <b>100</b> for distribution to users who have been selected for virtual screenings of the media content. The movie studio may have a digital questionnaire or survey hosted on a website of the movie studio or on a website of a survey partner, which may include a series of questions for screening potential users for participating in a virtual screening of the media content. The system <b>100</b> may identify users for participating in the virtual screening based on the responses provided by the users to the questions in the survey, based on having target demographic characteristics preferred by the movie studio, based on having any number of characteristics in common with the subject matter of the media content of the virtual screening, based on random selection, based on a user's desire to participate, based on a round-robin fashion, based on any desired condition and/or factor, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the users may be sent digital or physical invitations to participate in the virtual screening and the system <b>100</b> may process responses to such invitations accordingly. For example, based on response to invitations, the system <b>100</b> may reserve each user's place in a particular virtual screening. In certain embodiments, the identifying of the user for participation in the virtual screening may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user <b>101</b>, the second user <b>110</b> and/or by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>404</b>, the method <b>400</b> may include transmitting a unique link to each user for facilitating access to the media content. For example, the first user <b>101</b> may have been identified and selected for participating in the virtual screening of a particular movie. Once the first user <b>101</b> was identified and/or selected for participation for the virtual screening, the system <b>100</b> may generate the unique link and transmit the unique link to a device of the first user <b>101</b>, such as the first user device <b>102</b>. Each link may be specific and tailored to each user that is selected for participation for the virtual screening. In certain embodiments, the link may be configured to only be opened by a device known to be associated with a selected user. For example, the link may be configured such that only the first user device <b>102</b> may be utilized to open the link, which may be utilized to facilitate access to the movie associated with the virtual screening. In certain embodiments, the generation and/or transmission of the unique link to each user may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user <b>101</b>, the second user <b>110</b> and/or by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step <b>406</b>, the method <b>400</b> may include determining if the user has successfully authenticated with the system <b>100</b> after interacting with the unique link sent to the user. The user may interact with the link by clicking on the link (e.g. with a mouse), tapping on the link (e.g. via a touchscreen of first user device <b>102</b>), issuing a verbal command to access the link, and/or performing any other action that facilitates interaction with the link. Once the link is interacted with, the system <b>100</b> may cause an authentication process to initiate for the user to authenticate into the system <b>100</b> providing the operative functionality of the method <b>400</b>. In certain embodiments, the authentication process may involve the user inputting a username and/or password combination for registering with the system <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, the authentication process may include additional layers of security or alternative layers of security. For example, after the user interacts with the link and/or after the user enters in a username/password combination, the system <b>100</b> may transmit a unique code as a part of a multi-factor authentication process to the user's device (e.g. first user device <b>102</b>). Once the code is received at the user's device, the user may enter the code into an application supporting the functionality of the system <b>100</b> to authenticate into the system <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, other forms of authentication may be utilized, alone or in combination with any other forms of authentication described herein and/or elsewhere. For example, the system <b>100</b> may facilitate authentication of the user by enabling the user to utilize time-based one-time passwords generated directly by the application supporting the functionality of the system <b>100</b> or by a separate application, such as an authenticator application, that generates unique codes at selected or random time intervals. When the user inputs the correct generated password into the application supporting the functionality of the system <b>100</b>, the user and/or the user's device may be authenticated into the system <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, further forms of authentication may be utilized as well. For example, biometric authentication, such as, but not limited to, iris scans, fingerprint scans, heart rate scans, temperature measurements, user health profiles, body measurement information, and/or other biometric information may be utilized to authenticate the user into the system <b>100</b> as well. In certain embodiments, the determining as to whether the user the user has successfully authenticated into the system <b>100</b> may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user <b>101</b>, the second user <b>110</b> and/or by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">If, at step <b>406</b>, the method <b>400</b> includes determining that the user has not successfully authenticated with the system <b>100</b>, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to step <b>408</b>, which may include preventing the user from accessing the media content associated with the virtual screening. For example, the user may have entered in an incorrect code, incorrect password, incorrect biometric information, and/or any other incorrect information as required by the authentication process. Upon unsuccessful authentication, the user may be directed to a web page or application page that provides the user with another chance to enter in correct authentication information and/or may provide an indication to the user than authentication was unsuccessful. In certain embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may block the user from attempting to authenticate after a certain number of attempts. If, however, at step <b>406</b>, the method <b>400</b> includes determining that the authentication was successful, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to step <b>410</b>, which may include associating the unique link with an identifier associated with the user. For example, the link may be locked and/or associated with the internet protocol address of the user's device (e.g. first user device <b>102</b>), a device identifier associated with the device (e.g. model number, unit number, manufacturing number), a media access control address associated with the user's device, any unique identifier associated with the user's device, any information associated with the user, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the associating of the link with the identifier may serve to ensure that only the user and/or the user's device is utilized to access the media content associated with the virtual screening. For example, a device not having the identifier associated with the link may be prevented by the system <b>100</b> from accessing the media content when attempting to access the media content. In certain embodiments, the associating of the unique link with the identifier may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user <b>101</b>, the second user <b>110</b> and/or by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>412</b>, the method may include requesting a digital key for facilitating decryption of the media content. For example, the digital key may be a digital rights management key that may be utilized to decrypt an encrypted version of the media content that the user wishes to access during the virtual screening. If an appropriate digital key is not utilized, the user and/or the user's device may be prevented from decrypting the encrypted version of the media content during a virtual screening. In certain embodiments, the requesting of the digital key may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user <b>101</b>, the second user <b>110</b> and/or by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>414</b>, the method may include requesting a digitally signed file for facilitating access to the media content. For example, the request may be for a digitally signed cookie (or some other type of file) that the device of the user may digitally sign (or other device depending on the implementation). For example, the process may work as follows: when the user authenticates into the system <b>100</b> seeking to access the media content, the system <b>100</b> may return set cookie (or other file) headers in a response back to the user's device. In certain embodiments, the requesting of the digitally signed file may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device. A viewer for viewing the media content on the user's device may store the name-value pairs. The user may then request the file associated with the media content from the system <b>100</b>, and, with the user's request, the user's browser (or other application for accessing the media content supplied by the system <b>100</b>) may obtain the previously obtained name-value pairs and add them to the request, such as in a header of a cookie (or other file) accompanying the request. The cookie (or other file) including the name-value pairs may be sent to the system <b>100</b> and may serve as the digitally signed file. The system <b>100</b> may analyze the digitally signed file received from the user's device and validate the digitally signed file (i.e. cookie) to confirm that the file has a valid signature (e.g. such as by using a public key or other technique for analyzing the validity of a signature).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the digitally signed file is invalid, the system <b>100</b> may prevent the user from accessing the media content (e.g. by going back to step <b>408</b>). If, however, the digitally signed file is determined to be valid, the system <b>100</b> may analyze rules, parameters, policies, and/or conditions associated with the cookie (or other type of file). For example, information contained within the cookie and/or in content associated with the cookie may indicate that the media content may only be accessed during a specific timeframe. If the request to access the media content comes to the system <b>100</b> outside the allowable timeframe, the system <b>100</b> may reject the request even if the signature is valid. As further examples, the cookie (or other file) may dictate the specific media content that the user may access, the format of the version of the media content that the user may access, which device may access the media content, how long the media content can be accessed, whether the media content may be downloaded, whether the media content may be copied, whether the media content may be edited, any action with respect to the media content and/or the system <b>100</b>, or a combination thereof. On the other hand, if the request from the user and/or the user device meets the rules, parameters, policies, and/or conditions associated with the cookie (or other file), the method <b>400</b> may proceed to step <b>416</b>. At step <b>416</b>, the method <b>400</b> may include applying a watermark to the media content to be provided to the user to facilitate tracking of the use of the media content. In certain embodiments, the applying of the watermark may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the applying of the watermark to the media content may involve applying a visual watermark that is intermixed and/or embedded into the media content, an audio watermark (e.g. a unique sound&#x2014;whether perceptible by a human ear or not), incorporating unique metadata into the media content, a digital marker embedded into the media content, incorporating information hidden within digital signals comprising portions of the media content, any other type of watermark, or a combination thereof. The watermark may include information specific to the user, such as, but not limited to, information identifying the user, information identifying a device of the user, a unique code generated for the user and/or a device of the user, unique media content embedded within the media content, a unique message incorporated with the media content, any other unique information, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the watermark may be tracked by the system <b>100</b> to determine if the media content has been modified, transferred, copied, tampered with, used, accessed, stored, and/or otherwise manipulated, such as in an unauthorized manner. In certain embodiments, since the watermark may be unique for the particular user participating in a virtual screening, the system <b>100</b> can easily track unauthorized usage of the media content and may take appropriate action against the user. In certain embodiments, the watermark may be configured to be perceptible with the media content being screened or may be configured to be imperceptible such that a user cannot see, hear, or otherwise perceive it. In certain embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may support session-based forensic watermarking for viewing of media content as well. In certain embodiments, each virtual screening session may incorporate the use of different watermarks so that use of media content during one session may be tracked separately from use of media content from another session.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once the watermark is applied to the media content utilized for the virtual screening, the method <b>400</b> may include, at step <b>418</b>, streaming, during the virtual screening, the media content to the device of the user according to parameters, conditions, and/or rules associated with the digitally signed file and/or by utilizing the digital key to decrypt the encrypted media content. In certain embodiments, the streaming of the media content may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device. The user may watch, listen, and/or otherwise experience the streamed media content, such as via the first user device <b>102</b> (or other suitable device), during the virtual screening of the media content. In certain embodiments, the media content may be streamed via an application accessible on the user's device that also supports some or all of the other functionality of the system <b>100</b>. While the media content is being streamed to the user and/or after the media content is streamed to the user, the method <b>400</b> may include, at step <b>420</b>, obtaining feedback associated with the media content from the user that participated in the virtual screening of the media content. In certain embodiments, the obtaining of the feedback may be performed and/or facilitated by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>111</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, any component of the system <b>100</b>, any combination thereof, and/or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device. For example, the feedback may be obtained via a digital survey provided by the system <b>100</b> to the user via the device of the user, a video conference with the user, a phone conference with the user, an electronic message exchange with the user, any feedback technique, or a combination thereof. The feedback may indicate preferences for the media content, preferences for certain portions of the media content, distaste for certain portions of the media content, opinions relating to the media content, ratings of the media content, any feedback associated with the media content, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the method <b>400</b> may include utilizing the feedback to alter the media content, enhance the media content, remove content from the media content, create additional media content, or a combination thereof. The method <b>400</b> may repeated as desired for any number of participants participating in any number of virtual screenings for any number and/or type of media content. Notably, the method <b>400</b> may further incorporate any of the features and functionality described for the system <b>100</b>, any other method disclosed herein, and/or any other features and/or functionality described herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The systems and methods disclosed herein may include additional functionality and features. For example, the system and methods may provide for a streamlined virtual screening reservation system that fully integrates the reservation process with transcoding processes, authentication processes, encryption processes, decryption processes, watermark application processes, media content generation processes, media content streaming processes, and feedback processes all with the same system and/or application. The system and methods may provide a communal online screening with users from a variety of different screening recruitment sources (e.g. surveys, invitations, selections by the system based on demographics, etc.). The system and methods may provide a platform that also prevents piracy of media content and ensures that only authorized usage of media content is facilitated. In certain embodiments, the system and methods may drive the users to external sites and/or feedback systems after viewing or otherwise experience media content. In certain embodiments, the system and methods may include utilizing artificial intelligence and/or machine learning systems to utilize feedback to train artificial intelligence models of the system <b>100</b> over time so that the system <b>100</b> may anticipate potential reactions to media content from certain types of users. For example, over time, the system <b>100</b> may learn that certain users with certain demographic characteristics may enjoy a certain type of movie with certain types of action sequences in it. Similarly, the system <b>100</b> may learn that certain users with other demographic characteristics or life experiences may not enjoy the very same movie. The system <b>100</b> may analyze feedback and learn which geographic regions, users, and/or communities may prefer certain types of media content and may provide recommendations to creators and/or distributors of the content with curated information that indicates where to market media content, how to market media content, and to whom media content should be marketed to.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The systems and methods disclosed herein may include still further functionality and features. For example, the operative functions of the system <b>100</b> and method may be configured to execute on a special-purpose processor specifically configured to carry out the operations provided by the system <b>100</b> and method.
