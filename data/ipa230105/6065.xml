As a consequence, the resistance of such contacts (which are typically metal-to-semiconductor contacts) is becoming an excessively large component of the total electrical resistance of a transistor when it is switched on. This undesired metal-semiconductor contact resistance is becoming a very significant performance limiting factor for such devices, contributing both to wasted energy and reduced switching speeds (clocking rates) in digital integrated circuits comprising such transistors. Furthermore, the decreasing volume of doped source and drain regions in state of the art transistors accommodates fewer dopant atoms, even at very high doping concentrations in excess of 10<sup>20 </sup>dopants/cm<sup>3</sup>. As a consequence, the variability in transistor performance that is a result of variance in doping species number and placement is predicted to become a significant problem in future, nanometer-scale MOS transistors, particularly in anticipated, gate-all-around nanowire transistors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a gate-all-around nanowire transistor <b>10</b>. In this example, a gate wraps completely around a semiconductor channel. A gate oxide is disposed concentrically between the gate and the channel. Doped semiconductor source and drain regions are located at opposite ends of the channel and have associated circumferential contacts, typically metal silicide contacts, separated from the gate contact by an gate sidewall spacer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Contact resistance is conventionally calculated as &#x201c;contact resistivity&#x201d; divided by the area of the contact. Traditionally therefore contact resistance has been minimized by ensuring as low a contact resistivity and as large a contact area as technologically possible. According to Park et al., &#x201c;Scaling effect on specific contact resistivity in nano-scale metal-semiconductor contacts&#x201d;, Proc. Device Research Conference (2013), however, &#x201c;initial results indicate that contact resistivity increases in the limit of very small contact areas and that the effect is stronger in the 3D wire case compared to the 2D wire case.&#x201d; Contact resistance of metal-semiconductor contacts is expected to increase even more than a classical model would predict in the size regime of 10 nm and smaller due to the two-fold effects of increasing resistivity and decreasing contact area. There is then a serious metal-semiconductor contact resistance problem for present and future nanoscale transistors that have contact dimensions of approximately 10 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, in present day, state-of-the-art transistors, at nodes smaller than 20 nm, the semiconductor channel is fully depleted, whether the transistors are fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) FETs, FinFETs, &#x201c;tri-gate FETs&#x201d;, nanowire FETs or gate-all-around FETs. Fully depleted implies that the thickness of the semiconductor body that includes the channel and the parts of the source/drain adjoining the channel are extremely thin, typically less than 12 nm or so. The parts of the source and drain that adjoin the channel may have a very small volume. When such transistors have conventional doped source/drain regions, the number of dopant atoms in the source and drain regions proximate to the channel may be of the order of ten or fewer and these dopants will have random placement. As such, the doping in any given transistor is stochastic rather than deterministic and this can lead to excessive variability in the electrical performance of a population of transistors that form an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To explain this problem in more detail, even at high doping levels in excess of 10<sup>20 </sup>dopant/cm<sup>3</sup>, the dopants are sparse, at most comprising only 2% of the atoms present in the source/drain regions and more typically less than 1%. It has been recognized that when the volume of source/drain regions is small, the statistical variation of the number and location of the dopant atoms introduces a very large variance in the electrical responses of the transistors. See, e.g., Martinez et al., &#x201c;Quantum-Transport Study on the Impact of Channel Length and Cross Sections on Variability Induced by Random Discrete Dopants in Narrow Gate-All-Around Silicon Nanowire Transistors,&#x201d; IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, Vol. 58, No. 8, p. 2209 (2011). In this article, the authors point out that a transistor with an unfortunate configuration of dopant atoms in source/drain can have both an undesirably high &#x201c;off&#x201d; current (under zero gate bias) and an undesirably low &#x201c;on&#x201d; current (under high gate bias) relative to a transistor with a more favorable configuration of dopant atoms. In designing an integrated circuit, often comprising several billion transistors, it is the &#x201c;weak&#x201d; transistors that determine the performance of the whole circuit. That is, to obtain high yields of manufactured ICs it is necessary to design the circuit assuming transistors are the inferior or weak type. Stated differently, the performance of a circuit is determined by the weakest of the transistors rather than the strongest. In modern statistical design of circuits, the dependence is more nuanced but it is generally true that given a statistical distribution of device characteristics across a large population of transistors, the performance of a circuit is determined more by the low performance of the weaker transistors than the high performance of the stronger transistors. What is preferred is to have a population of transistors with the variance in their electrical performance as small as possible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Quite apart from the severe contact resistance problem associated with nanoscale metal-semiconductor contacts, the statistical variance of source/drain doping thus presents another major challenge to further scaling of MOS transistors into the 7 nm node and beyond. Metal source/drain transistors provide a solution to the dopant variability problem in conventional doped source/drain technologies. Dopants can be eliminated if the source/drain regions are formed of a metal that adjoins the undoped channel region and provides carriers to the channel directly without any need for doped semiconductor. Such metal source/drain regions most desirably have a small Schottky barrier height in order for their performance to be competitive with doped source/drain counterparts.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat.

Briefly, an electrical junction includes an interface layer disposed between a contact metal and a semiconductor, and may comprise a passivation layer (which in some instances may be a monolayer) adjacent the semiconductor and, optionally, a separation layer disposed between the passivation layer and the metal. Various metals and semiconductors may be used, and the passivation layer may be an oxide of the semiconductor or other material. The separation layer, if present, may be a metal oxide. The very thin, interfacial dielectric layer between the metal and semiconductor acts to reduce the Schottky barrier at the junction from that which would exist in the absence of the interface layer, and at the same time has sufficient conductivity, despite being itself a dielectric with poor bulk electrical conduction, to provide a net improvement in the conductivity of the MIS junction. These devices overcome the statistical dopant variability problem by eliminating source/drain doping completely. However, these devices do have a remaining limitation in that the area of the metal-semiconductor interface, where a metal source or drain adjoins the semiconductor channel, is exceedingly small, being broadly comparable to the cross sectional area of the channel. U.S. Pat. No. 8,212,336 provides a solution that offers some relief to the area limitation by providing an interface that has an area exceeding the cross-sectional area of the channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is known to induce &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; p-type and n-type regions using MOS capacitors.

A negative Schottky barrier height between the source/drain metal and the semiconductor is required to achieve such a carrier concentration.

The interfacial layer in certain embodiments is comprised of a monolayer of atoms. The atoms may be any of N, As, P, O, S, Se, or Te for n-channel transistors or B, Ga, Al, Zn, Cd or O for p-channel transistors. The interfacial layer in certain other embodiments is a &#x201c;thin insulator&#x201d; comprising a material that would be an insulator in its bulk state but which is conductive when very thin (in the thickness range 0.2 nm to 2 nm). In these embodiments, the interfacial layer at the metal-semiconductor junction is not comparable or equivalent to the thin insulator that separates the gate from the semiconductor channel.

Undoped semiconductor source and drain regions are located at opposite ends of the channel and have associated circumferential metal contacts separated from the gate by respective sidewall spacers. Between the source/drain contacts and the source/drain regions are disposed circumferential I-layers (interfacial layers) having the characteristics described herein.

Under these conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, some electrons transfer from the metal and populate the surface of the semiconductor to establish electrostatic equilibrium between the metal and semiconductor. As indicated above, in some embodiments of the invention an interfacial layer is present between the metal and the semiconductor, the interfacial layer permitting electrons to flow with little impedance between the metal and the semiconductor and the interfacial layer having the purpose of causing the Schottky barrier to be negative. Interfacial layers that can cause a negative Schottky barrier for electrons include tunneling dielectrics such as titanium oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and vanadium oxide. When such interfacial layers are used to cause a negative Schottky barrier for electrons, the contacting metal is preferably, but for n-FET contacts need not necessarily be, a low work function metal such as aluminum, hafnium, zirconium, titanium, lanthanum, magnesium, silver, erbium, yttrium or ytterbium. Other interfacial layers that can cause a negative Schottky barrier for electrons at metal contacts to group IV semiconductors such as silicon and germanium include dipole-inducing monolayers of group V elements such as arsenic, phosphorus or nitrogen or dipole-inducing monolayers of group VI elements such as or sulfur, selenium, tellurium or oxygen or bilayers of group V and group III elements where the group V atoms are on the semiconductor side of the contact and group III atoms on the metal side. Some embodiments of n-type contacts with negative Schottky barriers have a low work function contact metal such as aluminum, hafnium, zirconium, titanium, lanthanum, magnesium, silver, erbium, yttrium or ytterbium, with an interfacial layer between the low work function metal and the semiconductor. Other embodiments of n-type contacts with negative Schottky barriers have a low work function contact metal that is a metal oxide such as zinc oxide (ZnO), with an interfacial layer between the low work function metal oxide and the semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For a &#x201c;p-type&#x201d; contact, a negative Schottky barrier means that the Fermi level of the metal is at a lower energy than the valence band edge of the semiconductor as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. This may be considered a negative Schottky barrier for holes. Under these conditions, some valence electrons transfer from the surface of the semiconductor to the metal and the surface of the semiconductor is populated with holes to an extent necessary to establish electrostatic equilibrium between the metal and semiconductor, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. It is possible for an interfacial layer to be present between the metal and the semiconductor, the interfacial layer permitting holes (or in alternative interpretation electrons moving in the opposite direction), to flow with little impedance between the metal and the semiconductor. For &#x201c;p-type contacts&#x201d;, the interfacial layer has the purpose of causing the Schottky barrier for holes to be negative. Interfacial layers that can cause a negative Schottky barrier for holes include tunneling dielectrics such as zinc oxide. When such interfacial layers are used to cause a negative Schottky barrier for holes, the contacting metal is preferably, but for p-FET contacts need not necessarily be, a high work function contact metal such as nickel, cobalt, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, gold, osmium, palladium or platinum, or a high work function conductive metal oxide such as MoO<sub>x</sub>, WO<sub>x</sub>, CrO<sub>x </sub>(each with composition factor x approximately equal to 3) or V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. In some embodiments, pFET and nFET contacts may comprise the same metal, but have different interfacial layers to provide the desired negative Schottky barriers in each case.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other interfacial layers that can cause a negative Schottky barrier for holes on group IV semiconductors include dipole-inducing monolayers of group III elements such as boron, gallium or aluminum or bilayers of group V and group III elements where the group V atoms are on the metal side of the contact and group III atoms on the semiconductor side. Some preferred embodiments of p-type contacts have a high work function contact metal such as nickel, cobalt, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, gold, osmium, palladium or platinum, or a high work function conductive metal oxide such as MoO<sub>x</sub>, WO<sub>x</sub>, CrO<sub>x </sub>(with x approximately equal to 3) or high work-function V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x </sub>(with x approximately equal to 5) with an interfacial layer between the high work function metal (or metal oxide) and the semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The invention also has great utility where a low resistance metal-contacted source or drain is required in a semiconductor material that might not be doped conveniently or for which doping might not be possible at all. Examples of such semiconductors may be two-dimensional semiconductors such as graphene, germanene, phosphorene, stannene and silicene or two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors such as MoS and WSe which have recently been recognized as strong candidates as future transistor channel materials. Other materials that may not be amenable to conventional doping include organic semiconductors, polymer semiconductors, fullerenes such as carbon nanotubes, amorphous semiconductors, perovskites. All semiconductors in the form of a nanoscale thin film or nanowire benefit from this invention by virtue of the fact that free carriers are induced in the semiconductor material by an adjacent metal so long as there is a negative Schottky barrier between the metal and the semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the semiconductor is a thin film or two-dimensional semiconductor, typically having a thickness of 12 nm or less, with two primary faces, it is preferred to have metal contacts on both faces with both metal contacts having a negative Schottky barrier to the semiconductor. Note, however, that it is a characteristic of the present invention that the Schottky barrier between the metal source contact and the semiconductor source is a negative Schottky barrier, but that it is optional for the Schottky barrier between the metal drain contact and the semiconductor drain to be a negative Schottky barrier.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the semiconductor is a &#x201c;one-dimensional&#x201d; semiconductor, either cylindrical, such as a carbon nanotube, or a semiconductor &#x201c;nanowire&#x201d; where the wire may have circular, square or any other cross-sectional shape with a wire width of approximately 20 nm or less, it is preferred to have the metal contact wrap around the outer surface of the nanowire, again with the metal contact having a negative Schottky barrier to the semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a transistor with a fully depleted channel (may be a FinFET, FDSOI FET or nanowire FET), a thin body of semiconductor includes a channel region and source and drain regions where the source/drain regions are undoped and the source/drain metal contacts surround the semiconductor on two sides (FDSOI-FET or FinFET) or completely (nanowire FET).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In other embodiments, the free carriers induced by the contact metal with negative Schottky barrier may be additional to free carriers introduced into the semiconductor by doping. As such it is not essential that the semiconductor be undoped for the invention to provide an advantage in a semiconductor device. For example, the source and drain regions of a nanowire or FinFET transistor maybe doped conventionally (e.g., by diffusion of atoms from an external solid source or ion implantation and thermal activation) and the randomness of the dopants tolerated, the induced carriers provided by this invention being additional to the carriers provided by doping and therefore reducing the variability while not eliminating it.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, a nanowire transistor comprises a nanowire disposed on a substrate.
