The above-described structure of the internal electrode layers <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> may be implemented by simultaneously or sequentially vapor-depositing a material for forming the connection portion &#x201c;I&#x201d; and a material for forming the base portion &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and then sintering the same.
