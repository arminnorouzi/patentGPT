cords for tyres for vehicle wheels and processes and apparatuses for manufacturing metallic reinforcing cords are described in US2003046919 and in WO2007128335 to the Applicant and in WO2012055677.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hereinafter, when reference is made to any range of values comprised between a minimum value and a maximum value, the aforementioned minimum and maximum values are included in the aforementioned range, unless expressly stated to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, all of the ranges include any combination of the maximum and minimum values described and include any intermediate range, even if not expressly specifically described.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Any numerical value is considered to be preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; to also indicate any numerical value that differs slightly from the one described, for example to take into account the typical dimensional tolerances in the field of reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter the following definitions apply.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The term &#x201c;equatorial plane&#x201d; of the tyre is used to indicate a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the tyre and that divides the tyre into two symmetrically equal parts.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The terms &#x201c;radial&#x201d; and &#x201c;axial&#x201d; and the expressions &#x201c;radially inner/outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;axially inner/outer&#x201d; are used with reference, respectively, to a direction substantially parallel to the equatorial plane of the tyre and to a direction substantially perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the tyre, i.e. to a direction substantially perpendicular to the rotation axis of the tyre and to a direction substantially parallel to the rotation axis of the tyre, respectively.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The terms &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d; and &#x201c;circumferentially&#x201d; are used with reference to the direction of annular extension of the tyre, i.e. to the rolling direction of the tyre, which corresponds to a direction lying on a plane coinciding with or substantially parallel to the equatorial plane of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term &#x201c;substantially axial direction&#x201d; is used to indicate a direction inclined, with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre, by an angle comprised between 70&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;substantially circumferential direction&#x201d; is used to indicate a direction oriented, with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre, at an angle comprised between 0&#xb0; and 10&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The expressions &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; are used with reference to a predetermined direction and to a predetermined reference. Therefore, assuming for example a direction from left to right and a reference taken along said direction, a position &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; with respect to the reference indicates a position to the right of said reference and a position &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; with respect to the reference indicates a position to the left of said reference.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;elastomeric material&#x201d; is used to indicate a material comprising a vulcanizable natural or synthetic polymer and a reinforcing filler, wherein such a material, at room temperature and after having been subjected to vulcanization, can undergo deformations caused by a force and is capable of quickly and energetically recovering the substantially original shape and size after the elimination of the deforming force (according to the definitions of ASTM D1566-11 Standard Terminology Relating To Rubber).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;metallic reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate an element consisting of one or more elongated elements (also called &#x201c;wires&#x201d;) made of a metallic material and possibly coated by, or incorporated in, a matrix of elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;hybrid reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate a reinforcing cord comprising at least one metallic wire twisted together with at least one textile yarn. Hereinafter, reference is made to hybrid reinforcing cords reference to refer, in particular, to reinforcing cords comprising textile yarns having low modulus, like for example nylon yarns.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;mixed textile reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate a reinforcing cord comprising at least one textile yarn having a low modulus, like for example a nylon yarn, twisted together with at least one textile yarn having a high modulus, like for example an aramid yarn.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;yarn&#x201d; is used to indicate an elongated element consisting of the aggregation of a plurality of textile filaments or fibers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The yarns can have one or more &#x201c;ends&#x201d;, where the term &#x201c;end&#x201d; is used to indicate a bundle of filaments twisted together. Preferably, a single end or at least two ends twisted together are provided.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The yarn can be identified with a symbol that represents the textile material, the linear density of the fiber used and the number of ends that form the yarn. For example, an aramid yarn (aromatic polyamide) identified as Ar1672 indicates a textile yarn comprising Aramid fibers with a linear density of 1670 dtex, formed by two ends twisted together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;strand&#x201d; is used to indicate the union of at least two wires or yarns, or of at least one wire and at least one yarn, to constitute an elongated element intended to be twisted together with at least one other elongated element to form at least one part of a reinforcing cord.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; of a reinforcing cord, or of a wire, is used to indicate the diameter measured as prescribed by the method BISFA E10 (The International Bureau For The Standardization Of Man-Made Fibres, Internationally Agreed Methods For Testing Steel Tyre Cords, 1995 edition).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the case of yarns, the term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; is used to indicate the diameter of an ideal circumference that circumscribes all of the filaments that define the yarn. The diameter of a yarn increases as the number of filaments and/or ends of the yarn increases.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;thread count&#x201d; of a layer is used to indicate the number of reinforcing cords per unit length provided in such a layer. The thread count can be measured in cords/dm (number of cords per decimeter).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;linear density&#x201d; or &#x201c;count&#x201d; of a cord or yarn is used to indicate the weight of the cord or yarn per unit length. The linear density can be measured in dtex (grams per 10 km length).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;modulus&#x201d; is used to indicate the ratio between load (or force) and elongation measured at any point of a load-elongation curve according to the BISFA standard. Such a curve is traced by calculating the first derivative of the load-elongation function that defines the aforementioned curve, normalized to the linear density expressed in Tex. The modulus is therefore expressed in cN/Tex.

Such a stoneguard layer comprises a plurality of cords parallel to one another and extending according to a substantially circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to keep down the emissions of CO<sub>2 </sub>into the atmosphere, the Applicant has been producing for many years tyres for automobile, motorcycle and heavy and/or light load vehicle wheels having a low rolling resistance. Such tyres comprise, in the respective crossed belt structures, and/or in the bead reinforcing structures indicated below with &#x201c;chafer&#x201d; and &#x201c;flipper&#x201d; and/or, in the specific case of tyres for heavy and/or light load vehicle wheels, in the stoneguard layer, metallic reinforcing cords comprising particularly light steel wires, for example having a diameter equal to 0.22 mm, 0.20 mm or 0.175 mm.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The choice of the Applicant to use in the aforementioned structural components of the tyre reinforcing cords comprising only steel wires derives from the fact that the steel wires, having a high rigidity and an excellent resistance to fatigue, are capable of providing the reinforcing cord, and thus the aforementioned structural components of the tyre, with a high resistance to the high compressive or bending stresses to which such structural components are typically subjected during travel of the vehicle on which the tyre is mounted. Moreover, thanks to the high heat conduction capability of steel, the steel wires have high thermal stability, providing the reinforcing cord with a stable mechanical behavior even in extreme conditions of use, like those typical of high performance tyres.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The Applicant has also observed that steel ensures good adhesion of the reinforcing cord to the surrounding elastomeric material, with consequent advantages in terms of quality of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">However, the Applicant observed that in order to avoid risks of corrosion of the steel in the case of leakage of water inside the tyre and, at the same time, to maximize the adhesion between steel and elastomeric material, it is advisable to ensure that, at each cross section of the reinforcing cord and, therefore, along the entire longitudinal extension of the reinforcing cord, the elastomeric material surrounds as completely as possible each steel wire. In the case of reinforcing cords comprising a plurality of steel wires twisted together, it is also advisable for the elastomeric material to penetrate as much as possible into the space defined between the aforementioned wires. This is in order to avoid having zones of possible mutual contact of the steel wires, which would actually constitute zones of possible formation of cracks due to fatigue from fretting, at the expense of the structural integrity of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The Applicant has also observed that steel wires, having a low part load elongation, are not suitable for being used in those structural components of the tyre where a high part load elongation is desired, like for example in the zero degrees belt layers. In such structural components it is deemed preferable to use textile reinforcing cords having a low modulus, like for example reinforcing cords made of nylon or, in the cases in which a high rigidity is also required at high loads (and thus a high modulus at high loads), mixed textile reinforcing cords or hybrid reinforcing cords.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">With particular reference to mixed textile reinforcing cords and hybrid reinforcing cords, they make it possible to obtain the desired part load elongation and the desired rigidity thanks to their characteristic &#x201c;double modulus&#x201d; mechanical behavior obtained through the use of a material having a low modulus and a material having a high modulus. At low loads, the mechanical behavior of the reinforcing cord is mainly dictated by the reaction offered by the material having low modulus, whereas at high loads the mechanical behavior of the reinforcing cord is mainly dictated by the reaction offered by the material having high modulus. Such types of reinforcing cords therefore have a mechanical behavior that translates, in a load-elongation graph, by a curve defined by two segments separated by a joining knee, wherein the segment on the left of the knee (indicative of the part load elongations) has a much lower inclination with respect to the horizontal axis than that of the segment on the right of the knee (indicative of the rigidity).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The Applicant has however observed that the textile and hybrid reinforcing cords, unlike the metallic ones, do not allow adequate adhesion of the surrounding elastomeric material. Therefore, it is necessary to coat them with adhesive substances or subject them to specific chemical or physical adhesive-fixing treatments.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The Applicant has thought that it would be desirable to also use metallic reinforcing cords in those structural components of the tyre where textile or hybrid reinforcing cords are currently used, so as to obtain also in such structural components an adequate adhesion between reinforcing cord and surrounding elastomeric material with no need to apply an adhesive coating to the reinforcing cord or to subject it to adhesion-fixing treatments.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The Applicant has found that it is possible to satisfy this desire by providing metallic reinforcing cords having a helical geometry.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The Applicant has indeed realized that such a particular geometry allows the reinforcing cord to have a mechanical behavior at low loads that is comparable to that of textile reinforcing cords having a low modulus (thus obtaining a high part load elongation) and a mechanical behavior at high loads that is comparable to that of metallic reinforcing cords (thus obtaining a high rigidity). The high part load elongation is a consequence of the stretching of the helix defining the metallic reinforcing cord (the reinforcing cord in this case behaves like a spring), whereas the high rigidity at high loads is a consequence of the high elastic modulus which is typical of the metallic material.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In practice, due to the aforementioned helical geometry the metallic reinforcing cords can have a &#x201c;double modulus&#x201d; mechanical behavior which is comparable to the mechanical behavior which is typical of mixed and hybrid textile reinforcing cords. It is therefore possible to use the aforementioned metallic reinforcing cords in all those structural components of the tyre where hybrid and mixed textile reinforcing cords are typically used, obtaining all of the abovementioned advantages linked to the use of metallic reinforcing cords (in particular: fatigue resistance, thermal stability and adhesion).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The Applicant has found that the aforementioned helical geometry allows an improvement of the adhesion between reinforcing cord and surrounding elastomeric material also in the case in which the metallic reinforcing cord comprises a single metallic wire. This is due to a better mechanical adhesion of the elastomeric material on a helical wire with respect to a substantially straight wire.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The Applicant has also found that, in the case in which the metallic reinforcing cord comprises a plurality of steel wires twisted together, the helical geometry makes it possible to obtain, in addition to the desired improvement in terms of adhesion, a better penetration of the elastomeric material inside the metallic reinforcing cord, with consequent advantages in terms of resistance to corrosion and to fatigue from fretting.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The Applicant is also convinced that the helical geometry, providing the reinforcing cords with the capability of extending longitudinally when subjected to a load, allows the metallic reinforcing cords used in the crossed belt structures to maintain their design angle of inclination during the tyre shaping process.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention therefore relates, in a first aspect thereof, to a process for manufacturing a metallic reinforcing cord for tyres for vehicle wheels.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Preferably, at least one elongated element comprising at least one metallic wire twisted together with at least one textile yarn is provided.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Preferably, said at least one textile yarn is removed from said at least one elongated element to form a metallic reinforcing cord in which said at least one metallic wire extends along a helical path.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a second aspect thereof, the invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing a metallic reinforcing cord for tyres for vehicle wheels from at least one elongated element comprising at least one metallic wire twisted together with at least one textile yarn.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Preferably, a removal device is provided, the removal device being configured to remove said at least one textile yarn from said at least one elongated element to form a metallic reinforcing cord in which said at least one metallic wire extends along a helical path.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Such an apparatus makes it possible to obtain a metallic reinforcing cord in accordance with the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the present invention, the textile yarn is therefore a &#x201c;throwaway&#x201d; element, i.e. an element only used to provide said at least one metallic wire with a helical geometry. The textile yarn is thus intended to be removed, so as to obtain a metallic reinforcing cord consisting only of said at least one metallic wire and therefore also having a helical geometry. Such a metallic reinforcing cord has, in addition to those advantageous features which are typical of the metallic reinforcing cords (rigidity at high loads, fatigue resistance, thermal stability and adhesion to elastomeric material), a high penetration of the elastomeric material inside it (in the case in which the metallic reinforcing cord comprises a plurality of metallic wires) and a high part load elongation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The particular helical geometry of the metallic reinforcing cord of the invention can be selected, depending on the particular application, by changing one or more among the twisting pitch with which said at least one metallic wire is twisted about said at least one textile yarn, the diameter of said at least one metallic wire, the number of metallic wires, the diameter of said at least one textile yarn (i.e. the number of filaments and/or ends of the textile yarn), the number of textile yarns.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Depending on the particular helical geometry which is selected the reinforcing cord can be more suitable for being used in some structural components of the tyre with respect to other structural components of the tyre.

In fact, the elastomeric material takes up the free space left by the textile yarn after the latter is removed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">The elastomeric material arranged between the metallic wires also tends to behave like a structural component of the reinforcing cord and thus it also gives a contribution in terms of rigidity.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">By increasing the diameter, or the linear density, of the textile yarn it is possible to increase the amount of elastomeric material incorporated between the metallic wires of the reinforcing cord and more evenly distribute the steel wires in a piece of structural component having a predetermined thickness, achieving an increased rigidity of such a structural component and a better transmission of the stresses to which such a structural component is subjected during use of the tyre, to the benefit of the responsiveness.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0096">A further advantageous effect linked to the greater uniformity of distribution of the metallic wires in the piece of structural component is that it is possible to increase the winding pitch of the helix with no risk that unravelling occurs. This allows an increase in the amount of metallic reinforcing cord produced is a predetermine time period to be achieved (hereinafter such a feature is also indicated as &#x201c;machine output&#x201d;), with consequent economic and production advantages.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0097">Assuming, as an example, that the elongated element (comprising one or more strands of metallic wires twisted together with one or more textile yarns) and the metallic reinforcing cord (comprising one or more strands of metallic wires twisted together) have substantially circular cross sections, it is possible to make the elongated element so that the textile yarn is arranged only between substantially circumferentially opposite metallic wires or only between substantially circumferentially adjacent metallic wires or both between substantially circumferentially opposite metallic wires and between substantially circumferentially adjacent metallic wires. In this case, the space provided in the reinforcing cord after the removal of the textile yarn and intended to be occupied by the elastomeric material will be either only the inner space defined between the various wires, or only the outer space defined between circumferentially adjacent wires or both the inner space defined between the various wires and the outer space defined between circumferentially adjacent wires. In the case the elongated element comprises a plurality of strands, each strand comprising a plurality of metallic wires twisted together with a respective textile yarn, the textile yarn can be removed from only some of the aforementioned strands or from all of the aforementioned strands.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0098">In some preferred embodiments thereof, said metallic reinforcing cord comprises a plurality of cross sections in which said at least two metallic wires are in a condition of substantial mutual contact.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0099">Preferably, said metallic reinforcing cord also comprises other cross sections in which said at least two metallic wires are spaced from one another.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0100">It is however possible to actuate solutions suitable for ensuring that in all of the cross sections of the reinforcing cord said at least two metallic wires are spaced from one another.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0101">Such solutions consist, preferably, in suitably deforming (or preforming or crimping) the metallic reinforcing cord until all of the metallic wires are spaced apart from one another along the entire longitudinal extension of the reinforcing cord.
