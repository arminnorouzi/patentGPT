The carrier B may be a rubber pad or a silicone pad. The carrier B is formed with an annular groove B<b>1</b>. The semi-automatic wiring machine of the disclosure lays the wire A in the annular groove B<b>1</b> to compose multiple coils A<b>1</b> to form a semi-finished product of a mouse pad C with a function of wireless charge.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The chassis <b>10</b> includes a seat <b>11</b>, two posts <b>12</b> and a guide rail <b>13</b>.

The tray <b>31</b> is movable along a second axial direction y. The second axial direction y is perpendicular to the first axial direction x. In detail, the moving direction of the tray <b>31</b> is perpendicular to the first axial direction x and compose a two-dimensional plane with the first axial direction x.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wire leading mechanism <b>40</b> is connected to the shifting mechanism <b>20</b> and movable in a third axial direction z along the shifting mechanism <b>20</b>. The third axial direction z is perpendicular to both the first axial direction x and the second axial direction y. In detail, the third axial direction z is perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane to compose a three-dimensional space, i.e., the wire leading mechanism <b>40</b> is movable along the upward and downward directions of the seat <b>11</b>. The wire leading mechanism <b>40</b> includes a body <b>41</b>, a wire conveying assembly <b>42</b> disposed in the body <b>41</b> and a wire leading head <b>43</b> connected to the body <b>41</b>.

Thus, when the pressing portion <b>433</b> of the wire leading head <b>43</b> contacts the carrier B, the pressing portion <b>433</b> retracts toward the chamber <b>412</b> to compress the elastic member <b>44</b> so as to prevent the wire leading head <b>43</b> from being fractured or damaged. When the wire leading head <b>43</b> leaves the carrier B to be relieved from an external force, the wire leading head <b>43</b> returns to a fixed position by the elasticity of the elastic member <b>44</b>. The cross-section of the pressing portion <b>433</b> is of a substantially arc shape. The wire leading head <b>43</b> may effectively press the wire A to prevent the wire A from warping when the wire leading mechanism <b>40</b> is laying the wire A.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.

An end of the wire A is inserted into the through hole <b>411</b> of the body <b>41</b> to be output to the wire leading head <b>43</b> by the wire conveying assembly <b>42</b> for laying. By the rotation of the wire supply reel <b>50</b>, a certain length of the wire A continuously remains between the wire leading mechanism <b>40</b> and the wire supply reel <b>50</b> to prevent the wire A from twisting or fracturing because of unduly pulling when the wire A is conveyed by the wire conveying assembly <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, which show the using process of the semi-automatic wiring machine of the disclosure. First, the shifting mechanism <b>20</b> and the tray <b>31</b> are moved to a proper initial wire-laying position, at the same time, an end of the wire A is located above an end of the annular groove B<b>1</b> of the carrier B.
