For instance, if some additional policy types are to be enforced or an existing policy type is to be deleted.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The scenarios where policy types could be updated at near-RT MC are: subscription deletion by CU/DU node (via E2 interface); subscription from CU/DU node (via E2 interface) is updated to support additional/reduced functionalities (could be indicated by Event Trigger Definitions); addition/deletion of UE's, if the non-RT MC needs to express policies for a dynamically defined group of UEs (i.e., a set of UEs), it is done through a set of policies for individual UEs; and UE mobility could change the policy capabilities as well.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Current specifications indicate methods for providing information of supported policy types only when non-RT MC fetches the same before creating a policy. Additionally, the near-RT MC could send the feedback policy for an existing enforced policy with the status of policy.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Problems with feedback policy mechanism:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In case the near-RT RIC indicates that the all the applied policies is &#x2018;not enforced&#x2019; anymore, non-RT MC is required to send additional message to delete the policy instance at near-RT RIC; and, to get the set of new policy types supported, an additional message has to be sent by non-RT RIC before creating new set of policies to be enforced.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In case the near-RT RIC indicates that only few policies from list of &#x2018;enforced&#x2019; policies are applied, the non-enforced policies would still be required to be deleted at near-RT RIC; and the non-RT MC might still not know that there are any additional policy types to be updated and so it might not send request to get new of policy types.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The specification does not provide any other ways to update the policy type at non-RT MC from near-RT MC.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A call flow <b>100</b> for querying policy types from near-RT MC is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A call flow <b>200</b> for creating a policy at near-RT RIC is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A call flow <b>300</b> for updating policy at near-RT MC is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A call flow <b>400</b> for feedback policy sent by near-RT MC is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the call flows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, A1-P Consumer is non-RT MC and A1-P Producer is near-RT MC.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A solution to above problems is to have a policy update notification sent from near-RT RIC to non-RT MC with list of policy types that are supported whenever the node identifies that there is change in currently exchanged policy types.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With this mechanism a single message would indicate the new policy types that are to be supported for which non-RT MC can create new policy, and the same message can also indicate the policy types that are no longer supported and the instance of same needs to be deleted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">If during earlier exchange of messages non-RT MC queries near-RT MC and near RT MC sends list of policy types supported by same as POLICY_TYPE_A, POLICY_TYPE_B and POLICY_TYPE_C, the policies for same will be created by non-RT MC and enforced at near-RT MC. However, at some later point of time due to certain event, some policy types at near-RT RIC do not hold valid anymore (for e.g., POLICY_TYPE_B) and some new policy types is to be applied, say POLICY_TYPE_D,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With existing mechanism near-RT RIC can only send Feedback Policy with &#x201c;POLICY_TYPE_B&#x201d; as &#x201c;not enforced&#x201d; and non-RT RIC would take action to delete the instance of that policy only. With proposed solution near-RT MC can send a message to non-RT MC with list of supported policy types as POLICY_TYPE_A, POLICY_TYPE_C and POLICY_TYPE_D. This would help non-RT RIC to understand that POLICY_TYPE_B is no longer supported and needs to be deleted and at the same time a new policy for POLICY_TYPE_D shall be created.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An architecture diagram <b>500</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

In the current network architecture, each &#x201c;G&#x201d; has a core network. 2G circuit core network <b>705</b> includes a 2G MSC/VLR; 2G/3G packet core network <b>706</b> includes an SGSN/GGSN (for EDGE or UMTS packet traffic); 3G circuit core <b>707</b> includes a 3G MSC/VLR; 4G circuit core <b>708</b> includes an evolved packet core (EPC); and in some embodiments the Wi-Fi access network may be connected via an ePDG/TTG using S2a/S2b. Each of these nodes are connected via a number of different protocols and interfaces, as shown, to other, non-&#x201c;G&#x201d;-specific network nodes, such as the SCP <b>730</b>, the SMSC <b>731</b>, PCRF <b>732</b>, HLR/HSS <b>733</b>, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting server (AAA) <b>734</b>, and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) <b>735</b>. An HeMS/AAA <b>736</b> is present in some cases for use by the 3G UTRAN. The diagram is used to indicate schematically the basic functions of each network as known to one of skill in the art, and is not intended to be exhaustive. For example, 5G core <b>717</b> is shown using a single interface to 5G access <b>716</b>, although in some cases 5G access can be supported using dual connectivity or via a non-standalone deployment architecture.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Noteworthy is that the RANs <b>701</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>703</b>, <b>704</b> and <b>736</b> rely on specialized core networks <b>705</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>707</b>, <b>708</b>, <b>709</b>, <b>737</b> but share essential management databases <b>730</b>, <b>731</b>, <b>732</b>, <b>733</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>735</b>, <b>738</b>. More specifically, for the 2G GERAN, a BSC <b>701</b><i>c </i>is required for Abis compatibility with BTS <b>701</b><i>b</i>, while for the 3G UTRAN, an RNC <b>702</b><i>c </i>is required for Iub compatibility and an FGW <b>702</b><i>d </i>is required for Iuh compatibility. These core network functions are separate because each RAT uses different methods and techniques. On the right side of the diagram are disparate functions that are shared by each of the separate RAT core networks. These shared functions include, e.g., PCRF policy functions, AAA authentication functions, and the like. Letters on the lines indicate well-defined interfaces and protocols for communication between the identified nodes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The system may include 5G equipment. The present invention is also applicable for 5G networks since the same or equivalent functions are available in 5G. 5G networks are digital cellular networks, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into a collection of small geographical areas called cells. Analog signals representing sounds and images are digitized in the phone, converted by an analog to digital converter and transmitted as a stream of bits. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local antenna array and low power automated transceiver (transmitter and receiver) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a common pool of frequencies, which are reused in geographically separated cells. The local antennas are connected with the telephone network and the Internet by a high bandwidth optical fiber or wireless backhaul connection.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">5G uses millimeter waves which have shorter range than microwaves, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size. Millimeter wave antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks. They are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. Another technique used for increasing the data rate is massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output). Each cell will have multiple antennas communicating with the wireless device, received by multiple antennas in the device, thus multiple bitstreams of data will be transmitted simultaneously, in parallel. In a technique called beamforming the base station computer will continuously calculate the best route for radio waves to reach each wireless device, and will organize multiple antennas to work together as phased arrays to create beams of millimeter waves to reach the device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an enhanced eNodeB for performing the methods described herein, in accordance with some embodiments. eNodeB <b>800</b> may include processor <b>802</b>, processor memory <b>804</b> in communication with the processor, baseband processor <b>806</b>, and baseband processor memory <b>808</b> in communication with the baseband processor.

Wherever a 4G technology is described, the inventors have understood that other RATs have similar equivalents, such as a gNodeB for 5G equivalent of eNB. Wherever an MME is described, the MME could be a 3G RNC or a 5G AMF/SMF.

Therefore, at least four scenarios are described: (1) the selection of an MME or core node at the base station; (2) the selection of an MME or core node at a coordinating server such as a virtual radio network controller gateway (VRNCGW); (3) the selection of an MME or core node at the base station that is connected to a 5G-capable core network (either a 5G core network in a 5G standalone configuration, or a 4G core network in 5G non-standalone configuration); (4) the selection of an MME or core node at a coordinating server that is connected to a 5G-capable core network (either 5G SA or NSA). In some embodiments, the core network RAT is obscured or virtualized towards the RAN such that the coordination server and not the base station is performing the functions described herein, e.g., the health management functions, to ensure that the RAN is always connected to an appropriate core network node.
