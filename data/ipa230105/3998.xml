It applies more particularly, although non-limitatively, to the protection of optical elements.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical elements, such as for example lenses, objectives in an optical instrument (camera, telescope, microscope), light sources, photodetectors, are elements very sensitive to dust and other impurities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, these elements, when they are not in use, are placed in hermetic boxes or protected by removable rigid protective caps. These protective caps are intended to be removed before use. However, during the time taken for removing the protective cap and installing the optical element in a position of use, these optical elements may once again be subjected to dust. Moreover, the protective caps may be lost or forgotten.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention aims to remedy the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this purpose, the present invention proposes a protective seal taking the form of a hollow body comprising a first wall, a second wall opposite to the first wall, and a section between the first wall and the second wall. The first wall includes an opening. The second wall includes at least one slot. The protective seal is configured so as to pass, when a force is exerted on the second wall, in a direction perpendicular to said second wall, from a rest position, in which the at least one slot is closed, to a stressed position, in which the at least one slot is deformed, freeing up an orifice in the second wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first wall preferably has a generally planar shape. The second wall has a generally planar shape.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally planar or substantially planar shape means preferentially a wall having a constant thickness.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first wall is advantageously intended to come to be positioned against a support of an element that it is wished to protect from dust. The first wall is advantageously intended to be arranged so that the element to be protected is disposed facing or in the opening in the first wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, when the protective seal is positioned around the element, it acts, when it is in a rest position, as a protective cap with respect to dust. The second wall of the protective seal being closed off when it is in a rest position, the protective seal becomes hermetic to the introduction of dust through this second wall. The hollow body forming the protective seal thus delimits a dust-tight chamber.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">By a simple application of a force, in a direction perpendicular to the second wall, the second wall stretches in its plane, which deforms the at least one slot and creates an orifice in the second wall.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, when the protective seal is positioned around the element and in a stressed position, the protective seal no longer acts as a protective cap and the element can be used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The force can be applied for example manually or by a mechanical action.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The purpose of such a protective seal is advantageously to remain in place around the element, even when the latter is being used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such a protective seal is advantageously intended to protect optical elements, such as lenses, light sources or photodetectors. This protective seal can also be intended to protect non-optical elements, such as for example inkjet nozzles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular embodiments, the invention furthermore complies with the following characteristics, implemented separately or in each of the technically operative combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular embodiments of the invention, the hollow body forming the protective seal is produced from an elastic material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred example embodiment, the elastic material is an elastomer. Such a material made from elastomer is advantageous since it enables the protective seal to deform elastically, while remaining in the elastic domain.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other example embodiments, the elastic material may be a silicone, a composite material or a metallic material. Any other type of material capable of deforming while remaining in the elastic domain can be used.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular embodiments of the invention, said protective seal is configured to return to the rest position when the force is no longer being exerted on the second wall. Thus, as soon as the element is no longer being used, the force on the second wall is removed, the second wall reverts to its initial shape, with its at least one slot closed again, and the protective seal once again becomes naturally hermetic to dust.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular embodiments of the invention, the section has the form of a truncated cone, with a small base on the same side as the first wall and a large base on the same side as the second wall. Such a form of the section makes it possible, when a force is exerted on the protective seal, to advantageously contribute to the stretching of the second wall in its plane.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In particular embodiments of the invention, the second wall of the protective seal can include at least two slots, preferably crossed. Thus, when the protective seal is in a stressed position, the orifice created by the deformation of the two slots has dimensions greater than that of the orifice created by the deformation of a single slot.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention also relates to a protective assembly including two protective seals as disclosed and in accordance with at least one of its embodiments. The respective second walls of the two protective seals are advantageously arranged to come into contact against each other. Each protective seal is intended to protect an element. The two elements protected respectively by a protective seal are intended to interact together.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Such a protective assembly makes it possible, when the two protective seals are put in contact and subjected to a force exerted perpendicular to the two walls, to create, between said two elements, a protected space, delimited by the sections of the two protective seals and free from dust. Thus, even during use, the elements are protected by the protective seals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The protective assembly thus advantageously makes it possible to protect two elements, both before and after use thereof and during use thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention will be understood better from the reading of the following description, given by way of in no way limitative example, and made with reference to the following figures:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a protective seal according to a first embodiment of the invention, in a rest position,</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the protective seal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a stressed position,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows, in cross section, a protective assembly including two protective seals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the protective seals being in a rest position,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates, in cross section, the protective assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with the protective seals in a stressed position,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates another example of a protective assembly including two protective seals according to a second embodiment of the invention, and sized for protecting a plurality of elements; the protective seals being shown facing and in the rest position, and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the protective assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, with the protective seals assembled and in a stressed position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In these figures, numerical references that are identical from one figure to another designate identical or similar elements.

The truncated cone form of the section, with the large base <b>32</b> on the same side as the second wall, advantageously contributes to the stretching of the second wall in its plane.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">The selection of the hardness of the material constituting the body of the protective seal is preferentially dependent on the force exerted on the second wall <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">The protective seal undergoes a deformation that remains in its elastic domain. Thus, as soon as the force exerted on the protective seal ceases, the second wall <b>20</b> advantageously by itself resumes its rest position.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">The protective seal <b>70</b> can advantageously be used with another protective seal to form a protective assembly.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate a preferred method of use of such a protective assembly.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">In this non-limitative embodiment, each protective seal of the protective assembly is sized to protect an element, here optical.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">A protective seal, referred to as the first protective seal, is intended to protect for example a light source <b>40</b>.

The collar <b>12</b> of the first wall <b>10</b> is disposed against a bearing face <b>42</b> of a support <b>41</b> of the light source <b>40</b>. The first protective seal is attached reversibly, or non-reversibly, to the support <b>41</b> of the light source <b>40</b>, by the collar <b>12</b> of its first wall <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">In an equivalent manner, the second protective seal is positioned facing the photodetector <b>50</b> so that said photoreceptor is disposed at the opening <b>11</b> of the first wall <b>10</b> of said second protective seal. The collar <b>12</b> of the first wall <b>10</b> is disposed against a bearing face <b>52</b> of a support <b>51</b> of the photodetector <b>50</b>. The second protective seal is attached reversibly, or non-reversibly, to the support <b>51</b> of the photodetector <b>50</b>, by the collar <b>12</b> of its first wall <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">When the light source <b>40</b> is not being used, the first protective seal is in the rest position. The first protective seal is then hermetic to dust. No dust can enter the hollow body. The light source <b>40</b> is thus protected from dust and other impurities.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0093">Likewise, when the photodetector <b>50</b> is not being used, the second protective seal is in the rest position. The second protective seal is then dust-tight and no dust can enter the hollow body. The photodetector <b>50</b> is thus protected from dust and other impurities.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">When it is wished to establish an optical connection between the light source <b>40</b> and the photodetector <b>50</b>, the light source <b>40</b> and the photodetector <b>50</b> are disposed facing each other. The second wall <b>20</b> of the first protective seal is arranged opposite the second wall <b>20</b> of the second protective seal. In other words, the first surface of the second wall of the first protective seal is arranged opposite the first surface of the second wall of the second protective seal.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">As shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second wall <b>20</b> of the first protective seal is against the second wall <b>20</b> of the second protective seal. Each protective seal is in the rest position. No force is exerted on either of the protective seals. The optical beam that would be emitted by the light source <b>40</b> cannot then pass through the second wall <b>20</b> of the first protective seal. The photodetector <b>50</b> cannot receive the optical beam emitted by the light source <b>40</b>. In one example embodiment, the light source and the photodetector are distant from each other by a few centimetres, for example a maximum of 5 cm. Each protective seal is sized accordingly.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0096">As illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a force is now exerted on the protective seals. This force is represented by the arrow <b>61</b>, by way of non-limitative example. This force is applied in a direction substantially perpendicular to the second walls of each protective seal.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0097">When this force is exerted, said second walls of each protective seal stretch in their plane, as illustrated by the two arrows <b>62</b>. In stretching, the slots of said second walls of each protective seal open and leave clear an orifice <b>24</b> in said second walls. Said respective orifices <b>24</b> of each second wall then allows the passage of the optical beam emitted by the light source <b>40</b> in the direction of the photodetector <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0098">Such a protective assembly has a dual advantage. When the light source <b>40</b> and the photodetector <b>50</b> are not being used, each protective seal protects its optical element from dust, independently of the other. When the two protective seals are put in contact and a force is exerted on them, the optical connection is achieved in the hollow space of each protective seal. No dust can enter inside the protective seals. The protective assembly thus advantageously makes it possible to protect two optical elements, both before and after uses thereof and during uses thereof.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> illustrate another example of a protective assembly.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0100">In this example, each protective seal is sized to protect a plurality of optical elements (not shown) arranged in a column.

The two walls of the two protective seals are one against the other. More precisely, the first surface of the second wall of the first protective seal is against the first surface of the second wall of the second protective seal. In this figure the opening of the longitudinal slots of each second wall can be seen clearly, leaving clear an orifice <b>24</b> in each second wall allowing passage of optical beams emitted by the light sources towards the associated photodetectors.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0103">The present invention is not limited to a protective seal with a first wall <b>10</b>, a section <b>30</b> and a second wall <b>20</b> with the same cross section, as illustrated on the figures. A protective seal may include a first wall <b>10</b>, a section <b>30</b> and a second wall <b>20</b> with different cross sections. For example, a protective seal may include a first wall <b>10</b> having a circular cross section, a second wall <b>20</b> having a square cross section and a section <b>30</b> in the form of a truncated cone of elliptical cross section.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0104">Likewise, the present invention is not limited to a protective assembly including two identical protective seals, as illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.
