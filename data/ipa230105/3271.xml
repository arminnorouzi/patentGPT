application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085518, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if set forth herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a brake apparatus for a vehicle, and more particularly, to a caliper-type brake apparatus for a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a brake apparatus for a vehicle refers to an apparatus for keeping the vehicle stationary. The brake apparatus serves to keep the wheels of the vehicle from rotating. Recently, an EPB (Electronic Parking Brake) system for electronically controlling the operation of a parking brake is widely used. The EPB system is mounted on a typical disk brake which acquires a braking force by strongly pressing portions of a disk, rotated with a wheel, from both sides thereof through friction pads, and performs the function of the parking brake.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a brake apparatus presses a piston by converting a rotational force of a driving motor into a linear motion through a screw and a nut mechanism, and presses a brake pad serving as a friction material against the disk by moving a caliper through the pressing force and the reaction force of the piston, thereby generating a braking force. After the braking is finished, the brake apparatus removes the frictional force by separating the caliper and the piston from the brake pad through a knock back between the brake pad and the disk and a restoring force (roll back) of a piston seal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the conventional brake apparatus, however, the caliper has a structural limit that the caliper is deformed when repeatedly operated. Therefore, the axis of the screw may be distorted to apply an excessive load between the screw and the nut mechanism. In this case, the efficiency of power transfer may be degraded, or the gap between the screw and the body may be expanded so that oil inside the caliper leaks.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The related art of the present disclosure is disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0098846 published on Sep. 10, 2010 and entitled &#x201c;Disk Brake Having Parking Function.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various embodiments are directed to a brake apparatus for a vehicle, which can prevent an oil leakage and degradation in efficiency of power transfer when a caliper is deformed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, a brake apparatus for a vehicle may include: a caliper part fixed to a vehicle body, and having a cylinder provided therein; a piston part movably installed in the cylinder, and brought into contact with or separated from a pad plate part according to a moving direction thereof; a shaft part configured to receive a driving force from a driving part, and reciprocate in a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the cylinder; a pressing part connected to the shaft part, and configured to press the piston part toward the pad plate part as the shaft part is moved to one side; and an angle adjusting part provided between the shaft part and the pressing part, and configured to vary an installation angle of the shaft part with respect to the pressing part.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cylinder may be rotated in a first direction by a reaction force generated by the contact between the piston part and the pad plate part, and the shaft part may be rotated on the angle adjusting part in the first direction with the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pressing part may be fixed to an inner surface of the piston part.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The pressing part may have a front surface coming into surface contact with an inner rear surface of the piston part.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The front surface of the pressing part may be formed in a plane shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The angle adjusting part may include: an insertion part extended from the pressing part, and having an empty space formed therein; and a ball joint part extended from the shaft part, and rotated inside the insertion part in connection with a change in angle of the shaft part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The angle adjusting part may further include a load switching part concavely recessed into the pressing part from the insertion part, and configured to come into rolling contact with a front surface of the ball joint part.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The load switching part may include a first inclined surface and a second inclined surface which are disposed so that a distance therebetween decreases toward the pressing part from the insertion part.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An angle that the first inclined surface forms with a center axis of the cylinder may be smaller than an angle that the second inclined surface forms with the center axis of the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The angle adjusting part may further include a separation prevention part extended from the insertion part, and disposed so as to face a rear surface of the ball joint part.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The separation prevention part may be provided as a plurality of separation prevention parts which are arranged at predetermined intervals in a circumferential direction of the insertion part.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The brake apparatus may further include a stopper part extended from the shaft part, and configured to constrain an axial rotation of the shaft part by interfering with the insertion part.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The stopper part may be protruded in a radial direction of the shaft part from an outer circumferential surface of the shaft part and inserted into a cut-out portion formed in the insertion part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stopper part may have both surfaces abutting on an inner surface of the cut-out portion, and configured to constrain the axial rotation of the shaft part.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The stopper part may be moved in a longitudinal direction of the cut-out portion as the shaft part is rotated in the first direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure, the brake apparatus for a vehicle may prevent a gap in the connection portion between the cylinder and the spindle, which may occur when the cylinder is deformed by a reaction force of the piston part, because the installation angle of the shaft part with respect to the pressing part can be varied by the angle adjusting part.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, although the stroke length of the piston part is changed due to the wear of the pad plate part, the angle adjusting part may change the position of the rotation center axis of the shaft part while moved with the shaft part, thereby preventing a jam between the shaft part and the pressing part while preventing the degradation in power transfer performance to the piston part.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, although the angle of the shaft part is changed by the load switching part, the brake apparatus may induce a pressing load, applied through the ball joint part, to be transferred in a direction parallel to the direction that the piston part is moved forward and backward.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, as the pressing part having the front surface formed in a plane shape comes in surface contact with the entire inner rear surface of the piston part, the pressing part may come into constant pressure contact with the piston part without eccentric pressure, and make the most of the braking area, thereby improving the braking efficiency.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the pressing part of the brake apparatus may be fixed to the inner surface of the piston part. Thus, when the shaft part is moved backward to remove the braking force, the pressing part may separate the piston part from the pad plate part through a fixing force with the piston part, thereby completely removing a residual braking force while preventing a drag.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically illustrating that a brake apparatus for a vehicle in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is installed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating the configuration of the brake apparatus for a vehicle in accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an expanded view schematically illustrating the configuration of an angle adjusting part in accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically illustrating the configuration of a load switching part in accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view schematically illustrating the configuration of a stopper in accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref> are operation diagrams schematically illustrating an operation process of the brake apparatus for a vehicle in accordance with the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a brake apparatus for a vehicle will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings through various exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that the drawings are not to precise scale and may be exaggerated in thickness of lines or sizes of components for descriptive convenience and clarity only.

Thus, when the shaft part <b>600</b> is moved backward to remove the braking force, the pressing part <b>700</b> may separate the piston part <b>500</b> from the pad plate part <b>200</b> through a fixing force with the piston part <b>500</b>, thereby completely removing a residual braking force while preventing a drag.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The angle adjusting part <b>800</b> is provided between the shaft part <b>600</b> and the pressing part <b>700</b>, and serves to connect the shaft part <b>600</b> and the pressing part <b>700</b> to each other.

More specifically, when the cylinder <b>330</b> is rotated in the first direction A by a reaction force generated by the contact with the piston part <b>500</b>, the angle adjusting part <b>800</b> serves to induce the shaft part <b>600</b> to rotate on the angle adjusting part <b>800</b> in the first direction A together with the cylinder <b>330</b>. That is, the angle adjusting part <b>800</b> functions as the rotation center axis of the shaft part <b>600</b> whose installation angle is varied when the cylinder <b>330</b> is deformed.
