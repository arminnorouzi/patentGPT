DE 10 2021 207 034.5, filed on Jul. 5, 2021 in Germany, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a compensating device.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE 10 2015 214 003 A1 discloses a compensating device having a first and a second assembly. The first assembly is fastened, for example, to an articulated robot, with, for example, a gripper being fastened to the second assembly. In a first operating state, the second assembly is connected fixedly to the first assembly. In a second operating state, the second assembly is supported resiliently on the first assembly. An electric motor is used to switch over between the first and the second operating state. The corresponding locking mechanism comprises a plurality of balls which are arranged uniformly distributed about a center axis of the compensating element. The balls can be clamped by means of a locking ring such that the first operating state is set. The electric motor brings about rotation of the locking ring in order to switch over between the first and the second operating state.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If the compensating device is used in an automated manufacturing system, it is desirable to minimize the time which is required for switching over between the first and the second operating state so that the productivity of the manufacturing system is at maximum. In particular when switching over from the second into the first operating state, a considerable impact stress on the electric motor is caused as a result. Very rapid switching-over operations may destroy the electric motor within a short time.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One advantage of the present disclosure consists in that the electric motor has a long service life even if a very rapid switch is made between the first and the second operating states.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the disclosure, it is proposed that the locking ring is connected in terms of rotary drive to the electric motor via a torsion spring which is elastic with respect to the center axis. The torsion spring lessens the above-discussed impact in such a manner that said impact exerts only a small stress on the electric motor. As a result, the service life of the electric motor increases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The electric motor can comprise a transmission which preferably brings about a speed-reducing ratio. The spring mechanism preferably comprises at least one spring which is installed under pretension in the direction of the center axis between the at least three balls and the first assembly such that the at least three balls are in each case pretensioned toward the second assembly. A single annular undular washer can be provided. A separate pressure ring can be provided which directly touches the at least three balls, wherein the at least one spring is installed under pretension between the pressure ring and the first assembly. In the last case, use is preferably made of at least three helical compression springs which are arranged distributed uniformly about the center axis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The locking ring preferably has a flat bearing surface which is oriented perpendicularly to the center axis, it being supported on the first assembly via the bearing surface. Other forms of the bearing surface are also conceivable provided that they are rotationally symmetrical with respect to the center axis such that the locking ring is rotatable with respect to the center axis. The locking ring preferably has a pressure surface which can directly touch the at least three balls. The pressure surface and the bearing surface are preferably arranged on opposite sides of the locking ring in the direction of the center axis. The thickness measured between the bearing surface and the pressure surface in the direction of the center axis preferably varies periodically over the circumference of the locking ring. The number of periods is preferably equal to the number of balls.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageous developments and improvements of the disclosure are specified below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It can be provided that the electric motor has a rotatable drive journal which is arranged concentrically with respect to the center axis, wherein the locking ring surrounds the drive journal, and wherein the torsion spring is arranged between the drive journal and the locking ring, as viewed radially with respect to the center axis. This means that the torsion spring requires particularly little construction space. Furthermore, the end position, explained further below, of the torsion spring can be easily realized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It can be provided that the torsion spring comprises a single spring wire which is wound spirally with respect to the center axis, wherein a first end of the spring wire is connected to the drive journal for rotation therewith, and wherein a second end of the spring wire opposite the first end is connected to the locking ring for rotation therewith. Such a torsion spring requires little construction space and nevertheless over the long term withstands the impact stress during operation of the compensating element. The spring wire is preferably composed of hardened spring steel. It has a constant cross-sectional shape, preferably over its entire length, which is mostly preferably circular or rectangular. The spring wire preferably has between two and four winding revolutions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It can be provided that the spring wire is bent over at the first end and/or at the second end in each case at a right angle, wherein the corresponding bent-over portion engages at least indirectly in a form-fitting manner in the drive journal or in the locking ring. This makes it possible in a cost-effective and space-saving manner for the spring wire to be carried along at the first and/or second end for rotation with said drive journal or locking ring. The bent-over portion at the second end preferably engages directly in the locking ring, in particular in a circular-cylindrical bore arranged there. The right angle mentioned is preferably between 80&#xb0; and 100&#xb0;, mostly preferably 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A separate carry-along part can be provided which is connected fixedly to the drive journal, wherein the bent-over portion engages at the first end directly in a form-fitting manner in the carry-along part. This means that the standardized drive journal on the electric motor does not need to be changed. Furthermore, the carry-along part assists in the provision of the end position explained below by the carry-along part merging with its outer circumferential surface preferably without a step and gap into the circular-conical surface on the locking ring. The carry-along part is clamped against the drive journal preferably by means of a clamping screw.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It can be provided that the carry-along part is clamped against the drive journal by means of a threaded pin, wherein the threaded pin is oriented radially with respect to the center axis, and wherein the threaded pin is accommodated in the carry-along part in a manner completely recessed with respect to an outer circumferential surface of the carry-along part. This provides a clamping of the carry-along part, the clamping not obstructing the movement of the torsion spring and not being damaged whenever the torsion spring has reached the end position. The threaded pin is preferably clamped against a flattened portion on the drive journal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be provided that the spring wire is bent spirally in such a manner that the first and the second end are spaced apart from each other in the direction of the center axis. The corresponding distance is preferably selected to be of such a size that the individual winding revolutions are arranged next to one another in the direction of the center axis when the torsion spring is tensioned into the end position, where the latter preferably lies against the circular-conical surface. In the end position, adjacent winding revolutions preferably lie directly on one another in the direction of the axis of rotation, thus resulting in a particularly stiff end position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It can be provided that the spring wire is wound spirally in such a manner that it defines a circular cone on the other side of the first and the second end. By this means, the above-explained distance between the first and the second end can be realized in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It can be provided that the torsion spring is configured in such a manner that it is rotatable from an untensioned neutral position by 30&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; as far as an end position, wherein, from the end position, a stiff rotary entrainment takes place between the drive journal and the locking ring if the direction of rotation of the drive journal remains the same. The direction of rotation mentioned preferably corresponds to a displacement from the second into the first operating state. The torsion spring therefore has an impact-damping effect between the neutral position and the end position. From the end position, the locking mechanism thus moves as though no torsion spring at all were present. In this adjustment region, the actual locking into the first operating state takes place. This is in practice not interfered with by the torsion spring.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It can be provided that the spring wire in its end position lies with its inner circumferential surface on the locking ring. The desired stiff rotary entrainment can thereby be realized in a simple manner if the drive journal is moved beyond the end position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It can be provided that the locking ring has a surface which is in the form of a circular cone with respect to the center axis and on which the spring wire lies in its end position. The circular-conical surface is particularly readily adapted to the above-explained conical shape of the torsion spring, thus resulting in particularly stiff contact.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It goes without saying that the features which have been mentioned above and those which have yet to be explained below can be used not only in the respectively stated combination, but also in other combinations or on their own without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disclosure will be explained in more detail below with reference to the attached drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the compensating element according to the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a further sectional view of the compensating element according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an enlarged detail from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the region of the torsion spring;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross section through part of the compensating element in the region of the first end of the torsion spring; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that part of the compensating element which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, perspectively and unsectioned.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the compensating element <b>10</b> according to the disclosure.

Furthermore, the first assembly <b>20</b> comprises a first fastening flange <b>25</b> which is fixedly connected to the first main part <b>23</b> by means of a plurality of screws <b>36</b>, which are arranged obliquely with respect to the center axis <b>11</b>, with it forming the base of the cup shape mentioned. The compensating element <b>10</b> is preferably produced in a plurality of variants which differ in respect of the shape of the first and/or the second fastening flange <b>25</b>; <b>43</b> such that the compensating element can be used for different robots and different grippers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second housing body <b>22</b> comprises a ring-like second main part <b>24</b> and a second plate <b>28</b>.

The luminous ring <b>81</b> runs with a constant, rectangular cross-sectional shape in a circular manner about the center axis <b>11</b>. It is preferably composed of a light-scattering polycarbonate. On its two face sides facing in the direction of the center axis <b>11</b>, a respective sealing ring <b>84</b> is arranged towards the first and second main part <b>23</b>; <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The luminous ring <b>81</b> surrounds a first plate <b>27</b> which is arranged in a fixed position within the first assembly <b>20</b>. An electric motor <b>51</b> which comprises a transmission is connected fixedly to the first plate <b>27</b>, the drive journal <b>52</b> of said transmission penetrating the first plate. The axis of rotation <b>53</b> of the electric motor <b>51</b> coincides with the center axis <b>11</b> of the compensating element. The transmission means that the axis of rotation <b>53</b> of the electric motor <b>51</b> is arranged somewhat eccentrically on the electric motor <b>51</b> itself. The drive journal <b>52</b> is already mounted rotatably within the electric motor <b>51</b>, the drive journal additionally being provided with a further radial rolling bearing <b>54</b> which is accommodated in the first plate <b>27</b>.

The second printed circuit board <b>32</b> is connectable to a controlling means via the electrical connection <b>13</b> on the first housing body <b>21</b>, with all of the functions of the compensating element <b>10</b> being controllable via said connection.

Each distance meter <b>72</b> is assigned a measurement surface, wherein, in the zero position of the compensating element <b>10</b>, the measurement direction thereof is oriented perpendicularly to the assigned measurement surface and centrally with respect thereto. By means of the six measured distance values, the relative position between the first and the second assembly can be calculated in six degrees of freedom. For this purpose, a nonlinear system of equations has to be solved, which preferably takes place using a gradient descent method.

It is supported with three springs <b>64</b> on the first plate <b>27</b>. The springs <b>64</b> are designed as helical compression springs, and are arranged distributed uniformly about the center axis <b>11</b>. The springs <b>64</b> are accommodated at both ends in each case in matching recesses of the third ring <b>63</b> and of the second plate <b>28</b>. They are arranged in approximate alignment with an assigned ball <b>61</b> in the direction of the center axis <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The locking ring <b>62</b> lies in a sliding manner with a flat bearing surface <b>91</b> directly on a flat surface of the first plate <b>27</b>. In the direction of the center axis <b>11</b>, it has a thickness which changes in three periods between a minimum and a maximum over the circumference of the second ring <b>62</b>. If the three thickness maxima of the pressure surface <b>92</b> lie on the balls <b>61</b>, the first operating state is established, with the compensating element being locked. If the three thickness minima of the pressure surface <b>92</b> are arranged in the region of the balls <b>61</b>, the second operating state is established. The switch between the two operating states is made by the second ring <b>62</b> being rotated by means of the electric motor <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The balls <b>61</b> lie on an assigned, circular-conical ball seat <b>41</b>, specifically no matter in which operating state the compensating element <b>10</b> is in. The ball seat <b>41</b> is fixedly connected, in particular screwed, to the second fastening flange <b>43</b> via a single-piece extension arm <b>42</b>. The extension arm <b>42</b> penetrates a bore <b>37</b> in the second plate <b>28</b>, the ball seat <b>41</b> lying with a damping ring <b>44</b> on the edge of the bore <b>37</b> on the second plate <b>28</b> when the compensating element <b>10</b> is in the first operating state or in the zero position. In the second operating state, this contact can be neutralized by the second fastening flange <b>43</b> being acted upon with a force. Depending on the direction of said force, at least one ball <b>61</b> is moved towards the first plate <b>27</b> counter to the force of the respectively assigned spring <b>64</b>. In the second operating state, the second assembly <b>40</b> is therefore supported resiliently on the first assembly <b>20</b>. If the second assembly <b>40</b> is not acted upon with an external force, the spring forces in interaction with the guide rings <b>29</b> cause the second assembly <b>40</b> to spring back into a defined zero position. They can be clamped in said zero position by means of the second ring <b>62</b> in order to establish the first operating state.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a further sectional view of the compensating element <b>10</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The sectional plane likewise contains the center axis <b>11</b>, with the latter being rotated by 90&#xb0; in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As a result, all three balls <b>61</b> are arranged on the other side of the sectional plane.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> how the various parts of the first assembly <b>20</b> are screwed to one another. Use is made for this purpose of the screw <b>34</b> and the assigned bolt <b>35</b> which are each present three times, with the corresponding pairs being arranged distributed uniformly over the circumference of the compensating element <b>10</b>. The bolt <b>35</b> which is parallel to the center axis <b>11</b> is screwed by an external thread into the second plate <b>28</b>. It penetrates the first plate <b>27</b> with a circular-cylindrical mating surface such that the first plate <b>27</b> is precisely oriented. The screw <b>34</b> which is parallel to the center axis <b>11</b> penetrates the first main part <b>23</b>, the screw being screwed into an internal thread of the bolt <b>35</b>. As a result, the first main part <b>23</b> is braced against the first plate <b>27</b>. The first plate <b>27</b> lies via at least one spacer plate <b>38</b> on the second main part <b>24</b>, the latter in turn lying directly on the second plate <b>28</b> such that the force flux of the screw <b>34</b> is closed. So that the corresponding clamping force is transmitted only in a small portion via the luminous ring <b>81</b>, the latter is held between two sealing rings <b>84</b>, with it lying with its luminous surface <b>80</b> in sections on the inside of the first and the second main part <b>23</b>; <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, two prisms <b>72</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The two corresponding flat measurement surfaces <b>73</b> intersect on an imaginary straight line which, in turn, intersects the center axis <b>11</b> at a right angle. The two mutually assigned measurement surfaces <b>73</b> are arranged mirror-symmetrically with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an enlarged detail from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the region of the torsion spring <b>93</b>. The torsion spring <b>93</b> consists of a spring wire <b>94</b> which has a constant, rectangular cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present case, the spring wire <b>94</b> is composed of hardened spring steel. It is wound spirally. In the present case, two complete windings are provided.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For the locking of the balls, the spring wire <b>94</b> is rotated in the direction in which the inside diameter of the torsion spring <b>93</b> decreases as the rotation increases. At a rotational angle of approximately 50&#xb0; from the untensioned neutral position, this results in the spring wire <b>94</b> butting against the circular-conical surface <b>99</b> of the locking ring <b>62</b>, with the windings of the spring wire <b>94</b> also being able to directly abut one another. In each case, an end position is reached. The torsion spring <b>93</b> can then no longer be tensioned further. The fastening, explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, at the first and the second end of the spring wire <b>94</b> then leads to the drive journal <b>52</b> carrying along the locking ring <b>62</b> in a form-fitting or stiff manner.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">This type of suspension has the result that the drive journal <b>52</b> can be accelerated comparatively powerfully in order to rapidly lock the locking mechanism <b>50</b>. At the moment at which the locking ring <b>62</b> with its pressure surface <b>92</b> touches the balls <b>61</b>, a force impact arises. This impact is lessened by the torsion spring <b>93</b> in such a manner that the electric motor <b>51</b> is hardly loaded. When the end position is reached, the effects of the impact mentioned have been used to such an extent that the rotationally fixed or stiff entrainment now taking place between the drive journal <b>52</b> and the locking ring <b>62</b> does not result in an excessive stressing of the electric motor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross section of part of the compensating element in the region of the first end <b>95</b> of the torsion spring <b>93</b>. The sectional plane runs perpendicularly to the center axis <b>11</b>, it intersecting the first end <b>95</b> of the spring wire <b>94</b>. The direction of view is directed toward the first assembly, with the balls being blanked out.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It can be seen that the spring wire <b>94</b> has been bent over radially inward by approximately 90&#xb0; at the first end <b>95</b>. The corresponding bent-over portion <b>98</b>, which extends rectilinearly and radially with respect to the center axis <b>11</b>, engages in a matching recess on a separate carry-along part <b>97</b>. A form-fitting entrainment between torsion spring <b>94</b> and carry-along part <b>97</b> is therefore provided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The carry-along part <b>97</b> is clamped to the drive journal <b>52</b> of the electric motor by means of two threaded pins <b>56</b>. The threaded pins <b>56</b> each extend radially with respect to the center axis <b>11</b>. They are recessed in relation to the circular-cylindrical outer circumferential surface of the carry-along part <b>97</b>. When the end position mentioned is reached, a short section of the spring wire <b>94</b> lies on the outer circumferential surface of the carry-along part <b>97</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the outer circumferential surface mentioned merges into the circular-conical surface (No. <b>99</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) without a step and without a gap.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that part of the compensating element which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, perspectively and unsectioned. The spiral course of the spring wire <b>94</b> is more clearly visible as a result.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At the second end <b>96</b> of the spring wire <b>94</b> opposite the first end, a bent-over portion <b>98</b> bent over by approximately <b>90</b>&#xb0; is likewise provided. The second end <b>96</b> of the spring wire <b>94</b> faces radially outward in a straight line with respect to the center axis <b>11</b>. It engages in a form-fitting manner in a matching recess in the locking ring <b>62</b>.
