Such reasons may be objectively major (e.g., having problems at work, job loss, lack of money with rent due date approaching, major relationship problems, etc.), relatively minor (e.g., being worried about all the errands due by tomorrow, etc.), seemingly silly (e.g., afraid of an itch starting when bundled up for cold weather, imaginary ear or teeth problems, etc.), or anything in between. The anxiety-inducing reasons can also be (and often are) self-inflicted. For example, a feeling of &#x201c;unevenness&#x201d; in pressure of the left ear versus the right ear can cause a sense of panic. Yet, even when the pressure is indeed even, fear of unevenness may cause the person to yawn, blow their nose, or otherwise &#x201c;check&#x201d; that their ear pressure is even, which, in turn, may actually cause the unevenness which they sought to avoid. Or, a person may worry about all the possible problems that might be encountered on the next day's errands, even if those possible problems are low probability and/or would be minor problems at worst.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The drawings described herein are for illustrative purposes only of selected embodiments and not all possible implementations and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of an example system for determining location and context of an addict, a support network, and other information and aspects of an addict's personal and professional life for addiction treatment purposes, including relapse prevention and containment.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Addiction to substances (e.g., alcohol and drugs, etc.) and activities (e.g., gambling, etc.) are a major scourge of society. Addictions can come in many forms, but generally can be put into two categories: 1) addiction to a substance, such as drugs, alcohol, or food, or 2) addiction to an activity, such as gambling, sex, or shopping. The human impact of an addiction can vary greatly in terms of physical toll on the mind and body as well as everyday life-damage such as destruction of families and job loss. Common life-mining addictions include those involving alcohol, prescription and non-prescription drugs, cigarettes/nicotine, and gambling. Less common but very serious addictions involve overindulging in sex, eating, and avoidance/lack of food (e.g., anorexia or bulimia). Other addictions typically (but not always) can be considered relatively minor or annoying such as shopping, exercise, work, sports viewing, beauty enhancement/plastic surgery, videogames, or even surfing the Internet or constant use of smartphones, to name a partial list.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term addiction has many definitions, but in general it refers to a person or persons who cannot, or will not, stop using or doing something that is potentially harmful to them and/or others around them. While addiction often conjures images of drunks or drug addicts roaming the streets, in reality addiction impacts all walks of life, from professionals to blue-collar workers to athletes to celebrities to stay-at-home parents, even to children. Many addicts live otherwise useful, functional lives, that can be greatly improved if their addiction is effectively treated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various types of addiction treatments, programs, and other methods for addressing addiction have been around for many decades. Examples include: 12-Step Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Acupuncture, Aversion Therapy (multiple forms), Behavioral Self-Control Training, Cognitive Therapy, Going Cold Turkey, Community Reinforcement, Diet-based Programs, Drug-based Treatments (multiple forms), Exercise-based programs, Hypnosis, Interventions, Meditation, Motivational programs, Nutrition-based programs, Rehabilitation (Inpatient and Outpatient)/Hospitalization stays, Religious-based programs, Self-Change Manuals/Guides, (Traditional) Psychotherapy (multiple forms), Spiritual Immersion, and Work/Treatment programs to name some of the more commonly-known approaches.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Sometimes addiction treatments such as those mentioned above work. But very often addiction treatments do not work, at least not for long. While there are many reasons why an addiction treatment might not work, one common reason is that most treatments are most effective when they are actively being implemented, such as when a person is actively in residence in a treatment facility, attending an AA meeting, or in a therapy session. Put another way, one of the vulnerabilities of these and many of the above approaches is that their effectiveness is closely tied to their immediacy, both in terms of physicality to the addict (for treatments that have a personal counseling and/or physical location element) and in time-how fresh the teachings of the program are in the mind of the addict, not to mention how long the addict is willing to actively participate in treatment or treatment-related activities. This is particularly true for many of the most common treatments, such as rehab facility stays (inpatient or outpatient), therapy sessions, or alcoholism-related community meetings. Once the addict leaves those (usually physical, but increasingly virtual or augmented) places where the treatment takes place, the lessons or motivations from those treatments become weaker or start to fade, while at the same time opportunities and temptations to partake in the addiction increase.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another issue with the above treatments is that many surprisingly place little emphasis on the triggers that may cause or set off one's addiction-particularly in understanding what situations, circumstances, or mindsets (broadly, triggers) make or drive the addict to want to use the substance and/or activity in question. Triggers are what very often drives the desire to use. By way of background, triggers may be situations, circumstances, activities, events, and mental thought processes and frames-of-mind that tempt or cause an addict to want to use a substance or engage in an activity. Without such detailed knowledge of the triggers of addiction, such treatments often focus on symptoms, or controlling such triggers after they occur. In any event, even in treatment programs where understanding of addiction triggers is emphasized, such emphasis is usually focused on general understanding of the triggers, not in dealing with them on a practical, day-to-day, hour-by-hour basis of everyday life.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the addict gets farther away from the treatment program-physically and/or in time&#x2014;the lessons from those programs naturally start to fade, becoming less effective, and, in turn, making the addict more susceptible to relapse. Thus, it is desired to find ways of keeping treatment lessons fresh in the mind of the addict, or alternatively refreshing them in a way to actively deter an addict from relapsing. It is also unfortunately true that even the best-intentioned addict cannot see all the possible situations that might tempt or trigger the addict to relapse in time to avoid such triggers, or at least mitigate them&#x2014;the addict may find himself in a high-risk environment before realizing it. Accordingly, there is a need for a way to use technology to provide treatment reinforcement when the addict is away from the place of primary treatment(s), while simultaneously protecting the addict from the temptations/addiction triggers of their addiction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned earlier, some, but not all of the treatment programs above include education about addiction triggers. Such triggers include situations, circumstances, activities, events, and mental thought processes and frame-of-minds that tempt or cause an addict to want to use a substance or engage in an activity known or identified to be detrimental to the addict and/or others. Examples of triggers include but are not limited to: Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Change, Children, Conflict, Depression, Disorder, Embarrassment, Escape, Envy, Excitement, Fun, Frustration, Guilt, Health issues, Holidays Hunger, Insomnia, Job stress, Loneliness, Mid-life Crises, Money worries, Noise, Overconfidence, Pain, Peer Pressure, feeling Powerful or Powerless, Proximity (to the substance), Fear of Quitting (the substance or activity), Relationship issues, Relatives, Reminders, Sex, Shopping Situations, Social Situations, Special Occasions, Stress, Taste and Smell, Times of Day, being Tired, being Unfun, being a Victim (or crime, abuse), ex-spouses/partners, Yelling, even Season or Weather changes or Music. There are potentially hundreds of possible addiction triggers, and many thousands of trigger combinations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is when an addict's most vulnerable triggers become active or are present that the addict is most vulnerable to relapse. Thus, if boredom is a major trigger for an addict, it is imperative to keep the addict from becoming bored, or failing that, to respond to, and correct a bored addict before the temptation to use a substance or engage in an addictive activity becomes too strong and relapse occurs. Determining an addict's triggers and proscribing actions and activities to deal with those triggers without relapsing is anticipated to become a more common and important part of many addiction treatments and is at the core of various exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. In particular, various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein focus significant attention on understanding an addict's triggers and, in particular, using an array of sensors and other information to anticipate and/or detect triggers that are active, present, or in danger of becoming active or present, particularly by using location and context to a) anticipate, predict, and/or preempt an addict's triggers from becoming active or present, b) prevent a relapse when triggers do become active by initiating one or more actions, activities, and/or contacts with an addict's support network, and/or c) contain or manage a relapse if and when its occurs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Surprisingly, there is relatively little application of technology in addiction treatment in the prior art, less that incorporates location, and practically nothing that utilizes context. For example, location technology has been used to aid patient recovery, but this was focused on physical rehabilitation of ambulatory (hospital) patients, not addiction recovery nor patient monitoring outside a hospital environment. Location technology has also been used as a small part of an Internet addiction treatment, which focuses primarily on understanding the amount and type of internet activity that is taking place (e.g., games, certain types of websites, etc.). This latter example also utilized the concept of support groups, but not in a manner that emphases location or context of the addict or the support group.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Exemplary embodiments of addiction treatment systems and methods are disclosed herein. One example embodiment of a system includes a plurality of user devices, sensors, and other technology to: determine, through one or more communications networks, the location of an addict and the context of the addict at the location; evaluate a risk of relapse by the addict in relation to the location and/or the context; facilitate one or more actions and/or activities to mitigate the risk, if any, and/or react to a relapse, if any, by the addict. By way of example, the context may include a situation, environment, and/or state of mind of the addict at the location. The context may include why the addict is at the location, who the addict is with at the location, what the addict is doing at the location, when (day/time) the addict is at the location, and/or how the addict got to the location, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">One example embodiment of a method of treating an addict for an addiction includes determining, through one or more communications networks, the location of an addict and the context of the addict at the location, where the context includes a situation, environment, and/or state of mind of the addict; evaluating a risk of relapse by the addict in relation to the location and/or the context; and facilitating one or more actions and/or activities to mitigate the risk, if any, and/or react to a relapse, if any, by the addict. This may be done primarily by determining the location and context of the addict and assessing that data relative to the addict's addiction triggers.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In various exemplary embodiments, a plurality of user devices, sensors, and/or other technologies are provided to protect privacy and security of information collected as disclosed herein. In some exemplary embodiments, experience-based data, including but not limited to location and/or context data, may be used to condition access to protected information. Access to the protected information may be permitted to a permittee based on recognition by the permittee of the experience-based data.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The distinction between location and context and its importance should be noted. The location of a person is often (not always) part of determining a person's broader context. With respect to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, depending on the circumstances of an individual, the location of the person may be most important; in other circumstances, the broader context may be more important. For example, if the methods and/or apparatus described in the present disclosure determine that the best course of action may be to attend a nearby AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) meeting, the specific circumstances of that person at that time may dictate that the addict should attend the nearby AA meeting. In another exemplary embodiment, the methods/apparatus of the present disclosure may determine that for the addict's current situation and addiction inducing trigger level (e.g., anxiety trigger, etc.), the addict should meet a certain person in the addict's support network who also has the same or similar issues (e.g., anxiety and alcoholism etc.) issues at an (e.g., anxiety-related, etc.) meeting that is quite a bit farther away than the addict's current location. Here, the context of the addict is more important than just the addict's location.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments of the present disclosure, addicts can be helped to detect and deal with the triggers that initiate or enhance the craving to indulge in their addiction. There generally are many such triggers, including but not limited to: Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Change, Conflict, Depression, Disorder, Envy (desire to) Escape, Excitement, Extreme Emotions, Fear, Frustration, Guilt, Health problems, Holidays, Hunger, Insomnia, Job issues, Kids/Children, Loneliness, Media (TV, Radio, the Internet) marketing, Mid-Life Crisis, Money problems, Music, Noise, Overconfidence, Peer Pressure, Power, Powerlessness, Proximity (to an addictive substance), (fear of) Quitting, Relationships, Relatives, Reminders, Sex, (change of) Seasons, Smell, Social Situations, Stress, Taste, Times of Day, (being) Tired, (feeling) Not Fun or Unhappy, (feeling) Victimized, Weather, Yelling, and Zeal (high energy). Many addicts are especially vulnerable to relapsing when faced with one or more of these triggers. Some of these triggers have a location dimension to them, most notably proximity to an addiction substance or activity, and many more have a location element in the actions or solutions for dealing with those triggers (and/or high-risk for relapse situations) without relapse. For example, a response to the detection of the Boredom trigger may require the addict to go to a certain place to do a certain activity. Loneliness would involve visiting with or visit by a member of the addict's support network. Noise could require going to a quiet place to meditate, such as a church or library, or to retreat to a serene program on a virtual reality device. This kind of information could be captured in a data profile (e.g., an addict profile including actions to take in relation to the addict, etc.) stored in a database or similar data store.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present disclosure includes various exemplary embodiments of systems and methods that utilize the location and context of an addict and other resources to a) preempt trigger and/or high-risk relapse situations, b) prevent relapse in high-risk situations, and/or c) respond to, manage, and recovery from a relapse when they do occur. Various embodiments include collecting, aggregating, and analyzing addict- and addiction-related data specific to that addict's condition, vulnerabilities, motivations, and usage triggers. Such data/information can be collected from a wide variety of sensors and other data sources, including but not limited to: personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, PDAs, wearables (data collection devices worn on the person, such as Fitbit, etc.), implants, Google Glass, etc.; nearby sensors or devices such as security/video cameras, smart devices (such as smart home-related sensors, etc.), crowdsourcing data collection applications of nearby users, building/store/office Wi-Fi networks, location-sensitive beacons, etc.; and/or extended data collection mechanisms such as road traffic sensors, public video cameras or billboard displays, weather data collection sensors, law enforcement/security-related devices, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Various system and method embodiments according to the present disclosure make use of trigger-based sensor networks and trigger-based support networks that may be tuned or modified so as to collect data potentially related to one or more particular addiction triggers, such as Anger, Frustration, Noise, Social Situations, Stress, Yelling, etc. Such data solely or in combination can identify various high risk (of addiction usage) contexts or relapse situations, circumstances, events, and/or possible mental frame-of-mind/thought processes that often have to be managed to allow the addict the ability to successfully deal with such situations without succumbing to the addiction(s). This managing of such situations may include providing, recommending, and/or injecting actions, activities, resources, recommendations, directions, and/or elements of control into the addict's life on either an ad-hoc, occasional, periodic, and/or (near) continuous manner to help the addict to refrain from their addiction. Management of such situations can be done via a variety of analysis, assessment, and prediction engines and algorithms that anticipate or predict the impact of certain situations, contexts, circumstances, or events on an addict's behavior and overall sobriety and devise and quickly put in place a course of action to minimize the addict's risk of relapse, or failing that, minimizing any resultant harm and damage. Such a course of action may be predominately location-based, meaning using location information as a key part of the course of action, but the present disclosure is not limited to location-based information; key information may well include non-location based elements, particularly the use of sensors that can provide valuable input into understanding the current context of the addict, and actions that may have little or nothing to do with an addict's location (such as the addict calling a family member to discuss his Frustration, for example).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While various aspects of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are targeted at the treatment of addiction, actual addiction is not always involved. As noted, before, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be used for the prevention of addiction, dealing with possible or actual use or misuse of substances and/or activities that can potential be harmful to individuals or groups, or indeed unrelated to any addiction or substance/activity use/misuse at all. In order to utilize and receive the benefits of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a person does not necessarily have to be an addict with an addiction to a substance and/or activity. For example, a person may want to cut back on drinking, for example, even if not physically addicted thereto or even if the person does not drink often. Treatment may refer to any assistance provided in various exemplary embodiments to help an addict and/or others in dealing with the addiction (as described broadly herein) in some form or fashion, and/or for informational purposes. Sober may refer to non-usage of the addiction substance/activity. Relapse may refer to usage of the addiction substance/activity.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may also be applicable to persons and/or situations in a pre-addiction situation or scenario where the substances/activities are merely abused, that is, done more or more often than might be considered acceptable, healthy, or desirable. Thus, various embodiments of the present disclosure may be applicable in relation to persons who may be considered high-risk, such as the children of alcoholics, though no symptoms of addiction exist. Various embodiments of the present disclosure further may be applicable in relation to situations and/or scenarios where person(s) are neither addicted nor considered abuser(s) nor high-risk; rather, they and/or others would like to reduce the usage of a substance or activity to achieve some real or perceived benefit. The above situations/scenarios and other applicable contexts may be generally included under the term addiction, and a person suffering from addiction, abuse, or the general desire to reduce/stop doing some substance and/or activity may also be referred to as an addict. Also, an addiction or addict is not limited to just one substance or activity; many addicts concurrently or serially suffer from more than one addiction (sometimes referred to as dual diagnosis, though it can actually be 2 or more addictions). Various embodiments of the present disclosure can be equally applicable to such persons with multiple addictions, either concurrent or consecutive.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, a distinct set of exemplary embodiments related to prisoner and particularly parolee tracking and monitoring is enabled by the present disclosure. Such tracking and monitoring are currently done by a GPS bracelet attached to the person's ankle or other body part, with their movements then monitored via GPS readings. In situations where GPS does not work or work well, particularly in a building or other structure or environment where GPS does not work, cell tower triangulation is employed to provide a rough calculation. Both have limitations: GPS with its primary use cases of being tracked outdoors, and the inaccuracies associated with cell tower triangulation for indoor situations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Because of these limitations, GPS bracelets in effect determine the type of prisoner/parolee tracking that can be done, limiting the person to a particular area or building. It cannot get more &#x201c;micro&#x201d; than that and/or cannot granularly track the person's location and activities in an indoor environment, which is, however, possible with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, a parolee could be confined to house arrest in a multi-unit apartment or motel due to the enhanced ability to track a person's movements indoors. In addition, activities can be monitored or controlled, such as a person on parole for a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) being prohibited from drinking. The sensors associated with the present disclosure as well as risk calculation algorithms could be used to detect high risk situations where the parolee is about to violate parole, generating various alarms. If the parolee followed through and drank, then exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure would provide the evidence needed to revoke parole.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Context may generally refer to an addict's situation, environment, and/or state-of-mind (e.g., as determined by biometric data, etc.) particularly as it relates to a potential substance abuse relapse. Traditionally in mobile systems, a person's physical location can form a key cornerstone of that person's context&#x2014;and indeed may be all that is needed to determine the person's overall context in many instances. For example, if an alcoholic has stopped at a bar on his way home from work, it typically takes no additional data to infer a high-risk relapse situation and state-of-mind. However, other or additional sensors may be used to confirm and/or refine a person's context. For instance, a light sensor on an addict's device may indicate that the person is still outdoors (perhaps debating himself in the parking lot). A breathalyzer sensor could indicate a relapse&#x2014;that the situation has moved from needing a prevention set of actions to a set of damage control and safety actions. Thus, an addict's location may be considered the entirety of the context (stopped at a bar), part of the context (not yet in the bar), or perhaps even not a key part of the context (e.g., the person is drinking or is drunk, having left the bar, etc.). However, for many if not most embodiments, physical location plays at least a partial role in determining a person's overall context; in addition, the location of support resources very often plays a key role in if and/or how such resources may be employed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In various exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, systems and methods are provided for preempting, anticipating, and/or detecting high risk addiction relapse situations and determining and implementing actions and activities to prevent a relapse from occurring, or in the case of actual relapse minimizing the associated damage and returning the addict to sobriety as soon as possible. Various mechanisms are provided for determining and utilizing an addict's context-particularly location&#x2014;in assessing their risk of relapse and utilize that context as well as the relative locations and contexts of other resources to determine and implement relapse preventative actions. In various exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, location/context-based mechanisms are provided to minimize or contain the consequences in the event that a relapse occurs, as well as mechanisms to preempt and prevent high risk situations from occurring</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At a more granular level, an example communications network includes a plurality of heterogeneous, differing, or different types of sensing devices configured to monitor the location and/or context of an addict; and a plurality of heterogeneous, differing, or different types of interface devices each configured to engage in interaction with the addict, with a support person for the addict, and/or with a third party in the event that the network detects a relationship between the monitored location and/or context and a trigger predetermined in the network for the addict as being related to relapse; wherein the interaction is selected based on the trigger and the monitored location and/or context.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The example communications network may include one or more server, client, cloud, peer-to-peer, and/or other devices configured to develop and/or update a profile of the addict based on monitoring data from the sensing devices and/or the interaction engaged in by one or more of the interface devices.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the above example communications network, one or more of the sensing devices may be configured to detect and/or determine the relationship between the trigger and the monitored location and/or context.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the above example communications network, the sensing devices may be located in, on, and/or near the addict, and/or elsewhere relevant to a current and/or future location/context of the addict.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In various aspects of the present disclosure, a network-implemented method of providing support for an addict includes monitoring the location and/or context of the addict, the monitoring performed by one or more sensing devices; detecting a relationship between the monitored location and/or context and a trigger predetermined in the network for the addict as being related to relapse; and based on the detected relationship, one or more of a plurality of interface devices of the network interacting with the addict, with a support person for the addict, and/or with a third party.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The foregoing example method may include, based on the monitoring, the detecting, the determining, and/or the interacting, developing and/or updating a profile of the addict, the profile including actions to take in relation to the addict.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the foregoing example method, one of the sensing devices may be configured to send the monitored location and/or context and/or the detected relationship to one or more other devices of the network.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the foregoing example method, the sensing devices may be one or more of the following: located in, on, and/or in the vicinity of the addict, mobile, and stationary.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">FIG. 1 is a high-level summary diagram that shows an addict with associated devices, sensors, wearable/embedded tags, and other locatable technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows an exemplary scope of potential people, resources, assets, locations, applications, and data that may be helpful and/or important in helping the addict become and stay sober.

Thus, an addict does not have to be in physical contact with a device for a given exemplary embodiment to work. For example, an associated device could be the use of a drone to shadow an addict's movements, location, and behavior and reporting that information back to analytical engine(s) of the given embodiment.

Included in potential actions are monitoring the location of the addict and the addict's support network for scenarios where one or more support persons may be dispatched to the addict's location, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Such server functionality can be physically and/or logically configured in many forms. It can be centralized in one or more servers. It can be partitioned in a centralized manner such that functionality is split among different servers, such as one server being a communications network front-end for communicating with various addicts, devices, sensors, and other networks, while another server or set of servers does the analysis of the data. It can also be architected in distributed manner such that some or all of the functionality is performed on addict and/or support network devices. It can be architected such that some or all of the functionality is done in the Cloud via various forms of cloud computing. Regardless of physical and/or logical distribution of functionality, it may be described as or referred to as a server unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The server serves as a monitoring, assessing, and controlling function of, for, and/or on behalf of the addict. This could include providing a variety of alerts to various resources that the addict is in a high-risk situation or area. This control could further extend to actions such as disabling the addict's car, informing the addict's addiction sponsor or community members, or alerting family or law enforcement about dangerous situations. Indeed, one example embodiment of the present disclosure provides a form of involuntary monitoring and action coordination, not unlike GPS ankle bracelet monitoring, where an addict on parole for addiction-related offenses (e.g., DUIs, etc.) may have their devices (and even attached sensors such as Blood Alcohol Content sensors) monitored to detect the presence of offending substances and implementing actions to mitigate the risk to the community and the addict themselves.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is the use of multiple location determination technologies or sources <b>101</b> to determine locations of addicts and other persons/places/things. These technologies or sources <b>101</b> include, but are not limited to, sensor networks (e.g., Internet of Things (IOT) <b>101</b><i>a</i>, etc.), GPS/Assisted GPS <b>101</b><i>b</i>, cell tower identification <b>101</b><i>g</i>, cell tower triangulation (TDOA, AFLT), beacons <b>101</b><i>c</i>, Radio Frequency fingerprinting, Real-Time Location Services (RTLS) <b>101</b><i>e</i>, WiFi based location systems <b>101</b><i>f</i>, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based location systems and similar systems, drones <b>101</b><i>d</i>, crowdsourcing, hybrids <b>101</b><i>i</i>, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) <b>101</b><i>h</i>, and/or combinations of these or other location determination systems. These location determination systems may be on, worn or carried by, used by, embedded in, or nearby the addict or addiction-related resource sufficiently to determine approximate location.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Not all aspects of the present disclosure need to be centralized in the addiction server. The addict's local device(s) <b>115</b><i>a </i>may also have functionality as disclosed herein, both for Peer-to-Peer, IoT, Mesh, ZigBee, LPWAN, Star, Client/Server, and/or machine-to-machine (M2M) networking, situations and in circumstances where the addiction server or other parts of the present disclosure are not operating or accessible. An example of this functionality is in the device on/in/around the addict detecting a high-risk situation and the addict attempting to enter and drive a car in an underground garage (thereby preventing a GPS locate). The addict's device would automatically connect with the vehicle's transportation system <b>119</b> (e.g., personal vehicle, friend or colleague's vehicle, transportation service like Uber, airlines, public transportions, etc.) to inform or provide an alert of a high-risk situation and proceeding to disable the car. Indeed, many, even all of the server's functions could conceivably be done in one or more of the addict's device(s) or in other computing/data processing architectures such as cloud computing; a centralized server is a convenient/logical way to represent many of the present disclosure's functions, but not inherently necessary to its overall functionality. For example, the risk/prediction engine part of the server could easily be resident on the addict's device(s)(client). Indeed, in one exemplary embodiment, many or even all functions could be resident and/or controlled on the client.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Similarly, not all devices that can be used are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Devices <b>115</b><i>a </i>that can be associated with the addict include but are not limited to portable devices such as mobile phones/smartphones, tablets, laptops, other portable or mobile devices, etc.; wearable devices and tags on or in clothing, jewelry, shoes, watches, etc.; mobile payment devices/wallets, etc.; embedded sensors, tags, chips or other electronics that can be implanted or ingested (e.g., ingestibles or implantables, etc.) in an addict, augmented reality and heads-up-displays (e.g., Google Glass, etc.) and virtual reality-enabling systems. Fixed or mobile/fixed hybrid devices <b>115</b><i>b </i>such as desktop computers and smart home connected devices that can also be associated with the identity and/or location addict are also part of aspects of some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows additional examples of smart home connected devices <b>115</b><i>b </i>including a TV, refrigerator, and microwave. As more and more devices become smart, the smart device will have the ability to capture data that will help determine a person's location/context through onboard or connected data capture devices such as video, audio, and/or other sensors. Combined with the device's known location (or ability to determine the device's location), and the connectivity associated with communicating to and from these devices (also known as the Internet of Things or IoT), these devices/networks may provide new key sources of personal context information.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also discloses a variety of location and categories useful in a wide variety of embodiments, not limited to the addict, support resources, or even enforcement resources. One key concept can be to utilize these varieties of location types and categories in a variety of ways in supporting the above resources. These include, but are not limited to:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0084">Base Locations <b>121</b> including common locations for the addict, such as home, work, school, or church, etc.;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0085">Frequent Locations <b>122</b> including locations frequented often by the addict, such as homes of friends or family, stores, restaurants, malls, gym, hobbies, etc.;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0086">High Risk Areas, Events, Locations <b>123</b>, such as liquor stores, casinos, concerts, drug-dealing areas that could pose a temptation for the addict, bad peers, trigger activating situations, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0087">Sanctuary Areas, Events, Locations <b>124</b> where an addict might feel safe and have a very low temptation to use, such as AA meetings, churches, key/safe friends and family members, dry public areas or events;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0088">Virtual Locations <b>125</b> including online forums, such as Facebook, Twitter, Women for Sobriety, therapy sites/sessions, Virtual Reality Locations, addiction communities where an addict can involve him or herself safely (without using) in an online activity. This includes the use of virtual and/or augmented reality to put oneself in a different (safer) location, context, and/or frame-of-mind.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0085" num="0089">While location is most often a key distinguishing characteristic, context can also be important, particularly for support network members. Just having a support person nearby in time of trouble is not enough, the person needs to be available, interested, and in a position (e.g., situation/context) that he/she can break away from whatever they are doing to help the addict. Thus context-determining sensors and other mechanisms can be important not only to the addict but the support network as well.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0090">Put another way, Base Locations are where the addict is frequently, such as Home, Work, or School. Frequent Locations are where the addict frequently visits such as family and friends, the addict's gym, frequently visited stores or restaurants, and various hobby locations such as a bowling alley. High-Risk Locations are another element used in various embodiments, to track possible high-risk areas for the addict with both fixed locations (such as liquor stores, casinos) and varying locations (such as recent drug-activity areas). Opposite these high-risk locations would be Sanctuary Locations, where the addict will presumably be especially safe from high-risk situations, such as an AA meeting or church service. The use of Virtual Locations is also disclosed, used when an addict is logged into and/or viewing a service like Facebook or Twitter or is using Virtual Reality devices such that the addict is on those applications and can be contacted or otherwise influenced by those applications.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0091">These location categories have a wide range of uses. They can be an integral part of action determination when relapse risk is high, by finding the closest Sanctuary Location, for example, and arranging for a nearby support person to meet the addict there, including providing each of them directions via their navigation application based on their current location. High-risk locations of course are to be avoided, but this can be done in many ways. They can be omitted from navigation applications (de-augmented) to prevent temptations. Geo-fences can be setup around them such that when the addict enters one, automatic alerts are sent to nearby support persons to give them a heads up to possibly prepare for an interception. Indeed, geo-fences can play an important role in various embodiments, e.g., in risk prediction (e.g., if a high-risk location geo-fence is violated then risk score goes up by 20%, etc.), support resource identification (alert people within 10 miles of the addict when X occurs), and context setting (e.g., locations with walking distance of home-half a mile&#x2014;are considered safe/home location), etc. If an addict is within 1000 feet/5 minutes of a park, then a walking/running excursion can be added to a list of potential actions. And so on. Virtual locations can also have a wide range of uses, e.g., special Reddit groups, as could quasi virtual/physical locations such as safe zones for Anxiety sufferers within the broadcasting distance of a coffee-shop beacon, that provides for virtual or physical meetings of sufferers only within range of the beacon.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0092">In various embodiments, a variety of sensors, devices, and mechanism, may be used to determine the location and particularly the context of the addict. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, describes a device <b>200</b> an addict might have on their person (e.g., a smartphone, etc.), wear (e.g., in the form of a watch), have implanted, or otherwise be on or near an addict. This device <b>200</b> could contain a variety of sensors <b>212</b>, such as sensors that detect and capture sounds, images, video, or body conditions. for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides a detailed (but not exhaustive) list of such sensors <b>212</b>, including Blood Pressure sensors, Breathalyzers, Blood Alcohol Content sensors, Environmental/Weather sensors, Skin Temperature sensors, Olfactory (smell) sensors, Bio/gestation sensors, Vestibular sensors, Kinesthetic sensors, and Sight/Vision/Optical sensors to name a few. Other sensors may also be used including sensors for Water Quality/Pressure, Chemical/Gas/Fire/Smoke/CO2/Flood, Level, Gyroscope, (Passive) Infrared, Eddy current, contact, Ultrasonic, Images, Alarm, Doppler; Fiber Optic, Occupancy, Reed, Touch Switch, Magnetic, Inductive, Microwave, Radiation, Parking, etc.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0093">The use of these various sensors can be to aid in the detection and/or determination of the addict's context, e.g., what the addict is experiencing, feeling, even thinking, etc. Even further, to the extent possible individually or in combination with other sensors and/or data, the goal of such sensor use can be to detect/determine what trigger(s) the addict may be experiencing, and to what degree, in order to gauge the risk of relapse and factors involved in the potential relapse, and to identify and set in movement a course of actions that will preempt or prevent an addict's environment from deteriorating to the point of relapse.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> discloses one such device(s) <b>200</b> that can sense, monitor, and/or control aspects of an addict's context. The device <b>200</b> includes an array of capabilities, including sensors for detecting or anticipating addiction trigger conditions (e.g., contexts, situations, circumstances, environments, and/or state of mind(s) that may cause the addict to relapse or use substances or activities related to his/her addiction, etc.); mechanisms for interfacing with the addict including tangible/tactile Interfaces <b>201</b> (Display, Lights, Sound, Vibration, Heat, Smell, etc.). For example, a Smell Interface could generate the smell of fresh pine trees or pine tar in response to high risk associated with the Escape trigger being detected (helping remind the addict of good times he has had when hiking in the Rocky Mountains). The wide variety of interfaces is premised that dissemination of information to/from an addict needs to be in the most effective means possible at any given time or context, which can vary from day-to-day or hour-to-hour. In addition to traditional interfaces such as sound or vibration interfaces, some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure include the ability to project (or interface to a projector) 2 or 3 dimensional images, video, GIFs, or real-time holographic projections that the addict can converse with. It also includes the ability to augment reality (insertion of images not actually present), and even (de) augmenting reality, such as the elimination of addiction triggers/temptations such as liquor stores from the addict's vision.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a partial list of a variety of sensors that can be used to determine the addict's context. These sensors can be used individually, in combination, and/or with other information about the addict, environment, situation, circumstance to determine the addict's context, as well as determine if there are any triggers being activated or in the process of doing so. Simple examples include using acoustic sensors to detect the volumes and type of sounds in an addict's vicinity, to potentially identify triggers such as Noise (e.g., too high or low volume, etc.), Children (e.g., detecting high-pitched voices and/or multiple children, etc.), or Social Situations (e.g., multiple voices in the background, etc.).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0096">The addict's device <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be configured to serve as a local controller of information of, in, and around the addict. Towards that end it is, to the extent possible, self-reliant and contained in how it collects, processes, and disseminates data-based and physically based actions. To begin with, it provides a set of tangible/tactile interfaces for interacting with the addict, under the assumption that having good preventative actions is only part of the battle-such actions must be presented in a manner acceptable/receptive by the addict. Very often this is dependent on the context of the addict; for example, at night an addict may be most receptive to audio-based messages, while in the day he or she may be most receptive to visual-based actions. In public places the addict may not want either, but instead be physically pulsed/shocked/vibrated/or heated to remind them they are increasing their risk of relapse for example (one addiction reality is that many relapses are not deliberate, meaning they are a culmination of smaller, even innocent-seeming behaviors that rapidly culminate in a relapse situation before the addict was even aware they were in danger. Small shocks or other physical cues can help wake up the addict early in the process and stop the danger before it starts to build out-of-control).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0097">The device <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has a variety of capabilities to be self-sufficient and help monitor/manage/control the addict. The device <b>200</b> has a Locator Unit <b>202</b> that has or interfaces to a variety of location determination technologies (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi, CID, Beacon, TDOA, etc.). The device <b>200</b> has at least one CPU <b>203</b> and associated memory, storage, and calculating circuitry, hardware, and software, to do data collection, analysis, and decision making. The device <b>200</b> has specialty processing and display/interfacing capabilities for managing such capabilities as virtual reality, (de)augmentation, holograms <b>204</b><i>a</i>, device effects controller <b>204</b><i>b</i>, and robotics <b>204</b><i>c</i>. The device <b>200</b> has a mechanism <b>210</b> for detecting and interfacing with other nearby devices to extend its sensor/data collection capabilities (for example, tapping into a nearby security camera to see the addict's surrounding environment). The device <b>200</b> has an onboard medical controller <b>207</b> that can interface/integrate with attached and/or embedded devices or physical wraps, wearables, implants, and/or drug dispensers, in order to&#x2014;if needed&#x2014;suddenly inject or offer for immediate consumption an addiction treatment drug. The device <b>200</b> has a User Interface detector <b>208</b> that can tie into nearby systems if such systems are deemed advantageous for delivering a message (for example, broadcasting the message over a car's stereo system while it is playing a song (e.g., interrupting the song), instead of ineffectually playing on the addict's phone). The device <b>200</b> has a digital assistant and/or interface to a digital assistant for managing the addict's day-to-day, hour-to-hour schedule. The device has a self-contained module for storing and managing the addict's triggers (particularly useful if the addict is cut off from the broader system). The device has an onboard manager for all the myriad of sensors and tags on or nearby the addict so such data can be analyzed locally. Similarly, the device has a beacon interface/manager <b>209</b><i>c </i>to transmit/receive information from local beacons. More broadly, the device <b>200</b> has the capability of determining context locally, particularly in its ability <b>210</b> to tie into local networking connections such as Wi-Fi, RFID, RTLS, Bluetooth, peer-to-peer, Internet of Things, mesh/ZigBee, security systems, and other local-oriented networks. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the device <b>200</b> may be configured for connection and communication with companion technologies, such as imbedded/inserted/attached addict data/tag/devices <b>260</b>, support network devices and/or applications <b>270</b>, nearby cameras, video streaming, beacons, sensors, context data sources <b>280</b> (e.g., cars, buildings, people, specialty information broadcasts, etc.), sensor arrays <b>290</b>, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, devices, and/or networks <b>295</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>), etc.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0098">Other capabilities include an SOS button <b>211</b> or similar mechanism that the addict can push/activate when he or she is feeling particularly vulnerable to relapse, which will in turn activate other portions, aspects or features disclosed herein. The device <b>200</b> also includes mechanisms for causing various levels of physical pain or discomfort (called a reinforcer <b>206</b>) and/or pleasure, such as a sharp stinging sensation or warm/caressing sensation, that can be used to reinforce or dissuade certain behaviors, with the intention of preventing such behaviors and/or associating addiction-related behaviors or contexts with the pain or discomfort. The device also has a variety of identity verification/privacy protection mechanisms for protecting and if need be, disabling the device and preventing anyone from accessing the data on the device. There are also user-controllable/definable capabilities on the device, either programmable or insertable such as SIM-like add-on sensors.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0099">The above does assume an all-in-one device for such capabilities. Such capabilities could be spread across multiple devices on and/or near the addict. Example of these device extensions are specialized addiction-related wearable and implantable devices that focus extensively or exclusively on detecting and reporting certain addiction-related conditions, not unlike today's Fitbit, such as bracelets that do double duty as a fashion accessory and blood pressure and skin temperature monitor. These readings could be prompted by and/or received by the Addict Monitor/Controller (AMC) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or the extended device could do self-contained monitoring of those conditions and alert the AMC when they reach a concerning level. Smartphones with embedded alcohol detection sensors is another example. These addiction-specialty devices could continually monitor addiction-related conditions which could then send alerts and data (including location data) to the addiction server when conditions warrant. Such device extensions could include permanent devices not unlike today's parolee GPS monitoring ankle bracelets. A similar form could allow such actions as court-ordered alcohol use monitoring for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) offenders, or even voluntary usage by persons committed to beating their addiction but needing extra external discipline to achieve it.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0100">In fact, the use in Parolee Tracking and Monitoring Systems is an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure in at least two respects. The first addresses the limitation that current GPS-based ankle bracelets have in tracking and monitoring parolees and other prisoners, and that is its limited effectiveness inside a building. GPS does not work well inside buildings or in other contexts where there are obstructions between the bracelet and the GPS satellites, such as trees or metal containers, etc. Exemplary embodiments may utilize a variety of location-determination technologies and methods to monitor the location of the parolee. It then goes further to monitor the behavior of the parolee.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0101">Of course, the devices and associated sensors and capabilities are only effective if they are actually powered on. It is an unfortunate fact of addiction life that many don't want to become sober, or at least feel they can be so without any outside help. In any event, it is assumed there will be the temptation to tamper with/otherwise disable such monitoring devices and includes the ability to determine which addict-related devices are active (powered on and in the proximity of the addict) and which are the primary one(s) in use at any given place and time, via monitoring of usage as well as determining which device(s) are in the best position/proximity to monitor the addict's behavior, risks, and actions. This is important as well in general context determination, as people are trending towards having multiple devices, only some of which are actively on or near the person at any given time. In particular, it may be important to determine the primary device when determining what the best interface is for communicating with an addict at any given time.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0102">The above capabilities can be packaged in a variety of form factors, ranging from being worn on the wrist or neck to glasses form to even implants.

The security and privacy of this data is protected in various embodiments, as the potential for abuse is huge given that in some instances an addict's location and context may be tracked nearly 24/7 at times. In addition, the social and professional stigma of addiction remains huge in our society, and many-even most-addicts greatly prefer their affliction remain private. Accordingly, a variety of systems and methods are provided for addressing such considerations, including but not limited to limiting the length of time data is stored, physically distributing the data among different databases including having location/super localized, context-specific, and/or trigger-specific data stores, invitation-only data access methods, time-limited networking, and encrypting and/or anonymizing such data so it is very difficult if not impossible to link addiction-related data to a specific addict identity. Such protections may include unusual protection mechanisms such as location selective availability coding (deliberately introducing errors into location calculations) or &#x201c;nuclear football&#x201d; keys where the codes for unlocking/decrypting data change daily and/or under physical protection (e.g., not stored where it can be hacked online).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0112">In various embodiments, a learning engine is provided that utilizes artificial intelligence and other learning algorithms and methods to learn from an addict's behavior and to refine various systems, algorithms, and processes, such as an addict's likelihood of relapse, effectiveness of actions taken, and types and frequency of data collected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example process for assessing an addict's risk of relapse and determining potential actions and support resources, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> providing more detail on how such an assessment could occur, and how the assessment algorithm may be modified as more data points about the addict's behavior become available.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0113">By way of an example relating to an addict's Anger trigger, an initial approach to detecting an Anger condition may initially be based solely on blood pressure (e.g., a spike in blood pressure is indicative of anger). However, learning mechanisms disclosed herein may find that for a particular addict the correlation between a spike in blood pressure and an anger condition is low. Instead, the mechanism may determine that the addict's anger is immediately preceded in a rapid rise in skin temperature, and is exacerbated when loud noises (e.g., yelling, etc.) is in the immediate vicinity. Thus, the addict's anger-related sensor readings will change from monitoring blood pressure to monitoring skin temperature and noise levels.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0114">Indeed, various embodiments provide leveraging of numerous data sets about, related-to, or of potential value to the addict, and the use of data analytics, algorithms, and analysis engines to aggregate, compile, assess, analyze, synthesize, and otherwise bring together disparate pieces of information (many location-related) that can be used in the addict's treatment. Data/data sets can include but are not limited to information regarding the addict's medical history, personal profile (e.g., friends, hobbies, etc.), schedule/calendar information, historical data (often location-based) that describes past actions and behaviors, key enablers (people/places/things that can aggravate the addiction), key usage triggers, and sources of addiction (e.g., liquor stores, drug dealers)/Points of Interest (e.g., bars, casinos) that the addict has been known to frequent and/or has demonstrated vulnerability to in the past. Such information could be obtained in many ways, including but not limited to directly from: the addict (e.g., questionnaires, etc.), the addict's support network, friends and family, medical data, historical behavioral data, public records, news media, social media, school records, etc. The communications links used to obtain this information can include, but are not limited to, the Internet, wireless and wireline networks, cloud sources, crowdsources, peer-to-peer networking, sensor networks, machine-to-machine networking, smart homes/neighborhoods, and electrical-grid based networks.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0115">Such data sets and other information may be analyzed on multiple levels using analytics that include but are not limited to a Usage Trigger, Potential Response Analyzer, Risk Prediction Algorithms, and an Action/Coordination Engine (many of these concepts are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the Addict Data and Analytics and used implicitly or explicitly in many of the Figures). The Usage Trigger and Potential Response Analyzer takes as inputs the addict's usage triggers (defined by techniques such as questionnaires or psycho-therapy), and the addict's personal profile and schedule/calendar, as well as historical information about the addict's movements, actions, behaviors, and hobbies, to develop a risk assessment and prediction algorithms about the addict's vulnerabilities to future potential addiction-related situations and develop a series of potential responses. Risk Prediction Algorithms utilize information about the addict's current situation/location/context, addiction triggers, and historical behavioral data to develop a risk score, rating, or level (score) for the addict. If the risk assessment score reaches or exceeds a threshold, and/or falls within a certain range, the Action Coordination Engine will develop an action or course of action that will then be launched, such as contacting members of the addict's support network, rearranging the addict's navigation (away from high-risk locations), or disabling the addict's vehicle and arranging for alternative transportation, as a few examples.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0116">In various embodiments, an action/coordinating engine (based on the Addiction Server, one or more of the Addict's devices, via a cloud, or some combination) is provided to coordinate various actions on behalf of or in the interest of the addict. This action/coordination engine (action engine), the use of which is illustrated in several drawings in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>6</b>A, <b>7</b>, and <b>7</b>A</figref>), is responsible for identifying, determining, and/or managing a variety of actions that the addict, the addict's support network, or others can take on behalf of the addict, usually in response the detection of a relapse risk or actual relapse situation. Such actions could be automatic in nature, such as the engine directing the addict to move to a sanctuary location for example, such as a nearby AA meeting getting ready to start, in response to a high-risk alert generated in various embodiments. An action could be more of a coordination function, such as coordinating a meeting between the addict and a nearby addict sport person at a nearby meeting in an hour, action could include interfacing with the meeting place (e.g., restaurant) reservation system, as well as identifying nearby available parking, and providing instructions to the addict's and the support person's cars to activate the self-parking application once in range. This is an example of communicating/coordinating with a variety of third-party applications and services that will make the action(s) go as smoothly and hassle/aggravation-free as possible, as a key to resolving high-relapse risk situation without relapse is often to the addict in as a tranquil, trouble-free mindset as possible.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0117">Other actions include obtaining alternative transportation for the addict, modifying navigation applications to avoid areas where addictions can be enabled (such as liquor stores for an alcoholic), and/or posting on social media that the addict is in a high-risk situation. Note not all actions may be reactive, or reactive only to only high-risk or in-progress relapse situations. The action engine may manage the selection and communications of daily morning motivation messages to the addict or perform an alert reminder function to one of the addict's support persons reminding him do to his weekly Friday call to the addict.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0118">An often underappreciated and overlooked aspect of successful addiction treatment is the use of rewards mechanisms associated with good or desirable behavior. While addiction outsiders often take the attitude that avoiding the destructive aspects of addiction should be motivation enough for an addict to get and stay sober, the reality is that for many addicts that is not enough. Indeed, the destructive aspects of addiction get progressively less of concern to many addicts the longer they are addicted. However, the prospect of a reward for good behavior (not relapsing) can have a very stimulating/powerful effect on some addicts-thus, various embodiments provide a method and apparatus for detecting/determining good behavior and rewarding such behavior. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a rewards mechanism is provided under the presumption that many addicts' need a positive-enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to relapse. For example, engaging in good behavior such as avoiding trigger aggravating locations and contexts earns points, as does attending (in person or virtually) addiction community meetings. The points accumulate and can periodically be redeemed for (usually) addiction-related goods and services, such as passes to (non-alcohol serving) movie theaters or deep discount coupons for safe hobbies such as gym memberships or sewing supplies. In contrast, risky behaviors such as visiting with bad friends (friends that very actively drink for example) could results in points being deducted.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0119">More broadly, various embodiments include rewards for behavior that inhibits or prevents addiction usage/relapse (e.g., good behavior), and/or behavior that specifically avoids relapse or the possibility of relapse (e.g., bad behavior). While ideally the addict will be self-motivating in his/her desire to get sober, the reality is that many if not most addicts need some sort of external motivation and reinforcement-both positive and negative&#x2014;to get and particularly stay sober. Thus, a sobriety rewards program can be an integral part of various embodiments. For example, the addict may accrue reward points when he or she spends time in a new (good) hobby, or exercises for at least 30 minutes a day. Similarly, points may be earned if the addict does not go near vulnerable locations such as high drug areas, bad friends, or liquor stores for at least 30 days. An example embodiment would detect and track these good behaviors through functionality disclosed herein and/or data obtained from interfacing with other applications and devices used by the addict or his/her support network. Rewards could be in many forms, such as points redeemable for goods and services, discounts on using an embodiment of the present disclosure or related applications, free tickets to an event (presumably but not necessarily safe events), or even direct cash credits to their bank account or mobile pay account. Note a further feature of the present disclosure may be to detect/prevent the use of any financial transaction for the purchase of substances negatively related to the addict's addiction. Thus, purchases from liquor stores would be detected and rejected via interfaces with the addict's financial accounts and transaction enablers, e.g., credit/debit cards, mobile pay, and bank accounts, etc. Similarly, credits could be posted to these accounts. Credits could be selectively posted for good behaviors, such as paying for new hobbies, free Uber rides, etc. Similarly, bad (or not good) behavior could result in points/financial deductions from the addict. In one example embodiment, a reward engine would determine the applicability and value of such behaviors, track such additions/deductions, and coordinate with addict-related third-party accounts.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0120">Not all motivation-enhancers will be rewards-oriented; some need to be encouragement-oriented. This would include words-of-encouragement, testimonials, thoughts-for-the-day, and other types of motivation or self-esteem building messages. Thus, various embodiments provide ways of detecting when such messages would be particularly timely, selecting appropriate messages, and delivering them to the addict at the appropriate time, context, and using the best method for encouraging the addict to get on/stay on the path to sobriety. For example, an embodiment of the present disclosure may determine that the addict is susceptible to the Time-of-Day trigger, when he/she particularly desires drinking at 5 p.m. every day. Starting at 4:30, motivational messages and testimonials may be sent every 15 minutes, such as &#x201c;life is short&#x2014;make the most of it!&#x201d; This could be sent using any number of methods, including text, MMS, email, (pre-recorded) phone call, internet/(private) social media, and other methods. The embodiment could also automatically create rotating schedule reminders to (random or previously selected) various members of the addict's support network so that those members could connect real-time with the addict to offer words of encouragement during these vulnerable times-of-day.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0121">Sometimes actions require more than a positive reinforcement-orientation, meaning a more urgent, aggressive approach may be needed. One such scenario could involve the detecting of the addict relapsing while at a bar and having driven himself there. The addiction server will have monitored the addict's smartphone for example, showing that both it and the addict's car have been following the same path and has stopped at a local bar. Sensors on the addict's clothing will have detected the presence of alcohol, and other sensors noting a risk in blood pressure and blood alcohol content. Such data may cause the Risk/Prediction engine to generate a very high alert&#x2014;addict has been drinking. If no addict support person is in the immediate vicinity to come get the addict, the action engine may elevate the urgency and send signals to the addict's vehicle that disables it (an alternative would be putting it into self-driving mode if such option was available). Concurrent with disabling the call would be requesting an Uber/taxi ride dispatched to the bar, with an alert to the addict that such a ride has been arranged for, with the details showing on the addict's smartphone screen. To make it clear that the addict needs to get into the taxi, the action engine may also inform the addict that one of his support networks will be meeting the taxi at his home in 30 minutes, and he is expected to show at that time. Since this meeting would be considered a penalty meeting, the addict will lose points from his sobriety program if he is not punctual.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0122">Numerous communications methods to/from the addict and other resources are used in various embodiments of the present disclosure. These can include (but are not limited to) text/SMS/MMS, voice calls, email, social media, video, peer-to-peer and machine-to-machine communications, instant messaging, voice messaging/mail, 3rd party applications, heads-up-displays (such as Google Glass), hologram projections, and other applicable voice and data methods and mediums. For example, the server may alert via text someone in the addict's support network that the addict is nearby and should be contacted because of a detection of a high-risk situation. The support person may send the addict an MMS with an uplifting message, and also send an invite to the addict via a 3rd party application to meet him at a local restaurant at a certain time. The addict could respond with an instant message thanking the support person and accept the invitation via the 3rd party app along with a note that the addict will be approximately 15 minutes late. The support acknowledges this via a return text but hits an option on his device to instruct the addiction server to increase the location monitoring of the addict to detect if he/she takes a relapse-type action (such as stopping at a liquor store). These real-time updates may be transmitted to the support person in the support person's car system display/voice system or augmented reality sunglasses on the way to the restaurant, so he/she knows exactly what the addict has been doing since the original alert was issued.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0123">As introduced above, a key element present in many embodiments of the present disclosure is the use of location technology such as mobile devices and associated GPS or other location determination technology to track or monitor the location of the addict. The addict's location can be continually, periodically, occasionally, or on an ad-hoc basis compared to numerous other individuals and/or data sources to provide location-related assistance to the addict in continuing his treatment or in avoiding succumbing to the temptation of his or her addiction.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0124">Another feature or aspect of the present disclosure is the use of unaugmented reality technology. Instead of inserting objects into an addict's environment (such as a Pokemon character), instead an exemplary embodiment includes performing a continuous, real-time or otherwise timely monitoring of the addict's environment, detecting threatening objects such as advertisements for alcohol, and blanking out or otherwise hiding or obstructing the addict's ability to perceive such threatening objects. This could range from removing such objects from a navigation screen (such as liquor stores) to actual blanking or replacing said object within a Google Glass or Snapchat Spectacles or other Virtual Reality interface.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0125">Another feature or aspect of the present disclosure is the development and use of risk scores of relapses or other adverse treatment situation. Such scores could be in the form of a number (like credit scores), a high/medium/low designation, color schemes (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, etc.), and other scoring and/or range classifications (scores). Such risk scores could be for a variety of risk types: general risks, situation-specific, location-related, and/or date/time or date/time-range specific risks, among others. An embodiment would develop these risk assessments/scores using data/data sets but not limited to the addict's medical history, personal profile (friends, hobbies, etc.), schedule/calendar information, historical behavior data (often location-based) that describes past actions and behaviors, key enablers (people/places/things that can aggravate the addiction), key usage triggers as described above, and sources of addiction (e.g., liquor stores, drug dealers)/Points of Interest (e.g., bars, casinos) that the addict has been known to frequent and/or has demonstrated vulnerability to in the past.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0126">Such scores would be developed/calculated continuously, periodically, ad-hoc, or on-demand, as well as when certain individual conditions are detected by various devices and/or combination of conditions, as well as device-independent conditions. An example of a device-independent condition would if it were detected by external data sources that the addict was facing a heavy traffic jam on his usual route home at the usual time. Knowing from his trigger profile that this situation could activate the Anger trigger (e.g., road rage), the Risk Assessment Engine would calculate a high-risk score. This score, in turn, may be used in various other aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0127">Taken together, various implementations of the present disclosure could monitor the location of people in an addict's support network-such as social workers or their sponsor in an addiction treatment program&#x2014;to have them alerted and ready to stand by to assist the addict if the addict appears to be heading into a difficult situation, such as physically meeting an alcoholic if they appear to be in danger of entering a bar. To detect this kind of scenario, the addict's location may be compared to other data sources of potentially dangerous locations such as bars or liquor stores (for alcohol addiction), known drug-trafficking areas (for drug addiction), casinos (gambling addiction), shopping malls (shopping addiction), and so on. If it appears that the addict is possibly going to enter a dangerous situation or area, the nearest person (to either the addict or the place in question) in their support network can be alerted to intervene.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0128">In various exemplary embodiments, integration and coordination are provided with the addict's medical and psychological status and prognosis. Medical and psychologist/psychiatrists can embrace various embodiments as providing ways to monitor real-time the progress of their addiction patients, as well as provide near real-time/real-time adjustments to medications. For example, an embodiment, in monitoring addict with an embedded naltrexone dispenser, may start detecting high-risk behavior. The example embodiment could inform the addict's psychiatrist of this behavior, who then may decide that the medicine will need to be increased in dosage. The embodiment would interface to the service/application controlling the embedded naltrexone, e.g., either remote or attached/embedded with the dispenser, increasing the dosage, all potentially in real or near-real time, or as otherwise directed by the addict's medical professionals.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0129">More broadly, this may entail obtaining or otherwise receiving access to an addict's treatment records, providing updates to those records, and interacting with rehabilitation, therapy, and/or medical providers. It may also entail acquiring access to pharmaceutical/drug treatment prescription information and being able to administer through the addict's controller device real-time modifications to drugs administered through the controller.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0130">Such an embodiment could also be used by rehab professionals, in monitoring compliance of addicts under active treatment, during those periods where the addict is in a halfway house or similar situation, where the addict is no longer being closely monitored by rehab personnel, but it is desired to see if the addict can manage by oneself in a somewhat controlled situation. The example embodiment may monitor the addicts attached/embedded devices as well as other behavior to detect out-of-desired norm conditions or positive (&#x201c;good&#x201d;) behavior which will then provide additional data towards release of the addict from treatment.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0131">Some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure include the use of crowd sourcing in generating and disseminating addiction-coping ideas and actions. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> an addict enters a room where an &#x201c;open&#x201d; beacon is placed as part of a real-time location services (RTLS) network. In addition to providing location help, the beacon also serves as a repository for addiction-related ideas only for those people who are &#x201c;tuned&#x201d; to that beacon, such as a special ID and/or application that enables a one or two-way communication between the addict and the beacon. This could be, for example, only for alcoholics, only for addicts with the Anxiety trigger, and only accessible if the addict is in physical communications range with the beacon. The addict could download ideas for dealing with Anxiety for example, including specific ideas relevant for that specific location. Alternatively, the addict could upload uplifting messages such as praising the locale for its calming environment. It could even be used to identify and connect addicts with similar triggers that are in range of the beacon at that time, thus allowing ad hoc, spontaneous, unscheduled, or flash interactions not otherwise possible or likely. In effect, this would enable very specialized, private ad-hoc meetings or linkups between two or more addicts suffering from similar issues, in a safe, public yet private, anonymized environment</p><p id="p-0128" num="0132">As noted before, helping the addict avoid relapse into their addiction is not necessarily voluntary. Several of the embodiments of the present disclosure are predicated on providing help to the addict without their advanced knowledge and/or permission. In various embodiments, no assumptions are made regarding the legality of such assistance, but it is presumed that the embodiment includes acquiring permissions from/for the addict, either directly or via parental/court-ordered ones on behalf of the addict.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0133">One example embodiment of an involuntary use is tracking of the mobile device(s) of an alcohol-related court offender. An extension of GPS device tracking for parolees, the embodiment could continually track the movements of a court-ordered person who is required to attend AA meetings and/or stay away from any alcohol establishments. The embodiment would correlate the person's movements and report back to the court or parole officer to confirm adherence to the court order, or alternatively provide proof of violation of the order. In extreme cases, an embodiment could be configured to report directly to the local police any situation where addict impairment is detected, along with necessary information to apprehend the addict, e.g., location of the addict/vehicle.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0134">Various embodiments provide insertion, to the extent possible and appropriate, of inspirations, testimonials, motivational messages, and other positive (or deterring) information into an addict's daily life. What messages/information this would include would depend on the addict's location and/or context, in order to maximize their appropriateness and effect. A common theme throughout many of the embodiments is the use of these kinds of messages. The &#x201c;delivery&#x201d; of such can come in many forms-again geared to maximizing the ability for the addict to pay attention to and assimilate such messages-through the appropriate interfaces as well as third party applications such as social media, twitter, Facebook, snapchat, etc.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0135">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide monitoring of an addict's physical and mental condition through the use of sensors, such as wearable ones of even medical sensors embedded in the addict's body. These sensors can be monitored to detect conditions of particular danger or vulnerability to the addict, such as a spike in blood pressure that could be indicative of the addict becoming angry. If this trigger is detected, a message could be sent to the nearest person in the support network to alert them and have them contact the addict to arrange a calming meeting. Alternatively, if there is no one nearby, an embodiment could then interface with other medical delivery systems attached or embedded in the addict to deliver a tranquilizer or dose of a craving-inhibiting drug or other medical treatment. Similar actions could be taken with implants, prosthetics, or other artificial body/brain parts.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0136">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide minimizing of the extent of and damage from a relapse of the addiction. This could include the detection (such as via sensors, mobile device, or support network) that the addict has relapsed. This relapse once detected may set off a chain of events such as locking or disabling the addict's personal or work transportation if he/she gets within 100 feet of it; to automatically call a taxi or Uber-type service if the addict is in need of transportation (facilitated by accessing the addict's schedule and relapse contingency management instructions); to alert as appropriate portions of the addict's support network; alert family that the addict has &#x201c;used&#x201d; and is under-the-influence (for substance addiction); if appropriate automatically lock-out the addict from certain houses/buildings if the addict comes within a certain range; to alert school officials if the relapsed addict is detected with a certain distance of their children's schools; even to alert law enforcement (and his lawyers) if a breach of a restraining order is imminent.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0137">Indeed, there are many transportation-related embodiments related to the present disclosure. As numerous studies show that a high percentage of violent crimes (and of course other crimes such as drunk driving) occur under the influence of alcohol or other substances, there would be many scenarios under which transportation would play a key role if impairment of the addict is detected or suspected. These could include involvement of the addict's friends or family (e.g., automatic programing of a driverless car to take the addict to their house), ex-girlfriends/spouses (preventing driving to their location(s), addict's support networks (routing those persons to the addict), even law enforcement (routing law enforcement to the addict's location).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0138">As the above scenarios illustrate, the civil liberties, privacy, and/or security of an addict are considerations to be taken into account in various embodiments. Accordingly, in various embodiments, a privacy engine is provided that determines the conditions under which the addict's location/context can or cannot be disclosed or used. In most situations, the privacy engine may be under the control of and/or entail the acquisition of the approval of the addict. For example, the addict may &#x201c;pre-approve&#x201d; an embodiment in which a car is disabled or re-programmed in the event that usage is suspected. Many addicts who admit they have an addiction and are trying to become sober will agree to such conditions. They may recognize that that kind of monitoring and control mechanisms would serve as effective deterrents. In various embodiments, a privacy engine may prevent override of previous deterrence approvals in contexts where the privacy engine detects usage/abuse. But similar to parolee GPS ankle bracelets, the addict may not have control over the privacy engine in some exemplary embodiments. Instead, it may be under the control of a parole officer, medical professional, or other responsible party (for the latter, for example, the addict may sign power of control over to a trusted family member).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0139">In various embodiments, various differing privacy levels and other control mechanisms may be provided through multiple administration/authorization levels. For example, an addict may have one level of access, and an administrator can have a second, higher-level of access to control/override the addict's choices. There may also be additional levels of admin/control such that someone such as parole officer or medical professional may manage multiple addict's profiles with the same user login information. Although the typical control over any one user's privacy may be controlled by only one individual at a time, it is conceivable that multiple persons may have concurrent control, such as a parole officer and a medical professional.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0140">There may also be the opportunity to anonymize people involved in various embodiments. Not only may there be times when an addict desires to be anonymous, even to people within his or her support network, but a support network person may want to be anonymous to the addict. An example of the latter for example may be when there is no one available in the addict's known network to talk to at a vulnerable time-particularly if a relapse is in progress and no one in the addict's known network is available. In one example embodiment, an addict may connect, as a backup, to a general or on-call addiction support person that may provide someone to talk to, or even arrange to meet if they are close together.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0141">In various embodiments, obstacles may be introduced to obtaining the addiction substance or pursuing the addiction activity. One example is in using the information from one or more of the scenarios in combination with the proximity of the addict to transportation sources, such as the addict's car. In situations where the addict has relapsed, various embodiment components may automatically interface with transportation systems within the addict's reach and/or control to disable them or modify them, for example switching on a driverless car feature (and preventing manual driving).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0142">In various embodiments, interfaces are provided that are ways of interacting with the addict. One common and unfortunately generally applicable characterization of addicts is the tendency to be lazy. It is more accurate to say that because of the effects (or after-effects) of their abuse (particularly substance abuse) they have low levels of energy, motivation, and attention span. In various embodiments, interfacing&#x2014;i.e., receiving input from but particularly providing output to&#x2014;the addict can be very effective when appropriately provided. Thus, a wide variety of interfaces may be provided, the deployment of which is often context-dependent, and appropriately simple and intuitive for the addict to use, with minimal actions required on part of the addict.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0143">The use of Siri and other types of personal assistants are anticipated and included as possible interfaces. For example, if it the addict is determined to be at high risk of a relapse while home alone, a program could be initiated that talks to the addict to ask the addict what is bothering the addict (if the trigger is Loneliness for example and no human support person is available), or to suggest a call to mom if a trigger response to do so is high on the response list. The use of such interfaces could even be adjusted to use the type of voice (e.g., male, female, English, Australian accent, etc.) that has been determined to be appropriate in the past. The use of the addict's children's voices could also be used, as a reinforcer or defense to not to drink otherwise the children will be harmed in some way.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0144">The types of interfaces anticipated to be used are wide, varied and utilizing a diversity of technologies. They may range from, e.g., variations of smartphone interfaces (e.g., touchscreen, high quality video/sound, etc.) to others such as augmented reality, personal robotics, etc. The goal of using such interfaces in all cases is the same: to have a significant effect on the addict, which in turn may be provided by an interface appropriate for that addict in a particular context.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0145">The use of augmented reality and robotics can be beneficial in addiction treatment. With Augmented Reality, particular contexts/situations may be modified to both see things that are not there, but not see things that are there, or see different things (also referred to as de-augmented reality). For example, for alcoholics who see a spike in their desire to drink when they see a liquor store, their Google Glasses or equivalent may be programmed to block out all words and images of alcohol as they drive by. An alternative may be to replace the words and images with something benign, such as words and images about a charity, or even replace them with disgusting words and images along site symbols of alcohol in order to associate such disgusting words and images (such as someone vomiting) with the concept of alcohol.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0146">As discussed before, interfaces with third party applications may be provided in various embodiments. For example, interfaces with social media applications can identify friends who are nearby as candidates for transactional support needs (e.g., serve as support network substitutes if no other resources are nearby). Navigation applications can be modified to exclude the location of liquor stores or casinos. Communicating with support resources via Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter, or Facebook can be used depending on the best/most convenient way of interfacing with an addict and/or their support networks. A filter and program can be applied to online grocery applications that may prevent alcohol purchases from being made. This type of prevention may be extended such that if an alcoholic nears a local bar, an interface may be established with the bar's systems that download a Do-No-Serve notice to the bar owner along with facial recognition information.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0147">In various embodiments, a wide variety of interfaces may be provided to interact with the addict, support network, and third parties. Such interfaces include but are not limited to: Direct manipulation interface (e.g., augmented/virtual reality), Graphical user interfaces, Web-based user interfaces Touchscreens, Command line interfaces (e.g., command string input), Touch user interfaces Hardware interfaces (e.g., knobs, buttons) Attentive user interfaces (e.g., that determine when to interrupt a person), Batch interfaces, Conversational interfaces, Conversational interface agents (e.g., animated person, robot, dancing paper clip), Crossing-based interfaces (e.g., crossing boundaries versus pointing), Gesture interfaces (e.g., hand gestures, etc.) Holographic user interfaces, Intelligent user interfaces (e.g., human to machine and vice versa), Motion tracking interfaces, Multi-screen interfaces, Non-command user interfaces (e.g., infer user attention), Object-oriented user interfaces (e.g., to manipulate simulated objects), Reflexive user interfaces (e.g., achieves system changes), Search interface, Tangible user interfaces (e.g., touch), Task-focused interfaces (e.g., focused on tasks, not files), Text-based user interfaces, Voice user interfaces, Natural-language interfaces. Zero-input (e.g., sensor-based) interfaces Zooming (e.g., varying-levels of scale) user interfaces. Various mechanisms may be provided for selecting/modifying the interfaces based on the user's context. Such mechanisms are part of the User Interface Detector/Selector/Interface (UIDSI) unit in the Addict Monitor/Controller (AMC) <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0148">In various embodiments, robots and robotics may be used. A robot could be used, for example, to serve as an addiction monitor, controller, and/or enforcer. A robot, sensing or being instructed that a high-relapse risk situation is developing, might literally grab the addict by the hand and lead them to a different (safe) destination.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0149">In various embodiments, scheduling and to-do lists of the addict are utilized, as well as the addict's support network. For the support network, integrating with any scheduling program that they use (such as Outlook) can assist in determining their availability (and in some instances location) when an addict risk situation occurs. For the addict, an embodiment may make a dynamic scheduling adjustment and/or add or delete to-do items if in so doing so reduces the risk of relapse for a particular situation. For example, various sensors and other information may indicate that the addict's anxiety levels are rising in the morning. A schedule may have some high probably high anxiety-inducing appointments in the afternoon, for example a meeting with an ex-spouse and their lawyers that afternoon. Various embodiment algorithms may determine that such a meeting is too high risk, and prompt (say via a speech, Siri-like interface) the addict to determine if the meeting should be rescheduled and do so if the answer is yes (in some embodiments it may even be done automatically).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0150">Consistent with simple and intuitive philosophy of the interfaces, an Addict Monitor/Controller (AMC) <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may have a variety of form factors. Such form factors may include, e.g., being part of a mobile phone, tablet, PDA, or laptop; part or fully of Tablet/Laptop/PDA, implants, wearables, wrist devices, or any number of form factors. Note also that while the functionality described for the Addict Monitor/Controller is anticipated to be done on the device, it is not necessary, and could be done on a server, in the cloud, via peer-to-peer, or some other processing mechanism.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0151">The variety and diversity of interfaces and the ability to detect/select them-including specialized interfaces within the Monitor/Controller and interfacing to other third party devices via their interfaces&#x2014;are effective for: 1) determining the context, 2) receiving input from the addict in the ways most convenient to the addict, 3) providing information/output to the addict in the ways most receptive to the addict, and/or <b>4</b>) providing the most effective deterrent(s) to prevent (or inhibit) a relapse from occurring.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0152">For determining context, an addict user interface detector/selector (UIDSI) on the addict monitor/controller (AMC) may utilize sensors on the AMC to detect context-related data. A simple example is using an optical sensor to detect the addict's light environment, helping to indicate if the addict is inside or out, in a lighted environment or dark. Readings (like loud music) from the audio sensor may be used, e.g., to confirm/modify a conclusion (supported by data from the Locator) that the addict has entered a Rave (an impromptu party with large amounts of substances to abuse) and is in a high-risk context.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0153">Various embodiments may include the linking and coordinating of ad-hoc, spontaneous, unscheduled, or flash meetings between two or more addicts-who may or may not know each other-who either are a) generally open to idea of meeting; b) would like to meet a certain time and/or place; and/or c) are concurrent/coincidently sharing similar trigger risk profiles and where a potential solution for a high risk situation is their meeting, preferably in a sanctuary location.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0154">Various embodiments utilize physical locations as part of their risk identification and/or resulting actions/solutions or coordination efforts. However, many if not most of such embodiments may also use virtual locations as part of their description. For example, if an addict is posting on or in a chat room online (in a situation where their physical location is not relevant, determinable, or near anyone else), and making comments indicating a relapse/usage mindset, a risk assessment engine through a social media monitoring module could detect these comments and generate an alert to the addict's support network. In turn, those members of the support network who were also on that social media site at the same time (or could quickly log on to it) could then join the addict at that virtual location to interact live with the addict, to talk about their risk situation and/or active triggers. In this sense, the physical location of the addict and the appropriate support network person is not nearly as relevant as is their presence at/on the same virtual location on the Internet that enables them to interact real-time.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0155">Various embodiments utilize algorithms that assess and determine the potential of a relapse of the addiction(s) in question. Such algorithms may be based on many factors, including, e.g., addict's profile, behavior/context history, triggers, medical data, the current or trending context of the user, etc. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, such information could be utilized in a set of prediction algorithms and/or scoring formulas geared to determining a current or trending degree of risk.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0156">Various embodiments utilize the concept of trending context of the addict. Various embodiments may attempt to anticipate/predict the addict's context at some point(s) in the future-10 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, etc.&#x2014;in order to identify high-risk situations and proscribe some sort of preventive actions. A simple example is detecting the travel of the addict on a route for which a highly likely/only conceivable destination is a prohibited or forbidden destination, such as a liquor store, gambling establishment, known drug-dealing area, etc., or related forbidden areas such as an ex-wife's house under a court order of protection.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0157">The above trending context example is also an example of various embodiments' integration with other applications. In the above example, the prediction of the addict's destination of a liquor store, gambling den, or drug haven may be made very simple if the addict programs the destination into his/her GPS navigation application. An interface may be provided by one embodiment that would automatically (subject to privacy and/administration limitations discussed earlier) transmit the destination/route information from the navigation application to the embodiment, allowing confirmation of the addict's destination.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0158">Various embodiments provide integration with third party applications, systems, and processes, e.g., as relating to dealing with high risk or actual relapse situations. For example, in situations where it is deemed too risky for an addict to drive a car, an embodiment may automatically scan through alternatives to get the addict home or to help, without them endangering themselves or others by getting behind the wheel. This could include automatically integrating with an Uber or Lyft application to obtain a ride or interacting with the addict's car to alternatively disable it, make it switch to self-driving mode (and not allow manual driving at all), or only switch on if the addict was a passenger. Such third-party integration could be extended even further, for example, extending to home security applications (e.g., sending an alert to an ex-spouse's house under a restraining order to inform that the ex-spouse has been drinking and take appropriate precautions). It could even extend, e.g., to automatically informing law enforcement if such restraining order geo-fences have been violated.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0159">While the above embodiments emphasize anticipation and prevention of relapse, there are also many embodiments of the present disclosure that address minimizing damage if usage of the addiction occurs. In one example embodiment, alternative transportation mechanisms are leveraged when a risk of the addict traveling while impaired is considered high. Beyond and including communicating with the addict's personal vehicle(s) and interfacing with the appropriate systems to prevent the addict from driving the vehicle, the example embodiment may also interface with systems such as Uber or Lyft to automatically request ride services when it detects that the addict is in need of such transportation. It may also interface with driverless cars or cars with that option. For example, if the addict's personal vehicle has a driverless option, the example embodiment may automatically switch the car into that mode to prevent the addict from taking control. An alternative may be to completely disable the addict's car, or any other car the addict attempts to drive (such as those with embedded breathalyzers or similar driver condition monitoring/car interfacing technologies).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0160">Other transportation-related embodiments include, but are not limited to, communicating with rental car companies if an embodiment detects impairment; airlines to prevent drinks from being served to the addict. It also includes alerting key parties (such as spouses) when the (possibly impaired) addict is on the way to home and activate if desired various security measures when the addict is with a certain distance of the home or other location (such as children's schools) so that measures such as automatically locking the home, calling security/police, family etc. can be taken before the addict arrives at the location.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0161">Another example embodiment of the present disclosure provides interfacing with the increasingly personalized digital media world. Digital signs/signage may be capable of communicating with personal devices to detect information about the owner in order to tailor advertising to the owner's specific needs, preferences, and desires. Other signage looks to market to common denominators with beer commercials and the like-causing distress in some alcoholics. One example embodiment may interface with public digital signage, e.g., to prevent alcoholism-related signs from appearing while the alcoholic is in the viewing vicinity, or alternatively causing uplifting, trigger-soothing related ads or messages to be displayed. The signage for use by interfaces could be coordinated, e.g., by the Addiction Server or by an application on one of the addict's devices with access to the Action Coordination Engine.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0162">Various embodiments may address the privacy of the addict and others via a privacy engine <b>117</b> to both protect the addict's privacy&#x2014;to the extent possible and/or desirable&#x2014;as well as the privacy of others involved in implementing such embodiments, such as friends and service providers. As the transportation embodiment above illustrates, implementing restraints on an addict in terms of utilizing third party services and/or informing third parties of an addict's risk situation can involve privacy concerns and legal considerations. In various embodiments, a privacy engine <b>117</b> may address such matters while still providing functionality as disclosed herein. The privacy engine <b>117</b> may interact with various embodiments such as the Action Coordination engine to ensure that privacy concerns are appropriately addressed in the selection and implementation of any course of action.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0163">One example embodiment includes sending alerts to persons in an addict's support network when the addict is near, nearing, and/or stopped at a Point of Interest&#x2014;POI&#x2014;(e.g., liquor store, casino, shopping mall, etc.) and/or known geographical area (e.g., drug dealing areas and sites) that may provide a temptation to the addict or indeed is the intended destination of the addict. Selection of recipients of such alerts may be based on any number of parameters such as their location (e.g., proximity to the addict), time of day, day of week, etc. The triggering of such alerts could incorporate the use of geo-fences to initiate the application(s) and/or trigger various types of functionalities when the addict enters or leaves the geo-fence. This could help the addict in knowing he/she is being monitored (e.g., is being systematically supported by his/her personal, semi-anonymous, and/or anonymous safety network(s), etc.) and/or causing members of the network to actively intervene to help stop/prevent/advise/console the relapse or repetition of the addiction event. This could include generating alerts when the addict is near/nearing, and/or stopped by a person of interest, e.g., a known bad influence on the addict (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, etc.), etc.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0164">Another embodiment includes providing alternative routes for navigation applications (and/or data to navigation applications that can provide alternative routes) that modify directions to avoid these kinds of proximity to the points of interests (POIs) or areas described above and other functionality described below (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0165">Another example embodiment includes providing information/alerts to addiction means entities such as casinos and liquor stores when the location of the addict is in their proximity, so as to enable on-site activities such as refusal of service or counseling to the addict. Various embodiments may provide information to credit/debit card companies to temporarily disable the cards to prevent purchases or cash advances, and/or disable the usage of other electronic or computerized payment mechanisms such as mobile wallet technologies. Various embodiments may provide capabilities to block individual transactions when a part of that transaction includes addiction-enabling products or services. For example, grocery stores in many states allow the sale of beer, wine, and even liquor. It would be very undesirable to block a grocery store transaction by the addict just because the place he was shopping in sold alcoholic beverages in addition to many other non-alcoholic items. Various embodiments may provide a capability to tie the store's check out mechanisms (e.g., bar code scanners and the like) to the mobile payment system as well as to the data profile of the addict (see below) to detect when an addict (in this case an alcoholic) attempts to buy alcohol. An alert may be sent to the mobile payment system or perhaps directly to the grocery store's check-out system to deny the transaction. The addict would perhaps be given the opportunity to remove the alcohol from the checkout process and continue the checkout without the alcohol being included to avoid embarrassment and the like.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0166">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing an addict with a panic button or hot-key or equivalent on the addict's device(s) that could trigger some predefined functionality described herein.

Various embodiments may provide linkages to book/article passages or video footage showing the author(s)/actors in addiction situations and/or describing the impact of their addiction and/or showing them in embarrassing situations and the like. Various embodiments may provide various media reminders of public figures who have seriously damaged themselves in some fashion, such as high-profile actors or sports figures who seriously impacted their careers by behavior that seriously damaged their public profile and in turn their careers and finances.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0168">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing predictive analysis of potential relapse based on the addict's historical data, such as travel patterns and health data such as blood pressure, and linking them to real-time data (e.g., current location and directions; blood pressure monitors on or in the person), to anticipate and evaluate the potential for a relapse, and to initiate preventative measures, such as some of the types of alerts above or alternatives below, or even triggering a release of blood pressure medicine or other types of medicine that would be deemed appropriate in the circumstances, such as Campral or Naltrexone (e.g., alcohol containing medications, etc.). These medicines' administration could be, e.g., in the form of alerts to the addict to take it urgently or as a reminder to a periodic schedule, or even triggering the release of the appropriate dosage via implants in the addict, or even more exotic methods such as being shot with the medicine from a drone following the addict, or providing a supercharged vibrate on the mobile device that could serve as a sort of wake up call, or more benign mechanisms to the addict like changing their ring tone to the addicts favorite (or least favorite song), or launching a song on their iPod that reminds them of good/bad childhood experiences. Alerts could be sent, in various embodiments, to appropriate physicians and/or as updates to the addict's medical records. Various embodiments may provide capabilities such as functionality during the addict's sleeping period to subconsciously reinforce the addict's resolve to fight the addiction, such as special programs broadcast next to the addict's bed.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0169">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages to sensors such as in-vehicle breathalyzers that can activate alerts and other functionality disclosed herein. Various embodiments may provide capabilities such as addiction-trained dogs that detect the presence/usage of the means of addiction/relapse and take preventative action such as hiding the means (a kind of reverse application of the dog getting a beer for his master). Various embodiments may provide capabilities such as affixing RFID tags on addiction means (e.g., alcohol) that trigger alerts and other disclosed functionality if the tags are moved.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0170">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing location-based alternatives via the addict's mobile device to the addict to help either passively or actively in dealing with the addiction in general and/or relapses in particular. Such alternatives include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0171">Alerting the addict when he/she is in the proximity of their support structure, such being near an active or soon-to-start AA meeting or other support groups that meets the needs/preferences of the addict (example: a women-only meeting), or near a member of his support network such as a sponsor, family member, or friend; linking to navigation functionality to provide the addict with directions to the support person or structure; automatically calling the nearest support person or type of support person (e.g., family member, etc.).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0172">Providing location-based suggestions for other alternative activities by linking with a personal preference database, such as a nearby teen/youth center, church, movie theatre with a movie/movie type he likes that will start soon, bingo, a bowling alley, book store, coffee shop, and other types of alternative activities based on a database of preferences, such as self-esteem boosting activities which may include volunteering/community service. Other alternatives may include errand-running based on location, such as going to the grocery store or picking up the dry cleaning. These could be done in general while the addict's device is on and/or based on other parameters such as only during a certain day or time or geographical location, on a periodic basis, or randomly.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0173">Providing location-based advertisements for key products and services based in whole or in part on preferences and/or templates for resisting temptation, such as bakery or coffee coupons of nearby establishments (in this example, sugar and/or coffee being considered an effective alternative to alcohol). Could include special sales for that addict only and/or for a limited time (e.g., 2 hours, etc.) on those products and services.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0167" num="0174">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes detecting that the addict, having been located at his/her residence for a certain period of time, leaves that residence in a way or timeframe that triggers an alert to said social network or legal/public authorities. Said alert may preferably have the effect of either: 1) deterring the addict from said action (presupposing that the reason for the leaving of the residence is to indulge in the addiction); and/or 2) providing a public safety service.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0175">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages with databases storing images of photos, videos, text messages, legal transgressions (proven or otherwise), and other testimonial type data that can be used to remind the addict of the consequences of their addiction, and/or be communicated to their social safety network and/or other entities, particularly in the prospect of harm or inconvenience to other individuals and/or property is deemed possible. These linkages could be of a personal nature, or of an external nature, such as DUI car crashes having nothing to do personally with the addict but serving as stark reminders to the addict of the potential consequences of their actions. These images and/or messages could be automatically sent to the addict's device and displayed in the most effect manner to gain the addict's attention.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0176">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages to/reminders of loss of marriage, deteriorated connections with children, family, and friends, loss of job(s), embarrassing behavior, situations, or events caused by the addict's addiction, negative financial impacts like lost opportunities or assets, and other personally negative situations experienced by the addict. Reminders could be in any form, such as photos, videos, text, testimonials, etc., and rendered to the addict via display, text, audio, 3D, 4D+, heads-up display, etc.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0177">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages to medical databases that show the effect of addictions of various parts of the body, such as liver, stomach, colon, nose, and other effects such as blood clots, diabetes, etc. This information could/would be transmitted to the addict's device in various methods, e.g., voice, text, photos, video, or other methods such as heads-up-display, direct neural-to-the-brain and/or other body connections (e.g., implants or other methods of directly internally communicating with the addict, and other methods). This may include being able to display, text, and/or provide verbal reminders to the addict and/or others in the addict's network. This may also include the potential for notifications/linkages to other interested parties, such as the addict's doctors, therapists, etc.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0178">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages to legal and other public records indicating personal or of an external nature of the effects of the addiction, such as DUIs, restraining orders, and the like. This may include being able to display, text, and/or provide verbal reminders to the addict and/or others in the addict's network, particularly to those in close proximity to the addict. This may also include potential for notifications/linkages with public and private safety personnel and systems in close proximity to the addict.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0179">Another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure includes the development and presentation via various types of user interfaces of location-based information about the above in the form of news, alerts, other presentations, etc. This presentation may be motivational and/or dissituational in nature to reinforce the need for the addict to abstain from their addiction. For example, a newsfeed could pop up as a banner ad on the addict Jane Doe's phone or Google Glass as she was nearing a liquor store on 5th and Elm Street saying &#x201c;News Flash: Jane Doe laughs at the temptation of Joe's Liquor at 5th &#x26; Elm!&#x2014;World Rejoices!&#x201d; This would have the dual effect of a) reminding Jane she is being watched or monitored, and b) providing real-time reinforcement and praise for resisting that particularly temptation.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0180">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes the creation of an anonymous and/or semi-anonymous social networks, allowing users (helpers for the addiction that meet certain parameters including location proximity to the addict) to flag themselves as available to help (perhaps after achieving some sort of training) in the event that no one is available in the addict's personal social network, or as a supplement or substitute. These networks can be crowd-sourced from the community at large. The primary goal would be to empowering the addict to know that someone is just an action away if the addict needs help. The helper could choose to appear anonymously or not, as could the addict.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0181">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes detecting, monitoring, and/or preventing purchases and/or usage of addiction-related materials. This may include providing periodic, continuous, or random reporting of such purchases and/or purchase attempts to other interested parties on a specific, semi-anonymous, or anonymous basis.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0182">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing incentive programs and frameworks that rewards the addict for positive behavior, such as coupons for free dinner for two if the addict's behavior reached a certain positive threshold, such as not stopping at a liquor store for 30 days consecutively (verified by the application). This would entail a historical tracking/counter/points type system within the addict's application profile. This would entail methods and technologies such as periodic intensive tracking of the addict for an amount of time, such as a week or a month (or moderate tracking as a regular ongoing part of the application) and awarding points (redeemable for prizes) based on verifying going to a certain number of meetings or NOT stopping at a liquor store. This framework also has a lot of applicability for others involved. There can be support quests, where say a child has to write a letter to their estranged parent (a real letter) and if so, they get X number of points, which are redeemable for products or services appropriate to that person's demographic, such as an ice cream coupon for children 10-15, or iTunes credit for persons 10-25, with appropriate controls to prevent abuse. Another aspect of incentives is a behavior-based pricing model. This could entail raising the monthly cost of the service to the addict when the addict exhibits bad or undesirable behavior (e.g., relapsing, etc.), then lowering the price and/or providing refunds when the addict exhibits good or desirable behavior over a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0183">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing a user interface (UI) platform to the above functionality that minimizes or reduces the actions that the addict has to take for the functionality to activate. Indeed, by using capabilities that the user does not have to provide any action to activate the functionality, particularly the use of the addict's location, various embodiments may provide ways that reduce/eliminate any reluctance on part of the addict to use the functionality. Various embodiments may provide the ability to customize the user interface for the addict to maximize the convenience and usability of the functionality based on the user's profile. For example, the UI for an alcoholic may be much different than that for a prescription drug addict which in turn may be much different than the UI for a shopaholic. They could vary by many parameters, such as gender or location (e.g., text to voice conversion could be done in a western, southern, or northeastern dialect depending on the home location of the addict, etc.). The sensors used for detecting high risk situations may be much different; means of communicating messages may be much different. Various embodiments may provide the ability to modify/customize the user interface based on multiple parameters, particularly location. Other accessory type modifications to a UI based on location also may be provided. For example, if an embodiment detects that an addict (or in this case also includes non-addicts) is in a movie theater, it may automatically switch the device to vibrate, and provide a capability that inverts the display of any messages, e.g., instead of a bright background with messages in dark colors, the background will switch to a dark one with the messages in a lighter color, thereby greatly diminishing the impact on the dark movie theater environment. This capability could be enabled by various technologies tracking the movement and location of the person (addiction not a requirement in this kind of use case), and other technologies such as detecting payment for the product or service and using the nature of that transaction (e.g., buying a movie ticket, etc.) to automatically modify the behavior/user interface of the device. The device could then be instructed to revert to its former configuration when the user/device is detected to be leaving the theater.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0184">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing an initial setup capability that minimizes actions and time by the addict to setup his/her profile to take advantage of the functionality described herein. A pre-populated profile templates may initially be used based, e.g., on a few parameters such as addiction(s), gender, age, key medical conditions such as depression, medication taken, home/work locations, key hobbies/leisure activities, key addiction triggers, and/or (for some addictions) ethnicity, etc. In addition, various embodiments may provide the addict with a number of options for setting up his/her support network. These could include manual input of individuals/groups (generally undesirable), accessing/downloading individual/group information from other applications such as Facebook/social networking apps, phone and/or email address books, local AA meeting participants, etc. The addict would then need to confirm each individual (using voice or computerized confirmation) before they would be active in the addict's profile database, plus other parameters such as type of support (e.g., alert 24 hours/day, only certain circumstances such as only when the addict is out of town, etc.). These individuals may need to be sent confirmation messages, depending on circumstances (e.g., wanting to send alerts to that user) and/or the addict's preferences, asking permission to be included in the addict's support structure. Other parameters such as allowing the use of anonymous support individuals/entities would be requested. This initial information would then be used to provide the initial profile template for the addict. This information would include flagging of location-related/addiction-related POIs, such as liquor stores within a 50-mile radius of the addict's home/work or movie theatres within a 10-mile radius. It would include key directional information such as the various routes between home and work, which could then be used to provide alternative routes to avoid addiction tempting locations/POIs and triggers and/or provide convenient access to alternative activities, plus other data.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0185">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing an ongoing profile modification capability, which could be done by one or more means or ways: manually and incrementally, such as when the addict is calling, texting, or emailing a person asking the addict if he/she would like to add them to their support structure. Various embodiments may also provide or have a learning capability, such as detecting changes in behavior or condition of the addict (e.g., changed driving patterns or elevated blood pressure, etc.), correlating the changes in the addict's behavior or condition to relapse risk factors and then modifying the activation/prioritization/type of functionality described herein. Various embodiments may include suggestions by others in the addict's support network, such as recommending a good restaurant frequented by other addicts, a new bridge game being setup, a club at the addict's high school that might be helpful to the addict, etc.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0186">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing linkages to, usage of, and combination of a wide variety of databases, including but not limited to: street/navigation databases; POI databases; satellite map databases; addiction group databases, such as AA meeting types, times, and locations; event databases (e.g., ballgames, concerts, etc.); rehab facility databases; self-help databases such as WebMD; weather databases; public safety databases (e.g., police stations, sex offender databases, etc.); geographical/terrain databases; highly specialized databases such as databases that show hot fishing or surfing locations; plus a host of individual databases such as local theater databases/listings describing the locations, showings, and times of a movie theatre chain's location in the vicinity of the addict's home or work. This may include linkages to products and services in the addict's area that could help deal with triggers particular to the addict. This may include sign-up databases for addicts in a certain area who want to be part of a local, regional, national, and/or international (even special) support network, on a personal, semi-anonymously, or anonymous basis either offering to be part of a support structure, seeking the support of a support structure, or both. These databases could be public, private, or both. Various embodiments may provide new and unique value both in the application/usage of the databases, and also in combining/integrating them in new and unique ways.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts an example embodiment of a method for monitoring for a risk of a pre-identified behavior (e.g., pre-identified addict-related undesirable behavior, etc.). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> also includes example triggers, priorities, and initial risk assessment/detection sensors. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a first step may include providing a questionnaire (e.g., on paper, online, video, etc.). Questions on the question may be designed to obtain not just facts but to also elicit an emotional response from the person (e.g., addict, etc.) answering the questionnaire. The questionnaire may be used to determine the priority/impact/severity of each drinking trigger listed as well as any other ones that might apply. A high ranking for a trigger may indicate that the person often drinks or wants to drink when this trigger occurs, whereas a low ranking for a trigger may indicate that the trigger never causes the person to drink or want to drink.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0188">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, location(s)/context(s) for the addict may be extracted, such as from computers, phones, social media (including location and time stamp), etc. Location(s)/context(s) for the addict may be extracted from a third party, such as location, context-rich and/or image/photo-intensive applications, e.g., navigation, etc. After extraction of location(s)/context(s) for the addict, the method may include identifying, assessing, and prioritizing triggers, and identifying key sensors, determining sensor and other sources (e.g., key readings, values, levels, ranges, yes-no parameters, etc.) to monitor for risk. The method may also include accessing and/or using addict data sources including addict data and analytics <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), including predictive analytics data, etc. The various possible triggers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> are not necessarily independent from each other as there may be relationships between the triggers.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0189">Another feature or aspect in some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure includes providing the ability to anonymize the addict's identity for some or all of the above functionality, particularly (but not exclusively) for functionality that goes outside of the addict's support network, such as providing moment of value mobile coupons discussed above that would shield the addict's identity from the company providing the coupons.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0190">More broadly, the protection of addict (and their support network) privacy is one aspect of the present disclosure. The personal data collection mechanisms described in the present disclosure can conceivably be used to track a person's movements <b>24</b>/<b>7</b>. To prevent inappropriate use of data, the present disclosure provides new systems, methods, mechanisms, and techniques particular to how and where the data is collected, and who, how, when, and why it is used.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0191">The present disclosure describes exemplary embodiments of new systems/methods/techniques to use location and/or context information-based security as a way to protect location and/or context information. An important premise is that such personalized location/context-based images and other prompting mechanisms are readily familiar in some way to the user without the need of memorization. At the same time, such images/mechanisms would be very hard to hack or recognizable by (ro)bots since the ability to recognize them is rooted in the user's experience&#x2014;not in any sort of logical or algorithmic mechanism. Such security keys, passwords, or other security-related elements and mechanisms could be used in protecting the broader collection of location/context information. Besides the ability to protect the voluminous addict behavior data, such location-based security could be used as part of financial account password verification or reset processes, or even an extra layer of security to prevent individual household appliance or device hacking or access such as preventing fake off hacking of TVs, etc. that could become more vulnerable as the Internet of Things becomes more prevalent.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0192">One of the important premises of the location-based privacy and security components, embodiments, and examples is that location and context, presented in a user-friendly manner, requires little memorization of the image, unlike say an alphanumeric password. They are readily identifiable by the user once presented to them in some recognizable fashion. In particular, location/context can take advantage of the concept in human memory of recognition versus recall. Recognition refers to our ability to recognize an event or piece of information as being familiar, triggered or prompted from external piece of information or input. Recall designates the retrieval of a piece of information from memory without any external prompting or input. Today's passwords requiring number, letters, capital letters, and punctuation signs are examples of account/data/database keys or passwords that rely in total or significantly on a person's recall ability. Nearly all memory experts acknowledge that recognition is far easier for most humans than recall. Location-based privacy and security takes advantage of recognition, which besides being easier for a given person it much harder for others that have not experienced the piece of data recognized by the user, hence it being much harder to hack, guess, or otherwise deduce, particularly if constrained in some way, such as a time limit, etc.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b></figref> describe examples of location/context-based elements and embodiments of protecting/verifying valid users and/or access to this information. Broadly, the capabilities illustrated by these diagrams and associated disclosure and embodiments may be referred to as location-based security and/or location-based privacy, using some form of image(s) as key(s) to locking/unlocking/securing a broader set of information, such as account information and/or location/context data collected for purposes of preventing or dealing with an addiction risk or relapse. The images are not limited to only visual/graphical items, such as photographics as the images may also or instead be visual, audio, graphical, video-based, photographic, textual, alphanumeric, and/or other types of passwords depending on the user interface. The images could be in the form of sensor readings, which often have unique values depending on the sensor. The images could be multi-dimensional, such as two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), or beyond if, e.g., including time/time-lapse/time-projecting images. The images may be static (e.g., still pictures), dynamic (e.g., videos, etc.), past or present, based in memory or live streaming. Or, the images may also be combinations/hybrids of the above. In whatever form in various embodiments, the location-based security/privacy images are location and/or context-based, experienced by or known to the user and/or person(s) authorized to have access to the broader information.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0194">Location/context images can be obtained, derived, or computed from numerous sources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show a variety of location/context data collection devices, networks, sensors, and other mechanisms and sources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> further describes several example sources and associated types of data along with examples. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> also describes examples of questions that can be used to prompt for passwords/keys and/or access to/resets/verifications of changes/access to key information. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> provides an example of a user memory profile that can help tailor questions/potential answers to how that person best remembers/recognizes images.

A 2D photograph taken by a low-resolution smart phone of a backyard swing set has similarities with and distinct differences from a 3D image capture or video of that same swing set taken by a 3D heads-up-display camera with multi-media sound. The device, beyond capturing the time, place, and image of the location/context, also adds certain contextual elements to the image. In turn, those elements may play an important role in the ability of the user to recognize the image later when it is presented during a verification/password acceptance Q &#x26; A process.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0197">One of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is the concept of a multiple-key or jigsaw puzzle-based key or password for location/context-based security. The jigsaw puzzle-based information lock includes multiple keys to be correctly assembled in the correct order/sequence in order to provide access to any data.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0198">For example, the overall key is that a picture of a house must be assembled. This house has been broken up into 9 separate images with 9 separate associated location/context-based keys. Each of the 9 keys were created and assigned during a particular time during which certain controllers or monitors were on-call for a particular addict.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0199">The Location-Based Verification Examples sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> describes some of these either as Verification Grid Element # or Grid #. In various embodiments, data produced and used as described in the present disclosure could be location/context images as actually experienced or seen by the device/user, or they could be representations of a location/concept. Example of questions or limitations on verification answers are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, such as &#x201c;Where you have been in the last (week, month, year, etc.)?&#x201d; The use of multiple devices and/or perspectives of the same image (such as a house, daughter, etc.) would make it much more difficult for a (ro)bot and/or hacker to replicate through algorithms, analysis, or even guessing, whereas for the user it would take very little effort to recall/recognize the correct images. In the location/privacy-related examples and embodiments disclosed herein, a user may refer to a person or entity trying to gain access/validation to an account, database, data set, or other piece of information. Or, for example, a user may refer to a person and/or an entity generating such data/information. A user can be a human, computerized entity, and/or anyone or anything that has valid permission to access the information involved.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0200">In addition, there are potentially more persons/entities involved in location/context privacy and security than just users. Certainly, data can be generated/sourced from a wide variety of mechanisms/methods/sources. In addition, control over this data does not necessarily have to be by the (primary) user or account holder. Indeed, in addiction-related embodiments in particular, different data sets can be controlled by someone other than the key user (e.g., addict, etc.). One embodiment of such in location-based security is the use of an addict monitor or controller. Such an entity can be a human (or even artificial entity) that is responsible for monitoring the addict over a certain time period. The idea is to maximize or at least increase the probability that if a relapse were to happen, there would be a person on-call that would be at least generally aware of what the addict was doing, or at least have no uncertainty that if a high-risk/relapse situation were to occur that they are #1 on the list of support persons to respond. This entity may be a human or an artificial intelligence entity that has the responsibility of being at the top of the addict support hierarchy during a given time period if the addict were to encounter a high-risk situation during that time. The general purpose of such controllers is multi-faceted: to distribute security of addict information across different entities as a general security precaution; make it progressively more difficult for hacker to access the data; and, in the case of addiction-related data provide security control to entities that are (almost literally) more sober than the actual user.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0201">A side aspect of the controller function is that the controller's location/context would be sampled or otherwise tracked periodically for the time-period when they are on-duty. This location/context information, besides being used in identifying/locating support person if needed, could also be used to create a location/context-based password for the addict's location/context&#x2014;based on the controller's location/context&#x2014;during the period of time the controller was on-duty.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0202">While the location-based security and privacy elements and embodiments described in the present disclosure are primarily intended to protect information gathered in relation to getting/keeping an addict sober, its use is not limited to such addiction-related purposes. For example, one set of embodiments of this location-based security and privacy disclosure is in using recent and/or historical location/context information as a password reset verification mechanism, to prove that a user is not a robot, and/or to verify financial transaction. In one of its simplest forms, such verification would consist of a system (or person) asking where a person was on a certain date and/or certain time. Note that this query and response mechanism could be done using any of the user interface forms described elsewhere in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0203">Below is a variety of embodiments and examples that illustrate location-based security and privacy concepts applicable to many types of situations, verification environments, and protections/access to financial, addiction-related, or other types of sensitive data. Most (but not all) such example data protection/access mechanisms have some sort of qualifiers to limit the scope of a location/context-related question or statement.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0204">For example, Grid answers to the question could &#x201c;Select the location &#x26; activities you were doing on July 26, 20XX.&#x201d; Note that the specificity of the question/statement can be tailored to the User's Location/Context-based Privacy and Security (P/S) Memory Profile, so that questions/statements are not limited too narrowly (or broadly) for recognition purposes:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0205">As an easy example, Grid #4 could be an image of the user's mother's house-a location and associated context (where they live currently, as it looked before after a remodel last year)-easily identifiable to the user but less so to others and unlikely to be the current image in a readily accessible databases (e.g., Zillow, Google Maps, etc.). Such images could also be taken from angles (such as the backyard) that are generally not accessible on those kinds of databases, particularly since such databases do not generally have linkages to specifically identified family members and associated belongings. Additional security could be added that requires the user to identify how the image was captured (in this case from User's Device A). It may be that a user may have many devices (particularly for an Internet of Things user), but only takes pictures from 1 or 2 devices. This fact might be known only to the valid user.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0206">Grid #5 shows a vacation picture of the user's son on vacation in Location X doing Activity/Context of mountain climbing, taken with a Helmet Cam&#x2014;also easily identifiable to the user but much less so to others. This verification question statement could be further qualified by asking for example images that &#x201c;were on vacation&#x201d;, &#x201c;shows 1 of your children&#x201d;, &#x201c;shows mountain climbing&#x201d; or &#x201c;ocean&#x201d;, &#x201c;an activity you did 20 years ago&#x201d;, etc.&#x2014;knowledge likely known only to the user, as would the device used, which could be further obscured by using a nickname for the Helmet Cam, such as &#x201c;3rd Eye&#x201d; or &#x201c;Gorgon&#x201d;.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0207">Grid #1, shows a picture of a &#x201c;North Carolina&#x201d; street sign. The image may or may not have been &#x201c;seen&#x201d; by the user's device; rather, it is representative of whether the user had (or had not) been in North Carolina on (or around) the 7/26/XX time frame. Such an image could be generated from the raw data of a navigation app (such as the user's car #1- Device B onboard navigation system), combined with a geo-fence around the state of North Carolina that generated a database reading when the user crossed the state boundary on 7/26/XX.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0208">Grid #2 shows a textual representation of an address visited on 7/26/XX, such as the street address of the user's mother's house in Grid #4, derived from that image's latitude/longitude through a latitude/longitude to address converter program.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0209">Grid #3 shows an algorithmic derivative and associated graphical image that was created from the latitude/longitude centerpoint of all activity on a certain date. So in this case, the actual location/context of the user is not displayed, and used in an indirect manner, but the user could easily associate that they were a) indeed traveling overseas, b) it was in Australia, and c) it was on business (a hacker might assume it was for vacation, which in this case would be incorrect).</li>        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0210">Grid #6 shows am image that has multiple images of past context, in this case a picture of an dining room in a former home with a now deceased pet. This could alternatively be a possible answer to questions about playing with pets in old homes contexts.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0211">Grid #7 is an algorithmic representation of a crossroads that the user passed in a certain timeframe. Alternatively, it could be a subtle representation of a location/context, such as taking a trip with my cousin Sophie to Santa Monica Calif.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0008" num="0212">Grid #8 illustrates how an image is not necessarily photo/video/visual/graphical in nature. In this case, it is an audio clip of &#x201c;California Dreaming&#x201d; by the Mamas and Papas as a way of indicating a location or geo-fence, based on location information taken in this case from a mobile social networking post from Friend &#x201c;e&#x201d;. This illustrates how images do not have to be directly sourced by or even known to a user&#x2014;the key is to be recognizable to the user/person trying to access the account/data.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0009" num="0213">Grid #9 is an image pulled at random from a sample of retail visit locations, with the address matched with the store name and image (source: Internet). This could be in response to a question of where the user did NOT shop in the last week for example, or something even more subtle in response to a question of &#x201c;select store(s) in a retail strip mall where you've shopped the last week&#x201d;, assuming the person knows that there is such a store right next to a frequent shopping destination he or she went to, even if they did not go to that specific store during the timeframe in question.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0010" num="0214">Grid #10 illustrates an image taken from an indirect source (in this case for example a child in the backseat of a car). The driver may not have known such an image was being captured, but enough detail about the driver (user) and his context is shown that he would be able to recognize key location/context questions (such as what car was this picture taken from, or what state was the car in at the time of this picture?).</li>        <li id="ul0006-0011" num="0215">Grid #11 is another example of an externally sourced image&#x2014;a satellite image of a house from Google Satellite. Such images could be asked in a verification process regarding valid family member homes. It is likely only a user that is very familiar with such homesteads could quickly identify such homes, making more difficult for a bot to answer correctly.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0012" num="0216">Grid #12 shows how colloquial references to a location can be used as a verification mechanism. In this case, like Grid #'s 2 and #4, it is intended to represent the user's mother's home. This colloquial/textual representation could be used as a stand-alone answer to a verification question or be paired with other images such as asking the user to select all images related to a family member. In addition, a family tracking application such as AT&#x26;T Familymap can be used to extract colloquial names and locations of key places, such as &#x201c;Mom's House&#x201d;, &#x201c;Kids School&#x201d;, etc. These terms can then be paired/matched to actual or derived images of those locations, and some or all of the results presented as options in the Verification Process.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0013" num="0217">Grid #13 shows how the quality of an image (or lack thereof) can be used as a verification mechanism, under the premise that a poorer quality image will be more difficult to analyze by a bot or other hacking mechanism. Grid #13 is actually a much poorer version of the image of the user's mother's house in Grid #4. While still recognizable to the user, the image is likely to just appear as a bunch of squiggly lines to a bot or non-authorized user. Quality variations could be done in numerous different ways, including changing image fill/lines colors or solidarity (e.g., dashes instead of lines), color to black and white, pixel density, and/or circus mirror-type distortions.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0014" num="0218">Grid #14 shows a three-dimensional image of a roller coaster ride, illustrating how 3D images (including dynamic images such as video) can be used as both as a type of source data (e.g., requiring 3D-capable data capturing mechanisms) but also images where the person/entity trying to access the data has to have the correct devices to appropriately view/select the image. In some cases for example access to images could only be practically possible through viewing through 3D glasses&#x2014;in effect prohibiting bots or automated/computerized mechanisms from being able to process such images.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0015" num="0219">Grid #15 extends the 3D concepts of Grid #14 even further by portraying possible verification images in a dynamic, 3D manner, such as a rotating Rubik's cube type presentation where images are not only presented in 3D but also done in a temporary, rotating manner that requires very fast decision making. This concept is elaborated on further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, where solving Rubik's cube type images is required to verify an account and/or gain access to the account/data and where different portions of the cube are sources/controlled by different users/sources involved in the data collection and/or usage process.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0016" num="0220">Grid #16 illustrates the potential role and sourcing (and security and privacy concerns) associated with smart homes and the Internet of Things (IoT), as common household items such as TVs evolve beyond being dumb or one-way communications mechanisms to being able to collect, store, and transmit location/context and other data about a user (TV viewer). The image in Grid #16 is a possible example of a picture/video that could be taken of a TV viewer by the TV itself. As shown also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, IoT may play a major role in collecting location/contextual data (particularly activity/behavioral data) in places/situations not historically available to such data collection. This type of household data has the potential for being particularly sensitive, and as such needs the extra protections offered by the location-based privacy and security mechanisms, systems, and methods described herein.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0198" num="0221">To successfully use the protections and security described by this location-based privacy and security, there needs to be ways of verifying, authorizing, or otherwise providing access to the very large (and often very sensitive) volumes of data collected. At its simplest, a location-based key (or password) needs to be matched to the correct image/answer in order to proceed further. There are numerous ways of matching two images to see if they are the same. Many have to do with the degree of uniqueness, e.g., do the two images share the same unusual representation or pattern&#x2014;sometimes done on a pixel-by-pixel basis.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0222">For exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, doing exact matches are fairly straightforward, as the images being offered as a verification/password matching option may often be the exact image stored in a reference database, with few if any technical differences. Where degree of uniqueness comes into play is when certain location/contextual elements are the focus of the verification question or password sequence, such as requesting all images that show children-at-play in my backyard during summer of 20XX. In those cases, the possible images not only may not be an exact duplicate of a baseline/reference image, but there may also not be a baseline/reference image, and/or the possible correct images may seem very different to the typical viewer. In these cases, it can be subset(s) of the images that would be important&#x2014;those portions of the image that determine key location/context elements, such as &#x201c;children&#x201d;, &#x201c;at play&#x201d; and &#x201c;summer 2000.&#x201d; In those cases, a person may designate the important elements, or a matching algorithm may pick out key elements, such as the presence of a swing set to be the proxy for &#x201c;play&#x201d;, &#x201c;children&#x201d; being anyone under 5 feet tall (this needing a reference height), or &#x201c;Summer 2000&#x201d; showing trees and grass in full bloom, with a date stamp of June, July, August, or September 2000 as part of the image metadata. A statistical probability technique may also apply, such that any match with more than a 90% probability would be considered sufficient.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0223">A new way of dealing with the variances/uncertainties of matching/verifying images that are not technically/digitally the same yet have sufficiently matching elements is location/context fingerprinting, described in the present disclosure. As background, in the wireless field, there is a concept called Radio Frequency (RF) Fingerprinting. This is a generally a location-determination method where surrounding cellular or Wi-Fi signals at a given point are measured (such as measuring signal strength, or time-differences), and those measurements stamped with a GPS location&#x2014;constituting a fingerprint of that location. When a user of such a system later reports a variety of signal measurements, they can be compared to the fingerprint database, and if they match a fingerprint in the database, then that user is reported to be at the corresponding location.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0224">A new variant of that concept is disclosed here. For example, a verification database may have many hundreds or thousands of images of a location and/or context&#x2014;some drawn from/known to a user and others not. In a verification process, the verification engine could offer several images, and request the user to select the 3 that all have the same location or context in common. The common element could be any number of things&#x2014;same location (home) or context (playing with my children), same location at the same point in time (summer last year), etc. It could even be which images were taken from the same (user) device&#x2014;e.g., matching based on source device and/or metadata attached to the image versus the image itself. All of these examples would be relatively easy for the user to remember and remember quickly; a hacker would have a difficult, even impossible job in deducing the correct answers. Like a physical fingerprint is only on the user's physical person, these location/context fingerprints are available only in the user's brain. A simple example of a location-based fingerprint is to have a front, side, and top image of the same object or situation that the user then has to recognize. For example, while such images of a house are readily available from various sources (e.g., Google Earth, Zillow), such different perspectives of the same object would look very different to someone without a vested interest in the property (e.g., the owner), and thus it would likely only be an owner/resident that could quickly pick out <b>3</b> such images from a collection of several, for example.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0225">The above is another instance of the importance and effectiveness of location/context-based privacy and security in protecting against robots or bots seeking to compromise data/system security. For example, when asked to verify whether or not a person is a robot, many such existing techniques display several photos and ask the user to select those that display portions of street signs or store fronts. If the user correctly selects all frames, then they are allowed to proceed with the transaction. As an enhancement, the present disclosure could provide images of locations personal to the user. For example, a variety of storefront images could be presented to the user, and the user asked to select which ones they have been to within, say, the last 24 hours. These transactions could be selected according to a procedure, algorithm, or even randomly from the locations collected from the user during that time period. This kind of verification would deter a sophisticated robot as the validation process would be based on the user's personal experiences and not a robot's general image recognition capability. Similarly, several street signs with a real or systemically overlaid image of a street or road could be displayed and ask the user to select which streets/roads the user has traveled in the last week. The system could provide as much granularity as needed in selecting the roads, whereas a &#x201c;week&#x201d; could be very specifically 7 days, or generally several days, depending on how good the user's memory is (and which is described in their memory profile discussed shortly).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0226">Such a query could be structured to include locations/streets/roads that the system knows definitively has not been to during the proscribed time period. This could create by a simple geo-fence-type algorithm that encapsulates a user's movements in a particularly geographical designation, such as town, city, zip code, county, or state for example, within a certain time period, and then providing other selection options clearly outside those areas during that time. A simple illustration could ask the person &#x201c;have you been to O'Fallon, Illinois recently?&#x201d; The system's data store would know if the user has ever been there, but such answer is not part of public record such as asking where you've lived in the past or even the model of car that you have owned. The verification is based on the user's personally experienced location/context-information unlikely to be available in other databases that are accessible by hackers.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0227">The selection of the location transaction to base a query on could be done in a variety of ways. The selection of the preferred method could be established beforehand in user profiles, for example, giving the user choices to select locations for verification purposes based on day (e.g., Saturday), time (only in the afternoon), time period (within the last day, week, or month), historical only (only last year's locations), geography (only Missouri locations), and/or context (e.g., locations when I had been on vacation and/or clearly engaged in leisure activities). This allows the user to be prompted with locations that they are most likely to remember, yet with little or no obviousness to a hacker.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0228">Indeed, the above could be used not just for verification or reset purposes, but as an application/system password or key itself. Every time a person logs onto Application B for example, instead of being asked for an alphanumeric-based password, it could be shown as several images&#x2014;individual or parts of images, e.g., as shown in the jigsaw or Rubik's cube puzzles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>13</b></figref>. Images are not limited solely to visual/graphical items. The images may be visual, audio, alphanumeric, or other types of passwords depending on the user interface but are nonetheless referred to as images for convenience. In whatever form, the images are location and/or context-based and/or personally experienced by or known to the user. Several images could be displayed to the user, and the user may be asked to select the one(s) they've experienced at or during a selected time period. Or a time period could be displayed with images all experienced or known to the user, then the user may be asked to select the correct time-period from a list of options. An incorrect selection would be replaced by new options with a new answer that is based on the user's location/context experience or knowledge.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0229">The user interface used in the verification/password selection process can do more besides providing a large variety of image and image-type selections&#x2014;it can also enable new types of verification methods. For example, a 3D touch-type screen could enable choosing the correct images as they are raised or elevated in the view screen, and the user can touch/press those images that are correct/in the correct sequence, in a kind of virtual whack-a-mole mechanism. This concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. An example embodiment of this concept is that the user is presented with a static or rotating image (or cube) that has one or more pictures being enhanced (e.g., popped-up, etc.) every few seconds. The person trying to gain access to the data/account/system would only have, for example, 2-3 seconds to select (virtually whack) the valid option(s)&#x2014;validity being dependent on the verification/authorization question or statement, such as &#x201c;select all images showing your kids playing in your backyard in summer 20XX.&#x201d; This is an example of a question that would be relatively easy for a valid user to answer because the user could readily recognize the user's own children, own backyard, and even season/year (if, for example, the user's backyard was a landscaping mess up to Spring of that year, and a new swing set replaced the old swing set the winter of 20XX). Conversely, this would be very difficult if not impossible for a bot or other hacking-type algorithm to discern the correct answer(s).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0230">To provide further protection, the location data used could be selected randomly from the historical data store both in time and/or place. A live, real-time, or near-live/real-time (e.g., only a few seconds, minutes, hours-old, etc.) stream or recording could also be used, requiring the user to relatively instantaneously or instantly recognize images not seen or recorded anywhere else because they are happening now or just happened.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0231">In exemplary embodiments associated with addiction, there are additional location-based security embodiments above and beyond (or particularly tailored) to addiction-related issues and/or data sensitivity. For example, one or more specific persons may be provided with control of a location-key that is based on some personal information of the addict and/or support person(s). This key could be relatively static, changing relatively infrequently, or dynamic, changing perhaps every day or even hour. The premise is that much-even most-of an addict's data will go unused or used very infrequently-thus it is not necessary to have a commonly-known, even easily accessible password or equivalent. Because exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are generally centered around the prevention of relapses/usage of substance or activity, if during a given period of time there has been no usage-related activity, there is little reason to retain that information once key addict location/context/behavior information (such as rewards-eligible behavior calculations) has been extracted. Once the data has been fully used, it can then be erased in a Snapchat-like manner or archived with a location-based password or key, or pointer to who has the password or key. Or, portions of the data could be randomly selected (or selected based on the user's memory profile) and stored for future verification/location-based security purposes. Depending on the addict, addict-situation, controller or controller-situation, or other factors such as court-orders or law enforcement requirements, knowledge of and/or access to location/context-related keys could be bypassed (or enhanced) to make it easier (or more difficult) for an addict's location/context data to be readily accessed. In certain circumstances, the addict's consent could be an absolute requirement for anyone to access the data&#x2014;in other circumstances (e.g., court orders) the addict's consent might not be required at all.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0232">The duration or longevity of location/context-related data, particularly addiction-related data, is also significant. As indicated in the process flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, not all location/context data would be stored indefinitely. To the contrary, once the utility of an addict's location/context data has been fully utilized&#x2014;either in detecting and/or preventing and/or dealing with a high risk/relapse situation, or learning/adjusting/modifying applicable learning mechanisms, as well as rewards, there may not be any reason to (continue to) store the data and thus can be deleted in Snapchat-type fashion. On the other hand, if there is a longer-term reason to store such data (court orders, a desire by the addict to journal addiction recovery, etc.), then location/context-based privacy and security measures would be put in place.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0233">If location/context data for an addict is indeed archived, in general it should not be easy to retrieve and be extension very difficult for non-authorized persons or programs to access. Location-based security, with different pieces of historical data protected by different location-based security mechanisms and passwords known to different persons, would achieve this high level of protection. To resurrect a 24-hour period for example may require location-based passwords from several different people&#x2014;an electronic version of old-style bank lockboxes that require multiple keys to be inserted at the same time to open the box. Instead, to retrieve the location data from February 18, 20XX for addict A, it may require location-based passwords from the three different addict controllers that were on-duty that day, as well as the addict themselves, to reassemble/reconstruct that day.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0234">Images used in a visual matching scheme such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> need not be ones actually taken in photo form by a user or otherwise captured in a graphical form. For example, if the user had been detected at being at the intersection of Santa Monica Blvd and Sophie Street within an acceptable time frame (according to the user's memory profile), a street sign could be generated showing a street intersection sign image. Such images could even be generated using even more abstract mechanisms, such as a mileage street sign showing how far to certain locations could be derived by a visited location, then displayed in visual form. For example, if a person was in Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 2 months ago, and their profile allows for vacation locations within the last year to be used, a street sign could be shown that says 204 miles to Miami, 74 miles to Tampa, etc.&#x2014;those being the mileages between Orlando and those cities. Thus, an image-based location key could be generated just using a visited location or latitude/longitude.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0235">The image selection process for the above embodiments can be simplistic or very difficult. On the simplistic end, for example, only one of several images could be valid. On the difficult end, several could be valid, but they must be selected in order of oldest to newest (or vice versa). The latter, for example, could be images (pictures, addresses, etc.) of previous home locations, pets (that were only alive at a certain property), etc. that only the user is likely to readily know in the proper sequence, yet not require little additional effort by the user to actually remember. Thus, it would be possible to create a very complex password or verification sequence, yet easy for the user to understand, and nearly impossible for an outside party to know, at least without extensive research. A time or other context-based limit to provide the answers could be included in the verification algorithm to prevent such research from successfully taking place.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0236">Another exemplary embodiment or variation of the present disclosure uses 3-dimensional, jigsaw-type verification. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b></figref>, a location or context can be divided into numerous pieces, then scrambled similar to a (2D or 3D) jigsaw puzzle, requiring the entire puzzle to be solved, only certain pieces of it solved, or solved for a particular type of solution, theme, and/or in a given time-sequence for example. The general philosophy behind such puzzle approaches is that it becomes progressively (even exponentially) more difficult for a human/entity not familiar with the locations/contexts involved to solve the puzzle, while being only incrementally more difficult for those humans/entities who are familiar with the locations/contexts involved.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0237">That said, it is possible to use location-based concepts in the generation of a traditional password. For example, if the first 9 images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> were offered as possible answers to a verification question/statement, and there were only two correct images out of the 9, with each frame being assigned a value from 1 to 9, then a point score could be calculated based on the values assigned to each image. A simple example would be if the two correct images had a value of 3 and 7, respectively, the resulting key/password could be thirty-seven (concatenation of the values) or twenty-one (the multiple). That traditional password adding potential capitalization and/or numbers, such as &#x201c;Thirtyseven37&#x201d;, could then be used by the various addiction (or other verification) analytical systems in accessing active data.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0238">The various exemplary embodiments described above may provide an extremely sophisticated capability that establishes and systemically enforces privacy policies to support a balance of functionality and privacy. There are at least two main types of privacy policy scenarios that may be established and enforced. The first is where the addict voluntarily signs up for functionality as disclosed herein. For such a scenario and associated policy, many of the more severe elements of such functionality may be made optional, such as disabling payment mechanisms, etc. A second scenario is an involuntary sign up of an addict by other parties with the legal right, such as by parents of minors, via judicial judgments, etc. In such cases, the functionality to be activated may be decided by those parties with or without the addict's consent or even without their knowledge (if deemed legal). Various exemplary embodiments may support and, in some cases, require the coordination and integration of privacy and/or security policies and systems by a host of parties: application(s) as disclosed herein; financial entities; support group entities (e.g., AA, etc.), public safety and law enforcement entities; education entities (e.g., for teens, etc.); retail/wholesale chains and individual stores, service areas (e.g., movie theaters, etc.) and services; individuals, and the like.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0239">Various exemplary embodiments may provide functionality specific to a given demographic. One example of this is for teenagers. Teenagers, and especially teenage addicts&#x2014;regardless of their addiction (though usually drugs or alcohol)&#x2014;can have triggers and influencers in their lives that are particularly distinct from other demographic categories: high school angst, peer pressure, parental pressure, academic pressure, sexuality issues, not to mention that most of the mechanisms for enabling the addiction to begin with are illegal. Also, many addicts in that age demographic have not reached the conclusion that they are an addict, let alone think they need help. They also are much more likely to be technically savvy, which can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they would likely be loath to give up/not use those devices/mechanisms that various embodiments may utilize (e.g., teenagers in this day and age are almost tethered at the hip with their cell phone, with one of the most often used disciplinary methods used by parents is taking away their cell phone privileges). On the other hand, teenagers are one of if not the most inventive demographic in getting around technical issues and constraints on their activities. It is anticipated that teenagers may represent a significant percentage of involuntary users of various embodiments. Accordingly, in an example embodiment, social networks may be used in detecting true friends (non-addicts or non-enablers) with those who are technically friends in an addict's network but are recognized by the addict, his family, and/or other entities (e.g., judicial system, etc.) to be a negative influence on the addict. For example, permission may be given by these friends (particularly the negative type) to transfer, copy, or otherwise apply that permission for the addict to track the friend to the application of the example embodiment. Thus, the negative friend's location could be used in the example embodiment to help the addict stay away from that so-called friend. This could be done with or without the addict's and/or the friend's permission, e.g., supporting the voluntary and involuntary privacy scenarios described above.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0240">Unlike smoking where addiction may occur relatively immediately, alcoholism generally takes much longer and is much more nuanced in its progression, hence alcoholics may have very long periods of denial. In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, sensors and other mechanisms may be utilized for alcoholism testing for a person consciously or not and/or with or without the person's consent.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0241">In various exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, various functionalities described herein may be integrated as a whole or in part, e.g., into one or more methods, mechanisms, and/or applications. While any individual element above could be implemented individually, it is anticipated that much of the value of embodiments of the present disclosure is in the integration of the above, in whole or in part, to accommodate the wide range of addiction enablers and alternatives, and the various technology platforms that could be involved. Such integration may include other applications such as family finders, social networking applications, weather monitoring, navigation applications, Facebook, Groupon, etc. Various embodiments can provide ways in which to make the most of the moment of value, e.g., at times and/or in context where an addict is in significant danger of relapsing.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0242">That said, many features/aspects of the present disclosure are also anticipated to be of applicability to non-addicts or partially addict-related scenarios, such as persons with common medical conditions, sports enthusiasts, dating websites, law enforcement (e.g., additional functionality/flexibility beyond just GPS bracelets, providing other flexibility to the judicial system such providing innovative options to judges in DUI cases to revoke their parole if they are found to have stopped at a liquor store, etc.), medical applications, insurance applications, employee verification, medical alerts, amber alerts, suicide prevention, etc. For example, blood alcohol sensors may indicate a relapse by an alcoholic. Any one or more triggers as disclosed herein may also or instead be used to identify an increasing suicide risk and be monitored accordingly.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0243">All of the above covers one or more addictions; a substantial portion of the addict community has more than one addiction. Also, it covers addictions that may be replaced by others, such as replacing alcohol with caffeine and/or sugar.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0244">Exemplary embodiments are disclosed of systems and methods of using location, context, and/or one or more communication networks for monitoring for, preempting, and/or mitigating pre-identified behavior.

The systems and methods may include providing information/feedback and support to those parolees or other persons and/or applications to help in the modification of the parolee's location, context, and/or behavior/triggers before a violation occurs, or, if need be, preemptively responding to violations about to occur or in progress with actions geared towards providing information about locations, contexts, and/or behaviors to the appropriate authorities or other interested persons to help in their recapture and overall limiting of damage to the public and themselves.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0285">Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may enable new ways of sentencing or assigning parole or probation conditions (&#x201c;sentencing options&#x201d;), which are otherwise not possible or available today. Examples include sentencing DUI or DWI offenders to no drinking of alcohol or even being near alcohol or near those who have been drinking; prohibiting driving a vehicle under certain conditions such as being angry, being in traffic, or having drank alcohol; prohibiting drug offenders from being near high-risk crime (drug dealing) areas as well as drug-dealing &#x201c;friends&#x201d;; or identifying when a parolee (such as a sex offender) uses the Internet, watches inappropriate programming, or plays (e.g., violent, etc.) games. There is no limit to the types of sentences, or parole/probation conditions that could be enabled that are not possible or available today. Some examples, while unusual, are indicative of new possibilities that could have a major and/or positive impact on the parolee depending on the crime/violation involved. Examples include prohibiting/restricting participation in certain hobbies; not allowing drinking and/or smoking; performing public service activities with very specific times/permissible activities and/or with particular people; not being allowed to get angry or frustrated under any conditions or under certain conditions, places, and/or times; being required to attend and participate in AA (alcoholics anonymous) meetings and confirming/verifying such attendance and participation via exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure not just relying upon paperwork signed for the AA meeting; getting at least eight hours of sleep a night and never watching anything rated more violent than PG; interacting personally with certain people at least once a day; not playing video (e.g., Xbox, PS4, etc.) games with certain persons at certain times of day over certain amounts of time; requiring a clean residence at all times; not viewing (in any form) any sports events; eating at least two balanced meals a day; not getting excited/angry/frustrated while performing a job; not listening to certain kinds of music (e.g., sexually violent rap music, etc.); not engaging in any sort of activity that could be deemed sexually harassing; never yelling at your spouse, ex-spouse, and/or children, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0286">Beyond these types of new sentencing options, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may enable new ways of monitoring, tracking, analyzing, interpreting, and acting upon behavior and context data (&#x201c;trigger data&#x201d;) from and/or about those monitored person(s). It may include tailoring sensor and other data collection mechanisms specifically towards a parolee's trigger history and profile (and predicated to some degree on the violations/crimes involved) including key vulnerabilities or other aspects that contributed to past crimes or may contribute to violations of sentencing in the future&#x2014;and new ways of analyzing that data, as well as new ways of providing information/feedback about the monitored person(s) to third parties&#x2014;not just to law enforcement-related such as parole officers, but also to support persons that can assist the parolees/prisoners, as well as to parolee/prisoners themselves to help them &#x201c;self-correct&#x201d; their behavior preemptively, before it reaches violation status.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0287">Particularly important is monitoring/measuring/calculating key activity/behavior &#x201c;triggers&#x201d; that might cause a violation. Triggers can be defined as &#x201c;situations, circumstances, activities, events, contexts, mental thought processes and/or frame-of-minds that tempt or cause a parolee to want to engage in an activity or behavior known or identified to be detrimental to the parolee and/or others.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0265" num="0288">Such behaviors and triggers that could potentially be monitored/measured/preempted/modified/subject to violation include anger levels (e.g., relevant to general anger-based crimes, etc.), anxiety/pain-related issues (e.g., drug usage/theft, etc.), frustration-related specific issues (e.g., road range, etc.), excitement levels (e.g., thrill seekers, etc.), hunger levels (e.g., theft, etc.), money issues (e.g., theft, drug distribution, etc.), associates/friends (e.g., peer pressure-related crimes, etc.), relative issues (e.g., assault etc.), sexual activity (e.g., sexual crimes, etc.). Indeed, to the extent that a parolee/prisoner argued in his/her trial(s) that a &#x201c;certain thing&#x201d; caused the crime to be committed, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may thus enable monitoring (e.g., by the court, etc.) for that &#x201c;certain thing&#x201d; (e.g., behavior, activity, or even mindset or frame of mind, etc.) not possible or available today.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0289">The feedback and information provided (e.g., real-time, etc.) to third parties such as support persons include descriptions of key locations, contexts, behaviors, incidents, and/or events such as parole violations or violations &#x201c;in process&#x201d;, including historical information about such behaviors/triggers. More importantly, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may provide pre-identified recommendations for, enablement of, and/or automatic execution of pre-identified actions and/or activities that would preemptively mitigate/change his/her location, context, and/or behavior before it reaches violation status. The feedback to the parolees, support persons, or law enforcement could include warnings about &#x201c;in process&#x201d; violations, disturbing trends, or other aspects of the monitored person(s) location, context, and/or behavior that have the potential of being reversed or corrected before it reaches violation status, along with specific actions based on the parolee's past or present behavior or anticipated future behavior.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0290">In total, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein enable new sentencing options; preemptive tailored/personalized monitoring of behavior, context, and triggers; use of support resources; knowledge of a parolee's triggers and those actions that may preempt/prevent/mitigate negative triggers, and the developing of actions based on all of the above to prevent/mitigate recidivism/relapse of the parolee would provide great benefits to the public and to the parolees/offenders/violators themselves. In the unfortunate case that such violations do occur, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may also provide new ways of preemptively aiding in apprehension of the violator and in general preventing/mitigating any additional damage to the public.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0291">Previous inventions in the parolee/prisoner tracking field have focused on GPS-based centralized tracking, monitoring, and detection of location-based violations, such as violating home detention or being in proximity to forbidden areas such as schools, spouse, or businesses. The reliance on GPS, such as in a GPS ankle bracelet, which in itself is susceptible to tampering, in such prior inventions has been inherently limited, as GPS generally does not work well indoors, and even outdoors it is susceptible to a variety of factors that can result in inaccuracies of 50 meters or more, limiting applications and use cases and even potentially resulting in erroneous alarms. The reliance on centralized monitoring of the monitored person has also caused a variety of issues (e.g., if the parole officer is on vacation with no backup, etc.), as has reliance on tamper-detection capability on a GPS ankle bracelet which can provide no benefits if the monitored person decides he/she doesn't care anymore and decides to go on a non-tracked crime spree.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0292">The focus on the location of a monitored person has resulted in limited attention being given to the least tangible aspects of the monitored person's life, particularly their mindset/frame-of-mind (such as being able to monitor their anger levels), as well as their broader activities and behavior while they are inside their home or other &#x201c;confined&#x201d; area (where GPS doesn't work). To the degree that such activities/behavior has been focused on, it has been for the hastening/accelerating of potential violations&#x2014;not for purposes of preempting such a violation, or even proactively enlisting a support network to modify the parolee's/prisoner's behavior before it becomes a real or actual violation-worthy problem. Finally, the security of parolee/prisoner information has generally been assumed to be secure and/or of little interest to anyone outside law enforcement; such an assumption today and going forward will likely be incorrect; in the future &#x201c;stewards&#x201d; of a parolee's data could be others such as support personnel keenly interested in preventing the parolee from having his sentence invoked or parole/probation revoked.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0293">After recognizing the above issues, drawbacks, and obstacles with parolee monitoring and tracking, exemplary embodiments were developed and/or are disclosed herein that may address all of the above-noted parolee monitoring and tracking issues, drawbacks, or obstacles. As disclosed herein, exemplary embodiments may provide more comprehensive, more accurate, more preemptive, and more supportive monitoring and tracking, through one or more of the following elements:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0294">Deploying and monitoring indoor and wearable sensors connected via an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0295">Use of the IoT network to decentralize or otherwise monitor &#x201c;at-the-edge&#x201d; potential rule breaking and other concerns.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0296">Leveraging of other networks and environments (inside and outside, even ones without electronic or physical access by the parolee), for the purpose of behavior/activity assessment and analysis.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0297">Connection to other sensor-based networks to provide broader, seamless, 24/7, anywhere/any time monitoring to prevent a violation at any time, in any circumstance.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0298">Using pre-identified prevention/preempting behavior and context-based &#x201c;triggers&#x201d; to appropriate select and calibrate an appropriate subset of sensors (from a wide range of sensors, across all networks and environments), targeted at measuring and calculating/analyzing current behavior versus permitted &#x201c;pre-identified&#x201d; behavior and context, and, as needed relative to historical behavior and context. Examples of triggers include but are not limited to: Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Change, Children, Conflict, Depression, Disorder, Embarrassment, Escape, Envy, Excitement, Fun, Frustration, Guilt, Health issues, Holidays Hunger, Insomnia, Job stress, Loneliness, Mid-life Crises, Money worries, Noise, Overconfidence, Pain, Peer Pressure, feeling Powerful or Powerless, Proximity (e.g., to the substance, etc.), Fear of Quitting (e.g., the substance or activity, etc.), Relationship issues, Relatives, Reminders, Sex, Shopping Situations, Social Situations, Special Occasions, Stress, Taste and Smell, Times of Day, being Tired, being &#x201c;Unfun&#x201d;, being a Victim (e.g., of crime, abuse, etc.), ex-spouses/partners, Yelling, even Season or Weather changes, and/or Music.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0299">This term &#x201c;context&#x201d; as used herein may refer to the situation or circumstances in which a behavior, event, or activity occurs, e.g., the particular setting in which the behavior/event/activity occurs, etc. For example, when attempting to understand behavior, it is important to look at the situation or circumstances present at the time of the behavior. For example, the behavior Anger can be detected through measuring blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, and detection of yelling sounds, and for some people be considered a trigger by itself. But for some other people, in some circumstances, it is particularly valuable to know the context. For example, a person might be in the presence of his ex-spouse, and they may be in an argument. Or, for example, they could be having the argument in a public place on a hot day with no air conditioning. Having this understanding of context, in addition to behavior, helps to select the best preemptive or mitigating actions to cool down the Anger before a violation (e.g., a drinking relapse, etc.) occurs, such as getting the parolee physically away from the ex-spouse as soon as possible and to go cool down in an air conditioned, private place.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0007" num="0300">While there are potentially hundreds of possible addiction triggers (in the form of behaviors, contexts, or both behavior and context combinations), and many thousands of trigger combinations (such as Anger and Loneliness occurring at the same time), exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may emphasize the &#x201c;pre-identification&#x201d; of one or more of these behaviors and/or context-based triggers as a way to select, calibrate, and analyze various sensor and sensor network data collection of various pre-identified individuals, and to select and implement pre-identified actions based on those behaviors and/or context-based triggers to maximize the potential of preventing a violation or escalation of a violation.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0008" num="0301">Employ a risk-detection and action/activation system that provides an &#x201c;early-warning-system&#x201d; for early detection of adverse triggers such as &#x201c;wrong or adverse&#x201d; behavior, &#x201c;wrong or adverse&#x201d; contexts, and/or &#x201c;wrong or adverse behavior and contexts&#x201d;, and implementing a set of actions with appropriate support resources to stop or &#x201c;preempt&#x201d; the parolee by pursuing actions and/or activity that address the triggers (behavior, context, or behavior/context pairings), before it reaches violation status, or if violations have already occurred, preempting any additional damage by the violator.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0009" num="0302">Use of big-data historical data collection and analytics combined with various learning protocols, artificial intelligence systems, neural learning networks, etc. to refine each individual's trigger profile and associated sensors/sensor settings, as well as continually improve actions and their effectiveness in preempting unwanted behavior. Such systems/methods can be used in designing and implementing more nuanced or &#x201c;tiered&#x201d; reward/punishment systems (e.g., states between being out on parole or back in prison, etc.), and/or in gaining or losing points depending on the occurrence of performance of pre-identified (good and bad) behavior and/or activities.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0271" num="0303">There are many different embodiments of the present disclosure, but some of the more straightforward use an addiction-related crime, such as a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) arrest or a drug-trafficking charge. Such exemplary embodiments (generally, in increasing order of complexity and sophistication) may include:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0304">1. A person on parole on DUI charges is prohibited from drinking or driving under the influence. A profile is setup flagging those activities, which in turn identifies key sensors to be activated to collect data on Blood Alcohol Content (e.g., breathalyzers included in various devices including the parolee's smartphone, required-wearing sensor bracelet, and in the parolee's home (by the parolee's bed and bathroom sink), etc.). All sensors are setup to collect any detection of alcohol data and immediately report to a central monitoring center (e.g., a rule violation is calculated locally), or the &#x201c;raw&#x201d; data is sent to the center for processing and rule violation checks. Any violation immediately results in a multi-media message to a parole officer that includes the rule violation information as well as supplemental information (e.g., where the violation occurred, where the violator is at presently, and BAC, etc.). Immediate steps are taken to &#x201c;secure&#x201d; the violator, including disabling all of the violator's cars, notifying anyone who has a restraining order against the violator, etc., as well as activating sensor networks outside the violator's immediate location to monitor the violator in case of attempted &#x201c;escape&#x201d;. This includes GPS and/or various geofences (e.g., friends' homes, etc.) to which the violator may attempt to escape on foot.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0305">2. In an exemplary embodiment, an Internet of Things (IoT) network is established in the parolee's home, which besides connecting to (all) the breathalyzers, also connects to sensors on or near any alcohol (liquor cabinet, refrigerator, etc.). A proximity rule is established prohibiting physical contact with any alcohol-related container, such that not only liquor cabinets/wine storage are activated but select refrigerator sensors on all alcohol beverages (e.g., a bar code reader that reads every bottle removed from the refrigerator, etc.), and other bottles of alcohol-containing liquids (e.g., Listerine, etc.). If the IoT/sensor network detects immediate proximity to alcohol by the parolee or monitored person, or such products are moving (e.g., via bar codes, RFID, or motion sensors, etc.), yet there is no indication (yet) of an immediate violation (e.g., BAC content, alcohol-sensitive &#x201c;smell&#x201d; detectors, etc.), then a message is sent out to the person's &#x201c;support network&#x201d; that indicates that the person is (possibly) in imminent violation of parole/release conditions. The underlying logic machine may then analyze the location and other parameters of possible support personnel (such a familiarity with the person's present location) and directs them to immediately contact the person and/or go to that person's location to prevent/preempt the person from actually imbibing in alcohol and thus triggering a violation. If, once the support person visits the monitored person, the support person determines there was a potential violation, but it was stopped in time, then appropriate negative points/demerits are awarded to the monitored person. An accumulated points level of X may result in increased visits from a parole officer or some other punishment.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0306">3. A parolee may be allowed outside the parolee's home for 2 hours from 2-4 p.m. but is not allowed within 100 meters of certain places, such as schools or liquor stores. (Note: Current GPS ankle bracelets often have variability in accuracy, up to over 50 meters or more in certain circumstances). Thus, &#x201c;supplemental&#x201d; readings are needed to collaborate a potential violation. Also, in some situations a GPS ankle bracelet battery life is a concern, thereby providing an incentive to conserve battery life if possible. A &#x201c;wearable&#x201d; (e.g., bracelet, clothes, hat, jewelry, etc.) with a specialized transmitter (that the parolee or monitored person is required to have on his/her person and active) transmits a signal at a certain frequency (and with an identifier) when the parolee leaves home (e.g., it is activated upon crossing a reverse geofence, along with the GPS capability, etc.). The being at-home assurance is done by the home's Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network that ensures that the parolee is at home by using sensor/sensor networks, such as motion sensors during daylight hours, and the use of to-the-outside door sensors that activate/deactivate the GPS bracelet when such an outdoor door is opened/closed.        <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0307">Once outside, with the GPS activated and the proximity transmitter transmitting, the parolee runs a variety of errands. But if during the errands, the parolee or monitored person comes close to a (e.g., forbidden, impermissible, etc.) liquor store, a sensor at the store (which may be in a mall or otherwise indoors along with other stores and thus the GPS would not work well) detects/receives the signal, and records time, place, and identifier, including whether the parolee actually entered the store (e.g., via RFID or other precise egress-detection means, etc.). Alternatively, the bracelet or smartphone on/carried by the parolee detects and records the presence of several Wi-Fi networks (e.g., from the various stores, etc.), along with signal strengths and (if possible) directional information of the signals. A logic program running real-time or after-the-fact does a real-time (local/edge) calculation or (possibly later) sends the data to a central processing server, where a precise location map and breadcrumb trail is developed and analyzed, and determines whether a violation occurred, and if so whether it was only a &#x201c;technical&#x201d; violation (e.g., the parolee was within 50 meters, but did not enter the store, etc.) or a &#x201c;real&#x201d; violation occurred (e.g., actually entering the forbidden or impermissible store, etc.). Because it is possible that the parolee had never entered the mall before, the parolee may have not realized there was a risk of the violation. Therefore, the system would perform a historical analysis to identify any instances of familiarity with the mall. If not, and a &#x201c;technical&#x201d; violation, then the parolee may be let off with a warning or some demerits. If a &#x201c;real&#x201d; violation did occur, the location of the parolee is reported, and the parolee is taken into custody and the body of location evidence used to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the violation indeed took place.</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0308">4. An exemplary embodiment addresses GPS ankle-bracelet tampering and related use cases. There have been numerous incidents of bracelet tampering (which can be difficult to prove that the tampering was deliberately done), or worse where the bracelet was removed and the parolee went on a crime spree, and where the parolee wasn't caught immediately because there was a delay between the tampering and it being detected and acted upon by the appropriate authorities. This exemplary embodiment may thus address these scenarios as follows.        <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0309">A detection of (possible) tampering can be difficult to prove, as it historically relies on physical marks on the bracelet as the key evidence. An exemplary embodiment disclosed herein allows for increasing the body of evidence to prove (or disprove) the tampering, premised on the fact that tampering takes some time to successfully perform. In this exemplary embodiment, the parolee bracelet has a variety of additional sensors detect tampering (including matching pre-identified sounds and vibrations with measurements taken by the bracelet), as well as activating other sensors outside the bracelet upon first (local) detection of possible tampering. Other types of sensors could anticipate potential tampering, such as elevated heart rates or sweat levels.</li>            <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0310">The &#x201c;matching&#x201d; of sounds will result from internal bracelet recordings of sounds and other sound/vibration-based measurements taken when any sort of first indication of tampering occurs, such as a sudden bump of the bracelet (hitting it against something) or &#x201c;clicking&#x201d; (tampering with a screwdriver). With that initial detection, internal recordings of further sounds/vibrations are taken. In addition, any surrounding networks (particularly parolee's home network/IoT network) will be activated with a program to activate/wake up or otherwise increase the frequency of related readings (collectively &#x201c;activating&#x201d;) that could prove (or disprove) the tampering. This includes activation of cameras, audio and vibration sensors, and any other indicators (such as sensors indicating prolonged stay in the garage and/or tool usage).</li>            <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0311">In the case that the parolee doesn't care if the parolee is detected, and cuts it off and takes off, another set of activations occurs, with speed of the essence as well as location precision (particularly for violent/sex offenders, stalkers, or grudge-based or psychotic offenders). Once any &#x201c;full&#x201d; tampering is conclusively (or with high degree of certainty) detected (such as tampering warnings followed by no motion by the bracelet yet other motion detected within the home confinement area), a variety of actions would be activated. The first set of activations would be focused on &#x201c;preemption&#x201d;, e.g., preempting the possibility of escape as well as harm to the public. This kind of preemption includes disabling of any vehicles or automatic locking of doors (e.g., actions that could be controlled locally and activated real-time, etc.), to alerting of nearby (as determined by other sensor networks) law enforcement or support personnel (who while not having apprehension authority, could help in finding and tracking the parolee manually). Alerts would also go out to known places and associates of the parolee, as well as Amber-Alert type notifications (e.g., broadcast, etc.) to the parolee's past victims and the general public, which could include photos and videos and other descriptors.</li>            <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0312">In addition, communications with the cell phone carrier and other communications providers of the parolee would be made, and real-time &#x201c;pinging&#x201d; of the parolee's device(s) started, as well as &#x201c;activation&#x201d; of any nearby (according to last position) sensor networks that could potentially help detect an on-the-run parolee. Real-time pinging allows use of device GPS to provide real-time, precise locations, in contrast with other methods that provide less accurate cell-tower based location estimates. In the event the parolee doesn't have such a device with the parolee, a continually updating ring of sensor networks would assist in obtaining at least a somewhat accurate location of the parolee. Real-time pinging currently requires a court order. Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure envision a streamlined process for obtaining such an order in near-real time by packaging the evidence and presenting to a judge or judge equivalent for sign-off, then activating a pre-setup application interface to the carrier's systems to enable and report real-time GPS pinging.</li>            <li id="ul0012-0005" num="0313">Any responses to the alerts would be automatically compiled and analyzed, with a continually updated set of locations provided to appropriate humans and other tracking applications (particularly important if parolee is in a vehicle despite the preempting efforts).</li>            <li id="ul0012-0006" num="0314">In any tampering scenario, it would be beneficial for all concerned to preempt any tampering allegation, by immediately providing feedback to the parolee that tampering is being perceived, thus serving as a deterrent to further attempts. This preempting could be provided via a variety of scenarios, including alarms or vibrations from the bracelet, automated messages via the parolee's smart phone, etc. The interfaces could further include activating various alarm-type mechanisms within the environment where the parolee is at the time, such as the parolee's home (e.g., via an Internet of Things network, etc.), such as a locking of doors or turning on of speakers or video to broadcast a message, etc. A key part is to anticipate the appropriate types of interface(s) to communicate with the parolee in order to maximize its speed and effectiveness, such as keeping &#x201c;track&#x201d; of what types of devices, mechanisms, and interfaces are currently (or most recently used) by the parolee, such as using the parolee's phone (immediately sending text/MMS messages, instant messaging, or phone calls; using the parolee's surfing the Internet (via desktop computer) (immediately enabling a Skype/Facetime session); watching TV (breaking in to the video feed with a pre-broadcast warning message); sending messages (even disorienting ones) to displays such as Google Glass; activating pain/discomfort-based &#x201c;messages&#x201d; in the form of shocks, intolerable noises, or even sedative drugs; displaying pre-recorded (or real-time) holographic images by doorways via projection mechanisms if the parolee is in the process of leaving the house, etc. The key is to identify and focus on the interfaces (and appropriate actions) that will preempt/deter the potential violator from making things any worse.</li>            <li id="ul0012-0007" num="0315">Once the parolee has been precisely located (either as a result of the preemptive actions or &#x201c;reactive&#x201d; locating efforts), the parolee may then be &#x201c;followed&#x201d; (e.g., continuing to report the location to law enforcement, etc.), as well as continually calculating or anticipating possible &#x201c;future&#x201d; locations (e.g., based on past behavior stored by, obtained by, or accessed by this exemplary embodiment, etc.) and activating appropriate preemptive inhibitors to escape, such as if the parolee is approaching the home or residence of the parolee ex-spouse and may have the ex-spouse's car keys, in which the ex-spouse's car may then be disabled according to exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0272" num="0316">There are numerous other exemplary embodiments associated with this present disclosure. Some of the more common violations that could benefit from such exemplary embodiments include possession, use, and/or intent to distribute (or arrange distribution of) controlled substances, theft, Driving Under the Influence (DUI), aggravated assault (e.g., assault related to original/prior convictions, particularly sex/child-related, other forms of assault, etc.), receiving stolen goods, etc.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0317">Parolees and/or prisoners on some sort of controlled/temporary release are subject to significant rules that, if violated, will result in parole being revoked or modified, and/or privileges being revoked/modified. Such rules include but are not limited to curfew violations, committing of (additional) misdemeanor/felonies, not reporting to a parole officer, crossing state lines, or otherwise moving outside prescribed boundaries, substance usage/abuse, associating with specific person(s), violating court orders or other court mandated boundaries, off-limits, or non-interaction, use of vehicles, etc. Many of these rules/restrictions are location-oriented (and currently detectable), but behavioral violations are limited to rules that can only be detected by specific, controlled tests (such as drug testing, etc.). Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein provide the ability to detect a much greater range and types of behaviors/contexts (triggers), allowing more flexibility and/or precision in rule settings by law enforcement/judicial bodies, as well as the ability to monitor such behaviors to assist the parolee/prisoner in avoiding such behaviors before they reach violation status. Such triggers that could potentially be monitored, measured, preempted, modified, and/or subject to violation include anger levels (e.g., relevant to general anger-based crimes, etc.), anxiety/pain-related issues (e.g., drug usage/theft, etc.), frustration-related specific issues (e.g., road range, etc.), excitement levels (e.g., thrill seekers, etc.), hunger levels (e.g., theft, etc.), money issues (e.g., theft, drug distribution, etc.), associates/&#x201c;friends&#x201d; (e.g., peer pressure-related crimes, etc.), relative issues (e.g., various, particularly assault, etc.), sexual activity (e.g., sexual crimes, etc.), etc. To the extent that a parolee/prisoner blamed a &#x201c;certain thing&#x201d; for causing the crime to be committed, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein enable monitoring (e.g., by the court, etc.) of such a &#x201c;certain thing&#x201d; that historically has not been otherwise detectable, measurable, or practical for some technological or other reason.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0318">The collection and monitoring of such information, of course, has the potential of being &#x201c;big brother&#x201d; on steroids, measuring and monitoring the behavior of a person close to 24/7. To protect the rights and privacy of those persons, it is critical to provide the appropriate level of security to such information. Unfortunately, today's security mechanisms are vulnerable to hacking or other types of abuse. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may use a variety of individual and/or layers of security mechanisms and/or blockchain technology to record such transaction with the appropriate keys to &#x201c;unlock&#x201d; full data sets only to the appropriate persons and only for behavior/location/context issues. Control of these keys/unlocking capabilities will have many forms depending on the parolee, crime, triggers, and other factors, but in general multiple types of humans (and even machines) may be such data &#x201c;stewards&#x201d; such as law enforcement, judicial members, support members, medical personnel, etc. An exemplary embodiment may include one or more systems and methods for providing location-based security and/or privacy for restricting user access as disclosed above.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0319">One exemplary embodiment may include monitoring for, preempting, and/or mitigating pre-identified behavior, particularly substance use as disclosed herein. This exemplary embodiment may thus utilize methods and systems disclosed above to preempt (to the degree possible) a relapse by the parolee/prisoner, just as it would an addict, through various mechanisms such as use of support personnel, safe spaces, and identification and execution of actions as alternatives to drinking or using drugs. A further distinction may be that in the event of a relapse (e.g., usage, etc.), various alarms may be triggered to appropriately inform law enforcement personnel, but ideally before this would happen utilizing the preemptive measures and support resources of the present disclosure to prevent the relapse from occurring or worsening.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0320">An exemplary embodiment includes the detection and preemption of activities associated with associating with disreputable persons, potentially including an increased risk of performing a violation with those persons such as distributing drugs. This exemplary embodiment draws not only on the location of the parolee/prisoner but extends that knowledge to anticipating the context (what they are doing, how they are doing it) in addition to the location (where, and when), to understand the why. This is supplemented with external data sources, such as social media postings and purchases, and (if available) similar information from those &#x201c;associates&#x201d; to compare the data sets to detect any potentially rule-breaking associations.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0321">An exemplary embodiment includes the detection and preemption of driving under the influence (of drugs or alcohol), a major cause of parole violations. The sensors in, on, and/or associated with the person will enable detection of an &#x201c;in progress&#x201d; violation, not only by &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; methods (e.g., blood alcohol content or similar methods, etc.), as well as detection of location, context, and/or behavior that &#x201c;anticipates&#x201d; such behavior, such as driving near/stopping by a liquor store or by known areas of drug dealing, as well as combining such information with locations of other persons known to be associated with the person's prior violations. The location of such 3<sup>rd </sup>persons could be determined by similar or other tracking mechanisms, as well as detection of such 3rd person's proximity &#x201c;signatures&#x201d; in the form of their device transmissions, attempts at peer-to-peer communications, monitoring of social media location postings, etc. Such &#x201c;mashups&#x201d; enable early detection of high-risk situations that could avoid an actual violation (and associated potential damage). Support can take many forms, such as automatic facial recognition.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0322">One form of unique identification is facial recognition. An exemplary embodiment may include the use of crowdsourcing image/video recognition/profile scanning to extend the reach of a victim's network. For example, the victim's device could connect to any devices within range of the victim's device and use their image/video/profile scan applications (obtaining distinct, even unique elements in a person's facial structure) to &#x201c;scan&#x201d; the environment around those devices. In turn, the images/videos/profile scans would be compared to data for the perpetrator to identify a match or probability of a match, and report this back to the victim. This concept can be extended to where the victim is going in the future, in order to obtain an &#x201c;all clear&#x201d; status. Such information (e.g., perpetrator in the vicinity of the victim despite the court order, etc.) is anticipated to be used to prove violations in court.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0323">An exemplary embodiment includes the prevention/preemption of the parolee/prisoner from coming in contact with banned persons (e.g., court order, restraining order, etc.) or types/classes of people (e.g., minor children, etc.). This exemplary embodiment may enable more precise location determination via non-GPS technologies, allowing more specificity in court orders as well as evidence in violations. It also allows variations in behavior in court orders in addition to or instead of location, such as proscribing the non-allowance of Anger (with associated readings such as blood pressure and skin temperature levels combined with proximity to the spouse, for example), as well as early detection of &#x201c;in progress&#x201d; violations such as rising Anger that would trigger the intervention of support personnel to prevent Anger from passing certain thresholds and thus trigger a violation. Sexual parolees or those convicted but have served their time, but still have to register as a sex offender, could be monitored as part of their release. Sensors in this exemplary embodiment may be used to detect rising testosterone levels, or interfaces with mobile and/or fixed devices could monitor web activity to detect any porn or sexual content related to the original offense(s). Such sensor readings/activity could trigger support response to intervene before levels reach a point where the person reaches violation status (such as being tempted to get in proximity to a school). Alternatively, such &#x201c;pre-crime&#x201d; readings/activity could initiate a medical response such as automatic administering of testosterone-reducing drug, for example, or other medicine designed to reduce sexual desire. If such support/medical response(s) in response to a rising risk of &#x201c;relapse&#x201d; are not successful, then an alarm could be sent to the appropriate authority to apprehend the person for temporary &#x201c;safe-keeping&#x201d; until the risk has passed. The information sent would include the location of the person and the nearest &#x201c;safekeeping&#x201d; facility, which may or may not be a formal incarceration facility.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0324">While the use of bracelets and other &#x201c;wearable&#x201d; technologies for the tracking of individual persons with specific location-related crime and/or parole-oriented limitations is known, there are many situations where the person involved has not actually been charged with a crime and/or the accused is not legally enforceable to include such an object on or near their person. The use of Restraining Orders to prevent stalking and other personal-interaction crimes and issues is an example. While victims of such personal violations can obtain such orders, generally the evidence of an actual crime is not egregious enough (or not criminal in nature) to warrant a judge ordering the stalker to wear such an object. This exemplary embodiment may enable the ability to track the &#x201c;criminal&#x201d; in a way that does not require such a wearable object. There are ways to do this via exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. A first way is for a court or other entity to order that an application be activated (associated with this disclosure), and to be put on the perpetuator's phone and other devices. The above instance may have a couple limitations, such as requiring access to (and permission of) the perpetuator's devices for such applications to be installed. The functionality of this part of the capabilities on the perpetuator would include monitoring the location, context, and/or behavior of the perpetuator as it relates specifically to the victim.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0325">For example, in the case of ex-spouses/partners etc. it may be that the victim is most at risk in cases where the perpetuator becomes in an angry state, and/or when drinking. Other aspects described herein would seek to monitor/detect. While a court can do this, there are ways around it, notably obtaining other devices (e.g., replacement phones, etc.), or to just not use or turn off devices with the application on it. While it is possible to detect such &#x201c;active non-usage&#x201d;, it would be cumbersome to monitor and report said non-usage and to seek remedies. A better, if potentially less precise way of generating a &#x201c;perpetuator alarm&#x201d; is to use the sensors and other detection capabilities around the victim in order to detect the presence of the perpetuator. Specifically, the victim will &#x201c;calibrate&#x201d; the sensors and other controllable technologies to look for a &#x201c;signature&#x201d; of the perpetrator and use that to warn him/her of a rising risk situation. Such a signature could come in many forms. One form may include an identifier id or node address that uniquely identifies the perpetuator, either &#x201c;truly unique&#x201d; (such as a phone SSID or unique bracelet/wearable Identification Number, etc.), or a &#x201c;relative&#x201d; unique address that enables clear identification within the context of the victim, such as the victim's network, peer-to-peer communications with the victim's device, a &#x201c;victim network&#x201d;, a &#x201c;perpetuator network&#x201d;, a &#x201c;crime&#x201d; network (e.g., theft in Missouri/Illinois, etc.) or some other network that in combination with a device identifier is able to uniquely identify the perpetuator. Various other limitations could be included such as time-based parameters that would both help to uniquely identify the perpetrator as well as provide a degree of privacy (e.g., the perpetuator would only be identifiable while the court order was in force, etc.). Because such unique IDs are either not broadcast or otherwise communicated outside a cellular network (such as a SSID), such a unique ID could be obtained in various other ways.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0326">An exemplary embodiment may include the use of beacons. Historically, beacons have been used as one-way transmitters, typically attached to a wall in a room or other defined space and used to trigger sensors in a phone or badge. Because beacons generally have limited range, a phone or device receiving a beacon transmission is by definition in the vicinity of the beacon, such as in a particular room, etc. The phone/device can then by itself or with other location determination systems infrastructure report the location to the infrastructure or other types of location services.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0327">Exemplary embodiments may use the above type of real-time location service, but it is generally limited to a defined space, such as a hospital or campus, etc. As such, it has limited utility in terms of warning a victim if a perpetrator is anywhere else but that campus, hospital, or other defined space. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may include a beacon on, in, or around the perpetuator's device, and will use that infrastructure to broadcast a signal uniquely identifying the perpetuators device. Once properly equipped, the perpetuator will be unable to silence the beacon (potentially even while off) and will likely have longer range than today's beacons. In fact, the beacon range could be set to a predetermined distance consistent with a court ruling, e.g., not within 1000 feet of the victim, etc. In turn, the victim's device(s) will be set to detect such beacons, as well as the individual perpetrator&#x2018;s&#x2019; ID, which if &#x201c;heard&#x201d; by the victim's device means that the court order was violated. And, in turn, the victim's device can automatically inform law enforcement, which can then use its own methods for precisely locating the perpetrator. A refinement could be a 2-way beacon in the perpetrator's device, which could inform perpetrator that the perpetrator is violating the order (presumably it being done innocently/inadvertently), so that the perpetrator can quickly move away from the victim. For example, the perpetrator could perhaps be given a 2-minute lead time before the perpetrator is considered to be in violation.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0328">An exemplary embodiment may utilize the &#x201c;natural&#x201d; tracking capabilities of wireless carriers. As part of their normal function, carriers need to keep constant track of where every subscriber is (that has their device(s) powered on), to be ready to connect at a call, text, or data session at any time, to be able to hand off to the nearest available tower when the subscriber is moving, and for billing purposes. The part of the process that tracks the subscriber (specifically, tracks the cell tower that the subscriber is connected to at any one time) is through the use of a Home Location Register (HLR) and a Visitor Location Register (VLR). As part of the call setup process, the HLR and VLR are checked and updates to reflect the device's location. An exemplary embodiment may modify this process in at least one of several ways. The first is once the carrier is informed that a subscriber has a court restraining order against the subscriber that has a location limit(s) to one or more location and/or other devices/subscribers, an indicator of such an order may be provided, in the form of a flag or other database table element, to indicate there is such an order. Additional information could also be included in the HLR/VLR, such as duration of the order, the locations/devices/subscribers they involve, and the respective location ranges. Every time a carrier &#x201c;sees&#x201d; a request to setup a call or terminate a call, if such a flag is set, the carrier will output the device's location to an external software interface, (possibly) along with the additional information such as devices/numbers/IMEI of persons who may need to be notified. A location lookup of the victim(s) phone current location may then be initiated, as well as other potentially applicable locations (e.g., victim's home or work, school, etc.), and compare the locations and determine if the terms of the order are being violated, such as being within 1 mile of the victim or the victims/home or work. If so, appropriate action could be taken by the applicable law enforcement, but on an immediate basis the victim will know to move their own location immediately to stay out of harm's way.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0329">One issue with this approach is while the victim's location can be precisely determined by the GPS in their device, the perpetuator's phone is being located by cell tower. There are several potential solutions to enhance the perpetuator's accuracy. The first is for the victim software to execute a &#x201c;network initiated&#x201d; request to the carrier for a more precise location. This could be done through location pinging capabilities already done for law enforcement purposes, or, alternatively, using an application similar to those used by family tracking applications. Another is utilizing the software and/or methods described earlier that resides on the perpetrator's phone. In this instance, the idea is that the HLR/VLR serves as an &#x201c;early warning indicator&#x201d; for the victim, and also as a legal initiating to a process to obtain a more precise location, through various means, e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, beacon, RTLS, etc.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0330">An exemplary embodiment may be configured to be involved with stalking or boundary sentences such as not leaving the state. The detection of absconding or otherwise leaving an area that a court has required a person to stay within is generally a straightforward process and system in the form of a geofence and a reporting of a violation of that geofence to the appropriate authorities. But preempting such a violation or anticipating it in the act (before crossing the geofence boundary) is another matter, one addressed by exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. Once a parolee/prisoner is anticipated to be at or above some level of absconding risk (generally at time of parole/release), tracking of movements and behavior begins using applications on the person's phone and potentially on wearables (e.g., bracelet, etc.) mandated to be worn. Such devices/wearables can generate a significant amount of data about movements/activities of the person, and over time can begin to detect/develop patterns as to how the person is living their lives. A material change in this activity can be an indicator of uncertainty or confusion on part of the person&#x2014;a mindset that often precedes serious, non-common-sensical actions like fleeing the area (absconders are nearly always hit with a much worse penalty than they would have received if they had stayed for the original offense sentencing).</p><p id="p-0287" num="0331">But &#x201c;forcing&#x201d; a person who has little desire to wear something or allow operation on their phone is a real problem, particularly if remedies require the victim constantly going back to court to enforce the terms of the restraining order. If the perpetuator can be monitored without active involvement on their part, this would be ideal. Exemplary embodiments disclose such capability, e.g., requiring broadcasting of a specific signature/signal, or requiring the cooperation of the wireless carriers involved.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0332">An exemplary embodiment involves violations/crimes associated with the possession of a gun despite a court order. Detection of such a gun can be done by an exemplary embodiment directly or indirectly. Directly has to do with special locks/sensors attached to gun cases of guns in the possession of the person. An exemplary embodiment enables &#x201c;tripping&#x201d; of such sensors to send alarms to the appropriate support personnel (if such intermediate interventions are allowed in such cases) so that the support personnel can follow-up and see if there is a legitimate reason for the case to be opened/tampered with.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0333">An indirect method includes detection of locations, sounds, or associated &#x201c;damage&#x201d; associated with guns and gun shots. Detecting the person's presence at a gun range is one such potential indicator as are noise detectors that register a gunshot sound (in terms of loudness or type of noise). Sensors tuned to hand residue could detect gunpowder. Any one or more or all of these could be utilized in detecting an &#x201c;In progress&#x201d; possible violation that can then utilize the support network to intervene and failing that notifying the appropriate authorities or support personnel.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0334">An exemplary embodiment involves bail jumping/bond violation and includes detection of and tracking down of bail jumpers (persons on bail that do not meet their court appearance). Such people generally are divided into 2 classes: 1) Accidental, or 2) Deliberate. Accidental are just that&#x2014;they forgot about their court date. In these cases, the bounty hunter has to find the person and bring the person into court to get rebonded and rescheduled. An exemplary embodiment disclosed herein may be tuned to automatically detect such accidental violations and immediately inform bondsman (and hunters) of such violations, as well as the current location/context/behavior and likely locations/contexts/behavior during the next 24-48 hours, based on the person's history since the original bonding, which is tracked via an app on the bondee's phone as a condition of getting the bail. Thus, if the failed bondee usually is bowling Wednesday night, that is likely where the bondee will be the Wednesday after the missed hearing, and the bounty hunter can make appropriate arrangements based on that bowling context. For example, the bounty hunter may wait until after the bondee is finished bowling to avoid embarrassment in front of the bondee's bowling buddies, but before the bondee gets home and the associated embarrassment of arrest in front of the bondee's children.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0335">Exemplary embodiments disclosed above are examples of previous violations/conviction-based location, contest and behavior monitoring, tracking, preempting/prevention, and relapse reporting. But there could also be numerous variations depending on a variety of factors including age (e.g., juvenile, senior, etc.), type of conviction (e.g., felony vs misdemeanor, etc.), level of crime, number of convictions, etc. History (of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, etc.), sexual history/background, whether they are currently employed, degree of financial stability, how long since they last contacted high risk associates, whether they are in counseling and how long, have their own residence and how long (and with whom and associated stability of such persons, etc.), have their own transportation, are in a stable relationship and how long, how long they've been paroled/under supervision, number of convictions, total years served, number of uneventful previous parole violations and problem-free parole years, number/types of previous parole violations, etc. Family and friends support structure and/or the type and degree of counseling/treatment are very important risk elements. For example, a DUI offender currently in closely (separately) monitored residential/inpatient rehab could be consider low risk, low frequency monitoring up to the time until leaving the treatment facility. At that point, their housing and family/friend support structure and employment/training prospects could keep the risk low (if those elements are all favorable) but shoot to high if the home life they are going (back) to is very unpleasant. In which case, it would immediately raise to high risk/high monitoring levels. Other treatment types such as Outpatient, Halfway Houses, and Day Reporting could also have associated risk elements.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0336">Some or all of the above could be computed into a Risk Profile and/or a scoring system that could &#x201c;calibrate&#x201d; the sensitivity of monitoring/tracking/analysis algorithms and algorithms/methods for initiating support of the preemptive actions of possible high-risk violations. Behavior monitoring could even reach areas such as diet monitoring, in case for example low/high blood sugar has been demonstrated to be a high-risk factor of erratic behavior on part of the parolee/prisoner.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0337">In exemplary embodiments, all of the above may be incorporated into different intensities of monitoring. A simple low/med/high intensity schema could serve as a non-limiting tiering.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0338">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be implemented in numerous ways, including (without limitation) as method(s)/process(es), apparatus(es), system(s), composition(s) of matter, computer readable media, such as non-transitory computer readable storage media, and/or computer network(s) wherein program instructions may be sent, e.g., over optical, electronic, wireline, cloud-based, drone-based, Internet, wireless, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, and/or other communications link(s) and combination(s). At least some such implementations may be referred to, e.g., as techniques and/or mechanisms. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0339">Exemplary embodiments are disclosed of systems and methods for monitoring for and preempting pre-identified restriction violation-related behavior(s) of persons under restriction, such as a parolee, a prisoner, a person on probation, a person under house arrest, a person under a restraining order, a person under supervision and/or restriction(s) ordered by one or more of a criminal court, a civil court, a family court, and/or another justice entity, and/or a person under supervision and/or restriction(s) imposed by an association, an entity, and/or an organization, etc. In an exemplary embodiment, a system generally includes a plurality of different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks.

One of these side effects is in &#x201c;dating&#x201d;&#x2014;the seeking of and &#x201c;executing&#x201d; of potential romantic and/or sexual relationships. There have been numerous news stories where a person apparently said &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; to an invitation to a sexual encounter at some point (often early) in a relationship&#x2014;at least a &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; as interpreted by the other person&#x2014;that once concluded (attempted or completed), the person has changed their view on what happened, why, or both with assertions, e.g., &#x201c;took advantage of me when I was drunk&#x201d;, etc.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0373">Previously, such a &#x201c;defense&#x201d; may have been waved off on the alleged grounds that &#x201c;the person knew what they were doing&#x201d; or &#x201c;as long as the person was conscious then what is the problem?&#x201d;. More recently, the slightest hint that one person took advantage of another person in some way during a sexual (or even non-sexual dating) encounter may be treated harshly by society and increasingly so by law enforcement. In such situations, the accused party has heretofore had very little defense beyond &#x201c;he said, she said&#x201d; and with the &#x201c;accuser said&#x201d; typically receiving more weight than before. Even in situations where the accused has been cleared (e.g., college campus tribunals where the weight of evidence is less than criminal court, etc.), the accusation-often fueled by social media&#x2014;may never really go away and may follow the cleared accused person like a tattooed Scarlet Letter.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0374">Exemplary embodiments include systems and methods for developing, monitoring, and enforcing legal, technical, and social agreements, understandings, and/or contracts (e.g., legal, common law, or &#x201c;handshake-like&#x201d; agreements, etc.), such as by using behaviors and/or actions (e.g., pre-identified behaviors, preemptive actions, etc.) determined via one or more different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks (e.g., the Internet of Things (IOT), social networks, etc.). As disclosed herein, behaviors and contexts may be monitored by sensors, sensor arrays, devices, and/or communications networks including wireless, wireline, social networks, and/or The Internet of Things (IoT) and can include physical conditions, activities, and mental thought processes of pre-identified individuals in a variety of situations or circumstances (&#x201c;contexts&#x201d;). Current behaviors and, as applicable, contexts of pre-identified individuals are compared to pre-identified behaviors and, as applicable, contexts and associated acceptable variances to determine whether or not current behaviors/contexts as well as behavior/context trends conform within accepted boundaries of the behaviors/contexts. Based on if/degree of conformity, inclusiveness, fit, or other determinations, actions are initiated to either (1) &#x201c;approve&#x201d; the behavior in the form of some sort of contract, agreement, or understanding along with associated follow-up, measurement, and/or monitoring to ensure compliance/adherence to the agreement(s), or (2) alternatively, initiate pre-identified actions or artificial intelligence (AI) developed or other machine-determined actions to deter, stop, improve, or mitigate the behavior/contexts from continuing in their present (&#x201c;unapproved&#x201d;) form.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0375">In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, a trigger may be generally defined as or include behavior and (optionally) context. Behavior may be generally defined as or include the way or manner that someone conducts themselves or behaves (whether in public or private). Context may be generally defined as or include the interrelated conditions in which behavior occurs, exists, or takes place, such as situations, circumstances, events, activities, actions, location, and/or time (year/month/day and hour/minute).</p><p id="p-0332" num="0376">As recognized herein, detection or determination of behavior(s) can be difficult. This is particularly true when a behavior can have physical &#x201c;symptoms&#x201d; that are similar or even common to other very different behaviors. One example is Anger for which physical symptoms may include raised blood pressure, increased body/skin temperature, and/or raising of a person's voice. But such measures may also apply to other conditions or behaviors, such as having too much caffeine (e.g., elevated blood pressure), being in a very warm environment (e.g., hot body/skin temperature), talking to someone who is hard-of-hearing (e.g., raised voice), or talking in a loud environment (e.g., a bar). As a result, such measures and in particular the associated interpretations of those measures can vary greatly from person to person.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0377">In order to confirm (or at least increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis of) a behavior, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein include a pre-identification of data, measurements, and/or metrics, and in turn the sensors or other devices that collect(s) and develop(s) such data, measurement(s), and/or metric(s) as they relate to triggers, behaviors, and contexts. Such data, measurements, and/or metrics are taken, measured, and/or detected via sensors, sensor arrays, devices, and/or communications networks, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and social media networks. Generally (but not a requirement for all embodiments), more than one measurement may be taken, and such measurements may include a combination of one or more physical readings and one or more &#x201c;non-physical&#x201d; readings geared towards fully and accurately assessing the physical state of a person and even more importantly, assessing a person's state of mind and/or mental viewpoint. For example, exemplary embodiments may focus on (loud) word selection (e.g., curse words, etc.) besides or in addition to blood pressure as a way of indicating Anger. Other measures might be taken to &#x201c;calibrate&#x201d; such readings, such as a sensor that determines if/how much caffeine is in the person's system. Such indicators would be personalized to each individual as part of a the &#x201c;pre-identification&#x201d; process. For example, Person A may only curse when they are very Angry, whereas Person B may curse as a normal matter of course (and perhaps only doesn't curse when Angry).</p><p id="p-0334" num="0378">Even these person-oriented measures (e.g., measures focused on a person's physical and/or mental state) may not be enough to accurately determine a person's behavior, such that the person's context may also need to be determined via a context identification/determination process. For example, being in the context of an outdoor ball game could explain elevated blood pressure (e.g., from excitement), hot body/skin temperature (e.g., outside seating on a hot day in the sun), and even some (e.g., good natured) cursing (e.g., &#x201c;you struck out, you jerk!&#x201d;). Without the context of the hot ball game, the person could easily be misidentified as being Angry. Thus, identifying behavior accurately often requires a plurality of different types of measurements, e.g., measurement(s) of the person being monitored and measurement(s) as to the context the person is in at the time of measurement. In turn, determining the correct course of action to mitigate a (mis)behavior is not only dependent on an accurate behavior &#x201c;diagnosis&#x201d;, it is often also critical to have a full (and accurate) understanding of the person's context as well. For example, the same behavior of the same person but with different contexts will very often have very different preemptive/risk-mitigating actions. Actions that may be taken will vary depending on the person, behaviors detected, and context, as well as the actions possible depending on support networks, nearby locations, and other factors. Such actions as well as exemplary ways of detecting and interpreting behavior, context, triggers, and/or actions are addressed and disclosed herein. Exemplary ways of protecting the privacy of that information are also disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0379">Exemplary embodiments may focus on certain kinds of behaviors, contexts, triggers, and actions that enable heretofore new ways of detecting certain kinds of human interaction (e.g., romantic/sex/sexual-related interaction, fidelity, infidelity, interpersonal relationship, etc.) and enforcing agreements in some form with a variety of pre-identified information capture, documentation, measurements, compliance metrics, &#x201c;punishments&#x201d; or other actions for enforcing such behaviors and associated agreements.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0380">For example, an exemplary embodiment may be configured to address a situation in which a person (Person A) who wants to ensure that she or he (&#x201c;she&#x201d;) does not undertake sexual activity (e.g., say with Person B (&#x201c;he&#x201d;) or any person within type C such as a &#x201c;just-met&#x201d; person) when she is not behaving &#x201c;normally&#x201d; (e.g., such as being drunk) and/or when doing so in an unusual context(s) (e.g., anywhere outside her bedroom and when there is the potential for her roommates coming home within the next 4 hours). Person B may have generally similar concerns, but also specific concerns about engaging in sexual activity with someone who may later claim to &#x201c;not be responsible for their actions&#x201d; because of drinking or other factors, exposing Person B to potential accusations of harassment or worse. Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein enable both Persons to be comfortable that their sexual encounter &#x201c;requirements&#x201d; are being met. Further, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein enable Person A to &#x201c;certify&#x201d; or otherwise legally or at least objectively and verifiably agree that Person A is of sound mind and body and fully agreeing to participate in the sexual encounter. Note &#x201c;sexual encounter&#x201d; does not necessarily mean intercourse. Rather, it could pertain to any type of interaction between two or more parties, such that some element with respect to sex is involved, including touching kissing, or other behaviors short of intercourse. It would also apply to all forms and variations of such &#x201c;romantic activity.&#x201d; Such agreement(s) would be stored in a form of social agreement and/or potentially even legal document, using a variety of secure, and if needed, independently verifiable transaction mechanisms including but not limited to secure cloud storage, escrow-type data lockboxes, and/or blockchain transactions. Indeed, such privacy and security mechanisms are important due to the nature of the data collected as disclosed herein being highly sensitive or even among the most sensitive possible. Example privacy/security mechanisms are disclosed herein. A security/privacy mechanism employed in exemplary embodiments may have a requirement requiring both/all parties involved to agree to disclose the information associated with an agreement or dispute and be precluded technically and/or legally from being disclosed without all parties' consent. In other exemplary embodiments, a single person's agreement or consent may or may not be all that is needed before disclosure depending on the nature of the agreement.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0381">Furthermore, ensuring the security of the collected data may also help to avoid disputes with respect to the data collection, including key measurements/metrics, places and times, and any interpretations of the data. Towards that end, the use of blockchain technology (e.g., the use of distributed ledger technologies and methods) may be used in exemplary embodiments to store collected data in a completely secure, agree-by-all manner. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may include blockchain-based designs for capturing/storing all romantic/sexual &#x201c;transaction&#x201d; data as well as ensuring that the data remains private until/unless it is needed. This may include concepts disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0382">As recognized herein, there is a need for a way for one or both person(s) (or more than two person(s) depending on the situation) to protect themselves from false, misleading, or after-the-fact regret-based accusations of sexual misconduct through a behavior monitoring and social/legal contract mechanism.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0383">This is not to paint a picture of reverse power roles with the only concern being for the male and possible false accusations. Both males and females (biologically or self-identified) will continue to be presented with situations and circumstances that may tempt or accidently stumble into types of (sexual) behavior that they are uncomfortable with upon a moment's reflection. But females are physically different than men; for example, studies show that women may be more vulnerable to alcohol (such as a 2:1 per drink multiple in terms of impact) even with equal body weight. There are many anecdotes indicating alcohol use by one or both parties in a disputed sexual situation was involved. Studies have shown or suggest that after drinking alcohol, males may become more aggressive sexually after drinking alcohol, while women may become more susceptible to &#x201c;agreeing&#x201d; (or at least not disagreeing in the drunken male's view) to sex, including in situations where if the woman was sober, she would not have &#x201c;agreed&#x201d; to the sexual encounter in anyone's definition of the term. A similar situation from a male perspective would be someone who recognizes that he gets aggressive when he drinks and is afraid that he may cross a behavioral and/or socially acceptable line when interacting with others (particularly women). In one University of Minnesota study, as much as 70% of certain violent crimes (particularly rape) occur when the (male) criminal has been drinking, thus preempting/preventing unacceptable behavior (which clearly rape is, but so are many other behaviors short of rape) by males when drinking is a major objective of this invention, in addition to the obvious benefits to the (potential) victims of such unacceptable behavior, male or female.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0384">As recognized herein, there is a need for a way for a person (particularly those vulnerable to making bad decisions in certain behavior/context combinations, such as having been drinking with a person they find attractive) to protect themselves&#x2014;and others&#x2014;from making a bad decision (or multiple bad decisions). An example bad decision may include drunkenly agreeing to have sex to which agreement would not have occurred if the person was sober. Another example bad decision may be tending to behave inappropriately when drinking that puts the person at risk of embarrassment or worse sexually or otherwise harassing people while under the influence. In today's environment in particular, such behavior could have life-long lasting implications in terms of societal shunning, loss of job, or even incarceration.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0385">As further recognized herein, the benefit from early detection of &#x201c;trends&#x201d; towards (presumably &#x201c;bad&#x201d; even if intentions are good) behavior, such as having more than one drink in a defined timeframe when the person knows that having more in such a time frame has historically led to drunkenness. In which case (e.g., bad behavior either having been &#x201c;achieved&#x201d; or is going in that direction), exemplary embodiments disclosed herein have pre-identified actions at their disposal to prevent/mitigate potential bad decisions. This could, for example, include automatically initiating a messaging series (e.g., text, messaging, voice calls, social media posts) to the person's best friend(s) (via preferred interfaces and mechanisms) alerting them to the (impending) bad behavior and providing response(s) as pre-identified by the person and/or friend(s), along with appropriate methods and interfaces, pre-identified and selected according the best fit with the person's behavior, triggers, and context. Escalation actions are also possible, such that if the friend's &#x201c;intervention&#x201d; is not successful, a text or call to the person's mother is automatically placed or threatened to take place if the person does not alter his/her behavior direction.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0386">Disclosed herein are exemplary embodiments of systems and methods that may address one or more or all of the above needs by using and/or including one or more or all of the following.<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0387">Pre-identify behavior (physical and mental actions) and frame-of-mind of concern to the person (or others), potentially along with location(s), timeframe(s), situation(s), and circumstance(s) (context) within or associated with the particular concerned behavior.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0388">Monitoring that behavior(s) through sensors, sensor arrays, communications networks (e.g., social networks, etc.), devices, and/or other mechanisms, such as with sensors pre-configured or otherwise tuned, calibrated, set to, or otherwise focused on detecting those behavior(s) and (as needed) contexts.

A particular example of this that can cause great social, legal, and even criminal difficulties is agreeing to having sex or otherwise putting oneself in a vulnerable position via behavior or activity that may lead to such an end result, such as going bar-hopping with or going home with a person just met, or becoming (often at the spur-of-the-moment) involved in an activity with the other person, such as traveling with them, possibly to a unsafe part of town, that may put them in a context that may result in such difficulties (e.g., you shouldn't go out in this part of town by yourself-let me give you a ride home). Having (or not) sexual activity (or other romantic activity) under circumstances that could later be involved in some sort of dispute after-the-fact is at the core of this exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0394">Pre-identification of acceptable behavior(s) and/or context(s) is included as part of this exemplary embodiment (though one-time, multiple, and ongoing adjustment/modification of these behavior(s) and context(s) is also enabled herein). For example, a person may want to never be involved in sexual activity in the following scenarios: A) with someone just met; B) with anyone when any alcoholic drink has been consumed or other mind-altering substance taken (perhaps with an exception for a &#x201c;special&#x201d; someone, discussed more shortly); C) with anyone with whom the person works (with special actions if a possible sexual partner is a boss, supervisor, other coworker to which the person is subordinate, etc.); D) at certain locations (such as at a parent's house), or E) with an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0395">For Scenario B, there may be an exception for a specific person, who is a &#x201c;friend with benefits.&#x201d; In which case, that specific person may then be placed on a list subject to the other scenario conditions, such as restrictions on time and place for such &#x201c;benefits&#x201d; to take place. For Scenario C, the possible Action Tree (discussed shortly) may have a special branch of possible actions (and associated supplemental data collection) to both &#x201c;gently&#x201d; discourage the boss, supervisor, or co-worker and also to collect data for a possible sexual harassment charge.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0396">To pre-identify this behavior, the person may have one or more sensors enabled that are nearby, on, or around the person, such as a bracelet (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, etc.), a breathalyzer built into their phone that measures blood alcohol content (BAC), and/or other sensors/sensor combinations on the person (e.g., devices carried by the person, wearables, bracelets, glasses, etc.), in the person (e.g., implants, etc.), and/or near the person (e.g., sensors in the room the person is, on/in the furnishings, etc.) that may indicate a high risk of (potential) drunkenness, such as location in a bar for more than a certain period of time, being in the company of someone that frequently or always drinks with the person, the person starts to talk rapidly (as compared to the particular person's typical talking speed), slurring of words, etc. The sensor or other device readings may initially be pre-identified/tailored to the person with subsequent modification possible as behavior data is collected and additions/deletions/modifications/enhancements are determined through Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Adaptive Learning, Affective Learning, Big Data Analysis, Support Personnel suggestions, pre-identified actions and adjustments, and other mechanisms and methods for parameter/configuration adjustments identified. Such technologies are also used in exemplary embodiments in identifying/implementing key actions that need to occur/not occur in relation to behaviors and/or contexts.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0397">The sensors or other devices may be pre-identified and pre-configured to detect the existence of alcohol and/or to detect what degree might the person have a high intolerance, for example hard liquor. Thus, any detection of the proximity of hard liquor (e.g., within 2 feet of the person based on smell, visual evidence, etc.) may be considered as cause for alarm and initiation of preemptive/preventative action(s).</p><p id="p-0349" num="0398">This behavior(s), as indicated by one or more indicators (e.g., badly trending Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) levels, drinking &#x201c;friends&#x201d; present, etc.), and as measured by the one or more sensors that may indicate drunkenness or an imminent trend towards such, may be pre-identified, and the appropriate settings on the sensor(s) pre-identified and then pre-configured, such as detecting (and reporting) any BAC of over 0.04% (e.g., the person's view of what the limit is and still retaining full control of behavior), and/or allowing oneself only to drink at certain establishments and/or only with certain friends (or definitely not with certain drinking &#x201c;friends&#x201d;). Certain such friends add a non-location element to the context setting (along with location), as well as implicitly introducing the need to sense the particular identities of certain (pre-identified) people.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0399">Aspects of this invention enable modification and/or adjustment of pre-selection and/or pre-configuration of sensors and sensor-settings based on accumulation and analysis of historical data and/or observations of the monitored persons or others. For example, the person's friends may point out that person starts acting different after only 2 drinks, whereas the initial BAC level settings are calibrated for 3 drinks. Analysis of the person's drinking data may confirm this, by for example, walking at a slower, uneven, and/or erratic pace (e.g., data collected by walking/fitness-type sensors) and/or analysis of speech patterns. This may include recording samples of the person's voice, of which samples are collected when drinking is detected and compared to non-drinking recorded samples of the person's voice that were pre-collected for such analysis purposes. Modification of sensors can refer to the adding of or deleting of various types of sensors, for example, adding a blood pressure monitoring capability to an initial sensor set (that did not include monitoring blood pressure monitoring sensor(s)) identified for detecting the Anger trigger, and adjustment of sensors refers to adjusting the parameters for a given (pre-identified or later added) sensor regarding what type/level of data is collected and when, for example changing the frequency of a periodic measuring of BAC from 0.04% to 0.05%, and/or changing the frequency of measurement depending on the BAC level, e.g., once an hour up to 0.04%, once every 15 minutes at a BAC level of 0.05%, and continually/near continually once BAC level reaches 0.06%.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0400">When a certain pre-identified drinking threshold is passed (e.g., 0.04%), or a disturbing trend is detected (e.g., going from 0% to 0.03% in 15 minutes), this exemplary embodiment may analyze the possible (pre-identified) actions for that person's behavior and (as applicable) context. Besides the context elements discussed above (e.g., which bar, where located, with what persons), action-related context elements may be measured and compared to pre-identified concerns. For example, possible actions may vary depending on whether the person drove a car to the bar or came some other way (e.g., with a friend or an Uber driver). Because this kind of data would not be able to be collected while the person was in the bar, this exemplary embodiment includes some level of &#x201c;pre-behavior&#x201d; data collection of various elements (e.g., driving a car) that may come into play when a behavior concern is activated. Actions can vary widely and can be individually or in combination. For example, while a certain BAC level may initiate a disabling of the person's care and a call to Uber, the invention may take actions to stop or slow the degree/volume of drinking, such as sending reminders to stop drinking or playing drunk-driving-related videos on the person's phone, to contacting friends, relatives, or other support persons to get them to take actions on behalf of the original person, such as calling them or stopping by the bar that they currently are at. The invention would also include functionality for the support person they need to respond to the original person's situation, such as the person's location and information on how much they've been drinking, who they are with, how long they have been drinking/at the location, etc.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0401">Although the potential actions may vary, possible actions are pre-identified based on the behaviors (and as applicable, contexts), e.g., &#x201c;triggers&#x201d;, and other actions generated by artificial intelligence (AI), &#x201c;if/then&#x201d;-type decision trees and/or other machine-based technologies described above. Example actions include sending out message(s) to trusted friends or family members; automatically calling an Uber driver (while disabling the person's own car from being driven); essentially forcing the person to leave the bar; and/or sending a message to the bar/bartender to cut the person off and stop providing any alcoholic beverages to the person. A particular impactful action might be a pre-recorded video of that person warning oneself that &#x201c;YOU ARE NOT SOBER&#x2014;GO HOME!&#x201d;, perhaps even connecting to Bluetooth speakers near the person to add a public self-&#x201c;shaming&#x201d; element. Other actions could involve bringing in 3<sup>rd </sup>parties to the &#x201c;stopping&#x201d; action, such as causing one or both of the parties' mothers to call or be called and put on speaker, creating a Skype/Facetime link, or even transmitting real-time audio/video of the current situation or a virtual reality/augmented reality simulation of the &#x201c;direction&#x201d; that the situation/context is trending towards. In such circumstances, the support network and interfaces chosen to facilitate the actions, particularly communication-intensive actions, are a part of the overall action selection/generation process as is the action itself.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0402">Determining which interfaces will be most effective in delivering these actions is important, both pre-identifying and AI-generated interfaces, as will be determining in what context is involved in &#x201c;delivering&#x201d; those actions (particularly message-based actions). This determining is an important element of exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, as are methods and mechanisms for determining and implementing ongoing updates to those action/messaging pairing as behaviors, actions, and sensors that enable monitoring/delivering them are refined and as new technologies become available. For example, instead of or in addition to an audio (or even video) recording of the person's self-yelling at oneself, there may be a holographic image instead. Or as implants become more widespread, a shock may be delivered to the person in some behavior/context pairings to avoid public humiliation yet achieving the goal: to get the person out of the predicament the person is about to get into before it is too late. By way of example, an exemplary embodiment may use an electrode-based vibration-inducing smartphone-controlled system, such as Quell, etc. An aspect of the invention will be deciding which kind(s) of interface(s) will be most effective given the person's profile as well as location and context. For example, the interface used if the person is driving will be different than if in a quiet place and different than if the person is in a loud bar or a crowded ball game.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;Person Afraid of Drunken/Inappropriate Behavior</heading><p id="p-0354" num="0403">This second example is the converse of the first example described immediately above. This second example addresses the scenario in which a person is afraid of being accused of inappropriate behavior, such as drunken sexual assault, and understandably wanting to prevent that from happening before it happens. The challenge, in today's society in particular, is that one person's well-meaning but &#x201c;forward&#x201d; or aggressive behavior may be another person's sexual harassment or worse.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0404">There are two main windows of concern addressed by this exemplary embodiment. The first is while the &#x201c;harassment&#x201d; is actually happening, e.g., Person A (sometimes under the influence) tries to convince Person B (also possibly under the influence) to have sex. Person A may be too forward, such as by putting hands in inappropriate places, saying inappropriate things, or talking too suggestively, to make this happen. Or, Person A might only say a few things to gauge Person B's interest in an encounter, none of them particularly objectionable, at least to Person A. Regardless, Person B may become offended (which may be visible or not), and who finally says no and leaves whatever context/setting at which they were together.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0405">Historically, that might have been the end of a dud date perhaps a bit of an unpleasant encounter, and that would be that. But more recently, social media allows for this unpleasant encounter to be &#x201c;reported to&#x201d; dozens even thousands of followers, who can quickly start gunning for Person A's reputation, job, etc. Often found in newspapers are stories in which Person A is fired from their job and/or their reputation is ruined without any due process or even proof other than the accuser's accusatory words. This exemplary embodiment may provide such proof to protect oneself by capturing by various types of sensor measurements or other data collection mechanisms (e.g., audio, video) at key times in various forms, e.g., key &#x201c;snapshots&#x201d; of the evening that can be used to refute (or confirm) the behavior that took place.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0406">An even more problematic scenario is when Person A is &#x201c;successful&#x201d; with Person B. For example, Person A convinces Person B to (seemingly willingly) go to an apartment and (seemingly willingly) have sex. Person B then leaves or sleeps over and returns home in the morning. Historically, when this would happen, if either party has regrets about what they did the night before, they chock it up to people blinded by the throws of passion and perhaps alcohol and resolve not to do it again. But current society has introduced new variations in this Monday-morning quarterbacking. Instead of writing the evening off by saying &#x201c;I'll never drink that much again&#x201d;, or &#x201c;I have to stop doing this&#x201d;, the &#x201c;aggrieved&#x201d; person may feel that someone has to &#x201c;pay&#x201d; for &#x201c;making&#x201d; Person B have sex now that Person B is having the morning-after regrets. Another scenario might be that there is no &#x201c;true&#x201d; issue involved, but Person B, who lives at home, is caught by the parents. In a panic, Person B makes up a cover story that implicates or accuses Person A in harassing behavior or worse. In either such examples, Person B may talk to friends, take to social media, and/or even call the police. Person B (or his/her parents or friends) may contend that since Person B was not fully under control of their own faculties (e.g., because Person B was drinking), then what happened was sexual harassment or rape because Person A took advantage of Person B. As noted, sometimes this is &#x201c;crime&#x201d; is &#x201c;caused&#x201d; by a 3<sup>rd </sup>party finding out about the encounter, such as a parent or supposedly close friend who blabs to the world, embarrassing Person B and &#x201c;forcing&#x201d; Person B to manufacture a &#x201c;defense&#x201d; by claiming that Person B was taken advantage of even if it was mutually and consensually agreed to and no matter the consequences to the other party.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0407">Person A in this situation often has no evidence other than their word, and perhaps a few friends or acquaintances at the bar who could testify a &#x201c;subjective&#x201d; opinion as to how drunk/control of their faculties Person B really was at the time. Seemingly, this type of accusation in recent times has the accused as guilty until proven innocent and sometimes not even then when it comes to Person A's job and reputation in society.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0408">Accordingly, recognized herein is a need for and discloses herein exemplary embodiments of systems and methods to monitor behavior (by both parties); and preempt the sexual &#x201c;transaction&#x201d; from going too far if various warning signs/risks are detected. If the transaction proceeds anyway, the collection of data as disclosed herein may protect both parties from an after-the-fact accusation of harassment, rape, etc.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Woman and Man Want to Ensure Genuine &#x201c;Yes&#x201d;</heading><p id="p-0360" num="0409">This third example address a scenario different from the first and second examples described immediately above. In this exemplary embodiment, Person A wants to say &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; and is in the right state-of-mind (e.g., behavior) and context (e.g., safe place). Person B also wants to say &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; and is in the right state of mind (e.g., behavior) by being mentally genuine about a Yes (e.g., not being drunk) and in the right context (e.g., also a safe place).</p><p id="p-0361" num="0410">This exemplary embodiment includes monitoring both parties' behavior and context and comparing the monitored behavior and context to a list of rules/preconditions. If those rules/preconditions are met and there are no major red flags in terms of &#x201c;executing&#x201d; (such as Person B having no money to get a ride home in the morning), then alerts may be provided to both of them that the &#x201c;coast is clear&#x201d; regarding getting together. At that point, a social contract (e.g., legally and/or binding contract and/or mutually acceptable social agreement, etc.) is presented to both parties to attest that they are both in the right frame of mind and body. The parties may then click the appropriate button, or in some other form (e.g., body language, etc.) accept and agree to the social contract. Accordingly, the parties have now insulated themselves from any sort of morning-after regret and, worse, actions that could wrongfully accuse one or the other party of taking advantage of the other.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 4A&#x2014;A Full Agreement to Have Sex and the Nature of the Sex</heading><p id="p-0362" num="0411">If there are no conditions, exceptions, or other identified inhibitors regarding the participants having sex, then a contract (social and/or legal) or some other type of formalized agreement is provided for the parties. This fourth example 4A includes not just information about the consensus of &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, but if needed agreement on time, place, duration, and range and/or type(s) of sexual activity. The latter may be somewhat problematic both in terms of diminishing the spontaneity of the moment, but also not knowing what types of sex both parties are mutually interested in. That said, some sort of documentation or other recorded proof may be provided-even if only a brief yes/no to prompted questions from one party or even a prompting from the system regarding different types of and ranges of sex encouraged, allowed, off limits, areas of the body that can be touched and how, any safety words, etc. If agreed to by both parties (through a verbal, video, or other affirmation mechanism), a record of the sexual occurrence will be taken. This can also be done by various means, utilizing both parties' devices and/or other sensors in the room/area/bed etc. where the occurrence occurs, particularly (but not limited to) video and/or audio recordings.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0412">If a forbidden act or act not explicitly agreed to is detected (typically verbal or physical cues or through pre-defined recognition algorithms), the device (of one or both of the parties) or other alert-capable sensors may then document the &#x201c;termination&#x201d; of the act as well as the aftermath. If the act continues or continues in a non-approved way, appropriate alerts or other actions are then taken to discontinue the actions.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 4B&#x2014;Retraction of a Yes</heading><p id="p-0364" num="0413">There are circumstances where after an agreement has been made and sex has commenced, one of the parties may retract or revoke consent and change their mind about the sexual encounter. This can be very problematic as cues given to indicate the revoked consent may not be obvious (e.g., &#x201c;STOP!&#x201d;) and/or the other party may be wrapped up in the activity and be oblivious to the change of mind, incapable of correctly interpreting the cues, or just plain refuses to listen or doesn't believe it (e.g., No doesn't really mean NO). The technology of this exemplary embodiment 4B can be helpful in such situations as pre-identification of cues may be captured by the system according to this exemplary embodiment. &#x201c;Safety words&#x201d; or sounds (e.g., clapping of hands three times) may be used to trigger the system to take action(s). The system action(s) may be tiered, such as warnings to Person B: &#x201c;Person B&#x2014;Stop Please&#x201d; escalating to Loud Alarms, calling 911 in extreme situations, etc.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 5&#x2014;Woman/Man Afraid of Post-Sex Accusations</heading><p id="p-0365" num="0414">This fifth example is a variation of the above examples and is applicable to &#x201c;morning-after&#x201d; regrets. Unfortunately, it can be devastating on a person who thought everything was consensual the night before to find out the next day that the other party believes otherwise, e.g., the other part is not content to chalk up their consent at the time to foolishness or other reasons they alone are responsible for, decides to blame the other party, etc. Or, the person involved is a celebrity and wants to make sure they are not being used. This exemplary embodiment looks to preempt this by &#x201c;documenting&#x201d; the consent and subsequent actions (potentially even the romantic encounter itself with consent) in the form of a contract (e.g., verbally &#x201c;signed&#x201d; legal contract, etc.), e.g., an immediate post-romantic encounter &#x201c;agreement&#x201d; (e.g., verbally, video, etc.) that the encounter was consensual along with readings of the physical state of both parties if possible (e.g., sound mind and body). The combination of the pre-encounter agreement record and the post-romantic encounter agreement should dissuade the other party from a next day &#x201c;revision&#x201d; of the consensual encounter to a non-consensual encounter and/or provide the accused with irrefutable proof regarding the consensual nature of the encounter.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0415">This exemplary embodiment may also include monitoring of the potential reviser/revisionist/accuser's social media and other communications network accounts that will potentially signal a change of heart if it occurs over time (particularly if the romantic encounter does not extend a relationship or itself was unpleasant in some way). It could also provide non-testing proof of paternity (e.g., a &#x201c;time-stamp&#x201d;) of the encounter if needed at a later date. Various mechanisms (e.g., machine-based, etc.) focused on key words may be used to monitor the social media accounts of the other person (and possibly his/her friend(s)), with alerts or other actions triggered when a change-of-heart is detected or trending towards a change-of-heart.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 6&#x2014;Post Interaction Behavior Monitoring (Both Parties)&#x2014;Including Social Media</heading><p id="p-0367" num="0416">This sixth example includes a variation of part of the fifth example described immediately above. This embodiment provides a trolling/bot review and analysis function of all of the parties' social media accounts to detect/determine if unpleasant posts are appearing or if such posts are &#x201c;trending downwards.&#x201d; This exemplary embodiment includes a &#x201c;scoring&#x201d; of sorts regarding each post and provides an alert if a post goes below a certain predetermined negativity threshold regarding one of the parties or if trending downwards.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 7&#x2014;Falsehood Monitoring</heading><p id="p-0368" num="0417">This seventh example is a variation of the fifth and sixth examples described immediately above. This exemplary embodiment includes social media monitoring capability specifically looking for falsehoods, particularly with respect to the romantic encounter. Upon identification of potential falsehoods (e.g., libel, slander, etc.), notifications are sent to the victim (e.g., directly to the victim and/or to the victim's legal representation, etc.) along with a cease-and-desist order (e.g., via social media and/or legal form, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 8&#x2014;Underage&#x2014;Adult Inappropriate Interactions</heading><p id="p-0369" num="0418">This eighth example may address inappropriate and illegal sexual liaisons between persons under legal age and those of legal age. A variation of this is when both persons are of legal age but given the legal structure of the relationship (e.g., teacher-student), a sexual relationship is prohibited.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0419">Upon a physical or virtual interaction commencing between two such persons, and a concern is raised by one (for example, the adult has concern about the other party's age, but the underage party says they are of legal age), exemplary embodiment 8A will &#x201c;activate&#x201d; a data collection process to collect as much information as possible on both parties. This includes taking &#x201c;measurements&#x201d; of the persons such as photographs, voice recordings (including assertions of legal age by the possible underage person), etc. and essentially performing a real-time private investigation of that person. A voice recording giving permission may be captured. Various databases may be scrutinized with a focus on detecting age-specific information, including birthdate, school attendance (with associated extrapolation of birthdate), etc. If such access is blocked due to minor privacy restrictions, this exemplary embodiment considers that as an indicator of being underage. Any such indicators may then be reported to the adult person and with additional data capture (e.g., voice recordings, video, etc.) that will provide a record of the adult being informed of the situation along with (presumably) a record of the social interaction being terminated.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0420">A variation of the recording of the interaction between the adult and underage person will take place with some differences in another exemplary embodiment 8B. Because a pre-existing relationship (e.g., student-teacher) is already acknowledged in this example, this exemplary embodiment focuses on detecting unusual or &#x201c;out-of-bounds&#x201d; behavior on either participant. For example, a sensor may be activated when both persons are within proximity of each other and another &#x201c;keyword&#x201d; sensor may be calibrated to detect any untoward interaction, such as words &#x201c;sex&#x201d;, &#x201c;come back later&#x201d;, &#x201c;meet me at&#x201d;, and so forth. If such key words are detected, additional sensors are activated (e.g., video, full-time recording, etc.) to capture a complete record of the interaction with forwarding of the interaction later or in real-time to the appropriate person (e.g., parents, school administrators, authorities, etc.). Actions may also be triggered such as messages telling the underage person to come home or otherwise remove oneself from the situation. If the &#x201c;aggressive action&#x201d; is by the underage person (e.g., a high school senior male, etc.), additional action(s) may be taken to protect the teacher or other party, such as a real-time alert to a school principal or other school personnel to come immediately to the classroom or location where the interaction is taking place.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 9&#x2014;Sexual Harassment &#x201c;Scoring&#x201d;</heading><p id="p-0372" num="0421">Many forms of possible sexual harassment are not well defined and may be to a degree in the eye of the beholder, cf. how an alleged harasser interprets a comment, gesture, or action versus a recipient's interpretation. Historically, verbal-only differences have not consistently been considered a major deal at least for individual occurrences and do not lend themselves to requiring a solution.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0422">But any accusation of harassment in any form (even if unfounded or without any specifics) may be sufficient to damage and even end a career and/or ostracize a person in society. This exemplary embodiment includes pre-identification of behavior(s) and context(s) that may lead to inappropriate content generation or other types of posts with the same outcome; includes (e.g., puts in place, etc.) sensors and other mechanisms to detect as soon as possible a trend (hence, a scoring mechanism) towards such behavior, context, and associated social media action; and takes action(s) to stop the posting of the content, modify the content, and/or redirect the content to other platforms where it will have less impact.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0423">For example, Person A may have an issue with what Person A considers hypocritical political postings on Twitter. Person A's &#x201c;problem&#x201d; may get considerably worse when Person A knows or has met people with those postings, and furthermore if those postings have to do with sexual-related disparities and perceived &#x201c;wrongs&#x201d; done by Person A's &#x201c;culture&#x201d; (such as being a white male) against Person B's culture (being a minority female). Person A may recognize this propensity to get Angry when faced with what Person A views as unfair, biased, or unreasonable posts, and would appreciate a form of &#x201c;safety net&#x201d; provided by the system to protect Person A against oneself, and thus prevent or limit the types of responses Person A does when exposed to such provocative postings. Person A may also want to keep a record of the transactions involved such that if there is any after-the-fact question of whether harassment or other inappropriate behavior took place between Person A and Person B, then there is a record that can be consulted, thus avoiding a he-said/she-said situation; one that may be skewed harshly against the one accused of harassment to the extent that they can lose their jobs and livelihood without any sort of due process.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0424">The above examples 1-9 are generally or specifically addressed at romantic/sexual embodiments in some form. The following examples also utilize technology/methods described in previous embodiments but are less romantic/sexual in nature.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 10&#x2014;Social Media Self-Protection</heading><p id="p-0376" num="0425">It has become relatively easy to literally ruin one's life with an off-color, politically incorrect, inflammatory, and/or otherwise stupid comment or post on any number of apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, other social media, etc. This exemplary embodiment looks to preempt such unwise remarks/postings by pre-identifying those types of remarks/postings that a person is susceptible towards (e.g., political postings, etc.), and in particularly pre-identifying the behavioral conditions and context that are at the greatest risk for posting inappropriate content and then monitoring the person and their communications/communications channels.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0426">This exemplary embodiment focuses on proactively identifying the Triggers, Behaviors and/or Contexts when such communications/posting occur and proactively/preempting such communications/postings through one or more actions. For example, when such conditions occurred, this exemplary embodiment may enact a variety of actions ranging from temporarily disabling a Twitter account, enacting a social media &#x201c;overlay&#x201d; that will allow a post to be written, yet delaying its actual posting (e.g., similar to live TV seven-second delay) to immediately addressing the trigger(s) such as &#x201c;soothing&#x201d; the triggers(s) (such as Anger) that make the person more susceptible to posting inappropriate content in the first place.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0427">A variation on the above is a preempting of communications regarding certain topic(s), such as topics that fall under the old adage of never talk &#x201c;sex, politics, and religion in polite company&#x201d;. With a heightened focus on &#x201c;micro-aggressions&#x201d;, a proactive form of self-censorship may help to avoid antagonizing one of many identity groups. This exemplary embodiment facilitates that by detecting Trigger, Behavior, and/or Context(s) that a person might be susceptible to saying (posting or otherwise communicating to the outside world) such antagonizing statements. Once pre-identified (again, with Anger a high potential trigger), one or more actions may take place focused on preventing or delaying such postings/communications and/or mitigating the damage by soothing or otherwise addressing the Trigger. Post-communications action(s) may also take place, such as automatic deletions of postings to prevent or at least reduce the number of persons viewing the postings.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 11&#x2014;Bullying</heading><p id="p-0379" num="0428">This eleventh example is a variation of several above examples and in particular the previous tenth example described immediately above. This exemplary embodiment is focused on both preventing bullying of a particular person by pre-identifying triggers, behaviors, and/or contexts when he/she is susceptible to performing bullying (and preempting/preventing it), as well as detecting bullying by others and preventing a response (likely in reaction to a trigger being activated by the bullying). Besides the monitoring for and detecting/determining pre-identified triggers, behaviors and as applicable contexts as disclosed herein, these exemplary embodiments also include pre-identification of known likely bullies/persons to be bullied and monitoring their locations (physical and virtual). When proximity is detected (e.g., in a social media context in which they are online or actively posting, etc.), this exemplary embodiment includes taking steps/actions to essentially prevent the parties from being aware of their respective social media or other activity, and thereby preventing a response.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 12&#x2014;Domestic Violence Accusation; Restraining Order</heading><p id="p-0380" num="0429">This twelfth example focuses on prisoner/parolee/probation situations and with domestic violence-related embodiments focused on preventing physical contact. This exemplary embodiment elaborates on the capability and extends it to &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; contact, which may or may not be construed by the court as a violation of a restraining order. But virtual activity by an accused/criminal may be considered a threat by the victim, and thus should be prevented. In this exemplary embodiment, an accused/criminal's behavior, trigger, and/or context(s) are monitored to detect those that might &#x201c;cause&#x201d; the criminal/accused to post threatening or otherwise uncomfortable communication, social media posting, etc. that may be construed negatively by the court. When such triggers/contexts/behaviors are detected, then similar to exemplary embodiments disclosed above, this exemplary embodiment may initiate, implement, or take action(s) to relatively immediately preempt/prevent/mitigate such communications/postings. Upon the detection of such triggers or high risk of such triggers, action(s) may be initiated to the accused/criminal's support network to immediately address the &#x201c;near-miss&#x201d; and provide support to prevent any such trigger/behavior/context from happening again, if possible.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 13&#x2014;Workplace/Co-Worker Behavior &#x201c;Compliance&#x201d;</heading><p id="p-0381" num="0430">There is some anecdotal evidence that suggests that men are becoming reluctant to meet singly with a woman whether on work premises or offsite and/or even communicate with a woman when there is no way of verifying the integrity/accuracy of the communications. Evidence has started to indicate a reluctance of even hiring women under a fear of a &#x201c;guilty until proven innocent&#x201d; atmosphere where even a single, uncorroborated accusation may be enough to destroy a man's reputation, lose a job, and/or lose prospects of future employment.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0431">To prevent (or at least reduce the occurrence) of such situations, and more positively possibly help in restoring trust in the workplace, this exemplary embodiment seeks to capture relevant information about workplace interactions particularly those involving one-on-one interactions between a man and a woman and more broadly a person having authority or power over another person in a subordinate position. As such, this exemplary embodiment will detect or otherwise initiate monitoring of behavior when &#x201c;high-risk&#x201d; situations appear, such as a one-on-one meeting between a boss and a subordinate in the boss' private office (e.g., detection of a high-risk context). Upon such detection, monitoring/data collection of various types as described above commences with a focus on monitoring and, if needed, documenting the behavior of the boss or other person of power/authority, as well as the circumstances leading up to a determination of the high-risk situation, such as suggestive comments and/or body language of one or both parties. Upon such detection, actions may then be initiated to prevent or at least reduce the possibility of a potentially uncomfortable (or worse) situation from progressing, such as initiating alerts, requesting other parties to &#x201c;intrude&#x201d; on the situation, and/or other explicit actions deemed to interrupt or otherwise &#x201c;correct&#x201d; the situation.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 14&#x2014;Adultery/Suspicion of Adultery/Proof of No-Adultery</heading><p id="p-0383" num="0432">A variation of several of the above examples utilizes aspects to &#x201c;prove&#x201d; adultery or no adultery through monitoring of and behavior detection of suspected party(s) involved. In this exemplary embodiment, the monitoring may be performed on a voluntary or involuntary basis (or both). This exemplary embodiment focuses on beginning the monitoring when &#x201c;suspicious&#x201d; behavior begins, such as being in strange location/contexts at unusual times and/or exhibiting certain behaviors/Triggers outside the norm (for that person(s)). Detection of such context/behaviors/triggers activate certain action(s) that may range from &#x201c;discouraging&#x201d; adultery-leading behavior to intense monitoring of locations/activities/behaviors, which may include capturing data of any romantic/sexual liaisons that could be used in subsequent divorce proceedings.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0433">Other related embodiments are not restricted to permissions/permissible behavior as it is related directly to sex or other forms of &#x201c;commercial&#x201d; harassment. There are other permissible behaviors that may be deemed monitorable and turn actionable such as job interviews, education interactions, private investigations, etc.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0434">Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may advantageously provide individuals with a way to ensure there is no misunderstanding about what activity(ies) each party is agreeing to that is accessible, timely, and flexible. As disclosed herein, exemplary embodiments may advantageously provide a way to capture consent as well as a lack of consent. The technologies disclosed herein enable or provide guardrails for ongoing consent. By way of example, an exemplary embodiment includes an app (e.g., Apple iOS app, Android app, etc.) that includes features such as email login, a customized icon, ability to create a personal profile, etc. The app also includes expanded capabilities, such as connection to a server (e.g., a company or third-party server, etc.) to store consent details, ability to set permissions to integrate with wearables and to access to a smartphone microphone and camera that are delivered in an interface. Continuing with this example, two versions of the app may be available. The first app version may be free with functionality for an in-app purchase to capture a one-time &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no&#x201d; choice for an activity, e.g., yes for consent or no for lack of consent to intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, other activity, etc. Space for displaying ads via the app may be available to provide additional revenue. The second app version may be a subscription version that includes expanded capabilities for monitoring ongoing consent.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0435">Some exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may be generally divided into three main aspects or parts: (1) preemption, (2) agreement/contract formation, and (3) ongoing monitoring and ongoing validation to ensure compliance or detect violation(s).</p><p id="p-0387" num="0436">According to the first preemption aspect, a preemption mechanism is geared to making sure that the participants really want to progress to some level of interaction or activity such as by meeting predetermined conditions (e.g., via comparing to acceptable/nonacceptable conditions/triggers/contexts/behaviors) listed in their profiles. To the extent that the profile does not seem to capture the user's desires on a particular condition, etc., the system may be configured to dynamically create such a condition, etc. based on the specific situational data. The system may also be configured to include or issue a warning or alert for the user indicating that this an unanticipated condition, etc., and that the system-created condition is a system recommendation only for which acceptance, rejection, or revisions is needed from the user.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0437">For example, a person may meet another person at a mutual friend's wedding at which alcohol is involved. While his/her profile may include the condition or stipulation about not meeting people when drinking alcohol, this may be varied depending on the situation. Or, it may be a blanket no-alcohol restriction, but there may be a separate &#x201c;meet people my friends also know&#x201d; parameter. In which case, these 2 profile elements &#x201c;conflict&#x201d; to some extent relative to the wedding scenario. Thus, the system may then make recommendations for Terms and Conditions for that particular interaction. For example, the system may be configured to weight and compare individual parameters and make a recommendation based on highest weight parameter. In this example, if he/she has no alcohol as Very High in importance and &#x201c;meet people my friends know&#x201d; as just a Medium importance, then the system recommendation would be &#x201c;No.&#x201d; But the user may want to override the system recommendation. In which case, the system may not allow the user override without first requiring that a friend &#x201c;vouch&#x201d; (e.g., a third-party voucher) for the potential mate, which vouching may be a general default requirement in some cases. This vouching requirement may be implemented via an online vouching signature capability within an App (e.g., Apple iOS app, Android app), via a voice recording, or via another method that would confirm the friend's vouching for the &#x201c;transaction.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0389" num="0438">Continuing with the preemption aspect for this wedding example, a list of actions may be provided to help the user avoid or dodge an evolving, and perhaps confusing, situation. For example, the list of actions may include texting a friend of the user that is pre-identified and listed as a support person to the user. The friend may be known to also be at the wedding if the friend's location is being individually monitored and tracked and/or if all of the user's pre-identified support persons are pinged for their respective locations to determine which support person(s) are at the wedding if it becomes known that a situation requiring a friend vouching has arisen. Thus, this action functionality to preempt/avoid a situation from going further is an important aspect of the overall preemption functionality in exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0439">According to the second aspect, this assumes that above hurdles have been cleared, and it's time for agreement/contract formation. This would involve the parties (e.g., two or more persons, etc.) to agree that some sort of romantic/sexual/interpersonal interaction or activity is acceptable for the parties involved. In exemplary embodiments, an App may be used that is on just one person's smartphone or other device or the App may be on the smart phone or device of each party or participant to be involved with the interaction or activity. In some exemplary embodiments, the friend or other third-party voucher may be provided by an App on the smartphone or other device of the vouching person or one of the parties to the agreement/contract.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0440">The agreement/contract include terms and conditions, and importantly agreement on the ability for monitoring behavior of the parties after completion and execution of the agreement/contract to ensure compliance and non-violation. The agreement/contract may include static terms and conditions that are the same in every case (e.g., boilerplate legalese, etc.). The agreement/contract also includes dynamic data about the persons involved and the situation/context involved. The agreement/contract would include information about how far an interaction is allowed to progress and in what form. This may include identification of behavior(s) that are acceptable and behavior(s) that are not acceptable, and information about how the acceptability of behavior(s) might vary by time and other circumstance(s).</p><p id="p-0392" num="0441">For example, it may be the (somewhat drunken) user is ok (with a friend vouching, either overall or perhaps even by specific behavior-by-behavior) to allow the other party to only progress to a certain limited level of sex-related behavior as defined in the terms and conditions the first encounter/date and the next two encounters/dates. if any, occur. This would thus include ongoing tracking of both parties. And if there is a fourth encounter/date, then the user may allow sexual intercourse or higher level of sexual relations, e.g., perhaps without conditions and/or overriding the user profile, according to the general conditions or a &#x201c;custom&#x201d; set of conditions (e.g., depending on location, etc.). The terms and conditions may have &#x201c;custom&#x201d; conditions related to monitoring/contact verification as explained below for the third aspect. This may include the ability to monitor one or both/all party(ies) social media account(s) to ensure, for example, that there is no disclosure of their relationship in any way unless explicitly agreed to (later) by the parties. Or if disclosure of the relationship is allowed, this may include the ability to monitor one or both/all party(ies) social media account(s) to ensure there is no disparaging comments or other disclosures about either party as defined in the terms and conditions.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0442">The imminent interaction of the parties and the ongoing monitoring/validating may occur dynamically in exemplary embodiments. Because the preemption aspect described above may also be dynamic (e.g., creation of custom, on-the-fly conditions because of conflicting profile parameters, etc.), exemplary embodiments may therefore include features that function, operate, and/or change dynamically in relation to the context and other parameters of the situation, such as anticipating, reacting, recommending, monitoring, and alerting with respect to (un)desired behavior(s). The contracting functionality disclosed herein may include custom/dynamic evaluation/creation of modified acceptable/not-acceptable situations, etc., third party/friend vouching components, customization by-type-of-romantic-behavior (e.g., 3<sup>rd </sup>base, type of sexual activity, etc.) allowed and dynamically inserted into the agreement/contract.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0443">According to the third aspect, ongoing monitoring and ongoing validation is performed to determine whether the agreement/contract has or has not been violated, including detecting violation(s) and initiating action(s) to address the detected violation(s). Accordingly, this third aspect relates to functionality that happens after the agreement/contract formation. This includes tracking behavior of the parties (two or more individuals) relative to each other and relative to the contracted/agreed upon behavior. This behavior may practically be anything but will be customized based on the contract/agreement. This may start with monitoring immediate &#x201c;intimate&#x201d; behavior using one or more devices or sensors as needed (e.g., video, audio, heart rate, etc.). For example, two or more sensors may be used to confirm the occurrence of a given behavior. A plurality of sensors may be used to monitor location and related context at the location (e.g., only at my apartment, only on a weekend when I haven't had more than three beers, only if we just got home from a baseball game, etc.) and related behavior (e.g., only to 3rd base for the 1st interaction/date, etc.). The sensors for monitoring the location, context, and behavior may include social media monitoring. The type of behaviors and limitations associated with each behavior should requirement agreement by both/all parties, e.g., if initially proposed by only one party/user and negotiated thereafter by the parties/users. Based on the sensor output (e.g., detection of safety word(s), gestures, other detectable actions by a person, etc.), alert(s) may be provided and/or other action(s) initiated, e.g., a set of actions initiated such as loudspeaker warnings, texts to friends, contacting police, etc.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0444">The ongoing (post-interaction) monitoring may be focused on different types of behaviors at different times, cf., monitoring during the interaction. The post-type behaviors may focus on mutual behavior monitoring of both/all parties. For example, if Person 1 had fully consented (with verification/legal agreement), then Person 2 may want to ensure that Person 1 does not disparage Person 2, e.g., by social media posting damaging to Person's 2 reputation. For example, monitoring tools may be implemented and integrated with an App to warn Person 2 of detected disparaging social media posting(s) by Person 1. Conversely, if Person 2 discloses the relationship with Person 1 in violation of Person's 1 demand that there be no disclosure of their relationship, then Person 1 may be alerted and provided with the details of a detection that Person 2 has disclosed the relationship. The system may be configured to provide recommend action(s) for one or both/all parties to take in either of these above example scenarios, such as notifying the violator about violating the terms of their agreement and to cease-and-desist.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0445">Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may be used for the preemption and/or detection of an extra-relationship affair or cheating, e.g., extramarital cheating/affairs by spouses, boyfriend/girlfriend extra-relationship affair/cheating, etc. In addition, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may also be used to detect &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behavior or indicators that are likely to indicate a future occurrence(s) of an extra-relationship affair or cheating. Such exemplary embodiments are not limited to detection of the actual occurrence of the extra-relationship affair or cheating, but may also include monitoring, tracking, and/or detecting behavior(s) that might lead to and/or that may be predictive of a future occurrence of an extra-relationship affair or cheating.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0446">Regarding detection of an extra-relationship affair/cheating and/or detection of breaking or violating an agreement in a romantic encounter contract, exemplary embodiments are not exclusively focused on direct/obvious indicators of misbehaving, cheating, agreement/contract violations, etc. as such exemplary embodiments also focus on early indicator(s) predictive of such behavior. For example, in the case of extra-relationship affairs/cheating, an early indicator may include creation of a user account on a website that facilitates finding a willing participant for an extramarital affair, etc. As another example, an early indicator may include tracking of a spouse to a location (e.g., bar after work, etc.) more frequently than historically. In addition, other example early indicators of an extra-relationship affair/cheating may include triggers as disclosed herein, such as the triggers associated with loneliness, depression, unhappiness with a spouse or other partner, etc.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0447">Accordingly, exemplary embodiments may detect possible/trending-in-the-direction-of an extra-relationship affair/cheating and then initiate preemptive action(s) to attempt to prevent or reduce the likeihood of the occurrence of the extra-relationship affair/cheating. For example, an alert may be provided to a husband in that process of setting up a user account on a website that facilitates finding a willing participant for an extramarital affair that his wife will be notified (but has not yet been notified) if the process continues and the husband's user account is fully set up and activated. Exemplary embodiments may allow a person in a relationship for which the other person is suspicious (but yet unfounded in reality) to willingly signup for monitoring in order to appease that other person. Example preemptive actions may also include suggest marriage or relationship counseling or some other activity that will help the spouse or other partner come home from work in a much better mood.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0448">With exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, an affair may possibly be stopped before it started. Or, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may allow for an agreement to be created between persons that stipulated that they were having an affair and stipulated what kind of activity(ies) is permissible and what kind of activity(ies) is prohibited (e.g., different types of intimacy, sexual activity(ies), etc.). The existence of such an agreement, the parties would then provide protection against unfounded allegations of prohibited activity(ies) (e.g., different type(s) that are set forth in the agreement as permissible. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments may allow for (a) avoiding misunderstandings as to which activity(ies) are prohibited and which are permissible, (b) preempting or stopping a prohibited activity(ies) before it proceeds to far, and/or c) provide one side (or the other) with definitive legal and/or behavior tracking support for what did (or did not) actually happen.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0449">Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may also prove useful for control freaks, overly jealous persons, etc. For example, a person being controlling and becoming a control freak does not happen instanteously but instead involves a process that happens incrementally over time. Thus, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein may provide the ability to detect controlling behavior relatively early. This early detection and implemented remedial action(s) thereafter may help the controllee as well as informing someone who might not be self aware that he/she is engaging in or exhibiting controlling-type behavior(s), which if left unchecked/unabated may ruin a relationship. This avoidance of the controlling/jealous-type behavior may be implemented at various stages or processes in exemplary embodiments, such as in someone's profile, in &#x201c;screening&#x201d; a person before moving into dating/intimacy mode, to detecting controlling/jealous-type behavior &#x201c;the morning after&#x201d; as well as in established relationships including marriage, etc.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0450">Like other undesirable behavior, there are a variety of actions that may implemented or initiated, including action(s) that are upstream of and taken before the undesirable behavior after early detection of issue(s). For example, the early detection may include early detection of trends either in frequency of controlling/jealous-type behavior(s) and/or severity of the behavior and/or types of behaviors. The actions, in turn, may include notifying both or all parties of the detected trend and suggesting actions to reduce or preempt the frequency, severity, and/or type(s) of the controlling/jealous-type behavior(s) in the future.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0451">For example, if there is an increase in money arguments between spouses, an exemplary embodiment may include recommending that parties to agree on a discretionary budget such as a discretionary budget based on an AI analysis of the financial and purchasing habit parts of their profiles and/or to modify/build a person's financial/purchasing profiles and habits based on a plurality of sensors' observations, readings, measurements, etc. taken over time. A recommended budget may include a monthly dollar value limit to spend on clothes each month where spending is monitored to detect when that limit is being approached. Such a spending limit would not necessarily be an outright victory for the controller, as the controller may have been demanding that no money is spend and instead of a budgetary limit for clothing purchases each month. For just-met or other early-dating couples, such demands/arguments about money may be more troubling as it spending habits may be too sensitive or private at the start of a relationship. In which case, more emphasis may be placed on &#x201c;extracting&#x201d; the person from the relationship or at least informing person(s) within the controllee's support network (e.g., alerting loved ones of the controlled person with the controlled person's permission, etc.) about the troubling control freak tendencies emerging in the new relationship according to an exemplary embodiment. The controlling-type person/control freak in an early stage of a relationship may be alerted about the undesirable behavior, e.g., advised to stop the behavior and seek counseling, etc. according to an exemplary embodiment. Accordingly, this exemplary embodiment may be operable as a virtual counselor for both parties when dealing with incremental behavior (e.g., indicators of controlling or jealous behavior(s), etc.) that if left unchecked/unabated may escalate from being a minor nuisance(s) to a major issue(s) and/or relationship trigger point(s) in the future.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0452">Embodiments disclosed above involve parolee or persons-under-restrictions and include novel and inventive capabilities as do the exemplary embodiments disclosed hereinafter that involve a person(s) under quarantine. The example discussed next involves a person(s) under quarantine being allowed (under certain conditions) to go to a grocery store, which may be considered similarly to, essentially the same as, or substantially no different than the concept or details from, for example, a parolee under house arrest who might be allowed (under very controlled conditions) to leave his home to see his doctor (or go the grocery store or similar necessary/benign purpose).</p><p id="p-0404" num="0453">The term &#x201c;quarantine&#x201d; has a number of definitions. As a noun, quarantine may be defined as a state, period, or place of isolation in which people or animals that have arrived from elsewhere or been exposed to infectious or contagious disease are placed. As a verb, quarantine may be defined as impose isolation on (a person, animal, or place); put in quarantine. Exemplary embodiments may utilize these definitions and other definitions including &#x201c;self&#x201d; isolation or quarantine, such as a person having been exposed to a virus/illness and takes the precaution of self-imposing on themselves a predetermined quarantine/isolation period (e.g., a 14-day quarantine/isolation period, etc.). It could also apply to embodiments involving refugee containment/management, animal control (e.g., not relegated to humans only, particularly given that many diseases have their &#x201c;start&#x201d; in non-humans, etc.), military applications (e.g., locked on base, confined to quarters, etc.), conflict management (e.g., riot containment, enforcement of curfew, or &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; embodiments involving military containment of biological warfare with associated deployment of troops/command and control in managing/controlling the biological warfare agent, etc.). The persons/other entities do not even have to be living control/management of deceased entities related to the reason for quarantine/restriction could be addressed by the invention, as deceased entities can pose as much (or even greater) risk to other entities when deceased. In other words, quarantine should not be restricted to quarantine that is involuntary, &#x201c;imposed&#x201d;, or &#x201c;placed&#x201d; on an individual, such as by a governmental authority(ies), etc. Aspects of the present disclosure may also apply to by-necessity monitoring/control of a person or other entity (who for their own good, if not others) that needs to be closely monitored to prevent &#x201c;involuntary&#x201d; breaking of &#x201c;quarantine&#x201d; (such as Dementia or Alzheimer's patients).</p><p id="p-0405" num="0454">A quarantine-related exemplary embodiment may be configured to &#x201c;allow&#x201d; a person under quarantine to go to the grocery store (including proscribing when, where, with who, how, and why) based on a variety of contextual factors, such as the current state of the person's household's pantry/refrigerator and &#x201c;deployed&#x201d; supplies (such as toilet paper) all of which may be determined by using IoT sensors for example; the number of people in the household (based on any number of factors, including number of beds in the house, credit cards with that address, facial recognition &#x201c;keys&#x201d; enabled for the doors, etc.&#x2014;all determinable by sensors, or via a pre-identified profile determined at startup); patterns of usage (individually or collectively) within the household, and associated trends/predictions/projections of low inventories of a good/supply (based on daily/weekly consumption patterns detected by sensors, historical trends (e.g., rate of usage based on historical buying patterns of a given good, etc.); the last time someone in the household went to the grocery store (based on integration with navigation or social media apps, or integration/interface integration with credit card systems or grocery store databases), why they went (e.g., was it to shop, or see his cashier girlfriend&#x2014;determinable based on credit card statements, changes in household goods &#x201c;inventory&#x201d; relative to grocery store visits by IoT-type sensors, etc.), how long he was in the immediate proximity of his girlfriend's smartphone while he was at the store-based on standard personal geofence determination (possibly assisted by in store location beacons); what was bought (e.g., using historical location/contextual/other sensor data cross-referenced to household &#x201c;inventory management&#x201d; systems utilizing IoT and other sensor arrays and/or cross referenced to detailed electronic grocery store receipts); what are the household's dietary and/or health needs (e.g., diabetics, heart disease, allergies, genetic susceptibility, obtained through integration/interfaces to medical databases and/or pre-identified risk profiles as part of quarantine setup) and key demographics (e.g., elderly, babies, also part of quarantine profile setup); and even considering the work that person(s) in the household does (e.g., if they are EMTs or nurses (obtained by quarantine profile setup or by access to employer records (with the employee's permission), or perhaps a special essential-employee electronic certificate or flag in a 3<sup>rd </sup>party database)&#x2014;a circumstance/demographic that can add to the risk-of-running-out-of-food risk by them consuming (and needing to consume) food at a faster rate versus someone working at home (increased rates of consumption obtained by access to calorie-consumption tables based on age, gender, occupation, etc.).</p><p id="p-0406" num="0455">The use of integration or interfaces (except where otherwise noted, particularly with respect to user-interaction type interfaces such as text, email, phone calls, holograms, heads up displays, etc.) generally are interchangeable when in the context of an exemplary embodiment. From a technical standpoint, there are some distinctions. For example, systems integration&#x2014;the kind generally used in exemplary embodiments disclosed herein &#x2014;refers to the electronic-tying together of one or more computer systems, sub-systems, applications, communications networks, and/or databases through various methods and mechanisms. Often these computer systems et al. are owned/operated by different entities and/or have different functions and capabilities such that integration may include combining the respective functions and capabilities or even creating new capabilities, e.g., 1+1=3, etc. An interface (not a personal or human user interface), such as in API (Application Program Interface) may also involve combining/integrating otherwise separate/disparate systems but does so by providing special capabilities to facilitate doing so, such as providing standards and specialized software to make it easier to integrate multiple systems, instead of &#x201c;customizing&#x201d; all the electronic links system-by-system, data-element-by-data-element, and so on.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0456">Risks are also detectable in exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. For example, a much higher rate-of-consumption of food may be indicative of &#x201c;stress eating&#x201d;-a risk that, left unaddressed, could lead to the household running out of food (or certain foods) earlier rather than later. It could even result in &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; issues (e.g., gastrointestinal (GI) tract issues, etc.). As indicated by the possibility of &#x201c;stress-eating,&#x201d; mental/mentally-based risks are detectable in exemplary embodiments. Mental/mental-based triggers such as Anxiety or Fear (e.g., of getting sick, infecting others, or dying), Excitement (e.g., the desire to/excitement about something, or even getting out of the house), Boredom (e.g., the &#x201c;need&#x201d; to get out of the house), and so forth, could by themselves or in conjunction with other physical/environmental aspects as described above could trigger&#x2014;at least in the person(s) mind-a &#x201c;need&#x201d; to break quarantine, which may, or may not, meet the requirements of breaking quarantine. Certainly, being able to detect the existence of various forms of Anxiety, Depression, or other &#x201c;cabin fever&#x201d; mental conditions, where the person(s) is growing increasingly unstable, may be a &#x201c;valid&#x201d; quarantine-breaking condition (possibly if verified by an appropriate medical authority, who has access to the sensors et. al. readings), because left unchecked could result in some sort of psychotic-episode. Or, perhaps, detection of such about-to-explode-cabin-fever conditions could cause doctors/authorities to prescribe (without normal seeing-in-person protocols) Anxiety etc.&#x2014;reducing medications and/or other actions (such as allowing the person out of the house once a day for local-based running under appropriate control conditions). As such, the detection and preemption of risks are an example of the dynamic risk detection capabilities achievable herein, with appropriate machine learning, artificial intelligence, and/or other mechanism-based updating of pre-identified risk profile and employment of new or modification of existing sensors et al., as well as creation of new risk calculations, risk preemption/mitigation actions, resources, and interfaces to prevent/preempt the risk(s). Demographic elements, such as ethnicity could also be incorporated, particularly if there are ethnicity-based risk factors associated with an illness/virus. Such special risk factors, such as ethnicity and age, could feed into considerations of these factors on a macro or micro-basis. Various validation mechanisms could be employed to verify demographic risks linking to databases and also/instead to sensor et. al. readings for measuring, verifying, and/or validating physical (and mental) demographic risks.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0457">For example, local authorities could create special ethnicity and/or age-based group exemptions, allowing for example senior-only grocery store visit date/time blocks such that only seniors/age blocks into a store for a given time period. Various validation (of their exemption &#x201c;qualifications&#x201d;) mechanisms could be employed to ensure only those meeting the qualifications would indeed be allowed to enter the store. In addition to validating that a person can leave his house before leaving the house, exemplary embodiments may also be configured to provide levels or controls as to what-he-is-going-to-do level, in this case wanting to enter the grocery store. This further supports the notion that quarantines will be implemented at multiple levels in exemplary embodiments. e.g., at home, at intended destination, for intended purpose (e.g., location-less context), etc.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0458">An exemplary embodiment may include a health-related example/extension including a certification or other indicator of immunity for person(s) already infected/recovered from the illness (and thus having immunity) or having &#x201c;natural&#x201d; immunity. Such certification, validation, or other verification indicator may be provided in various forms, such as an &#x201c;immunity card&#x201d; (with a RFID chip or other sensors that could be &#x201c;read&#x201d; before allowing access to a space, like a store), an encrypted file loaded on a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; device (e.g., phone, apple watch, etc.) that could be also &#x201c;read&#x201d; by readers and compared to other personal data via other application integration/interfaces, e.g., a facial recognition program (adjusted for mask wearing, if applicable) to scan the person holding (electronically) the &#x201c;immunity card&#x201d; (in whatever form) and then comparing the embedded data (including facial profile) with a person's actual (live) image real-time, and so forth. &#x201c;Remote&#x201d; mechanisms may also be used, such as QR codes (individualized to a person, including whether the person has immunity) that can be scanned at key checkpoints. Embedded chips/sensors with appropriate certification/validation could also be used. However, some of these &#x201c;close quarters&#x201d; mechanisms may be problematic and thus avoided when conditions require social distancing. In such instances, the use of technology-based extenders and/or readers not requiring human involvement could be utilized.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0459">Both privacy and security may be provided to protect against tampering (e.g., trying to electronically &#x201c;fake&#x201d; immunity, certifications, etc.) and electronic identity theft. Such privacy/security aspects are disclosed herein including tampering mechanisms (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0411" num="0460">Other considerations addressed by the present disclosure include environmental factors such as the conditions of the building the household lives in (with influencing factors ranging from whether tap water can be drunk, if there is air-conditioning in hot weather, or what floor the household lives on and if there are elevators)&#x2014;accessed by integration/interfaces to building records or included as part of the pre-identified profile setup; the nature and conditions of the neighborhood (e.g., crime rates, level of and proximity to public transportation-readily identified by access to various 3<sup>rd </sup>party databases), including likely routes (if any) between the household and the grocery store (computed/obtained via integration/interfaces to various navigation apps). In &#x201c;big city&#x201d; scenarios where the household has no car and ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber service, taxis, etc.) are constrained/prohibited by the quarantine, additional focus will be put on pedestrian-oriented mapping programs (and underlying map data) identifying additional risk factors such as open dumpsters (with possible contaminated waste), and other contextual factors such as the weather (rain or snow prohibiting/inhibiting walking-easily accessible by integration/interfaces to weather apps or even real-time, extremely localized weather sensors deployed along the route or in its vicinity) or air quality (poor air quality prohibiting elderly or people with asthma from going to the store during poor quality days-obtainable via integration with local air quality apps/databases) and how they impact the ability to travel safely to the store in inclement conditions on any given day/time (part of an invention &#x201c;travel safely&#x201d; risk assessment algorithm based on any/many/all of the above factors). Regional/local conditions could also be incorporated into the risk factors/algorithms, such as the need for certain seeds in time for planting (in home vegetable gardens), particularly given (current or predicted) contextual factors such as weather patterns, soil conditions, dietary needs of household members, and so forth. Regional etc. variations could also (greatly) influence needs, supplies etc. by how restrictive regional/state/local controls are on essential businesses, control of key goods, etc., as well as determining the priority/weighting/conditions of who/when/why/how/where a person in quarantine is allowed an exemption, and/or even who has to be in quarantine in the first place (e.g., persons over 60 regardless of health, persons under 60 with certain health conditions or comorbidity, etc.). Even the contextual nature of the physical household could be considered, as highlighted by someone in a rural setting with say % acre of plantable land versus a high-risk urban apartment, or the &#x201c;mental context&#x201d; of the household, detectable by monitoring various mental metrics of individual household members to determine their individual and collective &#x201c;happiness&#x201d; or stress quotient and how that quotient individually/collectively impacts the risk of breaking quarantine.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0461">In various contextual/demographic examples (for example, households that have a sufficient amount of arable land), the household could&#x2014;and perhaps should&#x2014;be encouraged to plant a house garden or even a small farm. In the rural example, the household could&#x2014;and perhaps should&#x2014;be encouraged to plant a house garden. In such a context, what is deemed essential&#x2014;or even recommended (an action that could be recommended by an exemplary embodiment(s) disclosed herein based on the household context and other factors, such as time of year, availability of seeds and planting supplies, etc.)&#x2014;could vary (e.g., seeds would be useless in a high-rise apartment context, but (long-term) essential to a household with arable land, particularly a rural household without ready access to other food sources), and could also influence quarantine exemptions&#x2014;and type(s) of exemption(s). Recommendations (e.g., actions) by an exemplary embodiment(s) disclosed herein for preempting a risk are a key part of exemplary embodiment(s) of this invention, whether for example it includes recommendations for rationing/slowing down rate of consumption of a certain product (based on supplies and rate of consumption, prospects for replenishment, and mental &#x201c;state&#x201d; of the household and/or individuals therein), or providing proactive recommendations and specific steps for planting and nurturing a garden, or even in recommending the household apply for a &#x201c;specialty&#x201d; exemption that would enable the household to go hunting.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0462">In a further example/extension of the above, it would be recognized that the high-riser has little or no resources other than a local grocery store or similar for food (with availability or not of readily available online-ordered food/supplies also possibly taken into consideration), (likely) has very limited stockpiles of goods, and would have few/no viable &#x201c;specialty&#x201d; exemptions that could possibly increase its stockpile outside of a local grocery store. In a rural setting, this might not be as true, but other/different consideration for rural variations could be incorporated in exemplary embodiment(s). For example, it might take an hour or more to drive to a grocery store, placing practical limitations on access to a car, gas, etc., as well as recognition that the rural household would be logistically limited to fewer exemptions, but perhaps with a broader scope, e.g., trips to multiple stores, even visits to elderly parents (to make sure they are ok, e.g., through the window). As mentioned earlier, other variations on exemptions could include allowing such rural households to go hunting to supplement their food supply. Indeed, it can be argued that in certain epidemics and quarantines, the ability to self-source food could become very important to the extent possible. As an illustration an immediate need to accurately setup&#x2014;or modify after setup-upon the imposition of a quarantine, one of the key profile elements relative to the risk of violating such quarantine would of course be the type of&#x2014;and amounts of&#x2014;various supplies, as well as other associated factors such as perishability, expiration dates, vulnerability (e.g., from going bad depending on contexts such as weather and storage conditions), etc. The ability to establish such pre-identified supply &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; profiles, or updating the household's profile, via sensors, predictive estimates based on historical data, or even manual input is reflected in the scope of this invention. The quarantine exemptions acknowledge, account for, and enable such all the above variations in exemplary embodiment(s), as they are heavily context-based and reflective of its ability to dynamically (e.g., via automation) detect such contexts and create/modify actions accordingly.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0463">Exemplary embodiments may not rely on an unchanging or fixed pre-identified profile of risks, etc., but are configured for continually modifying/updating the profile and associated risks through a closed loop, machine-learning intensive, context-based, dynamic methods and mechanisms. There are various ways to perform the updates/modifications to the profile, e.g., including manually through prompting, etc. Exemplary embodiments are configured for dynamically (and both manually but particularly via automation) updating the profile and/or include system and process integration. As disclosed herein, exemplary embodiments are directed to preemption-preemption of risks, preemptions of behaviors that might lead to violations, preemption of other things that could result in an &#x201c;official&#x201d; or otherwise punitive warning/punishment. Exemplary embodiments may be configured to help or be on the side of the person, not the authorities-even to the extent of not alerting the authorities until it is absolutely necessary as a last resort without any other choice or option</p><p id="p-0415" num="0464">Government regulations in a quarantine situation play an outsized role, potentially controlling every aspect of life from personal mobility to civil liberties to supply chains. Such restrictions/regulations could change often-even daily&#x2014;and as such the appropriate 3<sup>rd </sup>party data sources describing those restrictions et al. would need to be fed into the system according to exemplary embodiment(s) via the varied architectural capabilities disclosed herein, e.g., communication links, directly to a client app, via 3<sup>rd </sup>party servers, via distributed nodes, etc., as appropriate. All of the factors/considerations could be used to establish&#x2014;or update&#x2014;the pre-identified profile in exemplary embodiment(s) through a variety of means: manually, periodical (electronic) updates, and/or real-time updates to the profile via systems integration as disclosed herein and appropriate 3<sup>rd </sup>party sources.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0465">The use of predictive analytics may be used in the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. For quarantines, this is important as its not necessarily the current supply of, say, toilet paper, it is when it is likely to run out. Thus, predictive analytics including the use of context (e.g., people in the household, their conditions (e.g., GI problems, etc.), rate of consumption, number of bathrooms, type of toilet paper (e.g., 2 ply versus 1 ply, etc.), etc.) and dynamic monitoring (e.g., not just frequently checking the usage, but recognizing that changing (re: dynamic) conditions/context (e.g., grandma is now sheltering-in-place with us, Janie's increased level of Fear is causing her gastral distress, Tom's PTSD is getting worse as confinement continues, etc.) is very important. For example, this is important when predicting necessary supplies (on an absolute basis, on a relative basis compared to needs and/or certain circumstances or assumptions, and/or given/relative to a specific time period(s)), and particularly when an exemption is needed to preempt someone being tempted to break quarantine (and what and how that is measured, e.g., rising Anxiety as measured by heart palpitations, monitoring of household conversations, types of web sites visited, content of messages sent, etc.).</p><p id="p-0417" num="0466">In exemplary embodiment, the above may be utilized to identify when there is a &#x201c;valid&#x201d; need to go the grocery store and identifying it early enough that there is minimal (or at least reduced) risk of someone in the household being tempted to risk breaking quarantine unlawfully in order to obtain supplies. Minimizing or at least reducing this risk could include identifying &#x201c;special&#x201d; goods needed by individuals such that if they begin to get low, there is a noticeable rise in Agitation, Anxiety, or Fear levels as indicated by (personalized) values. Such values-determined via various sensors as disclosed herein &#x2014;include certain amounts or percentages of raising of (in relation to normal, pre-identified levels) blood pressure, average pulse levels, and/or increase in average decibel-based average speaking volumes, possibly measured in conjunction with immediate usage of a fear-of-running-out product, such as the use of toilet paper, for those persons who have a major need for that product (such as people with no colon-which require very frequent restroom visits); or the fear/agitation is &#x201c;just&#x201d; identified as a major fear-of-running-out product based on other, less logical reasons. A &#x201c;need&#x201d; to stockpile-perhaps as mandated by local authorities' or based on a variety of factors such as a baby-on-the-way in the household, exacerbated by lack of room, money, or fear of new sources of noise&#x2014;could also be included in both consideration of the household's &#x201c;necessary&#x201d; supplies (type and quantity), as well as predicting when an exemption would be needed. Part of the risk calculations in exemplary embodiment(s) is to anticipate/predict the risk of unauthorized quarantine violation(s)&#x2014;well before the person(s) in the household become aware of the possibility of those risk(s) themselves.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0467">Two additional aspects address the identification of risks. One aspect is in the identification of pre-identified risks and associated behaviors, activities, triggers, and contexts. The second aspect is the various methods and mechanisms for adding to/deleting/modifying any or all of those risks and associated behaviors/activities/triggers/contexts. In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, the invention allows for many diverse ways of adding to/deleting/modifying the profile, and in turn what data dimensions are tracked, how they are tracked (e.g., what sensors/sensor arrays/networks et al. are used), how they are configured, values/levels/ranges/tracked, how the risk/compliance algorithms are calculated/configured/calibrated, and in turn what actions/resources/integration/interfaces are employed, how the results of those actions/resources/integration/interfaces are measured, and how (via various techniques such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning are &#x201c;fed back&#x201d; into the integrated/overall system to further add to/delete/modify the profile, and thus ripple through/add to/delete/modify the risks, risk measurement systems, and so on in iterative/continuous loops.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0468">Exemplary embodiments include highly technological closed loop or feedback control system that doesn't rely solely on technologies, e.g., &#x201c;low-tech&#x201d; mechanisms can be used to update the profile on which risks et al. are captured. For example, a person in the household could notice on their own that a) they are getting low on a supply, and/or b) that they are getting increasingly concerned, fearful, depressed, stressed, or anxious about individual triggers, behaviors, activities, and/or contexts (in a way not originally anticipated when the original pre-identified profile was setup). Various techniques/filters could be used to incorporate (e.g., unfiltered/filtered, modified, etc.) the concern of the member household into the profile, including direct (manual) input/updating process, via an application that filters/assesses the input on a variety of dimensions (including viability, as well as assessing the risk/possibility of the person inputting data to &#x201c;game&#x201d; or otherwise tamper the system to try and obtain an exemption when it is not needed, etc.). In exemplary embodiments, the system could also, for example via a Siri or Alexa-type interface, ask the user/household member&#x2014;&#x201c;Hi Sally, are you running low on anything, or concerned,&#x201d; or &#x201c;what is on your mind?&#x201d; &#x201c;What are you concerned about?&#x201d;&#x2014;a kind of mechanism-based therapy that also serves to assess risks related to the quarantine. The responses can be analyzed, crosschecked, assessed (or simply indulged), through adding the responses to the risk of quarantine violation risk algorithm, actions, etc., including &#x201c;just&#x201d; automatically ordering it (what is deemed to be likely to alleviate the risk(s)) via Amazon or other source, to the extent possible. In exemplary embodiments, this kind of mechanism and interface could be used-even if the supply request/quarantine exemption is not &#x201c;approved&#x201d;&#x2014;to mitigate another real risk of quarantine: mental distress associated with mental (triggers (or mental/physical combination triggers) of including but not limited to Agitation, Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Change, Children concerns, Depression, Escape, Excitement, Fear, Frustration, Fun (or lack thereof), Guilt, Health concerns, (missing of) Holidays, Insomnia, Irritability, Job worries, Loneliness, Money concerns, building intolerance to Noise, Overconfidence (in a solution being found quickly), Peer Pressure (to break the quarantine), Power (feelings of ability to break quarantine with impunity), Powerlessness (to do anything about the quarantine), Relationship problems, Sexual problems, various forms of Stress, upsets associated with Times of Days/Habit/Routine disruptions, increased feelings of Victimhood, and fear of Yelling or conflict. For example, a loneliness/boredom risk may be measured/detected by various methods and mechanisms as disclosed herein including context and being dynamic, e.g., why and how/what in particular in contrast to location-only. So even if not approved, by just the mechanism of asking the person, through Alexa, Siri, a &#x201c;voice call&#x201d; on her phone or even texts or emails generate by bots, could be very helpful. Such a loneliness/boredom risk (measured/detected by various methods and mechanisms as disclosed herein), if beginning to elevate, could result in dynamic, context-based actions/interfaces/resources such as automatically placing (or causing to be placed) a call to a &#x201c;quarantine hot-line&#x201d; to discuss-specifically&#x2014;the household's supply situation and talk about ways to conserve them, with information about the household's situation preceding the call to be sent to the (human) hotline person receiving/placing the call. If not deliverable (in that sense), it could even be added (subject to the appropriate controls, qualifications, etc.) to a neighbor's shopping list-one who has already been granted an exemption or seems likely to be granted one before the household is. In fact, such a &#x201c;shopping representative&#x201d; type of situation could be employed in contexts/situations where a person needs supplies but cannot&#x2014;or is afraid to&#x2014;go out to get them, and they can't be ordered and delivered automatically.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0469">Exemplary embodiments may also be configured for uses involving the grouping or pooling of people under quarantine and/or include one or more groupings or pooling of risks (e.g., everyone in the household, or even everybody in an old building with lead pipes that need bottled water) detection/monitoring of elements underlying those risks, and how they manifest throughout the invention, e.g., everybody or some plurality of individuals is at risk of breaking quarantine because of a common denominator&#x2014;i.e., water; and all the way through the actions, resources, etc., e.g., someone(s) go and get water for the whole building. The pooling could manifest itself everywhere, even influencing when and what kind of exemptions are granted (and to whom) to reflect the common/pooled risk and the logic of addressed that pooled risk with pooled actions, e.g., delivering a truck-load of water to the building and then employing specialized/pooled distribution methods and mechanisms, e.g., everybody come down to the shipping dock in scheduled/staggered times; designated residents (based on relevant criteria, such as those in the best health, the youngest adults, the physically strongest, etc.); delivering certain numbers of water bottles on each floor, or in front of each door, depending on need, etc.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0470">In exemplary embodiments, actions/interfaces may include peer-to-peer (P2P) communications between the person and resources. For example, in the grocery store examples, walkie-talkies or smart watches (e.g., Dick Tracy-like) could be used to make it much easier to communicate from a (local) distance, without using a phone. Plus, touchscreens of smartphones are not usable while wearing most gloves. Walkie-talkies (that use a manual push button) could be &#x201c;standard issue&#x201d; (sanitized of course) as a person walks into a store, to communicate with store personnel, once the person is verified to be wearing the appropriate protective gloves, or, better yet, voice-activated communicators that require minimal physical interaction. Such P2P communications could also be employed with home deliveries, and/or assistance with deliveries, and/or &#x201c;pooling&#x201d; of resources, among other uses.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0471">In exemplary embodiments, a core capability of the invention is to identify the &#x201c;triggers&#x201d;/certain behaviors/activities/states (mental, physical, or both) of a person by which, if left unaddressed, could lead to undesirable behavior&#x2014;in this case, violation of quarantine. This risk of quarantine violation, however it is defined for the circumstances, could be a major input into an &#x201c;application&#x201d;/submission to the appropriate &#x201c;authority(ies)&#x201d; for a (temporary) quarantine exemption certificate. Here again would be where various privacy/security protocols/mechanisms would be employed to prevent a household from &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; the system to generate an &#x201c;inflated&#x201d; risk of quarantine violation by manipulating various risk factors and so forth. In turn, the exemption authority could incorporate the household's individual risk assessment along with other considerations, including, but not limited to, the number of other requests/submissions; their geographical distribution to each other and to local grocery stores or other needed supply source(s); the timing of the risk (e.g., who is most imminent at risk of breaking quarantine); the goods listed in the submissions of being most at need; the &#x201c;priority&#x201d; of those goods (e.g., toilet paper and protein products would be much higher than ice cream for example); the supply of those goods at those grocery stores; the expected traffic (and routes) if exemptions were issued (e.g., tailoring which submissions would be approved, and when, in order to manage pedestrian/road/store traffic). Similar elements would be involved in the obtaining of services, such as needing a plumber for plumbing problems, with additional considerations/precautions required given the need for a plumber (in this example) to be specially screened relative to quarantine requirements and the individual household needs and situation, such as requiring full hazmat suits if there is an elderly person in residence. This submission evaluation/approval process might be a multi-step process; first, a tentative approval might be made, and then second, once additional analysis (e.g., selection of household member, preparations have been made) then a second-much more time/store/route-specific exemption would be issued, along with associated systemic verification mechanisms (e.g., disabling any alarms that might be set on the household's door, updates to police databases to make sure that the specific exemption is set up in their enforcement/tracking databases, etc.).</p><p id="p-0423" num="0472">Supplies may also be delivered to the house through delivery services, e.g., Amazon, etc. In such a case, the details associated with a household member leaving quarantine to shop would not be applicable. But that doesn't eliminate the risk of exposure to the illness even if delivery is allowed. Further, the nature of the illness-causing entity would be very important in terms of precautions that would be required to take place before any shopping or even the person being allowed to leave the household. For example, air-transmitted viruses may require extreme attention to face/nose coverings and social distancing, whereas surface-spreading diseases would require gloves, and extreme attention to minimizing any sort of contact to any surface, human, even pets, elevator buttons, etc. The aspects employed in this invention can be dependent upon the full range of details involved: the nature of the disease/situation; the requirements of the quarantine and quarantine exemption, both overall and locally; the demographics and other individual characteristics of the household; the context/characteristics of the environment and household; the needs of the household (and of course individuals within the household); the availability and sourcing of the goods and services needed to fulfill those needs; the logistics involved in fulfilling those needs; various timing/time frames involved (e.g., how long the quarantine/current quarantine level is expected to go on; the nature of and/or priority of the goods and services involved, such as perishability of goods, priority of service needed, etc.); the macro availability and logistical complexity of the relevant goods and services (e.g., is rationing needed), the ability to deliver&#x2014;in whatever form&#x2014;the goods or services to the household, and so on.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0473">As noted before, a key goal of this invention is not only pre-empt/prevent quarantine violations, but to pre-empt/prevent the &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors/triggers/associated risks that may, if left unchecked/unmodified, lead to a possible violation. For instance, example embodiment above have to do with possible violations caused by running out of toilet paper, or plumbing problems (perhaps caused by using too much toilet paper). An objective of exemplary embodiments of this invention would not be focused on the running out of toilet paper per se, or detection of a clogged toilet, but to identify and pre-empt the behaviors that might in turn be causing a high consumption of toilet paper. It may be that a certain person(s) in the household has a gastric-related medical condition, with confinement exacerbating that condition because of his/her Anxiety, Fear and/or Stress trigger's impact on gastric irritation (and, in turn, increasing the amount of bathroom trips and amount of toilet paper consumed). Exemplary embodiments of this invention would be able to detect these triggers (either their existence or levels that are deemed as elevated/high) as early as possible in quarantine (perhaps benchmarked with pre-quarantine toilet paper consumption data), and proscribe actions to pre-empt high toilet paper usage, proactively, instead of reactively trying to order higher volumes of toilet paper once the trigger/health condition is fully &#x201c;active.&#x201d; Towards that end, exemplary embodiments of the invention may proscribe the need for virtual mental therapy to address the Anxiety etc. trigger(s), and/or perhaps recognizing that therapy may not work or only be partially successful, proscribe (and even automatically ordering) a bidet that will cut down on toilet paper usage.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0474">The above example is indicative that triggers may be either or both mental and/or physical. As disclosed herein, triggers may encapsulate various forms of mental thoughts, mental and/or physical behaviors, mental and/or physical states, and/or mental and/or physical activities. For example, a mental trigger may be Fear, a mental/physical combination trigger may be Anxiety and Health, etc. In particular for quarantine, mental triggers Anxiety, Depression, Fear, Frustration, Insomnia, Loneliness, and Powerlessness may be major triggers at issue with physical elements being secondary. Health may also be a primarily mental trigger, such as when a person is not sick, it may be the fear of getting sick (e.g., hypochondria) that is the issue, or if the person is actually sick or shows symptoms of being sick, it may be the fear of dying or infecting others that is the issue. Accordingly, mental/mentally-based triggers may also be in conjunction with physical triggers.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0475">There are many more detailed exemplary embodiments that are enabled by this invention. For example, through its &#x201c;support resources&#x201d; integration, the invention would also be able to access the profiles of any potential delivery or service persons, including their immunity (or not), familiarity with and/or access to the household (e.g., could they be allowed to bring in groceries without the need for a household member to open the door for them or otherwise get anywhere close to a household member, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0427" num="0476">A variation on the above embodiment enabled by this invention is the use of &#x201c;flash&#x201d; delivery points to allow delivery person(s) and recipients to meet in an area/controlled environment to deliver and pickup goods somewhere else other than, for example, a household or store. Such meeting places in addition to being &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; (e.g., post office boxes, etc.) could be dynamic in nature (e.g., short-lived, even setup purely for that particular date, time, and context, specific package type, persons needing to be involved, location otherwise used for other purposes, etc.). Such meeting places may be similar to the &#x201c;flash meetings&#x201d; as disclosed herein, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrating example ways in which Real-Time Location System (RTLS) technologies can be used to enable ad hoc, spontaneous, unscheduled, or flash addict meetings between people with similar addiction issues. Such meeting places may be based on identifying meeting places and appropriate related contexts (e.g., sterilized, secure/exception-qualified credentials, meeting places appropriate for/accompanied by other resources for safe handling, middlemen-type services, etc.) to allow for the safe &#x201c;transfer&#x201d; of the package from the delivery person to the recipient (in real-time, scheduled, or asynchronous delivery) dynamically (e.g., the location/context being short-lived, and potentially established purely for this package only or perhaps similar packages or contexts (e.g., people with similar issues and contexts also using the &#x201c;flash&#x201d; delivery point. Further, exemplary embodiments of the invention enable &#x201c;context-based&#x201d; delivery, e.g., given the constraints of a household (e.g., an elderly woman who can't pick up anything more than 5 pounds), the size/weight of the package (e.g., a pack of 48 water bottles), and the capabilities of (e.g., weight-lifting capabilities being up to 50 pounds-less than the pack of water bottles) and &#x201c;health-certification&#x201d; of the delivery driver (e.g., has been certified immune), that when delivering an over-weight-limit package to that weight-constrained, particularly-virus-sensitive-and-thus-requiring-extended (12 feet instead of 6 feet social distancing)&#x2014;social-distancing-household, that the delivery/delivery driver would be allowed special delivery &#x201c;exemption and context-based instructions (action) to allow in-home delivery of the package (even allowing electronic access to the home while the household member practices social distancing) and even &#x201c;setup,&#x201d; such as bringing into the house, wiping down the package, and &#x201c;putting away&#x201d; the package (such as a shipment of 48 water bottles) in the house.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0477">A specific sub-embodiment of the water bottle scenario is further illustrative of the novel and inventive aspects of the invention, and how it contrasts with existing, location-only prior art. For example, consider an elderly gentleman who lives alone in a 3<sup>rd </sup>floor apartment in a 100-year-old building with no elevators or air conditioning, nor does he have a car. The nature of the disease causing his quarantine dictates that he has to drink bottled water, as his building has lead pipes and the nature of the virus and his health conditions means drinking tap water is hazardous. According to exemplary embodiments, the invention (e.g., systems and methods, etc.) is configurable to know or have knowledge of the last time he went grocery store shopping, which store, and what he bought, particularly how many water bottles he bought. Internet of Things sensors (IoT-type sensors) may track his consumption, and predictive algorithms based on his consumption patterns, adjusted for weather predictions (e.g., how hot it will be and how his consumption will increase) may predict when he is likely to run out of water. Since a key goal is to preempt/prevent the risk of the man violating quarantine to get water (or, alternatively, risk his health by drinking tap water), the next part is to determine the best set actions, resources and integration/interfaces for him to obtain that water, before the risk of running out of water/having to drink tap water becomes too high, or he is tempted to violate quarantine to the risk (of infection) to himself or others (in the event he is an asymptomatic carrier). In this sub-embodiment, support resources (including the delivery driver example) would become critically important. As illustrative throughout the disclosed exemplary embodiments, the dynamic determination and deployment of actions and support resources, via context-based interfaces-including creation of new actions et al. to address unforeseen contexts, utilizing AI, machine learning, and/or drawing from similar contexts beyond the individual history of the person(s) involved&#x2014;are key elements in exemplary embodiments. As disclosed herein, dynamic, context, machine learning, multiple support resources, and closed loop aspects are also important in exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0478">Picking up with a household-needing-to-go-to-the-store embodiment, there are numerous context, location, and dynamic sensor/network based elements that factor into identifying what store to go to (presuming delivery is not available in this scenario), when (day/time) to go, who else will be involved (in helping him shop/bring stuff home), how he will get to the store (walking and subway, and what route is best to take), what to buy (given his water requirements, what he's able to get home, and up to his apartment).</p><p id="p-0430" num="0479">The above-described exemplary embodiments and its variations are enabled by aspects of this invention, though some exemplary embodiments are focused on preempting the core risk of violating a quarantine and/or a valid quarantine exemption. exemption, through focus on various &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors/activities/states/triggers/risks.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0480">A particular concern, and highly important in calculating the risk of quarantine violation&#x2014;not just risk of a violation itself, but the risk to public health&#x2014;is in the case of a household member having an active (e.g., contagious) case of the sickness. To the extent that tests are available to determine contagiousness or not, they would be employed, and taking a test and obtaining the results would be a prerequisite to obtain a restriction. Variations of risk could be considered based on the type of test(s) employed, e.g., antibody tests, micro blood testing stations, small microneedles sampling blood and rapidly scanning for infection. Other tests might include a thermal camera or infrared (IR) contactless thermometer, just doing temporary scans, any or all of which could impact the type and/or duration of any exemption.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0481">The test results could result in an immediate update of an &#x201c;immunity card&#x201d; (physical or virtual) or equivalent, and/or be sent to the various endpoints (e.g., grocery stores) or other in-route/possible-route nodes, as needed. In the early days of a pandemic, tests may not be available. In such circumstances, it is to the benefit of all&#x2014;not just &#x201c;forcing&#x201d; a sick person to go out for (possibly desperately) needed supplies, but for the sake of anyone that they would interact with in the process&#x2014;to do everything to prevent a situation. In such a situation, not only could the person's priority be dramatically escalated (particularly if they are a single-person household, but also even multi-person households where non-sick persons may be asymptomatic and thus for all practical purposes be as dangerous as the obviously sick symptomatic person), and, instead of applying a household exemption, instead employing (probably scarce) support resources to do the shopping for them and to deliver them to the household. In this scenario, the support resource(s) would need to have an equivalent exemption made for them, but with varying conditions such that they are not as subject to as strict routing or time windows, do not have their own personal future exemptions somehow impacted, and indeed to the contrary those &#x201c;do-gooders&#x201d; (even if paid), are providing future exemption &#x201c;credits&#x201d; or other rewards, including but not limited to those disclosed herein, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> describing an example addict rewards/demerits system based on an addict's behaviors and actions, which may include rewarding (or punishing) an addict based on behavior via tracking and data analytics and various reward mechanisms, etc.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0482">Embodiments/sub-embodiments disclosed herein are/can be applicable to Parolee/Persons Under Restriction as well as being useful in related forensics applications. For example, the information/data generated may be used to actually forensically prove related crimes, for example, proving that an &#x201c;alibi&#x201d; that a person dies from a virus was instead actually murdered, and so forth. In this exemplary forensic application, the risk avoided or preempted by the system/method in this example would be in allowing someone to literally get away with murder. All sorts of data that is collected as part of the quarantine risk of violation preemption as disclosed herein could be also used in reverse-engineering crimes, including murder, etc. For example, if there is evidence that the wife disappeared 10 days ago, but the husband maintains she disappeared two days ago, various data could prove/disprove that, such as how the rate-of-consumption of toilet paper changed 10 days ago, not 2 days ago.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0483">It is worth reiterating that a core purpose of exemplary embodiments disclosed herein is to preempt a behavioral/activity/trigger-based violation from ever occurring (e.g., breaking quarantine, etc.), by monitoring/tracking/assessing and preempting risks of behaviors/activities/states that, left unchecked, might lead to actual violations, long before there is imminent risk of such actual violations. Another core purpose is to preempt/prevent the person going to the store from being tempted to (or accidentally) violate restrictions associated with how he/she goes to the store. In all these examples, this may be implemented (more) for the purpose of protecting individuals in the traumatic event of a quarantine, rather than implementation for use a tool for government to monitor individuals and impose penalties on violators.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0484">If it is determined that a trip to the grocery store is needed to prevent serious risk of violating quarantine, exemplary embodiment(s) would enable several other activities and monitor associated behavior(s)/activity(ies)/state(s)/trigger(s) that, if they occur (or, show signs of starting to occur, or being a risk of occurring), could lead to violations (e.g., revocation of current quarantine exemption, lowering the possibility of future exemptions, public shaming, arrest, etc.). As noted before, the invention could for example integrate/integration/interface with quarantine exception systems/app(s) (perhaps run by the local government) to request an electronic exemption certificate, providing some of the key information described above and below. Once&#x2014;in general&#x2014;an exemption is approved (pending details, as supported by the 2-step local government process discussed above), the details must be determined, such as person(s) who will be the designated shopper, which store(s) will be allowed to be shopped at, what route(s) is/are allowed, what time(s) has been allotted for that specific shopping visit(s), what variations in the above are acceptable (e.g., if it is raining, more time might be allowed). Or if a critical item is out-of-stock by the time the person gets to the store, an extra allotment of time (along with new computation of routes and associated restrictions) may be allowed to enable him to get to a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; store, etc. These details could be stored on a device/mechanism on/in/in the vicinity of the person, or they could be stored elsewhere and retrieved in conjunction with various personal identifiers on/in/associated with the person, and/or stored in various distributed network nodes (potentially with distribution of details according to what a node &#x201c;needs to know and be known&#x201d; relative to when the person is in the &#x201c;coverage area&#x201d; (logically or physically) of the node).</p><p id="p-0436" num="0485">All these details may be important, as for a quarantine exception to function, it has to be relatively limited (or at least well defined), including a start time window, the start (e.g., home) and particularly the destination (the specific grocery store allowed), the ending time window, and what variances/flexibility (if any) is allowed in route travelled, destination(s), method of travel, etc., as well as environmental and other factors associated with all the above (e.g., weather, crime, garbage dumpsters, etc.). These details would depend on a variety of considerations, which considerations are anticipated by and addressed by the exemplary embodiments. Various variations in geofence techniques may be included as well as the context-related capabilities disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0486">If a risk of someone possibly being tempted to break quarantine is identified (in the form of an absolute score, a relative score in comparison to other households of similar composition/characteristics, a relative score in comparison to pre-quarantine metrics/&#x201c;benchmarks, and/or risk categories or even specific qualitative/quantitative examples of specific risk manifestations), and/or a recognition of the household's need (by local authorities, for example) has been acknowledged by the authority(ies), a next step (in a multi-person household) would be to &#x201c;select&#x201d; the household member (or this selection may be made by the exemplary embodiment(s) via assessment/computation, and in turn enforcing its selection) to go on the grocery store run (assuming only 1 person per household was allowed out). The selection&#x2014;if not left to the household&#x2014;could in turn depend on any number of risk factors, including but not limited to health and mobility factors (determined by pre-identified profiles and/or various sensors and/or access to various databases, as described before), such as age (e.g., not being too old or too young, for reasons such as being able to physically perform the shopping), whether he/she has positive or negative health factors such as virus antibodies (e.g., was already sick, as discussed earlier), pre-existing health conditions (putting him/her in extra danger if the virus was caught while they were out shopping), and/or genetic susceptibility (to catching the illness and/or the illness will be extra detrimental given their genetic conditions). Any/all of the above could also be evaluated against local contextual factors such as weather, crime, etc.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0487">Further, mobility factors could be considered, e.g., does the person have access to a car/safe transportation, or whether the person if he/she has to walk has demonstrated a past ability to walk the required distance and shop, have the ability to carry/push a certain weight and bulk of groceries, and return in the allotted time; and/or other risk factors such as the possibility or propensity to get &#x201c;distracted&#x201d; on or near the route needed to go to the selected grocery store (such as, for example, him having friends/a girlfriend that live along/near the route). Note that &#x201c;safe transportation&#x201d; by itself would require a risk assessment calibrated for the day/time that the person will be traveling. Certainly not all public transportation options will be equal in terms of safety relative to the person's specific requirements, and even private transportation options (e.g., bikes) may have practical obstacles that prevent their usage, in the specific context for which the person would need it (e.g., it is impractical to carry heavy water bottles on a bike). All these factors could be pre-identified as part of the profile setup process of the invention, and/or various sensors, and/or could be computed by the exemplary embodiment(s), such as combining various personal characteristics into a &#x201c;ability to shop while walking X distance with Y pounds&#x201d; score). In exemplary embodiments, the invention may also incorporate the use of &#x201c;Support Resources,&#x201d; such as the availability of (immune) nearby strong young persons to help elderly in carrying groceries from the store back to their apartment on the 3<sup>rd </sup>floor. Requesting/needing the support of additional resources (inside the household but especially outside the household) may be part of the exemption request process and may include requiring access to many of that support person(s) personal and/or household data as part of the exemption request risk assessment and evaluation/approval processes.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0488">In the shopper selection (or preparation) phase, exemplary embodiment(s) could also incorporate current local and/or demographic-oriented official guidance regarding movement/shopping and associated conditions (e.g., use of masks and gloves, and considering the household inventory of such). If masks and gloves are required, for example, then that requirement could be included in the exemption &#x201c;certificate&#x201d; (or equivalent), a potential source of a violation. Towards that end, if the household/shopper does not have a mask and/or gloves (e.g., medically approved, not just winter gloves, etc.), then an expedited acquisition process could be initiated, interfacing with Amazon or other online store, or perhaps local government stock, to get them expedited shipped to the household. This latter step would ideally not happen. Instead, one of the immediate tasks upon implementation would be to ensure that each household had all the medically necessary &#x201c;pre-requisites&#x201d; necessary for not only surviving the quarantine, but also have what is necessary when it is necessary (and allowed) to venture outside their individual quarantine area.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0489">A precursor, concurrent, or next step at this point is determination of a complete&#x2014;and verifiable-shopping list (virtual and/or physical). This list would be predicated on (but not necessarily limited to) the high-risk item(s) (that is/are causing the risk of quarantine violation). This list could be open ended, e.g., whatever household wanted (as long as it included the high-risk items); or it could be partially restricted (say, to total estimated weight); or it could be restricted to specific, individually approved items and quantities by the authorities. And/or it could be adjusted/restricted depending on supplies/anticipated supplies in the store(s) that the household member has access to, based on geography and other factors, discussed next.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0490">Turning to the &#x201c;destination&#x201d; of the quarantine, exemplary embodiment(s) could also incorporate current availability of certain foods at the nearest grocery store versus what the household is getting low on and/or needs/desires, and even selecting the grocery store(s) based on current (or projected) traffic in the store. For example, if there is less foot traffic/people in store A versus store B perhaps measured on a square foot basis, or number of active cashier lanes at that time or projected for when the person will be there, Store A would be selected even if Store B is closer. The exemplary embodiment(s) could even incorporate information like pedestrian traffic (current or projected), if the person would need to walk to a store and designing a route that minimizes interaction/maximizes the possibility of 6 feet or more social distancing, at various possible specific dates/times that are under consideration to be assigned/allocated to the person. Such assignment/allocation of permissible go-to-the-grocery-store times could even extend to integration with, and coordination with, scheduling programs, e.g., a person is allotted a coveted spot at 5 p.m. Friday because the person is a high priority go-to-the-store person based on the above, and the person is not scheduled to be at work at that time. A potential key part in the grocery store selection would be current and projected inventory of all items in order to make sure that an exemption and selection of a specific store does not go for naught by the person showing up to a store that is out-of-stock. This risk could be preempted by ties to the store's inventory management system, e.g., timing the store visit with expected delivery times (and stocking) of the high-risk items; use of an electronic ration-book control system; and/or a pre-allocation of stock by the store to a specific person (or exemption certificate), essentially setting aside the inventory for that person (or certificate) only. This would include re-introducing the stock into inventory, or allocating it to another person, if the item(s) are not picked up by the exemption certificate expires.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0491">The exemplary embodiment(s)&#x2014;at any point in the process-could also incorporate the household financial situation (based on pre-identified profile in the setup process, and/or access to credit score, etc.), e.g., income levels, whether the household is on food stamps that are awarded at the beginning of the month (thus being slotted at the beginning of the month is better than the end of the month), or even take into considerations when scarce supplies (e.g., toilet paper) that the household needs (or has been allocated a monthly &#x201c;ration&#x201d;) will be available in Store A, and if that is one of the household's pressing needs given the rate of consumption in the household (projected consumption based on household demographics, or even actual consumption as measured by IoT-type sensors). The financial situation of the stores in the area of the household could also be incorporated into the algorithms involved in choosing the store(s) that could best serve the needs of the household at that time.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0492">In addition, an electronic &#x201c;certificate&#x201d;&#x2014;with an embedded duration and where&#x2014;can-be-used embedded, could be issued to the person authorized to go to the store, that could be monitored by various sensors in the street, and actions and/or alerts of various content, integration/interfaces, and intent, sent to various enforcement entities if the certificate is missing or not valid at that time, place, location, and purpose. A core purpose of the invention is to preempt any actual violation. As such, the invention's primary&#x2014;and first priority-purpose and associated actions, etc. is to inform/influence/mitigate a person's behavior before an actual violation occurs. Thus, warnings/alerts etc. would be sent to the person (supposed to be) shopping or on the way to/from shopping, to get them to address &#x201c;inappropriate&#x201d; behavior well before an actual violation occurs and in turn triggering all manner of unpleasant actions by law enforcement etc. being visited on the person.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0493">For example, any deviation from the authorized routes by the person from their home to the selected grocery store could be analyzed and predictive analytics employed to determine if the person is accidentally (or within acceptable parameters) deviating from its authorized destination of the grocery store, or warnings/alerts sent to the person if their departure time or rate of progress is too slow relative to expected shopping time (estimated based on shopping list, traffic, and average through-put times of the store as historically indicated for that date/time or projected/predicted). If for example, the person using the &#x201c;authorization&#x201d; seems to instead go (or start to) to a nearby friend's place, in violation of official gathering guidelines, could be detected. In keeping with the invention's emphasis on extra-early early warning, and the preemption/prevention of an actual violation, indicators that indicate such misuse of the authorization could be monitored via a variety of sensors/networks et al., ranging from not taking a wallet (e.g., not taking any money to buy something), text(s) to a friend that says (be there soon) to dressing up &#x201c;inappropriately&#x201d; (e.g., getting all decked out in a way unlikely to a grocery store visit) to not taking a mask and gloves (prerequisites for being allowed to entering the grocery store), and so forth. Even checking that the person's primary device(s) has a sufficient amount of power for the trip could be part of the risk preemption mechanisms (e.g., if the phone dies in route, this would create all sorts of problems-mostly unmitigable). Again, the emphasis of the invention would be on actions to pre-empt a violation, through extra-early detection (particularly using behavior(s), activity(ies), state(s), trigger(s), and/or context(s)) and focus on actions, alerts, etc. to the person, versus prior art that focuses on location-centric, imminent or already-in-progress violations that are focused on involving law enforcement or other authorities.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0494">Once a person has been designated to go to the store, and the conditions under which he can go have been defined (e.g., what store(s) and where, under what date/time window(s), with what support resource(s), what route(s), by what mechanisms (e.g., car, walking, Uber, taxi, bus, etc.), and what can be purchased, to address the overall underlying risk of breaking quarantine and what individual risks making up that broader risk (e.g., the elements of where, when, who, how, what, and why), then the &#x201c;processes&#x201d; of actually going to the store, doing the shopping, and returning need to take place. This includes the management of a series of related risks, including but not limited to: violating any of the related who/what/when/where/why/how aspects such as leaving too late or too early; going without appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE); going with unapproved resources; deviating from the approved route(s) (or taking routes that could jeopardize being able to complete the shopping in the window allowed); going to the wrong stores (or unapproved stores); interacting with person(s) not deemed essential to the shopping (for example, stopping at a friend's house along the way); not purchasing the supplies that underlaid the reason(s) for the shopping in the first place; purchasing goods that might jeopardize being able to complete the shopping in the time allowed (for example, buying a 50 gallon container of water that could not be carried without assistance up the 3 flights of stairs up to the household apartment), for example. All the above can be tracked/monitored via some aspects of the exemplary embodiment(s). To enable at least some of this in-route, while shopping, and/or getting goods home sub-embodiments, it will be necessary to have integration/interface/integrate with various deployed sensors, networks, systems, et al. along the way and/or in the store. Accordingly, this exemplary embodiment may rely upon context including Where, When, Who, but also What, How, and perhaps most important of all Why. This use of context is considerably different than prior art that relies upon location only (Where When Who without any context and with Why).</p><p id="p-0446" num="0495">There are numerous&#x2014;and perhaps an unlimited or countless number of&#x2014;ways for &#x201c;validating&#x201d; that a person outside their home is doing so &#x201c;legally&#x201d; or otherwise in an approved fashion. For example, just leaving the household could be validated with a geofence-based validation that the person leaving (or about to leave or having just left) a geofence (defined by any number of methods, such as the property footprint for a single-family home, the actual footprint of the home, going out of the range of a beacon placed within an apartment or on the door(s), etc.). Upon detection of a (possible) violation, various devices associated with the household could be checked for an exemption certificate or equivalent, and local, EDGE-type IoT computing could prevent any further escalation of possible violation checking, at least with respect to immediacy of household leaving risks. Or, such possible violation behaviors could be communicated electronically to central server and/or decentralized nodes in the vicinity of the household to confirm a valid exemption. Such geofence-type checking is addressed in the prior art, or could be considered obvious, even if the mechanisms (e.g., EDGE-computing and validation via decentralized nodes) were not.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0496">But a device leaving the geofenced area or crossing a geofence is not the end of the exemption checking. See, for example, the tampering mechanisms disclosed herein (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, etc.). The tampering mechanism(s) may be used to make sure that the person leaving the household (with the device with the approved exemption) is the one who should be leaving. Although verification mechanisms may be known, the quarantine exemption&#x2014;with a stated destination, allocated time, etc.&#x2014;can also be context dependent. For example, various sensors (in the household, in/on the person, etc.) could detect the existence of&#x2014;and proper usage&#x2014;of masks and gloves, if for example those are required or recommended by various authorities (the existence of determined via systems integration with appropriate 3<sup>rd </sup>party systems/data sources). The exemplary embodiments may focus on determining this as soon as possible prior to leaving the vicinity of the household (or even before leaving the household), generating certain alerts/actions if the masks or gloves are deemed to be missing (e.g., go to pantry #3, they are on the bottom shelf) or not being used properly (e.g., the mask is around the neck, not over the mouth and nose, in proper orientation and coverage). Even non-required elements could be detected, such as bringing reusable bags in an environment is discouraging (but not prohibiting) use of such bags (due to their retention of germs), or, alternatively, since part of the shopping list may include heavy items (that would cause plastic bags to tear), ensuring (via the alerts/actions and subsequent results measurement) that the reusable bags being brought have been appropriately disinfected before leaving the household.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0497">As an example of the dynamic, context-based actions/alerts of the exemplary embodiment(s)&#x2014;and a distinction between geofence (e.g., location or location/context)&#x2014;only based alerts&#x2014;can be seen in the selection of interfaces in the above leaving-the-house example. The interface could vary for example both with respect to where the person is relative to the geofence boundary as well as the specifics of what the risk is. For example, if the person is still in the house, but not having opened the door, without having yet picked up masks and gloves, an audible alarm from in-house speakers could be generated with a message of &#x201c;don't forget your mask and gloves!&#x201d; Once he crosses the boundary (e.g., opens the door and steps out), then a buzzing or beeping on his phone could be activated (without an audible voice, to prevent panicked listening by neighbors). If he still hasn't turned around and gone back to his house, various automated calls and/or texts could be sent to all his devices, escalating if he continues to ignore them, such as sending messages to any support personnel (accompanying them, or being planned on being met) to try and contact the person/get their attention. If in a different context (e.g., he left carrying reusable bags), then the nature of the actions/alerts, and their content, might be dramatically different, reflecting the difference in severity between an &#x201c;essential&#x201d; risk of violation (e.g., leaving quarantine without proper PPE versus an &#x201c;optional&#x201d; risk of having discouraged (but not prohibited) reusable bags). Further, to the extent the various actions and/or interfaces (and or additional resources employed, if any) were not effective in changing the person's behavior (and thereby increasing the risk of an actual violation), then these (non) results would be fed back into the system/method embodiment(s) of the invention (via mechanisms including AI and machine learning) to modify (or even create new) actions/interfaces/resources to be employed instead of the those used in the current actions/interfaces/resources, the next time a similar risk, behavior, and/or context was detected, so that preemption of the behavior(s) that might lead to an actual violation could be done better/earlier/in a more effective manner.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0498">The above leaving-the-house example helps to demonstrate (novel and inventive) context-based extensions of &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; geofence-based restrictions, not only in what is tracked/measured, but how various context-based risks are identified (e.g., masks, reusable bags, etc.), and dynamic, context-based generation of actions are employed, even within a context-type (e.g., instead of the context-based possible risk of violation being not having a mask, it is one about how the person not wearing the mask properly, with variations of actions and interfaces within even that same context-type, even before he reaches the door)&#x2014;all examples of dynamically detecting, and preempting, various risks, via various behavior/activity/trigger/risk/context-based methods and mechanisms, before they can become actual violations.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0499">As the household member (and potentially, support resource(s)) travels to the grocery store, his progress will be tracked. There are a variety of ways to do this, e.g., by traditional GPS, or via Wi-Fi Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), or beacon-based tracking, or other such systems. While such this tracking may be known per se, what is done with the tracking information in embodiments disclosed here in non-conventional and less traditional. Given this invention's focus on preempting violations, the invention's primary&#x2014;and initial focus, at least&#x2014;is in detecting behaviors that might lead to violations, and initiating context-based action, using context-based interfaces and resources, to &#x201c;course-correct&#x201d; the person before an actual violation can occur and/or be reported. Exemplary embodiment(s) would go to great lengths to prevent a violation from being reported, including (under certain circumstances/contexts), not reporting actual violations to authorities if there is any chance of the person (quickly) correcting their behavior. For example, if a person is deviating from their &#x201c;approved&#x201d; course-even to the extent of exceeding a &#x201c;tolerance,&#x201d; buffer zone, or other approved range of variance (measured in distance, time, or other metrics), the exemplary embodiment(s) would implement an increasingly strident series of actions and interfaces and/or resources to &#x201c;encourage&#x201d; the person to correct their behavior, potentially ending with a kind of &#x201c;last warning&#x201d; message (via ALL possible interfaces), after which actions/alerts/messages to the appropriate authorities would be implemented. In this set of tiered or progressive actions, et al. the context(s) of the person will be critical in determining the tiering/progression, as well as to what degree of &#x201c;leeway&#x201d; or flexibility in the tiered/progressive actions will be implemented.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0500">For example, if the context is that the person has a broken bike (a transportation alternative somewhere between a car and walking, and a context detectable by sensors on the person's devices, on the bike, or even self-reported) and the person appears to be seeking repair assistance somewhere off the approved route, then the invention would not only not report the deviation to authorities, it would recognize the circumstances and try to help by contacting other (non-infectious) resources in the vicinity with the necessary skills and/or directing the person to the nearest bike shop that is allowed (in emergency circumstances) to repair bikes. Even if such a specific context cannot be detected, then the exemplary embodiment(s) could make differing tiered/progressive decisions and associated actions et al. based on not only where he is, but how he is moving (e.g., running, getting in a car, etc.), and using that information along with historical data on his movements and contexts as to where he is likely to be going. That predicted &#x201c;final&#x201d; destination would then likely have dramatic impact on the actions et al. employed by the exemplary embodiment(s). If it looks like he is going to a hidden, prohibited party for example, the actions et al. could be quite different than if he appears to be wanting to quickly visit his mother.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0501">Once at the store, a new round of sensor usage is employed, some traditional and some via this invention. To start, just entering the store will require validation of the person's &#x201c;credentials,&#x201d; e.g., having a valid exemption, and validation that the person trying to enter is indeed the one on the exemption (checked locally, centrally, via distributed &#x201c;smart&#x201d; nodes, etc.). This may include various techniques, including facial recognition (adjusted for mask-wearing). Context could come into play, however, for example, if the store has different entrances for different needs, than those contextual needs (e.g., the shopping list of the person/household, or at least their critical needs) could further modify the validation &#x201c;protocol&#x201d; or equivalent of the store. It could also vary for example by the age and (non-virus) health conditions of the person (e.g., a separate section for senior citizens who are otherwise healthy). A further variation could be if the person is accompanied by support resource(s) or needs support resources within the store.</p><p id="p-0453" num="0502">As the person traverses the store (practicing enforced social distancing using for example, personal geofences, or beacons that permit only 1 person at a time to be within range), the person's shopping list is compared to the goods on the shelves (using various tags/beacons per item). For example, persons with the store may be require wearing wristbands that vibrate when someone in the store comes within a predetermined distance (e.g., six feet, etc.) of another person in the store, whereby the wristbands would thus provide personal geofences for each person (e.g., shopper, cashier, stocker, other store employee, etc.) in the store. If the person passes by a needed (e.g., required/essential item that was a factor in their getting an exemption in the first place), then various alerts could be enacted. These could be delivered via a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; interface (or even specialized app automatically loaded on his device of choice when he entered the store), with alerts escalating if he continues to pass by the item without picking it up (in other words, enforced shopping of a sort). The nature of these actions could also be tiered, generally localized to the person, support person, and/or store management, e.g., not such as to disturb the other shoppers. Exemplary embodiment(s) could even enable &#x201c;assisted&#x201d; shopping in a sense that if a person &#x201c;misses&#x201d; as certain item, store employees will &#x201c;pick&#x201d; the item(s) (in the allowed quantities) and have it ready for the shopper when they get to the register. Indeed, at checkout (preferably via contactless mechanisms), the shopping list of the person could be automatically checked against the &#x201c;required&#x201d; items. Any omission would result in the total (including the item) to include the missing item(s), and then requiring the person to wait (probably outside) while the items are picked and &#x201c;delivered&#x201d; to the person (preferably without human interaction). In exemplary embodiments, other considerations may include a comparison of (A) how much time the person has left, ability to carry items, distance involved, how travelling (e.g., subway, car, bike, etc.) with (B) whether a (missing) item should be (involuntarily) enforced via perhaps a dynamic (context) calculation of total &#x201c;allowed&#x201d; purchases&#x201d; (e.g., by weight if the person has to carry the purchases and/or other transportation alternatives, etc.). A predictive algorithm may be used to determine if the person cannot get home before the exemption expires, and if so, then a &#x201c;forced&#x201d; replacement of non-essential items may be made with essential items.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0503">Leaving the store to return home could be tracked just like going to the store. But here again, the different context (e.g., going home, with a load of groceries versus going to the grocery store with none) could result in significantly different actions/interfaces/resources being employed. For example, any deviations from the route could be cause for different actions et al. to be taken than a similar deviation in the going-to-the-store context. A bike breakdown, for example, would make going to a bike store with a bunch of groceries impractical, if not impossible. As such, (approved) bike resources would need to come to the person. Such a situation would very likely result in an exemption time-expiration if left unaltered. Thus, a dynamic, rapid-approval extension and update to various certificate mechanisms would also need to be employed. Another, less forgiving, example might be a detection of a route deviation to a party. Going to a party, with an arm/basket load of groceries might be considered especially problematic (e.g., a risk of not only the person being exposed, but the groceries intended for the rest of the household being exposed), and thus the actions employed may have a much shorter/limited set of actions trying to rectify the person's course before law enforcement or other authorities are alerted. Or, other more &#x201c;harmful&#x201d; yet not-quite-as-bad-as-alerting-authorities might be employed, such as social credit score negative hits or even public shaming on social media. As an example of the use of interfaces, as the person follows an &#x201c;approved&#x201d; route, the navigation system might use one standard pleasant voice. But upon a deviation of the route, the voice changes, for example, from a woman to a man's voice that gets progressively angrier and/or louder as the deviation continues/gets farther from the approved route.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0504">Upon entering a building (e.g., for apartment dwellers, etc.), specific conditions of the building and context of the person could come into play. For example, a problem in many older buildings is that the main door out of the elevator must be opened by hand, and apparently it is against the fire code to put an automatic opener. Anyone going in or out of the building must touch that door handle and pull. This is obviously problematic in many respects, so as the person nears the building, an appropriate resource must be employed to operate the elevator appropriately, both to prevent the person from having to touch it (e.g., have less people touching anything on the elevator) as well as in the process assist the person with the groceries. Exemplary embodiment(s) would ensure that this took place appropriately, particularly from a timing and social distancing standpoint. This &#x201c;narrow&#x201d; assistance could also take into account making sure the steps up to the building were cleared of ice and snow under a presumption that such regular maintenance of such would be discouraged and thus need to be done for exemption travel only in a just-in-time basis.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0505">Upon returning home, a variety of sensors and actions would then be employed. Based on individual goods, sensors in storage spaces, the shopping list, the shopping list receipt (e.g., actual goods), and/or all of the above, the household inventory of goods would be updated to be used in future risk of violating quarantine calculations. Tracking of any support resources who entered the household would be noted, and the exemption certificate &#x201c;closed&#x201d; or otherwise updated to show that the exemption was successfully used and within the allotted conditions.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0506">In addition to (or an expansion on) the capabilities exemplified by the virus/grocery store examples above, another overall distinction between the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein and prior art, is that while some prior art may be considered a &#x201c;warning system,&#x201d; or, at best, even an &#x201c;early warning system,&#x201d; exemplary embodiments disclosed herein are an &#x201c;extra early-early warning system.&#x201d; In the virus/grocery store examples disclosed herein, all sorts of risks may be assessed and incorporated into the broader purposes disclosed for exemplary embodiments. For example, the risk(s) of running out of food or key supplies, to individual health needs, that might lead to a temptation to violate the quarantine could be assessed and preempted. On the other end, a deviation from a route (in consideration of other factors, such as likely destinations, time left over before the authorization expired, how much he was carrying, etc.) could be assessed for its likelihood of the deviation to be accidental versus deliberate, with context-based, even dynamically created actions (and resources and integration/interfaces, as applicable) being implemented to prevent an actual violation from occurring, well before it could occur, thus (hopefully) avoiding all manner of actual violation-induced punitive penalties and enforcement actions. Thus, the distinction between &#x201c;early warning&#x201d; (at best) of various prior art, and &#x201c;extra-early&#x201d; early warning system as disclosed herein is not just a question of semantics; instead, it is a major difference that is reflected in exemplary embodiments disclosed herein that are greatly distinct from prior art, and the associated emphasis in exemplary embodiments on preventing (e.g., doing essentially everything possible to prevent, etc.) an actual violation from occurring, through extensive use of dynamic, context-based, utilization of sensors, risk evaluation mechanisms, dynamic use of actions, resources, and interfaces, and the use of and feedback into the invention of actions et al. learnings via Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and other learning mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0507">Exemplary embodiments may also be configured for monitoring for and/detecting possible illness(es) based on changes in behavior. While this would include monitoring/detecting changes in temperature-fevers, sluggishness, etc., exemplary embodiments may be further configured to monitor for and detect unusual and/or non-medical behavior, such as, for example, changes in voice frequency, changes in sleeping habits, or perhaps decreased &#x201c;productivity&#x201d; from everything from how fast they can prepare a meal to how fast they type, as compared with historical (contextual) norms. The above in particular would be context-based, such as work typing (in Word) vs. doing personal texts. Advantageously, such exemplary embodiments may thus be able to detect illness in persons who are otherwise asymptomatic by detecting changes in behavior even if the persons otherwise &#x201c;feel fine.&#x201d; This would involves detecting (possible) &#x201c;extra early&#x201d; early warning signs of an (eventual) medical situation of asymptomatic cases and/or cases where eventually the persons get sick and have symptoms.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0508">Exemplary embodiments may also be configured for monitoring behaviors within the home environment. For example, this may include monitoring to determine whether school-age student(s) are studying (or not), along the lines of monitoring rates-of-consumption, etc. This may include tracking at-home schooling with the risk of the student avoiding required school activities, starting with logging in to the school's daily classwork, etc. This may include monitoring computer time to distinguish between playing video games versus school-related activities. The &#x201c;risk&#x201d; of violating quarantine associated with this would be that to the extent the child is falling behind at school, the parent might be concerned enough to violate quarantine in some way to &#x201c;break&#x201d; it for some reasons&#x2014;particularly if schools are in session for those &#x201c;immune&#x201d; children, and the parents get panicked enough about the student so poorly with online learning that they want to break quarantine and send him to school, even though the student is not eligible.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0509">Exemplary embodiments may include the concept of &#x201c;tiered&#x201d; quarantine areas. Thus, for certain locations, people, and/or context, there may be differently defined quarantine areas (and/or contexts). Thus, for a given household, there may be multiple quarantines: some people, (possibly, even likely) further qualified by context, might be constrained to the house or apartment (like seniors); other (people)/contexts to the yard (or for apartment dwellers-floor or building); others let outside the home and lot/building but constrained to the neighborhood or city limits.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0510">Beyond this location-based geofence-type quarantine, these tiered quarantines could depend on context, e.g., a home dweller allowed outside for chores (but not socializing), or the apartment dweller allowed to go to the basement where the washer/dryers are to clean their clothes (in this the &#x201c;tiered&#x201d; exemption may be &#x201c;micro&#x201d; in nature, e.g., making sure than only one person goes down to the basement at any given time). Again, this may all be geared to avoiding the risk of violating quarantine. For example, if someone has a sewer problem that he thinks has to be unclogged via the outside access, he will violate a house-only quarantine.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0511">Exemplary embodiments may include location-less context-based &#x201c;fence(s)&#x201d; without any location element. For example, if a hurricane is approaching, and a household is in need of plywood, certain foods, etc., then a shopping-for-hurricane exemption can be granted, that doesn't have any restriction on WHERE he can go, just WHY he is going, and WHAT he is getting, and perhaps how (e.g., has to go by car). A building dweller might have an exemption to walk her dog&#x2014;not specifying exactly where or how (or maybe not even where); just that she's got a window to take her dog out, and perhaps being back by a certain time. Another example is the clogged sewer in that it may be considered an emergency, and he (and the system of the exemplary embodiment) doesn't have time to figure out where he needs to go to get what he needs, therefore he is given an emergency &#x201c;sewer-unclogging&#x201d; exemption that allows him to go anywhere (within a certain time limit perhaps), as long as it is for the purpose of getting what he needs to fix his sewer problem.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0512">In addition, the pooled resources aspects disclosed herein may be extended to other exemplary embodiments. For example, a building may have a specific common issue (risk) that needs to be addressed in a pooled-related set of ways of detecting/monitoring it, evaluating the risk, and via pooled/common actions/resources/interfaces. This aspect of pooled resources may be extended to location-less context-based fence(s). For example, if the whole building has a sewer, water, or electricity problem, and time is of the essence, then a common purpose-based exemption could be given to multiple people in the same timeframe, without a number of restrictions that would typically accompany an exemption (e.g., destinations, routes, etc.)</p><p id="p-0464" num="0513">Regarding the interfaces, exemplary embodiments may preferably use interfaces that (a) are contactless or those that at least minimize contact with surfaces and/or nearness with other persons, and/or (b) do not require persons to remove their PPE, particularly gloves and masks. This would also include at key points, such as checking out at a store, e.g., avoiding all contact with anything through the use of wireless-enabled mobile payment mechanism, as well as maintaining social distancing (e.g., air &#x201c;contact&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0465" num="0514">Exemplary embodiments may include the use of robotics/automation. For example, home delivery/delivery assistance via the use of (sanitized) robots, including interfacing with support resources/delivery drivers, with the goal of a) minimizing human contact, both with the groceries as well as each other), and b) providing key support (instead of human support) to, for example, get the groceries from the front of the building to inside the household unit. It would be pointless, for example, to go to great extremes to buy the groceries only to later contaminate the groceries getting them into the building, up the stairs/elevator, to and into the front door. This may also include robotic bagging of groceries, or the &#x201c;picking&#x201d; of goods off shelves, e.g., instead of touching a good (and thus contaminating it, particularly if you put it back), the shopper could speak the good and a robotic arm would take it off the shelf and put it in the shopper's cart. Another option is to have the shopping list used as the picking mechanism, e.g., the list is communicated to the (distributed or server-based) shelf &#x201c;intelligence,&#x201d; and as the shopper approaches the good a robotic arm has the good ready to put into the shopper's cart (which the shopper could reject via voice command, want 2 of them instead of 1, etc.). Also, once this is done, then there may be an automatic updating of the shopping list, which could be used as another mechanism for making sure the shopper does not leave the store without having bought everything that is needed (e.g., the reason the shopper was granted an exception in the first place).</p><p id="p-0466" num="0515">Accordingly, disclosed herein are exemplary embodiments of systems and methods for monitoring for and preempting the risk of a future occurrence of a quarantine violation, such as by using behaviors and/or actions (e.g., pre-identified behaviors, preemptive actions, etc.) determined via one or more different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks (e.g., the Internet of Things (IOT), social networks, etc.). Exemplary embodiments may include one or more (or all) of the follow major innovations not present in the prior art:<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0516">use of systems and process integration to preempt the risk of a future occurrence of a quarantine violation</li>        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0517">using context and being dynamic as compared to prior art systems that are location-only, using &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; or static sensors, risk algorithms, and actions. In contrast, aspects of the present invention use context in some way as well as emphasizing &#x201c;dynamisms,&#x201d; e.g., emphasizing rapidly changing risks, behaviors, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0518">use of closed/partially closed loop and/or learning systems and methods. For example, the system may continually learn and improve without manual input the longer it goes on.

Then, as the RESULTS of the actions/resources/interfaces are measured, the results, via various methods and mechanisms including AI, machine learning, etc. are then &#x201c;fed back&#x201d; (via the &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d;) into the exemplary embodiment(s), and/or new elements (e.g., sensors, actions, data sources) are determined to need to be added (e.g., partially closed loop), including updating the profile and/or also changing (possibly) the risks measured; what sensors et al. are used and/or what configurations/values are used/measured; what risk assessment formulas/algorithms are used; and/or what actions, resources, and/or interfaces are employed to address the (possibly now modified) risks-particularly the context. Then, these results are fed back again in an ongoing process of continual improvement/modification/learning.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0467" num="0519">As disclosed herein and shown by the table below, triggers may encapsulate various forms of mental thoughts, mental and/or physical behaviors, mental and/or physical states, and/or mental and/or physical activities.

considered mental only triggers. Some may be considered as both physical and mental triggers, such as money or relationships. In addition, a mental trigger (e.g., Fear, etc.) may be caused by any sort of context, including mental (e.g., an imminent important deadline), physical (e.g., a physical examination that could determine whether I pass and can get the job), or both physical and mental and physical (upcoming physical interview with a prospective boss). In addition, physical environmental factors disclosed herein (e.g., nature of lead pipes in a residential building, etc.) may be characterized differently than simply running out of an item. Such environmental factors may be characterized as contributory contextual factors (both physical and mental) that could be combined with triggers, e.g., mental/mentally-related triggers. Accordingly, triggers may thus be mental, physical, or a combination of both, while context may also be physical, mental, or a combination of both (e.g., being in a pressure-packed meeting at a physical workplace versus a pressure-packed zoom meeting or upcoming deadline).</p><p id="p-0470" num="0521">In addition, physical triggers may also be caused by and/or are interrelated with mental triggers. For example, a person being hot (physical trigger) may be caused by elevated blood pressure (physical), which elevated blood pressure may have been caused by Anxiety/Worry (mental). As another example, a person feeling thirsty (physical trigger) may be caused by the person being hot (a both mental and physical state), which, in turn, may have been caused by Anxiety/Worry (mental state/behavior/trigger). As yet a further example, a person being short-of-breath (physical trigger) may be caused by Anxiety or Excitement (mental). In addition to these examples, another example includes mental and physical triggers that have a more clear/major cause-and-effect connection, such as a person having mental issue/trigger/state caused by a vitamin D deficiency and the household is running out of vitamin D supplements/food.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0522">Disclosed herein are exemplary embodiments of block-chain based dynamic and adaptive systems and methods for behavioral modification and rewards. By way of background, behavior modification programs have been around for decades, as have such programs with rewards associated with achieving behavior milestones or otherwise providing some sort of financial/material incentive for modifying one's behavior. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,039,688 (hereinafter the '688 patent) is titled &#x201c;Therapeutic Behavior Modification Program, Compliance Monitoring and Feedback System&#x201d;. The '688 patent discloses a rewards program for modification of behavior relating to a wide variety of ailments, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, chronic pain, depression, addiction, cancer, and a wide variety of other ailments. The '688 patent discloses that the changed behavior includes changes to diet, exercise patterns, and stress levels. Other patents mirror the scope of the '688 patent, generally adding various &#x201c;bells and whistles&#x201d; as to how the modification program and/or compliance monitoring/feedback system is implemented.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0523">The '688 patent, and others like it, have a variety of common characteristics, notably that many if not all of their key components are fixed in terms of the component either having to be predefined (e.g., before a behavioral modification rewards program can be established and put in operation) or at least be narrowly defined, structured and implemented before providing or awarding any reward. Examples of how the key components are fixed and predefined include:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0524">The behavior(s) that are the basis of the modification program and associated rewards need to be predefined.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0525">The modifications to the behavior and/or associated goals need to be established/predefined.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0526">Milestones associated with the behavior(s)/behavior modification need to be established/predefined.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0004" num="0527">Actions/feedback mechanisms to encourage behavior modification/achievement of milestones need to be created/predefined, as well as conditions to initiate such actions/feedback mechanisms.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0005" num="0528">Quantification and associated measurement of the behavior/behavior modification/milestones/actions/feedback mechanisms need to be quantified and translated to measuring mechanisms that need to be predefined.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0006" num="0529">Rewards programs, reward types, levels of reward within type, range/allowable conditions for an award to be awarded, values of any given reward, the mechanism(s) for awarding a reward, and the mechanisms for redeeming a reward need to be predefined.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0007" num="0530">Personalization or customization of any of the above needs to be established/predefined.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0473" num="0531">In short, existing prior art fully or predominately requires some or even all of the above elements to be predefined. These and other prior art characteristics, at a more granular level of detail, include in full or in part:<ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0532">A &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; reward system that includes specific milestones for the person (such as an addict) that need to be met for a given behavior and associated targeted/desired behavior modification.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0002" num="0533">Behavior(s), and associated behavior modifications, need to be predefined, such as behavior=eating, behavior modification=eat less, and/or goal=lose weight.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0003" num="0534">More specifically, these milestones, while by their nature having some degree of personalization (e.g., Joe you need to cut your drinking in half by next week, or Jane target losing 10 pounds by end of the month) are still generally fixed in terms of the core behavior/activity (e.g., drinking, eating less) to be changed. Further, as indicated by these examples, these milestones by their nature also tend to have fixed time-related elements, e.g., achieving a milestone by a fixed time, or within a fixed time period, or other fixed temporal metric, that may (or may not) be also be personalized, e.g., Jane wants to lose the weight by her sister's wedding on March 15th. Further, the personalization is limited to the degree of change relative to the fixed core/end behavior to be modified, versus related, contributory, and/or underlying root cause behaviors (unless those are also pre-defined).</li>        <li id="ul0020-0004" num="0535">Even when the milestones/behavior modifications/goals are personalized, the rewards still tend to be fixed, or at least not personalized in how the rewards are delivered. Meaning, even if the reward/reward value is personalized to the person, the presentation or personality is not. In other words, in the prior art the reward tends to be a material or financial thing that typically shows up as a credit in some account, or through some sort of physical or virtual offer for free or discounted stuff. Little attention is paid to how the user is informed/made aware of their reward, e.g., there is no focus on the presentation or personality associated with the reward delivery and notice/information to the awardee.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0005" num="0536">Indeed, the nature of prior art rewards tends to be physical or financial. There is little to no attention paid to rewards in or involving the virtual world, such as the awarding of game tokens or other game-related add-ons as it relates to behavioral modification rewards. Thus, the delivery mechanism of the reward is relatively fixed in terms of form/form factor.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0006" num="0537">The prior art fixed reward systems are fixed not only with respect to specific milestones and delivery mechanisms, but also require that specific rewards/level of rewards for specific behavior modification be determined beforehand, e.g., receive $10 in discount coupons for every 1 pound lost. More broadly, there are no mechanisms for dynamically/adaptively creating, implementing, and delivering new rewards programs/rewards/levels &#x201c;on-the-fly,&#x201d; or dynamically adapting a program to reflect changing conditions/circumstances/contexts, or even monitoring/measuring/rewarding &#x201c;new&#x201d; behaviors related (or not) to the original &#x201c;pre-identified&#x201d; behaviors. Instead, nearly all rewards programs, if modified at all, are done so program-wide, typically after deep proforma analysis of how such changes would impact the financial and operational viability of the system as a whole. To the extent such changes are made dynamically, they are done across-the-board with respect to program participants, not individually to reflect changing behaviors/circumstances/contexts of the person. For example, for a person with the Anger trigger, the ability to manage their anger may be vastly different (and more difficult) for them while at work, versus by themselves or at home. This variation in susceptibility to anger based on these different contexts may not be known when the (original) behavior modification program was set up&#x2014;with such a variation (in the prior art), if recognized at all, needing to be (pre)established in a new behavior-to-be-monitored profile well after the fact of such discovery&#x2014;not dynamically/near instantaneously. In these &#x201c;newly discovered&#x201d; contexts, it will be more important to reward-near instantaneously, or at least very rapidly&#x2014;&#x201c;good&#x201d; behavior (e.g., managing the underlying causes of and/or contributors to his anger), at work and/or around other people, vs. when he is alone/at home. Thus, the ability to dynamically change/adapt the rewards program to a wide variety of personalized, rapidly changing, and/or newly/recently discovered (typically) context-based dimension(s) is absent in the prior art.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0007" num="0538">Further, once a reward is awarded, these prior art systems also have fixed redemption elements (e.g., redeem this coupon within 1 year) that does not vary between persons to which it is being awarded. In other words, these prior art systems typically lack personalization in terms of redemption conditions and/or processes, or they are limited to time-related dimensions, e.g., within one year of being earned, by his/her next birthday, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0008" num="0539">The behavior to be modified is predominately physical, e.g., drink less, eat less, etc. Further to the extent that there is additional behavior modification to be tracked/monitored and modified, this related behavior is closely and/or directly related to the core behavior. For example, &#x201c;drinking less&#x201d; may be more specific in terms of &#x201c;drink less wine,&#x201d; but not involving any &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors that may lead to drinking more (or less), whether it's wine or any alcohol.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0009" num="0540">These &#x201c;upstream behaviors/contexts/situations/circumstances&#x201d; also referred to herein as &#x201c;triggers&#x201d; are absent in the prior art. Instead, the prior art is focused on the end behavior not any upstream behavior or triggers. For example, the prior art may focus on reducing drinking rather than recognizing (and trying to prevent) that Anger is a major trigger for his/her drinking (e.g., he/she drinks when angry). This prevents monitoring of upstream behaviors/contexts/situations/circumstances that would allow for &#x201c;pre-emption&#x201d; of the end/core behavior. To the extent the prior art does include trigger-like behaviors, the trigger-like behaviors are generally subordinated in the prior art to some or all of the fixed characteristics described above thereby excluding the ability monitor/detect/establish actions/create rewards dynamically to behaviors/contexts/situations/circumstances that were heretofore unknown to contribute to his/her anger or reduction of anger.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0010" num="0541">The actions associated with modifying the behavior, if based on monitoring, are also physical, e.g., monitoring your diet indicates you are eating too many carbs and should eat more fruit next week.</li>        <li id="ul0020-0011" num="0542">Tracking behavior modifications, to the extent the prior art uses sensors and other electronic mechanisms, are focused on tracking the specific end, or core behavior, such as losing weight or drinking less. In this sense, the prior tracking mechanisms are also fixed and focused on tracking a specifically defined behavior or limited set of behaviors. The prior art does not include a broad range of tracking mechanisms nor mechanisms that can adapt to changing/new upstream behaviors/activities/situations/circumstances/contexts not originally anticipated when the rewards program and associated actions were created.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0474" num="0543">In general, the above translates, among other characteristics, to forcing the person to change their behavior to meet the requirements of the rewards system. In contrast, Applicant's systems and methods disclosed herein are configured to do the opposite as changes are made to the rewards system/program(s) to meet the requirements, characteristics, and/or behaviors, activities and/or context(s) of the person even to the extent of dynamically creating new rewards programs with new actions for newly identified behaviors needing to be modified rapidly.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0544">Put differently, the prior art behavior-modification rewards programs do not have the following characteristics/attributes:<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0545">A &#x201c;variable&#x201d; reward system that adapts to the behavior of the person, both in types of rewards and levels of rewards.</li>        <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0546">Adaptable, dynamic, or even no pre-set/fixed milestones for the person to achieve. Rather, prior art rewards program(s) are dependent upon the behaviors/change in behaviors (of any sort) of the person.</li>        <li id="ul0022-0003" num="0547">Ability to dynamically/adaptively create and implement rewards programs, rewards within a program, and levels with a reward that are based on newly identified (e.g., not pre-identified) behaviors, behavior modifications, and actions to enable/assist in such modifications, and in effect be highly personalized and adaptive within the entire end-to-end behavior modification rewards process, even extending to the delivery presentation/personality of how the reward is delivered.</li>        <li id="ul0022-0004" num="0548">Instead of just delivering a credit in an account, a free pass, or a discount coupon (via email), a key (and neglected) part is how a reward is delivered to the person. For example, for a rewards program that is based on providing game tokens or credits, some people may prefer a stoic artificially intelligent (AI) avatar while other people may prefer a happy-go-lucky type personality. So not only adapting the presentation, but also adapting the User Interface elements that may possibly be enabled by Artificial Intelligence/machine learning, etc&#x2014;can facilitate positive change (or discourage negative behavior/activities).</li>        <li id="ul0022-0005" num="0549">To the extent that there are significant degrees of personalization involved in the prior art behavioral modification programs, they tend to be focused on feedback mechanisms to a person or support persons in the prior art. To the extent these feedback mechanisms are truly personalized to the person in some way, they are not personalized to the extent of incorporating the context that the person/behavior of the person is taking place within, nor the context of the behaviors/behavior modifications, and, in turn rewards for those behaviors/behavior modifications are taking place. Thus, if a person has an Anger trigger, and that trigger is more likely to be &#x201c;tripped&#x201d; or activated around other people in the workplace (in stark contrast for example) with the person being alone at home, which rarely triggers Anger, recognizing this context becomes key to the entire rewards system: when, where, and how the person's behavior is monitored and measured; what underlying root causes/enablers/sources of possible anger need to also be monitored and measured; what actions/feedback mechanisms are provided to the person, support persons, or other support mechanisms to help manage his/her anger in that context; what elements are measured to verify success in that context; deciding upon/creating (as applicable) the appropriate rewards program, type, level, &#x201c;personality,&#x201d; and redemption process(es) (and associated dimensions) for that behavioral improvement (or, alternatively, &#x201c;punishment&#x201d; for &#x201c;bad&#x201d; behavior).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0476" num="0550">As recognized herein, utilizing virtual rewards through games or other virtual activities should be added to the physical and financial rewards of conventional rewards systems for behavior modification. It has also been recognized it is desirable to have the ability to personalize the redemption conditions and/or associated processes that would allow personalization in to when, how, and under what conditions a reward can be redeemed based on the needs and/or desires of the person and/or what the incentive system calculates or determines to be the optimal usage window/time/conditions for that reward relative to the needs of the behavior modification reinforcement degree/type/level of behavior as well as context, situation, and/or circumstance. For example, if the system detects that going for a walk in the park (in certain conditions, such as sunny days) is effective for lowering Anger-related biometric levels (e.g., lowering blood pressure, etc.), an award of free passes to local parks may be accompanied by a personalized and dynamically established set of conditions such as being activated (with associated alerts to the person) on sunny days in the locale in which the person lives/works.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0551">Given the &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; nature of prior art reward systems, the &#x201c;accounting&#x201d; e.g., tracking of the person's adherence to reward-generating behaviors/behavior modifications in the prior art is relatively simplistic due to the well-established, predefined variables and associated reward-calculation algorithms. In contrast, the ability to track dynamically and adaptively new/rapidly changing behaviors/activities and associated contexts/situations/circumstances becomes much more complex, and associatively much more vulnerable to &#x201c;mis-capture&#x201d; of the reward-relevant behaviors and associated rewards. Accordingly, a need has been recognized herein for a new &#x201c;accounting&#x201d; system that is blockchain based.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0552">Accordingly, disclosed herein are exemplary systems and methods that include or use blockchain (e.g., cryptocurrency, virtual currency, digital currency) as a &#x201c;platform&#x201d; or management/accounting system for a managing a &#x201c;portfolio&#x201d; of different dynamic/adaptive motivation mechanisms.

Instead, and/or in addition, the rewards programs reward &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors that underlie the &#x201c;end&#x201d; behavior(s) to be modified. For example, if getting Angry causes a person to want to drink (an &#x201c;Anger&#x201d; trigger), the rewards program focuses on reducing/modifying situations/contexts that might lead to the person getting Angry. This kind of &#x201c;preemptive&#x201d; anger management (in this particular example) is very distinct from what in traditional behavior modification programs would be focused on managing (e.g., calming down the person) once the person is already angry.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0573">In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, the behaviors (upstream behaviors and/or core behaviors) are not limited to only physical or physically measured end behaviors. But the behaviors also include (via the use of sensors or other mechanisms) mental &#x201c;behaviors&#x201d;, such as reducing Anxiety or pre-empting Anger, addressing or reducing the behaviors, activities, situations, circumstances, and/or contexts, which may include thought processes that may cause or lead to an increase in Anxiety or lead to Anger.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0574">In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, the actions associated with the behavior modification are also not limited to physically-oriented actions (e.g., drink less). Particularly because the actions are focused on pre-emptive, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors, including mental behaviors, the actions to take and the rewards to be granted once taken are also focused on pre-emptive, broad-based behaviors, which are not the focus of existing behavioral modification rewards programs.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0575">Moreover, the actions to be taken and (dynamically) rewarded are not predefined let alone fixed in exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. Instead, if the person undertakes an action (of any sort) that leads to a positive (core or upstream) behavioral impact, that heretofore &#x201c;unknown&#x201d; action and its benefits will be detected and with rewards to encourage future similar behavior dynamically created and calibrated based on context as well as administered. For example, if the person has a problem with the Anger trigger, then Anger (for that particular person) may be determined or measured by specific levels of blood pressure, voice volume, and skin temperature. In this example, if the person decides to go for a walk in a quiet city park, and the sensors for one or more of those variables detect a positive movement (e.g., lowering in this case of those underlying trigger values for blood pressure, voice volume, skin temperature, etc.), the context &#x201c;walking in the park&#x201d; could be dynamically added to the rewards program actions-to-be-rewarded list perhaps with some associated values (e.g., in the park for at least 30 minutes). And, a reward may be dynamically created to encourage future walking-in-the-park, such as free passes to private parks near the person's home or work and/or other parks with similar characteristics to the &#x201c;successful&#x201d; park, such as open during certain days/times, forested with lakes and walkways, pets allowed, etc. Other contextual elements associated with the &#x201c;successful&#x201d; walk in the park may also be incorporated, such as it was a sunny day, cool but not cold, pets were nearby, etc. Accordingly, the reward could be created/modified/calibrated to encourage future walks under similar conditions that if not incorporated into the pass, then (possibly also) incorporated into various future actions. For example, when anger again becomes high-risk/a concern, the actions engine/rewards administering engine could create alerts/notifications to the person encouraging (free) walks when it was sunny and cool, or (regardless of weather) encouraging the person to go to Park #C which happens to be the closest to the person at the time where pets are known to be popular.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0576">To support the adaptive/dynamic nature of the above, exemplary embodiments may include monitoring/tracking mechanisms configured to track/detect a wide range of both mental and physical upstream behaviors and activities/situations/circumstances/contexts.

Within a type, the &#x201c;conditions&#x201d; by which a reward is awarded is also generally &#x201c;fixed,&#x201d; such as a coupon for X in the amount of Y (%), possibly along with various redemption conditions (e.g., redeem by Z date). The nature of these &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; requirements, e.g., a fixed reward type, the level, time constraints, etc. for a &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; behavior modification (e.g., lose 10 pounds by the end of next month) is generally consistent across all prior art rewards systems (behavior-focused and non-behavior focused, such as traditional airline mile earnings programs) monitoring/modification.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0600">The prior art has very significant fixed elements of at least one of: behavior(s) to be monitored and modified, actions and/or feedback mechanisms, reward program types, reward levels, reward awarding conditions, and/or reward redemption conditions. Accordingly, it is recognized herein that the prior art is missing or lacks the ability to provide an adaptive, dynamic behavior modification rewards platform that is centrally designed around broad-based, dynamic/not &#x201c;pre-defined&#x201d; behavior.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0601">Although conventional behavior/activity modification encourage may exist in a variety of fields and forums, these tend to be &#x201c;on-offs,&#x201d; e.g., specially designed/targeted system to encourage specific behaviors or activities, such as points-based rewards programs that accrue points based on numbers, volumes, and/or dollar values of purchases in order to encourage more purchases. Other more personal behavior-oriented systems are also typically specifically designed, e.g., encouraging &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; lifestyles. These personal behavior modification systems tend to focus on a specific behavior (e.g., eating/dieting) with a specific amount of data elements. Furthermore, such rewards programs all tend to be very focused at major problem activities or behaviors. Other prior art may be designed to discourage certain behaviors or activities, such as GPS Ankle-bracelets for persons on parole who know that if they travel outside of approved zones (&#x201c;geofences&#x201d;) at all or at certain times the system will report them as violators potentially leading to the revoking of parole.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0602">The prior art behavioral modification rewards programs and associated systems have the following characteristics:<ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0603">The prior art focuses on the direct behaviors or activities to be done (and rewarded) or avoided (or be punished). Thus, alcoholism rewards programs reward a person for not drinking or take away rewards for drinking.</li>        <li id="ul0030-0002" num="0604">The prior art does not address the modification of (and rewarding for) &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors. Thus, most &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; lifestyle programs/systems (even platforms) will, for example, focus on eating healthy foods and regular exercise. But this prior art does not address the &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; triggers, such as Anger, Boredom, Relationship problems, etc., that might lead a person to eat unhealthy foods. The prior art also does not identify, monitor, and/or take action to remove key obstacles to performing regular exercise, such as depression, spending (too much) time with supposed &#x201c;friends&#x201d; that do not exercise or worse &#x201c;friends&#x201d; that encourage bad habits such as hanging at the bar drinking and eating fatty foods.</li>        <li id="ul0030-0003" num="0605">Prior art rewards programs/systems are built around &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; types of rewards for &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; types of behaviors with little to no personalization or context-based variation. For example, not drinking for 30 days might reward you with a coin&#x2014;there is no variability or adaptability in the possible use of other reward mechanisms based on the person's motivation factors and/or context. In rewarding a coin, however, the prior art does not address the challenges/difficulties that the person might have encountered (e.g., the context), and there are no context-based variations in the rewards given.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0494" num="0606">Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein illustrate and/or incorporate inventive features and elements described above. For example, an exemplary embodiment disclosed herein may involve an addict whose triggers are Anger, Boredom, and Escape. The addict's anger level might be determined by monitoring three biometric elements: blood pressure (specifically high risk when the addict's blood pressure is over 130/90), speaking volume (indicative of anger when the addict's speaking volume is 5 or more decibels greater than the addict's normal speaking volume), and skin temperature (high risk when the addict's skin temperature is over 10 degrees higher than the addict's normal skin temperature for a given context/activity). To the extent possible, the locations, contexts, and/or activities that the addict was involved in that caused, or at least were associated with, the increase in the addict's anger level will also be determined. For example, if the addict was driving while on the phone with the addict's mother when the addict's anger level (as indicated by the biometric sensors) began escalating, this exemplary embodiment may then theorize that the call with the addict's mother and/or traffic issues (e.g., road rage) were the likely culprits.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0607">Given the high risk/trending risk of Anger occurring, combined with the theoretical cause(s), this exemplary embodiment may encourage the addict to go to places and/or engage in activities to reduce rising Anger levels (as indicated by the above risk factors/metrics). If the addict is successful, the addict is rewarded, and the type of reward and amount is determined by what he/she does, where he/she goes, and by how much the risks/metrics were reduced/successfully modified. If, for example, he/she was near a city park when the high-risk situation is flagged, this exemplary embodiment may suggest he/she go to somewhere quiet and outdoors (away from his/her phone and car) and suggest a variety of nearby parks/settings. If he/she goes to Park D, and in doing so reduces Anger, then the system will determine a type of reward and &#x201c;level&#x201d; of a reward based on a variety of factors, including how successful he/she was in reducing the risk, by how much, how quickly, and how &#x201c;easily,&#x201d; as well as other personal motivating factors such as how little it cost, whether he/she took the recommended navigation path (that minimized traffic congestion and directed him/her to open parking spots, thus limiting his/her road rage, with more reward if he/she followed the instructions), etc. Thus, the reward in this exemplary embodiment is based on what he/she does to reduce his/her anger and also how he/she does it.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0608">In exemplary embodiments, the reward type/level/amount may also be adapted/calibrated depending on whether he/she was &#x201c;killing two birds with one stone&#x201d; and also satisfying/addressing other triggers even if the person is not in a high-risk situation, such as the addict's Boredom trigger. When the addict was Angry, the addict may have not necessarily been Bored. In exemplary embodiments, the reward type/amount/level may also be dependent on how enjoyable the activity was, e.g., did the addict (broadly, the person) have fun or otherwise benefit from the trip to the park above and beyond the success in lowering anger level.</p><p id="p-0497" num="0609">Some exemplary embodiments may include providing game tokens or virtual avatars as rewards, improving online behavior, skiing as a good/bad behavior tracked via beacons without requiring phone usage, proactively identifying actions (for future use and for rewards) by observing/monitoring effect on addict, etc.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0610">As indicated above, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein include a novel and innovative feature that is the reversal of the person&#x2014;rewards program dynamic. Instead of the rewards program &#x201c;dictating&#x201d; what the person should do (or should not do) to earn rewards, the person is in effect dictating what kind of rewards he/she should receive and under what conditions. Not only does this enable a variety of benefits including dynamically and adaptively changing what types (and what values) of rewards are rewarded, but also the conditions under which the rewards occur are fluid. Plus, the rewards are not necessarily or required to be known ahead of time in some exemplary embodiments. Moreover, new rewards can be dynamically created with exemplary embodiments if the user's behavior and context necessitate/enable such new rewards.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0611">Exemplary embodiments may be configured to use AI, such as using AI to examine the blockchain (or any data/data set) trail to identify behaviors/behavior patterns not necessarily picked up (e.g., picked up directly) by sensors. For example, an exemplary embodiment may include the AI observing and/or examining the blockchain itself to make predictions for identifying behaviors/behavior patterns.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0612">As recognized herein, there are a multitude of human conditions requiring new ways of modifying and/or rewarding associated behaviors with those conditions as existing ways of modifying the associated behaviors have met with limited success, have high costs, and/or have heretofore been limited in how technology can be applied. Three such example conditions are: addiction, incarceration, and parole.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0613">In an exemplary embodiment, a system comprises a plurality of different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks. The system is configured to determine, through a plurality of measurements/readings taken by the plurality of different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks and/or inferred through information from system inputs, behavior(s) of at least one entity and context(s) associated with the behavior(s) of the at least one entity. The system is further configured to: dynamically and adaptively determine a reward for incentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity and facilitate redemption of the reward; and/or dynamically and adaptively determine a disincentive for disincentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity and facilitate redemption of the disincentive.</p><p id="p-0502" num="0614">In an exemplary embodiment, the system is configured to: determine whether at least one trigger is active or present based on the behavior(s) of the at least one entity and the context(s) associated with the behavior(s) of the at least one entity, as determined through the plurality of different devices, sensors, sensor arrays, and/or communications networks and/or inferred through information from system inputs; determine a reward for incentivizing behavior and/or context that caused or created the at least one trigger to be active or present; and facilitate redemption of the reward. The at least one trigger may comprise at least one positive trigger including one or more of an aspiration trigger, a goal trigger, a happiness trigger, or other positive trigger associated with behavior (e.g., good behavior, etc.) to be incentivized and encouraged by the system.</p><p id="p-0503" num="0615">In an exemplary embodiment, the system is configured to dynamically and adaptively: determine a reward for incentivizing at least one positive trigger associated with behavior (e.g., good behavior, etc.) of the at least one entity; and facilitate redemption of the reward to thereby incentivize and encourage the behavior of the at least one entity. The at least one positive trigger may comprise one or more of an aspiration trigger, a goal trigger, a happiness trigger, or other positive trigger (e.g., do-right-by-the-world trigger, be a better person trigger, do right by family trigger, be a good parent trigger, be a charitable trigger, attain spiritual growth/religious values trigger, desire to serve the community trigger, a desire to attain the &#x201c;good&#x201d;, pay old debts, etc.) associated with the behavior to be incentivized and encouraged by the system.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0616">As disclosed herein and shown by the table above, triggers may encapsulate various forms of mental thoughts, mental and/or physical behaviors, mental and/or physical states, and/or mental and/or physical activities. Generally, triggers are predicated on, or a description of, behaviors/activities/states which may be either or both physical and/or mental. By way of example only, the table above categorizes various examples of triggers in which &#x201c;X&#x201d; and &#x201c;m&#x201d; respectively indicate major and minor applicability. Although some triggers may be considered negative triggers (e.g., anger, anxiety, boredom, depression, fear, frustration, etc.), other triggers may be considered as positive triggers. Example positive triggers may include aspiration triggers, goal triggers, happiness triggers, do-right-by-the-world triggers, be a better person triggers, etc., which positive triggers may be encouraged, rewarded, and/or incentivized in exemplary embodiments disclosed herein. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments may be configured to not only discourage bad behavior but also to inspire, incentivize, and reward entities (e.g., persons, etc.) to good behaviors. For example, many people volunteer at food banks or habitat for humanity simply because of the desire to help the world without any expectation of a reward. In this example, a system may be configured to reward such the good behavior even if it was just providing a report of the volunteer hours worked and an occasional anonymous coupon, etc.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0617">By way of further example, a positive trigger may be based on a a notion (e.g., Aristotelian view on morality, etc.) that overall people tend to be kind of neutral. A person(s) may be less bad in some ways but also more good in other ways for which there are different though complementary motivations for each. For example, a person may want to stop drinking alcohol because it has ruined his/her social life, so the person may try and overcome the negative motivations that initially exacerbated it (e.g., angry with parents, boredome, etc.). In this example, the person may be able to obtain and maintain sobriety via a system/method disclosed herein. While the sobriety may stop further degeneration of the person's relationships with others, the sobriety in and of itself may not actually repair the person's relationships with others. In which case, the person may need to embrace more positive motivations, e.g., do right by family trigger, be a good parent trigger, be a charitable trigger, attain spiritual growth/religious values triggers, a desire to serve the community trigger, a desire to attain the &#x201c;good&#x201d;, pay old debts, etc.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0618">In addition, exemplary embodiments may include negative zones that are disincentivized or restricted and/or positive zones that are incentivized or rewarded. For example, a negative zone restriction may include a person being at a bar or casino, whereas a positive zone may include the person spending time at the gym or with family.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0619">In exemplary embodiments, the at least one entity may comprise one or more of a person, a robot, an artificial intelligence, an animal, a virtual agent (e.g., video game virtual agent, etc.), a corporation, a business entity, a nation, a network, and/or a governmental entity. The incentivized behavior and/or context may include one or more of a sustained behavior, an improved behavior, an environmental context change, and/or a change of circumstances of the at least one entity. The disincentivized behavior and/or context may include one or more of a discouraged behavior, an environmental context change, and/or a change of circumstances of the at least one entity.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0620">The system may be configured to use blockchain or other distributed ledger technology (DLT) to track, manage, and redeem reward(s) and/or disincentive(s).</p><p id="p-0509" num="0621">The system may be configured to dynamically and adaptively: determine a new reward for incentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity, which new reward is not predetermined, predefined, or fixed in the system; and/or determine a new disincentive for disincentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity, which new disincentive is not predetermined, predefined, or fixed in the system. Additionally, or alternatively, the system may be configured to dynamically and adaptively: determine a reward that is predetermined, predefined, or fixed in the system for incentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity; and/or determine a disincentive that is predetermined, predefined, or fixed in the system for disincentivizing behavior and/or context of the at least one entity.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0622">The system may be configured to dynamically and adaptively determine the reward and/or the disincentive by using one or more of machine learning, a neural network, a quantum network, and/or an artificial intelligence. For example, the system may be configured to dynamically and adaptively determine the reward and/or the disincentive without requiring manual human intervention to create, define, manage, and administer the reward and/or the disincentive by using one or more of machine learning, a neural network, a quantum network, and/or an artificial intelligence.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0623">The system may be configured to dynamically and adaptively determine rewards and/or disincentives by adapting types and levels of the rewards and/or the disincentives to the behavior(s) and associated context(s) of the at least one entity.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0624">The system may be configured to use a proof blockchain system or other distributed ledger technology consensun mechanism for privacy protection and security.

In this way, the system can act as both sword and shield, as well as a self-contained &#x201c;red-team/blue-team&#x201d; system, that is constantly probing itself for attacks to increase its capabilities across operational domains. Such systems and methods could be used in a variety of ways beyond actual warfare.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0654">For example, the systems and methods can support elements of gamification. Gamification may include the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. Gamification can also be defined as a set of activities and processes to solve problems by using or applying the characteristics of game elements. This can include causality tracking, financial and resource efficiency, target and unit effectiveness, and additional items to support the evaluation and improvement of resources, as well as quantitative and qualitative elements to encourage continuous improvement, with a mindfulness that such scores could potentially be detrimental to uplifting to morale at various levels, times and locations.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0655">For example, with respect to drinking/addiction, a running counter could count exactly how many days the person is sober. Coupon awards may then be provided or awarded on special milestones like 1 week, 1 month, 100 days, a year, etc. With respect to warfare gaming/simulation, such gaming/scoring mechanisms could track wins and losses, or achievement or projected achievement of simulated victory (or defeat) goals. This could include augmented reality to make combat training more game-like or life-like depending on the objective. This could be supported by the use of dashboards or other visualization capabilities to facilitate understanding of how and/or how close the objectives of a particular simulated (or real) &#x201c;battle&#x201d; are being achieved or not and why.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0656">The use of grouping/aggregating behaviors is an integral part of exemplary embodiments of this invention. For example, one or more suspected &#x201c;bad&#x201d; actors may have their behavior/activities monitored for detection of possible triggers that may indicate upcoming attacks. Through the exemplary sensors, sensor arrays, communications networks, et. al. disclosed herein, the triggers of Fear and/or Excitement may be specifically monitored to detect &#x201c;spikes&#x201d; in or elevated levels about those triggers, possibly driven by an upcoming attack. Similarly, other triggers such as sudden movements of or discussions about Money may be such possible attack leading indicator triggers.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0657">The above could be done individually or for multiple persons, or sequentially. For example, if Fear/Excitement is detected in one bad actor, the system/method could expand monitoring for those triggers in other possible bad actors, or even in other not-yet-determined-to-be-bad persons whom the bad actor has some sort of contact with. Or, recognizing that an impending attack may have different impact on different people, a different set of sensor monitoring (or other device monitoring) may occur, for example, an increase in Anger levels, drinking/substance usage, etc. Or, there could be a change in different websites the person(s) are going to, for example legal sites (e.g., for will-making purposes, etc.), or in the types of messages that the person(s) are posting on social media (e.g., &#x201c;you know I love you, right?&#x201d;), spikes/new efforts regarding certain kinds of Google searches, a sudden use of anonymous browsers (e.g., Tor) or dark web usage, etc. could be leading indicators, particularly if such usage is tied to known suspected triggers (e.g., Fear as a trigger could result in a spike in searches for meditation techniques). And, of course, an increase in any types of behavioral interactions between bad actors, for example message &#x201c;chatter&#x201d;, could be an indicator of upcoming bad activity, even if between a small number of individuals-even just two.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0658">Changes in physical behaviors/activities and associated triggers can be indicative of upcoming attacks. If individuals are known to be devotedly religious for example, a sudden increase in the number/duration of visits to a nearby associated religious community center could be a leading indicator of Fear or Stress, and as such indicators of impending attacks, especially if such increases occur for multiple suspected bad actors. As mentioned, a sudden increase in certain &#x201c;vices&#x201d; (e.g., smoking, drinking, etc.) could also be indicators of upcoming attacks as leading indicators regarding Fear, Excitement, Stress, etc.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0659">Changes in overall context for both mental and physical behaviors can be indicators of upcoming bad activity, both individually and plurality of individuals/group. For example, a bad actor may suddenly start spending far more time at work/working than is typical. Further, if he is performing activities there (doing personal business for example) than at home, such change in context for &#x201c;normal&#x201d; activities may be cause for suspicion of upcoming bad activities.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0660">Some/all of the above may be used &#x201c;progressively&#x201d; for legal purposes. For example, monitoring of a specific individual for certain triggers may be authorized (e.g., via warrants, etc.), but not for other possible bad actors. However, upon detection of certain behaviors/triggers/associated levels of concern, that, in turn, could be represented to a judge to authorize broader monitoring of possible bad actors for those behaviors/triggers, and/or usage of &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; monitoring methods, e.g., phone data, etc.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0661">Overall, aspects of exemplary embodiments disclosed herein enable the ability to &#x201c;visualize&#x201d; cyber-battles or other kinds of battles, with&#x2014;or in particular without&#x2014;the need to actually engage in such battles.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0662"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> includes an example diagram of one such potential visualization of a conflict.

Similar to patents and patent applications listed above and incorporated by reference, such as identification of addiction triggers that may lead to the consumption of drugs or alcohol, or partaking in an undesirable activity such as gambling or one that may result in a parole or quarantine violation for persons-under-restriction, the ability to detect key triggers that provide some sort of advance warning and/or predictive basis to believe that an attack may be forthcoming or that an action would create a defensive vulnerability is an important aspect to this invention.</p><p id="p-0563" num="0730">Similar to the threats/behaviors that could occur in the digital world, detection of such triggers/behaviors through sensors, sensor arrays, communications networks enable defensive (re)actions that can pre-empt such attacks. Examples include:<ul id="ul0045" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0045-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0046" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0046-0001" num="0731">Indicators of Possible/About-to-Occur Incoming Fire Detection-A variety of behaviors/triggers are possible that can provide &#x201c;extra early warning&#x201d; with respect to possibility of firing. Examples include sudden troop movements (particularly around known or suspected gun placements), activation of radar systems, increased drone/aircraft activity in an area, changes in electronic warfare patterns, or even changes in satellite activity. An increase or absence in systemic &#x201c;behavior&#x201d; could also be indicative of a possible threat. For example, it is known that increased &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; on certain kinds of social media platforms can indicate a higher possibility of a near-term attack. Such systemic indicators could be across a wide range of applications and/or networks, ranging from more direct-such as wargaming-type applications&#x2014;to indirect, e.g., social media posting. Other indicators could include increased financial activity, such as money flows that suddenly jump or change direction. Even without application-specific activity, a change in network voice/data traffic (even if content is unknown) could be a leading indicator of negative behavior.</li>        <li id="ul0046-0002" num="0732">Use of Fast Filters&#x2014;Edge or other based systems for fast detection of threats, including increased activity in &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; activities about the development or &#x201c;implementation&#x201d; of weapons, including        <ul id="ul0047" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0047-0001" num="0733">Minefield, IEDs, etc. construction and placement</li>            <li id="ul0047-0002" num="0734">Establishment of possible Enemy Sniper locations, and/or increase in number of humans or types of human behavior in/around previously identified possible such locations</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0046-0003" num="0735">Use of Location/Range estimators        <ul id="ul0048" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0048-0001" num="0736">HUD display of range of various types of weapons, overlaid on location/regional/country/world maps</li>            <li id="ul0048-0002" num="0737">Increase in purchase activity, permit requests, etc. with respect to certain kinds of weaponry, particularly if localized</li>            <li id="ul0048-0003" num="0738">Generally conducting &#x201c;big data&#x201d;, AI, and/or predictive analytics against not just physical movements/activity, but &#x201c;mental&#x201d; activity. For example, historically leaks of military operations by naive, well-meaning personnel-bragging or otherwise&#x2014;was a major source of advanced intelligence. Similarly, &#x201c;grunt&#x201d; personnel who are told certain details (even if they don't make sense to the individual, or by their individual selves don't mean much) can be observed/aggregated as possible leading indicators of upcoming negative behaviors.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0564" num="0739">While the above are discussed in the context of defense, many of them can be used offensively. For example, indications of &#x201c;standing-down&#x201d; by known or possible bad actor physical gun crews could indicate exhibiting overconfidence behavior, in turn providing &#x201c;opportunities&#x201d; for pre-emptive attacks on those positions. Gaps in minefield/IED construction activity in a given area could provide an avenue for attack by good actors. Similarly, gaps in weapon distribution, defensive placements, or certain kinds of personnel could provide opportunities for good actor offensive activity.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0740">Identification of indirect/upstream behavior/triggers can provide opportunities for offense. For example, battle-conducting personnel very often have support personnel of at least 2 times. Tracking the behavior, contexts, and/or locations of such personnel can provide important extra-early warning of upcoming &#x201c;direct&#x201d; personnel activity-akin to a drug addict that is susceptible to certain triggers such as Boredom or Anger, and/or exhibits jumps in blood pressure and/or other measurable or observable parameters indicating, for example, Anger, that in turn could lead to drug/alcohol usage. Similarly, while behaviors by &#x201c;direct&#x201d; warfare-related personnel are usually highly secured, the behavior of indirect/support personnel (and systems) are less so. Monitoring key activities/behaviors/triggers of those indirect/support personnel and systems can provide both extra-early warnings (or not) of possible negative behavior (e.g., for defensive purposes), but can also be used for offensive purposes in identifying gaps/opportunities in bad actor defenses for use in good actor offensive actions.</p><p id="p-0566" num="0741">Such actions could be of all sorts to modify bad actor behavior, again, not just related to traditional &#x201c;direct&#x201d; physical weapons. For example, detection of Stress, Powerlessness, and/or Tired triggers (through various sensors/sensor arrays/communications networks) could generate actions specifically intended to exacerbate those triggers/behaviors, such as various propaganda-related activities intended to sap morale and overall energy/alertness levels. The exemplary systems and methods of this invention could detect, through certain behaviors/triggers, opportunities for employing non-convention weapons such as social media posts, financial account stress (employing credit card fraud for example), etc. that could have a far more success in draining bad actor readiness than direct/traditional methods/weapons might.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0742">Logistical Organization (from Unit to Multiple Organization Levels)</p><p id="p-0568" num="0743">As noted above, the ability to detect/disrupt the behaviors of indirect personnel/systems can have a significant role in various forms of warfare. This has basis in the oft-cited &#x201c;an army travels on its stomach.&#x201d; In more contemporary terms, the ability to disrupt an ordinary combatant's digital life can have a similarly outsized impact, e.g., a soldier whose digital life is disrupted is an unhappy, less-effective soldier. Such digital disruption, when combined with the physical &#x201c;stomach-like&#x201d; impacting disruption, in combination can be far more disruptive than one element might have individually. To that end, any digital and/or physical disruptions in a direct/indirect bad actor/system can have a major impact, such as through the ability to disrupt:<ul id="ul0049" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0049-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0050" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0050-0001" num="0744">Supply Tracking</li>        <li id="ul0050-0002" num="0745">IoT based systems that provide awareness of key resources</li>        <li id="ul0050-0003" num="0746">Distortion of priority needs identification</li>        <li id="ul0050-0004" num="0747">Ability to anticipate actions, making the bad actors much more reactive</li>        <li id="ul0050-0005" num="0748">Ability to confuse weather and climate monitoring and anticipation</li>        <li id="ul0050-0006" num="0749">Loss of Supply/Supply Line modeling</li>        <li id="ul0050-0007" num="0750">Disruption of Logistical War Gaming</li>        <li id="ul0050-0008" num="0751">Supply De-Optimization</li>        <li id="ul0050-0009" num="0752">Resilience Modeling disruption (if such and such scenario were to occur, we'd greatly benefit from a supply depot in XYZ location)</li>        <li id="ul0050-0010" num="0753">Supply Depot location suggestions, e.g., distort various conditions to cause misplacement of ground resource placement/concentration/needs/resources/prioritization</li>        <li id="ul0050-0011" num="0754">Map Modeling (disrupt location-based models of coverage)        <ul id="ul0051" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0051-0001" num="0755">Heat map of coverage area, reaction time, and time till need resupply</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0050-0012" num="0756">Supply (In)Validation and False Audit&#x2014;human, robotic and or IoT based systems to constantly confuse/in-validate that supplies at location are actually at levels recorded in various databases</li>        <li id="ul0050-0013" num="0757">Quality monitoring and mischaracterization</li>        <li id="ul0050-0014" num="0758">Data de-rectification</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0569" num="0759">Robotic Elements</p><p id="p-0570" num="0760">Of particular note in many of the exemplary embodiments or aspects of the invention is the use of robotics, such as unmanned or autonomous vehicles and assets.

The requests may be any type of request. In the case of a research engine, the moral and/or motivational analysis engine may include evaluation whether the research question or requirements were moral&#x2014;for example, research into pain thresholds may provide some value, but overt infliction of pain is seen as immoral. The moral and/or motivational analysis engine would need to balance the needs of knowledge versus the ethics of acquiring that knowledge. Other examples would be requests of information coming out of the system as tasking, to ensure that it is an ethical request. In a military context, action could include potentially harming civilians, which is generally seen as unethical. In this latter example, the moral and/or motivational analysis engine could veto suggested unethical action. The moral and/or motivational analysis engine may also be configured to weigh and/or balance a need or desired outcome versus consequence(s) or collateral damage, e.g., in order to determine what is willing to be done and under what circumstances/context, etc. For example, the moral and/or motivational analysis engine may weigh and/or balance a need of capturing a high profile target (e.g., terrorist, etc.) versus possible collateral damage, e.g., possible and/or types of civilian casualties (e.g., less than 10 civilian casualties, no children casualties, etc.), at a secluded location with a low probability of civilian casualties, etc. In this example, the strategic imperative of not harming civilians may be waived or parameter(s) may be adjsuted such that civilian harm is deemed allowable at a certain minimum level in the case of capturing a very high profile target or under other situation(s).</p><p id="p-0624" num="0872">In exemplary embodiments, the computer-implemented method includes allowing user intervention to prevent and/or address prohibited, wrongful, immoral, and/or unethical action(s) of the system and providing machine learning to inhibit the system from repeat performance of the prohibited, wrongful, immoral, and/or unethical action(s). Examples of prohibited actions could be war crimes, attacks against civilians, severe environmental damage (e.g., salting the earth, using nuclear weapons to make areas uninhabitable, etc.). Additional examples could be pain research, other research that could be experiments that result in damage to life or liberty, Nuremberg accords violations, etc. An assortment of various controls may be implemented in exemplary embodiments, such as intervention by qualified and credentialed personnel, use of &#x201c;therapy&#x201d; to restore viability&#x2014;to refresh the moral engine and try and remove misconfigured ethics, simply restoring to a previous version, etc.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0873">In exemplary embodiments, the computer-implemented method includes determining, via a reputation engine connected with the system, whether a user is untrustworthy based one or more wrongful, disreputable, immoral, and/or unethical user actions and/or requests by the user. And if the user is determined to be untrustworthy, the computer-implemented method includes reducing user privilege(s) to the system and/or locking the user out from system. By way of example, a wrongful action could be repeated attempts to try and coax the system into bad actions. An example of this would be a nefarious actor trying to get the system to hurt civilians. In this example, the system could correlate the &#x201c;bad/evil&#x201d; requests to the requestor/actor, and see a pattern that this person is repeatedly trying to make the system do &#x201c;bad&#x201d; things.

Whether it is packages, food, or even helping humans get from one place to another, the speed and efficiency of delivering (e.g., picking up, transporting, dropping off) items or deliverables has become more important than ever, fundamental to many delivery companies' business models, as well as increased its role in the customer's satisfaction with the overall transaction and even more broadly with the company. Customer satisfaction in particular, while always important, has become especially important and impactful with the rise of social media and various ways to (publicly) rate a particular transaction between the business and the customer. The experience of the customer with the delivery person involved in actually getting an item to the customer (or the customer to their destination) often plays a frequent&#x2014;and outsized-role in the overall satisfaction of the customer with the company(s) involved.</p><p id="p-0645" num="0901">As such, these companies implement a variety of measures and metrics about their delivery personnel, generally focused on customer interaction-related speed, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Increasingly, these measures and metrics are not used only as a way to tune the business operation, but as very specific ways of rewarding (or, more often) punishing the delivery personnel when the metrics and measure goals are not achieved, or if there is a particularly negative customer experience.</p><p id="p-0646" num="0902">For example, companies will often weight negative ratings 10 times or more relative to positive ratings when calculating performance-based rewards. Others require a minimum 4.5/5 rating to continue employment. Thus, even one negative experience can have a dramatic impact on delivery personnel compensation/employment, especially with newer employees with their lower volume of deliveries and lesser experience in detecting and pre-empting/avoiding negative metric-resulting root causes.</p><p id="p-0647" num="0903">In total, a negative measure, metric, rating, or feedback (collectively or individually referred to herein as &#x201c;measures&#x201d;) in any form can have major-even devastating impacts on the income and even employment of delivery personnel. The problem that Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) seek to address is that many of these negative measures can be caused by factors outside the delivery person's control or even be outright fabricated. Given the outsized impact such a negative measure can have on the deliverer, making sure that any such negative measure is justified because of the actions/performance of the delivery person becomes critical. Or, put another way, there is a need to ensure to appropriately identify the root causes of any given negative measure, and appropriately qualify, reduce the impact of, or otherwise nullify any negative metric when the root causes demonstrate that they were out of the delivery person's control. Alternatively, if the negative measure was partly&#x2014;but not entirely-because of the delivery person or deliverer in some way, the impact of the negative measure on assessing the deliverer's performance needs to be appropriately reduced or de-weighted in impact. Further, there is a need to provide to the delivery person ways of avoiding or pre-empting high potential negative measure-causing events, persons, places, circumstances, etc., so that the chance of them occurring at all is reduced/eliminated.</p><p id="p-0648" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="175pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>NEGATIVE</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>MEASURE</entry><entry>EXAMPLE ROOT CAUSES</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Late delivery</entry><entry>Multiple building entrances-people are often at </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>the wrong place-can be up to 4 or more doors</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Some buildings have sophisticated entry </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>systems with special codes for delivery</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>personnel.

An immediate action may be taken such as to compare planned/recommended route versus route actually taken, detect differences, and where differences break down to determine where route went wrong, particularly confirming door ambiguity/confusion, and subtract time to go to &#x201c;extra&#x201d; doors from delivery time and adjust negative review accordingly (either in proportion or completely). A preemptive action may be taken for future deliveries to that building/customer, such as update building, customer, and all delivery personnel (who have or might deliver to that building/customer again) about the multiple doors issue, including requiring input from customer on any future orders about what door to deliver to. A preemptive action may also include perform 3D analysis of building map data to identify multiple pathways/doors to customer and obtain directions for which door to use BEFORE delivery is presented to driver, INCLUDING adding additional time (before being reviewed) to compensate for at/internal building complexity.</p><p id="p-0650" num="0905">For Late Delivery-based &#x201c;dings&#x201d;, Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may perform root cause analysis including:<ul id="ul0081" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0081-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0082" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0082-0001" num="0906">Measuring for purposes of root cause (of negative rating/late delivery):        <ul id="ul0083" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0083-0001" num="0907">Overall: Breaking down planned and actual route into individual segments, comparing the segments in terms of a) whether planned route was taken (and if not, why not (e.g., traffic, construction) and impact in terms of time and distance), and b) assuming planned route segment was taken, comparing likely estimated time (conventional routing programs don't breakdown, or at least store for later analysis, the individual segment times/distances, so may need to recreate); to actual time, and if materially different determine Why (Particularly if not under control of driver).</li>            <li id="ul0083-0002" num="0908">For near-building/in-building &#x201c;segments&#x201d; (which generally are NOT generated by conventional routing programs&#x2014;they only route to the address), Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may provide a &#x201c;last-mile route&#x201d; even though it may only be a few dozen feet. To the extent the route was generated by the driver's navigation program, the following may be performed on a micro level (e.g., for every straight-line segment, or &#x201c;micro&#x201d; Points of Interest (say from Door A to Door B). For portions that are NOT on original route (particularly everything that happens once the navigation app decides the driver has &#x201c;reached its destination and stops), map driver's actual route (using separate pedestrian-focused navigation program probably), identifying inefficiencies in path delivery person took (e.g., if driver took most efficient route, and if not, what route did the driver take, and how much longer than time it should have taken if the driver had been given clear directions).</li>            <li id="ul0083-0003" num="0909">INTERFACE: providing last-mile (particularly in-building) guidance could be done via Augmented Reality interface, such as A/R glasses, that like a video game could do things like &#x201c;paint&#x201d; a red line on top what is actually there to guide the deliverer to the customer's door. This would be particularly helpful as it would not require a hand to check the deliverer's directions, allowing the deliverer to carry a full load as well as reduce likelihood of wrong turns.</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0082-0002" num="0910">Calculate what correction should be, e.g., take off 11 minutes from 38 minute deliver process, feeding that to delivery company system.

All of the above may be captured in a separate data profile and an App that is particular to a driver or set of drivers in a given area. Part of this would include/benefit from capturing all (possible) data about the driver's delivery history. Besides potentially giving the deliverer additional info (like building maps) that his company App may not have/capture (or the delivery company's system may not be able (or interested in) capturing this additional information), the deliverer can draw on this history to help deliver to that customer/building in the future. More importantly, it will allow the Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) to identify potential trouble-causing &#x201c;behaviors&#x201d; that may cause problems (not just customer specific ones) in the future. For example, the deliverer might have a tendency to not gas-up before beginning a day/night of deliveries. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured to see (through access to a schedule or even pattern identification) that the deliverer normally delivers Thursday-Sunday. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may send the deliverer reminders or messages beginning Wednesday to buy gas that evening before going to bed. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may also tie to the deliverer car's computers to monitor fuel levels and prompt filling up (even directing the deliverer to the nearest gas station) whenever car has less than a half tank of gas and/or within 12 hours of starting deliveries (or likely to). Other problem behaviors could include a tendency to view off calculated routes; to delay starting a delivery route for an average of 8 minutes after acceptance, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0082-0004" num="0912">Thus, even if the company has no interest (even to the point of not being willing to adjust a negative rating for a particular trip), the driver will know about any future issues related to a delivery to that customer/building (or even himself) before the deliverer begins. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured to perform and provide a risk calculation ability for a driver, for a given delivery (before or after the deliverer accepts the delivery task, preferably before), to calculate a risk assessment about the likelihood of a problem and as a result the possibility of a negative measure (late delivery) and/or negative customer review.</li>        <li id="ul0082-0005" num="0913">As recognized herein, risk assessment is important given the context/location and context of a (potential) customer delivery, what is the risk (e.g., level, score, etc.) of some sort of problem occurring that could result in a late delivery, other negative metric, and/or negative customer rating. The driver could include personalized risk parameters like what level of risk the driver is willing to accept, as well as personalized risk-increasing parameters such as car with poor gas mileage. These are in addition to more general context/location risk parameters, such as high-crime area, lots of construction, high traffic (or traffic inducing events like a nearby sports arena that makes deliveries in the area at certain times very difficult, even if at the moment traffic is ok), day of week or time of day (may drive slower at night/can't see as well). A separate&#x2014;and important-risk factor is the ratings history of the customer, not just for the delivery service but in other forums as well. For any customer that has a record of online complaints about products and services (not just complaints about the delivery company), collect (to the extent possible) as much information about those complaints as possible, and develop a likely-to-complain risk score that will factor into the above risk assessment. This would collect data from social media sites (e.g., Facebook/Meta, Twitter, NextDoor, etc.) and other retail establishment sites. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured to identify problem customers BEFORE a deliverer has committed to making a delivery, and/or for prioritizing that customer to minimize the risk of negative review. Accordingly, Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured for identifying past, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; behaviors of the customer that could be a leading indicator of their propensity to cause problems (trigger a negative review) for a delivery person.</li>        <li id="ul0082-0006" num="0914">OTHER ACTIONS and FEEDBACK INTO MEASUREMENT MECHANISM: For deliveries that are high-risk, but not crossing a threshold (or even crossing it but driver wants to do it anyway), additional precautions can be added to Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s), such as police web-cams, video of the &#x201c;last mile&#x201d; could automatically be recorded as evidence in any subsequent dispute about a negative rating, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0082-0007" num="0915">In some exemplary embodiments, the data collection mechanisms for deliveries may include a manual feedback/questionnaire process for the driver in addition to data automatically collected via one or more automated sensors, devices, communication networks, etc. For example, if Applicant's exemplary system detects that the deliverer seems to be wandering around a building or floor, the system could open an automated voice interface that will ask the deliverer &#x201c;what seems to be the problem&#x201d;. Or, preferably, the Applicant's exemplar system is configured to pre-emptively detect the deliverer's wandering around problem and provide the deliverer &#x201c;in route&#x201d; advice on how to get to the delivery destination.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0651" num="0916">As noted herein, some buildings have sophisticated entry systems with special codes for delivery personnel. OVERALL ANALYSIS: This gets into a &#x201c;last-mile&#x201d;, access-to-premises-specific issue that needs to be identified and pre-empted when possible. PREEMPTIVE ACTION&#x2014;Use an API from building IOT system to interface with outside systems, may incorporate with reputation systems to provide limited trusts or at least accelerate authorization. RISK NOTE: People/buildings who feel the need for special codes may present an elevated risk of complaining category of people. RELATED: For &#x201c;high risk (of complaining) customers, additional/supplemental actions could automatically be implemented, e.g., custom messages, macros, ability to streamline or have custom messages such as a specialized thank you (using the customer's name, hope you enjoy your large pepperoni pizza, etc.). This includes sending automatic updates about status (more/more often/more specific than company does), including messages such as we appreciate your business, or &#x201c;due to COVID, please put any tips under the mat in front of the door.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0652" num="0917">Exemplary embodiments of the Applicant's system(s)/method(s) may be configured to be used for customer service applications, or virtual/digital guidance, e.g., where you are located in a webpage and how to navigate, etc.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0918">Exemplary embodiments of the Applicant's system(s)/method(s) may be configured to be used for not just delivery but for pilots, airline packages tracking, and navigational systems.</p><p id="p-0654" num="0919">Exemplary embodiments of the Applicant's system(s)/method(s) may be configured to be used for autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, missiles, farming equipment, etc.</p><p id="p-0655" num="0920">Exemplary embodiments of the Applicant's system(s)/method(s) may be configured to address biased weightings on ratings.

This may save the deliver time, but this may also cause a crash, annoy people, result in a ticket, etc. Exemplary embodiments of the Applicant's system(s)/method(s) may be configured to detect/anticipate (or even pre-empt when planning for the next delivery) that the deliverer might take risks to save time and emphasize to the deliverer not to do so (particularly if the deliverer has done this in the past). And to help the deliverer overcome the impulse, Applicant's exemplary system may be configured to remind the deliverer of past incidents, or even cause its own mini-negative review. Applicant's exemplary system may be configured to provide time-saving alternatives to the deliverer.</p><p id="p-0663" num="0928">Accordingly, Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured to address what a delivery driver should&#x2014;or should not&#x2014;do in order to &#x201c;properly&#x201d; deliver something and, accordingly, earn (or lose) rewards in the form of good driver ratings (and associated derived benefits). Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured with ongoing monitoring of what/where/when/how the deliverer is doing the delivery and during-delivery corrections when the deliverer is doing something &#x201c;bad&#x201d; that may impact the deliverer's ratings. Applicant's exemplary system(s)/method(s) may be configured with pre/post analysis/monitoring of the customer to detect and adjust for potentially problem customers.</p><p id="p-0664" num="0929">In exemplary embodiments, back-end data analysis may be used to more appropriately weight a delivery experience using, for example, the complexity of the locations (starting and ending) involved, the accuracy of the routing, as well as context (e.g., delivery was in a bad/high crime neighborhood), etc. For any negative review, the weighting could be changed/reduced depending on the context, e.g., delivery to a hotel is problematic due to parking problems, finding the right room, various sources of delays (slow/packed elevators), etc. Delivery to an apartment complex is not ideal as someone may need to let the deliverer into the apartment complex to make the delivery. Parking in bad neighborhood's is an issue as you need to be confident your car won't vanish while you are inside an apartment complex making a delivery.</p><p id="p-0665" num="0930">The online &#x201c;reputation&#x201d; of the reviewer may also be considered or incorporated, e.g., if reviewer constantly complains and only gives numerous negative reviews then the reviewer &#x201c;vote&#x201d; should not count as much as everyone else's. Conventional reviewer systems may unfairly afford equal weight to each person's review even if the problems were not the deliverer's fault and/or the reviewer unfairly provides negative reviews.</p><p id="p-0666" num="0931">A relatively low number of deliveries (e.g., less about 20%, etc.) receive reviews. And to make matters worse, people are more likely to complain about a bad experience than reward a good one. Thus, delivery drivers tend to get no credit currently for deliveries that went well or well enough that people didn't bother with a review one way or another. To address this issues, Applicant's exemplary system(s) may be configured to analyze the overall delivery, timeliness, complexity, locations involved, even food involved, to create a proxy-rating scheme that can improve or enhance (accurately) a delivery driver's overall ratings, and thus make the deliverer less vulnerable to one-off negative reviewers who seem to delight in making everyone else's life miserable.

Such reasons may be objectively major (e.g., having problems at work, job loss, lack of money with rent due date approaching, major relationship problems, etc.), relatively minor (e.g., being worried about all the errands due by tomorrow, etc.), seemingly silly (e.g., afraid of an itch starting when bundled up for cold weather, imaginary ear or teeth problems, etc.), or anything in between. The anxiety-inducing reasons can also be (and often are) self-inflicted. For example, a feeling of &#x201c;unevenness&#x201d; in pressure of the left ear versus the right ear can cause a sense of panic. Yet, even when the pressure is indeed even, fear of unevenness may cause the person to yawn, blow their nose, or otherwise &#x201c;check&#x201d; that their ear pressure is even, which, in turn, may actually cause the unevenness which they sought to avoid. Or, a person may worry about all the possible problems that might be encountered on the next day's errands, even if those possible problems are low probability and/or would be minor problems at worst.</p><p id="p-0721" num="0986">Pre-empting many of these real&#x2014;or even imagined-&#x201c;triggers&#x201d; of Anxiety and other mental/physical behaviors that can trigger anxiety are addressed by the exemplary systems and/or methods disclosed in the patent applications and patents listed above, which are incorporated herein. The exemplary systems and/or methods can help in pre-empting/mitigating anxiety-inducing/causing behaviors, both in pre-empting the triggers of Anxiety as well as identifying/pre-empting the root causes of the Anxiety triggers. Note that for many people being prone to Anxiety often defies attempts at identifying root causes or requires many years of therapy to understand the root causes. Even then, it may be difficult or even impossible to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; those root causes (e.g., extensive childhood trauma). Thus, the ability to pre-empt the triggers of Anxiety, regardless of whether there are true &#x201c;root causes&#x201d;, is especially critical in helping Anxiety-sufferers or persons that suffer from Anxiety.</p><p id="p-0722" num="0987">A particularly difficult aspect of some people suffering from Anxiety, or even people who otherwise rarely or even never experience serious Anxiety, is a particular kind of very severe anxiety condition/event colloquial known as &#x201c;panic attacks.&#x201d; According to the Mayo Clinic, a panic attack &#x201c;is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe . . . reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause.&#x201d; These reactions can be physical, such as rapid, pounding heart rate, sweating, shaking, and/or shortness of breath, and/or &#x201c;mental,&#x201d; such as sense of impending doom or danger, claustrophobia (even when not in small space), or other fears or concerns having little or no relation to the physical world. One such phenomena (likely to grow tremendously) are the need for &#x201c;safe spaces&#x201d; that will (supposedly) &#x201c;protect&#x201d; the person from all sorts of possible &#x201c;attacks,&#x201d; particularly verbal &#x201c;assaults&#x201d; that make the hearer uncomfortable or scared, and in turn can trigger all sorts of conditions, including Anxiety, which in turn cause various levels of physical and/or mental issues/symptoms in the person. In particularly severe instances, &#x201c;panic attacks&#x201d; can occur. While these symptoms are present in &#x201c;normal&#x201d; anxiety, in panic attacks the symptoms are much more pronounced and severe, causing in every sense of the word &#x201c;panic.&#x201d; These attacks-which actually can be prolonged, chronic periods of panic and related triggers (powerlessness for example)&#x2014;can be incredibly uncomfortable to completely debilitating in practical functioning terms for the sufferer.</p><p id="p-0723" num="0988">When this happens, or seems likely to happen, intense, coordinated, time-sensitive, and multi-faceted defenses often need to be employed to prevent the attack or prevent it from actually reaching a &#x201c;panic&#x201d; state. Doing so not only prevents the highly (even extreme) unpleasantness associated with such attacks, preventing/mitigating such attacks can break the cycle of such attacks occurring in the future. For example, some panic attacks can be triggered by the change from daylight to nighttime, say for a given geography at a given time of year having sunset at 6:15 pm. The ability to a) understand that such a potential panic-inducing trigger occurs for a given person at that time of day can thus be critical, and b) can provide &#x201c;leads&#x201d; to potential pre-emption, such as increasing the amount of (artificial) light at/after that time and/or avoiding darkness, increasing the amount of physical/mental activities that might distract the person from the (lack of) light issue, being/increasing &#x201c;deployment&#x201d; of anxiety-reducing medications, and/or diligently avoiding activities, events, situations, and/or substances that can cause anxiety. Once the cycle (or &#x201c;habit&#x201d;) of being triggered every time a certain thing (or in this example time of day) happens, it can greatly decrease the potential for such attacks resulting from that trigger(s) to happen in the future.</p><p id="p-0724" num="0989">Generally, anxiety-reducing advice from therapists and others include some portion of the above. However, the anxiety-reducing advice often does not focus on triggers that can be the &#x201c;first dominos&#x201d; in a sequence that results in a panic attack. Instead, the anxiety-reducing advice more often focuses on the more &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; (and/or obvious) reasons (e.g., root causes) for the anxiety in the first place (e.g., money issues). While needing to get to the root causes of issues is of course a major focus of therapists/therapy, it may have only minimal immediate effect on the occurrence/frequency/intensity of the panic attacks. Further, while various &#x201c;remedies&#x201d; can be recommended and/or proscribed by therapists/doctors, they are typically done in an asynchronous fashion (e.g., not caring, or at least being able to pinpoint, much of the timing of the &#x201c;remedy&#x201d; in relation to the symptoms (such as taking an anti-anxiety medication like Ativan), or they focus extensively on such timing (e.g., if you start to feel X, immediately take two Y pills). In the latter case, the panic attack likely has already begun, whereas the goal (of exemplary systems and methods of the invention disclosed herein) is to prevent such a start-of-panic-attack state from even beginning.</p><p id="p-0725" num="0990">Existing treatments/remedies also tend to be independent of the context in which the panic attacks are prone to occur, and/or the contexts when various treatments are employed. Such context(s) can be a key-even critical&#x2014;differentiator in when panic attacks are likely to occur, when a given treatment is likely to be effective (or not) in preventing/mitigating the attack, or both. An example is a lack of immediately accessible safe spaces, and just knowing a &#x201c;safe space&#x201d; (of any sort) can be &#x201c;nearby&#x201d;/immediately available by itself can tremendously comforting to the point of helping prevent a panic attack even if the triggers are already occurring and/or are particularly intense. Note that &#x201c;safe spaces&#x201d; do not have to be physical, geographically-oriented, location-type &#x201c;spaces.&#x201d; A &#x201c;safe space&#x201d; might be just knowing that if they need to call their sister Jane at a moment's notice, that their phone is with them and that Jane is available to pick up. Or the &#x201c;safe space&#x201d; may be that they have an Ativan pill within easy reach, or that there is a box of tissues in their car if they get nasal congestion while they are driving (and that nasal congestion can trigger a series of panic-inducing concerns related to inability to breathe). Thus, a person getting in the car for a two hour trip, and realizing that they a) left their phone and/or b) forgot their Ativan/nasal decongestant or box of tissues can start a cascade of thought processes that result in a panic attack, especially if they feel they are &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; in somehow and prevented from rectifying the situation (e.g., they are too far into the drive to return home, or are 30 miles from the next exit where they can buy tissues, etc.). Such triggers/chain of trigger-related contexts might seem minor or even silly to the non-anxiety sufferer, but they can be very real&#x2014;and extremely unpleasant&#x2014;to the sufferer.</p><p id="p-0726" num="0991">The above pharmaceutical references also illustrates a common approach taken by many therapists to panic attacks: pharmaceutical-based treatments versus non-pharma physical and/or mental activity-related. While taking anti-anxiety drugs such as Ativan can be very effective in dealing with panic attacks, such drugs are very highly controlled (e.g., scarce, and/or have to be &#x201c;rationed&#x201d; by the suffer less they run out before a refill is possible). The drugs can also have serious side effects (e.g., addiction, reduced mental capacity, etc.). And the drugs also tend to be &#x201c;general&#x201d; in treating the symptom but not the trigger and/or context.</p><p id="p-0727" num="0992">Indeed, what makes dealing with/preempting panic attacks particularly challenging is that for many people, the triggers (let alone actual root cause(s)) of panic attacks are often not known and/or the ways to effectively pre-empt or minimize their effects are not known to the sufferer or the therapist (not at least without a lot of therapy). Unlike say a particular disease (e.g., chicken pox, the flu, etc.) where the cause(s) of the illness do not vary much, if at all, from person-to-person, the triggers/causes of panic attacks are very personalized, as are the way(s) of pre-emipting/mitigating the severity of such attacks. In such cases, trial-and-error &#x201c;treatments&#x201d; are often employed (also known as &#x201c;let's throw some treatment spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks).</p><p id="p-0728" num="0993">Thus, keeping track of what treatments (pharma, physical, and/or mental), and if, how, when, where, and (hopefully) why (or at least what context or context/location) they work (or don't) can be critical in pre-empting/mitigating panic attacks. Otherwise, while there might be an immediate mitigation of an in-progress panic attacks, the lack of data collection about everything/anything that might have triggered/caused/be related to the occurrence of the panic attack in the first place will not be captured, nor analysis of such be possible-a core capability of the exemplary systems and methods of the invention disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0729" num="0994">Indeed, one of the key aspects of the exemplary systems and methods of the invention is in the selection of, deployment of, coordination of, tracking the results of, and modifying a portfolio of pharma-based, physical, and/or mental activities, and associated contexts in order to understand what triggers/causes as well as what actually works in preetmpting/mitigating a panic attack, what does not work, when and where the treatment(s) work (or not), how and with whom the treatments work (or not), and why the treatments work (or do not), and the various associated context(s), and in turn learning from these treatment experiences such that they are continually improved in helping to prevent/mitigate any future panic attacks.</p><p id="p-0730" num="0995">There are many, many possibilities in what might contribute to or pre-empt/mitigate panic attacks. For example, engaging in various physical and/or mental activities (&#x201c;exercise&#x201d;) can be very effective in &#x201c;taking the edge&#x201d; off a person, thereby making them less prone to whatever cause(s) their panic attacks, in addition to (or in lieu of) pharma-based approaches. Such &#x201c;exercise&#x201d; of course can be very different for different people, e.g., one person viewing playing chess as a good mental exercise versus another who prefers Sudoku or crossword puzzles, etc. Such potential exercise(s) also can be highly context dependent as well. If a high-potential time-period/context for a person happens to occur when driving a car, it would obviously inhibit their ability to partake in some sort of game or crossword puzzle. Or, it could significantly alter what form the game/activity takes and/or user interface that is used. For example, playing chess against a computer or doing a crossword puzzle while driving might necessitate all interactions taking place via verbal instructions, with no visible interfaces required, unlike their usual form.</p><p id="p-0731" num="0996">An example of a panic attack, how it might occur, and how it might be pre-empted in the future are features that are addressed by and/or are objectives achievable with exemplary systems and methods of the invention disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0732" num="0997">Exemplary systems and methods of the invention disclosed herein are configured to prevent and/or pre-empt anxiety-related behaviors and associated issue/events stemming from the metaverse or highly immersive virtual world in which people gather to socialize, play, and work. As recognized herein, the metaverse (augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR)) could be VERY detrimental to a person suffering from a particular trigger, such as Anxiety. A simple example is someone who is afraid of heights or open spaces. In this example a person may enter an elevator, and their AR/VR-enabled glasses may decide to treat the person to a metaverse in which the person seems to be flying through the air with no walls, no ceiling, and no floor. As disclosed herein, the systems and methods of this invention are configured to detect this possibility BEFORE it even starts to happen or even before it is even suggested by the interface, as the very IDEA (even if requiring opt-in) of being in a floating elevator could cause a panic attack even before the person gets on the elevator or even the building, or even starts his/her commute to the building. It can take VERY little, in the right conditions/context, to trigger a panic attack unfortunately.</p><p id="p-0733" num="0998">In exemplary embodiments, a system is configured to modify one or more aspects of a metaverse or immersive virtual world to lower a risk of an anxiety-related episode and/or behavior(s) of at least one person while experiencing the metaverse or immersive virtual world. For example, the system may include at least one augmented reality user interface configured towards hiding, obscuring, or otherwise modifying one or more sense-oriented triggers for the at least one person. For a person suffering from claustrophobia, the at least one augmented reality user interface may be configured for modifying the metaverse or virtual world such that person experiences a larger virtual room by way of one or more virtual windows being provided that visually display a beach, a forest scene, or other outside environmental scene(s).</p><p id="p-0734" num="0999">As recognized herein, the use of the metaverse is causing unintended consequences. For example, the metaverse may be capable of providing a user experience (via wearing googles or via screens on the walls) in an elevator that is completely open to the sky. This may cause undue stress and anxiety on some people especially if someone happened to bump into them, which may make them feel like they were being pushed off a cliff. Accordingly, exemplary systems and methods of the invention disclosed herein may be configured with &#x201c;anti-metaverse&#x201d; capability, which may be particularly useful for certain metaverse interfaces that are implemented without requiring the user to wear glasses but instead are built into the surroundings themselves. Exemplary embodiments may include anti-metaverse capability that is enables aspects of the metaverse to be hidden from an anxiety-suffering person. This may include turning off the metaverse completely or changing the anxiety-causing metaverse experience to something less anxiety inducing, such as comforting familiar surroundings, etc.</p><p id="p-0735" num="1000">Disclosed herein are exemplary embodiments of systems and methods for proactively pre-empting/mitigating anxiety-related behaviors and associated issues/events.

While triggers can often be enough by themselves to &#x201c;cause&#x201d; or otherwise result in the (undesired) behavior, that is not always the case, particularly as many triggers are emotional in nature at least in part, and emotions tend to &#x201c;blend into&#x201d; or merge with other emotions (and thus triggers), and/or causing/triggering other emotions/triggers to occur, and/or vice versa. For example, Anxiety can cause/lead to/trigger Depression or vice versa. Boredom can cause/lead to/trigger Loneliness, which can, in turn, lead et al. to Depression. Kids (children) chaos can cause Noise which can result in Yelling, which can result in Anger. These are all &#x201c;related triggers&#x201d; to the original trigger that started the process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates how triggers can be &#x201c;related.&#x201d; The practical effect of a trigger activating related triggers is a kind of emotional/trigger &#x201c;snowball&#x201d; that rolls over the sufferer. Some of the snowballs &#x201c;picked up&#x201d; after the ball starts rolling may be relatively small, or as big if not bigger than the original snowball-starting trigger, just like in the physical snowball world. This makes preempting the original &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; snowball (e.g., the one highest on the mountain) to begin with so critical.</p><p id="p-0769" num="1034">In an alcoholic example, it is not uncommon for alcoholics to have somewhere between 5 and 10 (or even more) very significant or major triggers, e.g., a trigger(s) that, in and of itself or by its very nature, can individually lead to a relapse. These significant/major triggers really make the person want to (or &#x201c;have to&#x201d;) drink, more often than not. They can make the person want to drink all by themselves, e.g., independently of anything else going on in the person's life. But they also can set off a number of &#x201c;related&#x201d; triggers. Using a straw-that-broke-the-camels-back metaphor, a significant/major trigger (and possibly more) can serve as the first 900 straws on the camel-relapse back that can stand <b>1000</b> until it breaks (relapses). One or more related triggers&#x2014;for that person&#x2014;might serve as the 101 straws that puts the camel over the top: breaks its back. And these triggers, and how much they &#x201c;weigh&#x201d;, can depend on the context, with different triggers having different straw &#x201c;weights&#x201d; in different contexts. Indeed, for a given person, one trigger might be significant/major and another related trigger relatively minor in impact; in other contexts the reverse might be true, or other triggers coming into the mix in varying degrees. In effect, for different people, and even for the same person, any/all of the triggers (and others) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> might be both significant/major triggers as well as related triggers for other significant/major triggers depending on the context and the person.</p><p id="p-0770" num="1035">This sea of interrelated triggers is a different concept than is &#x201c;taught&#x201d; in rehabilitation programs of all sorts. Even when traditional treatment programs go through some degree of trigger discussion, they nearly always &#x201c;treat&#x201d; triggers as &#x201c;standalone&#x201d;, e.g., the focus is on the effects that a trigger has on your drinking habits (in an alcoholic example) due to that trigger all by itself. At best (worst) such treatments might incorporate the concept of &#x201c;dual-diagnosis&#x201d; of Alcoholism and Depression for example, or Anxiety and Depression in a more general mental health treatment program.</p><p id="p-0771" num="1036">Unfortunately, the pressures of daily life rarely line up in such single file fashion. Certain situations in a person's daily, historical, or ongoing life can &#x201c;activate&#x201d; or trigger other triggers. Again, these are referred to herein as related triggers. For example, Boredom can make you Lonely, which, in turn, might make you want to go out with friends who drink (causing direct or indirect Peer Pressure), which may take you to a place where Proximity and Smell of nearby alcohol has you drooling for a Taste of alcohol to help you Escape from other problems in your life. It is incredibly difficult to defend against alcohol in all of these simultaneous/near-simultaneous circumstances. There are hundreds, even thousands of possible combinations. And many of them, in relevance, degree, impact, and combination can vary in their &#x201c;snowball building&#x201d; by context, making treatment far more complex. And life is complex&#x2014;what further makes determining/diagnosing/treatment so difficult is that many triggers often &#x201c;attack&#x201d; at the same time or nearly, and/or occur so often in conjunction with related triggers that it sometimes becomes impossible to sort out the different triggers involved, and what is a &#x201c;cause&#x201d; and what is an &#x201c;effect&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0772" num="1037">To add even more complexity, a person's defenses, such as an alcoholic's defenses, may be weaker for some triggers than others. Worse still the strength of the person's defense may vary depending on the hour of the day, day of the week, personal living environment at any given time, how their day at the job went, and so on. In total, this complexity of trigger/related trigger relationships and variability of how and when they attack makes it almost impossible to build a single defense that works against all of a person's vulnerabilities all of the time&#x2014;a much more sophisticated set of systems, methods/processes, and mechanisms are needed&#x2014;examples of which are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0773" num="1038">Exemplary embodiments are disclosed of systems and methods for monitoring for and lowering the risk of addiction-related or restriction violation-related behavior(s).

The plurality of devices, sensors, and communication network(s) are configured for monitoring noise level, yelling and/or speech of the at least one person, skin and/or body temperature of the at least one person, and ambient temperature. The system is configured to determine that an Anger trigger for the at least one person is active, in danger of becoming active, or imminent based on the measurements/readings of the noise level, yelling and/or speech of the at least one person, the skin and/or body temperature of the at least one person, and the ambient temperature.</p><p id="p-0774" num="1039">In exemplary embodiments, the system is configured to monitor result(s) of the one or more actions to thereby determine effectiveness of risk lowering action(s) and determine modification(s), if any, to profile parameter(s) of the at least one person, risk determination algorithm(s) and/or measurements/readings taken by the plurality of devices, sensors, and communications network(s) relative to the trigger(s) and/or the addiction-related or restriction violation-related behavior(s) of the at least one person.</p><p id="p-0775" num="1040">In exemplary embodiments, the system is configured to determine whether any other trigger(s) related to the Anger trigger for the at least one person is active, in danger of becoming active, or imminent, including one or more of a Frustration trigger, a Job trigger, a Personal Relationship trigger, a Stress trigger, a Despair trigger, a Self-Loathing trigger, a Resentment trigger, an Information Overload/Snowball Effect trigger, and/or a Yelling trigger.</p><p id="p-0776" num="1041">By way of example, the Despair trigger may be a combination between Depression, Victim, Powerlessness/Resentment, and Frustration, which individually may be relatively minor but collectively may be significant, e.g., cause a person to rage leading to a mass shooting incident or alcohol binging, etc. In this sense, the Despair trigger is a bit different than that caused by Frustration alone, for example.</p><p id="p-0777" num="1042">By way of further example, the Information Overload/Snowball Effect trigger may be active, in danger of becoming active, or imminent when a person is being bombarded on social media on a topic. While any individual social media post might be minor, the sheer volume of numerous social media posts may slowly cause the person to rage, which may result in the person making inappropriate social media posts in Anger (and possibly reaching for a drink). When the system determines that the Information Overload/Snowball Effect trigger for the person is active, in danger of becoming active, or imminent, the system may proactively freeze or lock the person's computer, smartphone or other device used to access social media, e.g., to prevent the person from losing self-control and/or to prevent the person from making inappropriate social media posts in Anger, etc. Or, for example, the system may screen, filter, edit, or otherwise inhibit or prevent unwise content from being posted by the person for whom it has been determined that the Information Overload/Snowball Effect trigger is active, in danger of becoming active, or imminent. Content being posted could also be automatically delayed/buffered to prevent immediate posting, requiring a time period to pass and/or active manual effort (perhaps after screening by another person or automatic screening program) before the original content is actually allowed to post on the social media application. Exemplary embodiments may be configured such that negative posts (e.g., bad posts, mean posts, etc.) trigger preemptive/de-escalating return or interim posts from the automated system(s) (e.g. &#x201c;you seem upset, are you sure you want to post that?&#x201d;, etc.), the automated system(s) may automatically connect the person to a suicide or anger prevention hotline, may automatically flag to a close friend or relative that the person is very upset (e.g., would you like to call the person now?), or suggest to the person to call a relative, sponsor, parole officer, etc. as a preemptive measure. Such automation would be a useful mechanism not only for addicts and parolees, but other persons who want to self-filter their social media activities This could also be a pre-emptive tool for people susceptible to suicide or having been put on a red flag watch list for gun control purposes, and want a way to make sure they don't trigger extra scrutiny under the watch list rules, or even a way of monitoring their activities such that they can be cleared of being flagged if they are &#x201c;good&#x201d; on social media for a predetermined number of months. In other words, this may provide a way to deal with and provide a recourse to a person being (potentially unfairly) flagged under red flag laws.</p><p id="p-0778" num="1043">The Resentment trigger may also comprise a trigger at the core of violence possibilities. Similar to Despair, Resentment may also be caused by a combination of related triggers again varying by the individual and context. Resentment may also be a significant contributor to, and output from, social media snowballing.</p><p id="p-0779" num="1044">Exemplary embodiments may be configured for monitoring for various triggers and combinations therefor (e.g., Despite trigger, Self-Loathing trigger, Resentment trigger, etc.), e.g., with a focus on red flag laws, suicide preemption, mass violence preemption, etc. In exemplary embodiments, monitoring for resentment includes paying careful attention and measurement of not only individual related (input) triggers, but determination as to what will be the mix of the triggers (and the contexts) that may significantly increase the individual to a very high risk status. But, at the same time, the risk of abuse of the red flag laws may be problematic, e.g., an unhappy ex may red flag an ex by calling in a report of a fake incident, etc. Accordingly, exemplary embodiments may be configured for monitoring people to prevent false triggering of red flag laws or in situations where it appears persons were incorrectly flagged (or the persons got better) have them removed from the &#x201c;blacklists&#x201d; by monitoring good behavior. On the social media front, resentment can be problematic as a large number of social media posts are intended to anger people and build resentment about certain topics or people.</p><p id="p-0780" num="1045">In exemplary embodiments, the plurality of devices, sensors, and communication network(s) are configured for monitoring proximity of the at least one person to one or more other persons.

The related triggers may relatively small or insignificant individually and may change by person and/or by context. For example, for one person at one time it could be a combination of &#x201c;passive&#x201d; triggers (and thus trending towards suicide), which passive triggers may include powerlessness, victim, depression, and guilt for example. Or in other persons/contexts, more &#x201c;active&#x201d; related triggers could lend themselves towards violence, such as guilt (e.g., lost opportunities, bad deeds leading to a what-the-hell attitude towards doing worse deeds, etc.), frustration (at the world and myself, or specific individuals), victim, anger, snowball effect, etc. The context for the same combination of triggers might cause different results&#x2014;alone by yourself perhaps a withdrawing into the world, with the &#x201c;worst&#x201d; being attempted suicide, and in others (having supposedly been bullied at school recently, an extra-intensive form of Peer Pressure/Social Relationships) combined with victim and powerlessness, leading to shootings of others.
