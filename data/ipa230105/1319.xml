At least as far as children are concerned, there is a general understanding that the more bubbles that are made and the quicker they are made, the better the bubble maker. Simple wands that produce bubbles by loading the wands with a bubble solution and blowing through the wands with air from a person's mouth are well known. Furthermore, certain types of automated bubble producing devices, such as bubble producing guns, are also known. However, these types of devices can make a terrible mess in the hands of a child (the same goes for some adults, too). For purposes of generating more bubbles, and making less of a mess, stand-alone bubble generating toys have been designed. Such a toy generates bubbles by forming a film of bubble solution using an applicator as air streams through bubble-forming openings. This type of bubble generating toy requires bubble solution to be pumped from a reservoir at the base of the assembly and streamed over the bubble-forming openings. Furthermore, excess bubble solution must be collected so that it can be directed back into the reservoir. Toys of this type also blow air through small air tubes, which direct the air to the bubble-forming openings to help form the bubbles. Existing automated bubble making devices are messy, difficult and expensive to manufacture, and difficult to use. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus for generating bubbles which overcomes the above-noted deficiencies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exemplary embodiments according to the present disclosure are directed to an apparatus for generating bubbles and to a method of generating bubbles. The apparatus may include a modular assembly that includes a first housing assembly containing a fan device, bubble generating devices, and a bubble solution dispenser, a second housing assembly containing all of the electronic circuitry of the apparatus, and a drip tray. The second housing assembly, the drip tray, and the first housing assembly may be detachably coupled together by simply placing each component on top of the other such that gravity and no fasteners are used to hold the parts together. In some embodiments, operation of the apparatus involves the motor being operably coupled to the fan device and to the bubble solution dispenser to rotate them both about a rotational axis. The bubble solution dispenser may deliver bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices as it rotates and an air stream generated by the fan device may pass through the bubble generating devices to generate bubbles from the bubble solution loaded thereon.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention may be an apparatus for generating bubbles comprising: a first housing assembly; a motor; a fan device operably coupled to the motor to generate an air stream; a bubble generating assembly comprising a plurality of bubble generating devices that are aligned with the air stream generated by the fan device, the plurality of bubble generating devices fixed relative to the first housing assembly; a bubble solution dispenser comprising at least one delivery member that is fluidly coupled to a supply of a bubble solution; and wherein the motor is operably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser to move the delivery member across each of the bubble generating devices to load each of the bubble generating devices with the bubble solution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, the invention may be a method of generating bubbles comprising: generating an air stream with an air stream generator;

Moreover, the features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to the exemplified embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such exemplary embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist alone or in other combinations of features; the scope of the invention being defined by the claims appended hereto.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, an apparatus for generating bubbles <b>100</b> (hereinafter referred to as the apparatus <b>100</b>) will be described. The apparatus <b>100</b> may also be referred to herein as a bubble generating machine. The apparatus <b>100</b> is designed to generate bubbles from a bubble solution in an automatic fashion by way of moving parts that are operably coupled to a motor. Thus, a bubble solution may be dispensed onto bubble generating devices and then bubbles can be generated from the bubble solution loaded on the bubble generating devices as an air stream flows through the bubble generating devices. In some embodiments, there are no pumps, valves, or other similar types of devices included for facilitating movement of the bubble solution to the bubble generating devices. Thus, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be devoid of any pumps in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The apparatus <b>100</b> generally comprises a first housing assembly <b>200</b>, a second housing assembly <b>300</b>, and a drip tray <b>400</b>. The apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled by detachably coupling the drip tray <b>400</b> to the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and then detachably coupling the first housing assembly <b>200</b> to the drip tray <b>400</b>. Thus, the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, the drip tray <b>400</b>, and the first housing assembly <b>200</b> are detachably coupled together to form the assembled apparatus <b>100</b>. Stated another way, the drip tray <b>400</b> is slidably coupled to the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and then the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is slidably coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b> and the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the drip tray <b>400</b>, and the second housing assembly <b>300</b> are maintained in an assembled state due to gravity.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the exemplified embodiment, there are no mechanical fasteners involved in the coupling of the various components together. Rather, the drip tray <b>400</b> merely rests atop of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> via gravity and the first housing assembly <b>200</b> merely rests atop of the drip tray <b>400</b> via gravity. Thus, a user can very easily assemble and disassemble the apparatus <b>100</b> as desired, which is particularly helpful for purposes of cleaning the apparatus <b>100</b> after each use. To disassemble the apparatus <b>100</b>, the user lifts the first housing assembly <b>200</b> upwardly away from the drip tray <b>400</b>, then lifts the drip tray <b>400</b> upwardly away from the second housing assembly <b>200</b>. There are no screws, fasteners, or other hardware involved in the assembly and disassembly, which makes it very simple for an end-user such as a very busy parent.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Each of the first and second housing assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> will be described separately in greater detail below. However, briefly with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the first housing assembly <b>200</b> comprises an inner surface <b>201</b> that defines an interior space <b>202</b> that contains several components of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Specifically, the following components are either located within (partially or entirely) the interior space <b>202</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> or coupled to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> without being located within the interior space <b>202</b>: a fan device <b>210</b>, an air guide <b>220</b> having an outer casing <b>221</b> and an inner funnel <b>222</b> that collectively define an air passageway therebetween, a gear assembly <b>230</b>, a bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>, a bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>, a support member <b>270</b>, and one or more paddles <b>290</b>. In general, the fan device <b>210</b>, the air guide <b>220</b>, the gear assembly <b>230</b>, and the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> are located at least partially within the interior space <b>202</b> defined by the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b> via the gear assembly <b>230</b>, but in the exemplified embodiment at least a part of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> may not be located within the interior space <b>202</b> (although in other embodiments the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> could certainly be located entirely within the interior space <b>202</b>). Furthermore, although a portion of the support member <b>270</b> may be located within the interior space <b>202</b>, another portion of the support member <b>270</b> may be located outside of the interior space <b>202</b>. Of course, the shape and design of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> may be modified as desired to contain all of these components within the interior space <b>202</b> in some embodiments. The first housing assembly <b>200</b> is open at the top (for bubble generation) and the bottom (for air flow) in the exemplified embodiment, although the bottom could be closed in other embodiments and openings could be formed into the body of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> for air flow purposes.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second housing assembly <b>300</b> contains all of the electronic circuity required for operation of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Thus, for example, the second housing assembly <b>300</b> comprises an interior cavity <b>310</b> within which is located a power source <b>301</b> and a motor <b>302</b>, which are operably coupled together. Any other electronic devices that form a part of the apparatus <b>100</b> could also be included in the interior cavity <b>310</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. In certain embodiments, the interior cavity <b>310</b> is a hermetically sealed cavity such that liquid cannot penetrate the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and enter the interior cavity <b>310</b>. This may be desirable to protect the electronic components that are located within the interior cavity <b>310</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> from being damaged by liquids such as water during washing of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. Thus, in some embodiments the apparatus <b>100</b> may include a processor and/or memory device, and in such embodiments those components could be located in the interior cavity <b>310</b> of the second housing assembly <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The motor <b>302</b> and the power source <b>301</b> are operably coupled together so that power from the power source <b>301</b> may be provided to the motor <b>302</b> so that the motor <b>302</b> can be made to rotate. The second housing assembly <b>300</b> also includes an actuator <b>309</b>, which in the exemplified embodiment is a button that protrudes from the outer surface of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. Of course, the actuator <b>309</b> need not be a button in all embodiments, but could be a toggle switch, a slide switch, a touch sensor, an inductive switch, or the like. Activation of the actuator <b>309</b> closes a circuit between the power source <b>301</b> and the motor <b>302</b> to enable power from the power source <b>301</b> to be transmitted to the motor <b>302</b>. Thus, a first activation of the actuator <b>309</b> causes the motor <b>302</b> to rotate as described herein and a second activation of the actuator <b>309</b> will power the motor off.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The motor <b>302</b> comprises a drive shaft <b>303</b> that protrudes from the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. Furthermore, a coupler <b>304</b> having a non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape is coupled to the drive shaft <b>303</b>. The coupler <b>304</b> is entirely exposed and visible when the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is detached from the drip tray <b>400</b>. However, by coupling the first housing assembly <b>200</b> to the drip tray <b>400</b>, the coupler <b>304</b> interacts with a first coupler <b>212</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> to operably couple the motor <b>302</b> to the fan device <b>210</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the first coupler <b>212</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> is a recess that receives the coupler <b>304</b> that is attached to the drive shaft <b>303</b> of the motor <b>302</b>. However, the specific structural details of the first coupler <b>212</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> and the coupler <b>304</b> attached to the drive shaft <b>303</b> of the motor <b>302</b> are not to be limiting of the present invention and they can take on any shape so long as they mate/interact to transmit rotation of the motor <b>302</b> to the fan device <b>210</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the recess of the first coupler <b>212</b> and the coupler <b>304</b> have non-circular transverse cross-sectional shapes so that rotation of the coupler <b>304</b> is imparted to the fan device <b>210</b> so that as the motor <b>302</b> rotates, so too does the fan device <b>210</b>. Because there are no gears between the motor <b>302</b> and the fan device <b>210</b>, in the exemplified embodiment the fan device <b>210</b> rotates at the same speed as the motor <b>302</b>, although this is not required in all embodiments and gears or the like could be included to decrease and/or increase the rotational speed of the fan device <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The drip tray <b>400</b> is an open-top container having a collection reservoir <b>410</b> for collecting bubble solution that drips downwardly through the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The drip tray <b>400</b> is essentially a cup having a floor <b>402</b> and a sidewall <b>403</b> that define the collection reservoir <b>410</b> so that the drip tray <b>400</b> can collect any bubble solution that drips downwardly within the apparatus <b>100</b>. The drip tray <b>400</b> has a pour spout <b>401</b> to facilitate pouring any bubble solution collected in the collection reservoir <b>401</b> back into a bottle of bubble solution or elsewhere as may be desired.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the apparatus <b>100</b> is fully assembled as shown, the drip tray <b>400</b> is positioned atop of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is positioned atop of the drip tray <b>400</b>. Thus, in the assembled apparatus <b>100</b>, the drip tray <b>400</b> is located axially in between the first and second housing assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> such that the first and second housing assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> are at least partially spaced apart in the axial direction by the drip tray <b>400</b>. Furthermore, when the apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled the power source <b>301</b> is operably coupled to the motor <b>302</b> and the motor <b>302</b> is operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b> and to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. More specifically, the motor <b>302</b> is operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b> and then the fan device <b>210</b> is operably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> via the gear assembly <b>230</b> such that the motor <b>302</b> is indirectly operably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. Thus, in operation when the actuator <b>302</b> is activated and the apparatus <b>100</b> is powered on, the motor <b>302</b> rotates about a rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>, which also results in the fan device <b>210</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotating about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>. Because the fan device <b>200</b> is directly coupled to the motor <b>302</b>, the fan device <b>200</b> will rotate at the same rotational velocity (rotations per minute) as the motor <b>302</b>. However, the gear assembly <b>230</b> is designed to slow down the rotational speed of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> relative to the fan device <b>210</b> and to the motor <b>302</b>. Thus, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates at a rotational velocity (rotations per minute) that is less than the rotational velocity of the fan device <b>210</b> and the motor <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is illustrated in cross-section. The first housing assembly <b>200</b> has a main body <b>206</b> that extends from a top end <b>203</b> to a bottom end <b>204</b> along a longitudinal axis A-A. In certain embodiments, the longitudinal axis A-A and the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b> may be the same axis. Furthermore, the longitudinal axis A-A of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is also the longitudinal axis of the apparatus <b>100</b> when assembled. The main body <b>206</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> has an outer surface <b>205</b> that is opposite the inner surface <b>201</b>. The first housing assembly <b>200</b> also comprises a connection post <b>207</b> extending from the bottom end <b>204</b> of the main body <b>206</b> to a distal end <b>208</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the connection post <b>207</b> is a hollow cylindrical post having a circular transverse cross-sectional shape extending from the bottom end <b>204</b> of the main body <b>206</b>. Of course, the invention is not to be so limited and in other embodiments the connection post <b>207</b> could be a solid structure and it could have other transverse cross-sectional shapes, such as being square, rectangular, triangular, or the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The connection post <b>207</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> comprises an alignment feature <b>209</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the alignment feature <b>209</b> is formed at the distal end <b>208</b> of the connection post <b>207</b>. Specifically, the distal end <b>209</b> of the connection post <b>207</b> comprises an undulating edge comprising a series of circumferentially adjacent protrusions <b>209</b>a and recesses <b>209</b>b. The undulating edge of the distal end <b>209</b> is intended to mate with an alignment feature of the drip tray <b>400</b> to facilitate proper alignment between the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> when those components are coupled together. The alignment features <b>209</b>a, <b>209</b>b of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> are also intended to prevent the first housing assembly <b>200</b> from rotating relative to the drip tray <b>400</b> during operation of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Of course, the alignment feature <b>209</b> can take on other shapes, structures, or the like so long as it is configured to mate with an alignment feature of the drip tray <b>400</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Although the alignment feature <b>209</b> is depicted as being formed by the distal end <b>208</b> of the connection post <b>207</b>, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments. In other embodiments, the alignment feature <b>209</b> may be one or more notches, protuberances, recesses, springs, clips, or the like located on an outer surface or an inner surface of the connection post <b>207</b>. The alignment feature <b>209</b> can take on other structural forms and be positioned at other locations along the connection post <b>207</b> so long as it is configured to mate with an alignment feature of the drip tray <b>400</b> (described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>). Of course, in some embodiments the alignment feature <b>209</b> may be omitted without affecting the ability to detachably couple the first housing assembly <b>200</b> to the drip tray <b>400</b>. However, the alignment feature <b>209</b> may make the coupling between the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> more stable than it would be without the alignment feature <b>209</b>. Specifically, in some embodiments particularly where the connection post <b>207</b> has a circular transverse cross-sectional shape, the first housing assembly <b>200</b> may be able to freely rotate relative to the drip tray <b>400</b> if the alignment feature <b>209</b> were to be omitted. The alignment feature <b>209</b> could be formed by having the connection post <b>207</b> have a non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape as this would also facilitate the described alignment.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As noted previously, the fan device <b>210</b> is positioned within the interior space <b>202</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The fan device <b>210</b> is not limited to being a fan in all embodiments, but can be any device that is configured to generate an air stream when it is powered on. Thus, the fan device <b>210</b> may be any type of air generator, air flow generator, air stream generator, or the like. In the exemplified embodiment, the fan device <b>210</b> comprises a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart blades <b>211</b> that are oriented so that when the fan device <b>210</b> is rotated in a particular direction (one of clockwise or counterclockwise), the air stream generated by the fan device <b>210</b> flows upwardly towards the top end <b>203</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B</figref> the gear assembly <b>230</b> will be further described. The gear assembly <b>230</b> generally comprises a sleeve <b>231</b>, a gear train <b>232</b> housed within the sleeve <b>231</b>, a first gear coupler <b>233</b> for coupling the gear assembly <b>230</b> to the fan device <b>210</b>, and a second gear coupler <b>234</b> for coupling the gear assembly <b>230</b> to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. The gear train <b>232</b> operates as a speed reducer, which means that the output gear (the gear furthest from the motor <b>302</b>) rotates more slowly than the input gear (the gear closest to the motor <b>302</b>). The input gear is operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b> and the output gear is operably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. Thus, the purpose of the gear train <b>232</b> is to allow the motor <b>302</b> to simultaneously control operation/rotation of the fan device <b>210</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> while rotating the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> at a slower rotational speed/velocity than the fan device <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the gear assembly <b>230</b> is assembled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the first gear coupler <b>233</b> protrudes from a bottom end of the sleeve <b>231</b> and the second gear coupler <b>234</b> protrudes from a top end of the sleeve <b>231</b>. Each of the first and second gear couplers <b>233</b>, <b>234</b> has a non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape. In the exemplified embodiment, the first gear coupler <b>233</b> has a truncated circle transverse cross-sectional shape and the second gear coupler <b>234</b> has a square/rectangular transverse cross-sectional shape. However, any transverse cross-sectional shape may be used so long as it is not circular and it corresponds with a shape of a recess in the fan device <b>210</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> to which it is coupled.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the exemplified embodiment, the fan device <b>210</b> has the first coupler <b>212</b> configured to couple the fan device <b>210</b> to the motor <b>302</b> as described above and a second coupler <b>213</b> configured to couple the fan device to the first gear coupler <b>233</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the second coupler <b>213</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> is a recess that is configured to receive the first gear coupler <b>233</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>. However, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and in other embodiments the first gear coupler <b>233</b> could be a recess while the second coupler <b>213</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> could be a post or protuberance or the like that is received in the recess. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> has a coupler <b>251</b>, which in the exemplified embodiment is a recess configured to receive the second gear coupler <b>234</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>. Of course, the coupler <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> could be a post while the second gear coupler <b>234</b> is a recess in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fan device <b>210</b> is held in place within the interior space <b>202</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> due to its coupling to the first gear coupler <b>233</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>.

The non-circular transverse cross-sectional shapes of the first gear coupler <b>233</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b> and the second coupler <b>213</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> ensure that as the fan device <b>210</b> rotates due to its coupling to the motor <b>302</b>, so too does the first gear coupler <b>233</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>, which in turn rotates the gears of the gear train <b>232</b>, which in turn rotates the second gear coupler <b>234</b> of the gear assembly <b>230</b>, which in turn rotates the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The outer container <b>221</b> and the inner funnel <b>222</b> of the air guide <b>220</b> are also located within the interior space <b>202</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The outer container <b>221</b> is coupled to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the inner funnel <b>222</b> is coupled to the outer container <b>221</b>.

The inner funnel <b>222</b> has an outer surface <b>225</b> that faces the inner surface <b>224</b> of the outer container <b>221</b> and an opposite inner surface <b>226</b>. The inner surface <b>226</b> of the inner funnel <b>222</b> defines a cavity <b>227</b> within which the gear assembly <b>230</b> is positioned. Furthermore, although the outer container <b>221</b> and the inner funnel <b>222</b> of the air guide <b>220</b> are coupled together, portions of the inner surface <b>224</b> of the outer container <b>221</b> and the outer surface <b>225</b> of the inner funnel <b>222</b> are spaced apart from one another, thereby defining an air passageway <b>228</b> between the inner surface <b>224</b> of the outer container <b>221</b> and the outer surface <b>225</b> of the inner funnel <b>222</b>.

The air passageway <b>228</b> thereby guides the air stream generated by the fan device <b>210</b> from the fan device <b>210</b> to one or more bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>, which are aligned with the air passageway <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The air passageway <b>228</b> is an annular passageway located within the first housing assembly <b>200</b> that surrounds the longitudinal axis A-A of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>.

However, spacing between the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> may be desirable in some embodiments to prevent the bubbles from clinging to one another as they float away from the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B</figref> concurrently, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> and the manner in which it is coupled to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> will be described. The bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> may be referred to herein as a skinner or a skinner member because it cause a film of the bubble solution to be formed on the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as is passes across the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. The bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> comprises a hub portion <b>251</b> and at least one delivery member <b>252</b> extending from the hub portion <b>251</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, there are two of the delivery members <b>252</b> extending from the hub portion <b>251</b>, but in other embodiments there could be just one of the delivery members <b>252</b> or there could be more than two of the delivery members <b>252</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the two delivery members <b>252</b> extend radially from the hub portion <b>251</b> and are circumferentially spaced apart by between 80&#xb0; and 100&#xb0;, although different spacing may be possible in other embodiments. The delivery members <b>252</b> extend radially from the hub portion <b>251</b> and are used to dispense the bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as described herein. Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment, as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> dispenses the bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>, which are static or non-moving relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> comprises a storage reservoir <b>253</b> that, during operation, contains a supply of the bubble solution. More specifically, the hub portion <b>251</b> comprises a floor <b>254</b>, a first annular sidewall <b>255</b> extending from the floor <b>254</b>, and a second annular sidewall <b>256</b> extending from the floor <b>254</b>. The second annular sidewall <b>256</b> generally surrounds the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> in a concentric manner. A first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is formed by the floor <b>254</b> and inner surface of the first annular sidewall <b>255</b>. A second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is formed by the floor <b>254</b>, an outer surface of the first annular sidewall <b>255</b>, and an inner surface of the second annular sidewall <b>256</b>. An opening <b>259</b> is formed into the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> to fluidly couple the first and second portions <b>257</b>, <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> together. Thus, bubble solution in the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is capable of flowing to the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> through the openings <b>259</b>, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The first annular sidewall <b>255</b> forms a portion of a bubble solution bottle support member. Specifically, a bubble solution bottle can be placed upside down with its opening facing the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> and the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> (along with the support member <b>270</b> as described in more detail below) can hold the bubble solution bottle in the upside-down orientation. Thus, bubble solution can readily flow out of the bubble solution bottle into the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> and from the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> to the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> via the openings <b>259</b>. This can all occur passively without user intervention. The bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> also has a post <b>260</b> protruding from the floor <b>254</b> within the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> for guiding the flow of the bubble solution from the bubble solution bottle into the first portion <b>257</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The delivery member <b>252</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> comprises a floor <b>350</b> and a sidewall <b>351</b> extending upwardly from the floor <b>351</b>. The floor <b>350</b> and the sidewall <b>351</b> collectively define a delivery reservoir <b>352</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the sidewall <b>351</b> could be omitted in alternative embodiments and the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> could be defined solely by the floor <b>350</b>. That is, the bubble solution can be held on the floor <b>350</b> for dispensing onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> even without the sidewall <b>351</b> being present. In the exemplified embodiment, there is at least one aperture <b>354</b> formed into the floor <b>350</b> so that any bubble solution that is located in the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> can flow downwardly through the aperture <b>354</b> via gravity for dispensing onto the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>, as described in more detail below. In the exemplified embodiment, there are a plurality of the apertures <b>354</b> formed into the floor <b>350</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b>. The apertures <b>354</b> comprise at least one slot <b>355</b> and a plurality of apertures <b>354</b> located on opposite sides of the slot <b>355</b>. The at least one slot <b>355</b> may have a length measured from end-to-end that is equal to or greater than a diameter of each of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>. Of course, the specific pattern/arrangement of the apertures <b>354</b> is not to be limiting of the present invention and other patterns, arrangements, numbers of apertures, or the like may be used in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although in the exemplified embodiment the apertures <b>354</b> are illustrated and described for delivering the bubble solution from the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> to the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments. In other embodiments, the sidewall <b>351</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b> may have one or more openings therein so that the bubble solution can flow out of the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> and onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. In other embodiments as noted above, the sidewall <b>351</b> may be omitted and thus the bubble solution may be delivered by simply flowing past the boundaries of the floor <b>350</b>. In still other embodiments, the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> may be dipped into the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> for delivering the bubble solution to the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. Thus, alternative ways for delivering the bubble solution to the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> may be possible within the scope of the invention described herein.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the exemplified embodiment, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is positioned so that the delivery member <b>252</b> passes over the top of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> during use. As a result, the bubble solution drips/falls through the apertures <b>354</b> for loading the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> with the bubble solution. However, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments. For example, in some alternative embodiments the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> may be positioned so that the delivery member <b>252</b> passes below the bottom of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> (i.e., at a location between the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> and the fan device <b>210</b>). In such an embodiment, the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> may contact the bubble solution in the delivery member <b>252</b> as the delivery member <b>252</b> rotates or otherwise moves due to its operable coupling to the motor <b>302</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The second annular sidewall <b>256</b> has openings <b>269</b> that fluidly couple the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> with the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b>. Thus, the bubble solution can flow from the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> via the openings <b>269</b> in the second annular sidewall <b>256</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the delivery member <b>252</b> is circumferentially offset from the opening <b>259</b> in the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> and circumferentially aligned with the opening <b>269</b> in the second annular sidewall <b>256</b>. Thus, the fluid can't flow directly through the openings <b>259</b> and the openings <b>269</b>, but instead must flow through the openings <b>259</b>, then circumferentially along the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> to the openings <b>269</b>, and from there into the delivery reservoir <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>19</b>A</figref>, the floor <b>254</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> will be described. The floor <b>254</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> comprises a first circumferential portion <b>261</b> and a second circumferential portion <b>262</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, there are two of the first circumferential portions <b>261</b> and two of the second circumferential portions <b>262</b>, although this can be modified to be one of each or more than two of each without affecting the overall functionality of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The second circumferential portion <b>262</b> extends from the first circumferential portion <b>261</b> to a terminal end <b>263</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the first circumferential portion <b>261</b> is flat, or oriented along a horizontal plane, whereas the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> forms a ramp such that the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> is inclined relative to the first circumferential portion <b>261</b>. The terminal end <b>263</b> of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> is elevated relative to the end of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> that is immediately adjacent to the first circumferential portion <b>261</b>. Thus, the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> forms a ramp having an upward incline as it extends from the first circumferential portion <b>261</b> to the terminal end <b>263</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> comprises a stopper wall <b>264</b> extending upwardly from the floor <b>254</b> along the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. As a result, a dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is defined between the stopper wall <b>264</b> and the terminal end <b>263</b> of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b>. The dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is aligned with the openings <b>269</b> in the second annular sidewall <b>256</b>. Thus, the bubble solution within the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> readily flows through the opening <b>269</b> to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Because the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the floor <b>254</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> is oriented at an incline, in some embodiments the bubble solution may not be able to readily flow up the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> and into the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. Specifically, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments the bubble solution may extend partway up the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the floor <b>254</b>, but not all the way to the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. In such embodiments, the bubble solution may only be delivered to the delivery <b>352</b> when the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is being moved by the motor <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, in some embodiments the paddles <b>290</b> will facilitate the movement of the bubble solution up the ramp of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> and into the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>, which will be described in greater detail below) when the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is being moved by the motor <b>302</b>. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the bubble solution can only be delivered to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> when the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is being moved by the motor <b>302</b> (due to the paddles <b>290</b>). This prevents the bubble solution from freely flowing into the assembly when operation is not desired because such free flow would simply result in the bubble solution flowing from the bottle of bubble solution directly into the drip tray <b>400</b>. Thus, in some embodiments the bubble solution is prevented from flowing to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> when the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is not being moved/rotated by the motor <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Of course, in other embodiments the entirety of the floor <b>254</b> may be oriented along a horizontal plane rather than including the ramped portion as described herein. In such embodiments, paddles <b>290</b> that will be described below can be omitted because the bubble solution will be able to flow to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> without being forced there by the paddles. In still other embodiments, the floor <b>254</b> along the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> may be inclined downwardly from the opening <b>259</b> in the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> to the opening <b>269</b> in the second annular sidewall <b>256</b> to facilitate the desired flow of the bubble solution to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b>. Thus, modifications are possible while still permitting the apparatus <b>100</b> to function as described herein.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>10</b></figref>, during operation of the apparatus <b>100</b>, the motor <b>302</b> is operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b> and to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> as described herein above (due to the fan device <b>210</b> being coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> via the gear assembly <b>230</b>). Thus, as the motor <b>302</b> rotates about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>, so too does the fan device <b>210</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> and each of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> are fixed relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> such that the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> and the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> are static relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> while the fan device <b>210</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotate about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the exemplified embodiment, as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the delivery members <b>252</b> pass across the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> and the bubble solution located within the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> flows through the apertures <b>354</b> and drips onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the delivery members <b>252</b> pass over the top of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. However, as noted above in other embodiments the delivery members <b>252</b> may pass beneath the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> while still being configured to dispense the bubble solution thereto. Thus, stating that the delivery members <b>252</b> pass across the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> may include the delivery members <b>252</b> passing over the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> or under the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. In some embodiments where the delivery members <b>252</b> pass over the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>, the delivery of the bubble solution from the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> to the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> occurs via gravity which allows the bubble solution to fall through the apertures <b>354</b>. As the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>, the delivery member <b>252</b> passes over each of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>, allowing the bubble solution to drip onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as the delivery member <b>252</b> passes over it.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in the exemplified embodiment the delivery member <b>252</b> is spaced apart from the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as it passes across them. Thus, there is a gap G<b>1</b> between the delivery member <b>252</b> and the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as the delivery member <b>252</b> rotates and passes over the various bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. Stated another way, in the exemplified embodiment the delivery member <b>252</b> does not make direct contact with the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as the delivery member <b>252</b> passes over the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. Rather, the delivery member <b>252</b> merely passes over the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> while maintaining the gap G<b>1</b> and allowing the bubble solution to drip through the apertures <b>354</b> to form a film of the bubble solution on the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. In alternative embodiments, it may be possible for this gap to be omitted so that the delivery member <b>252</b> directly contacts the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> to assist in delivery of the bubble solution thereto. This may be necessary in certain embodiments where the delivery member <b>252</b> passes beneath rather than over the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> to ensure that the bubble solution is properly and adequately delivered/loaded onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. As mentioned above, the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> are all positioned so as to be aligned with the air stream generated by the fan device <b>210</b>. Thus, once the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> are loaded with the bubble solution and the air stream generated by the fan device <b>210</b> passes through the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>, bubbles are formed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the support member <b>270</b> will be described. The support member <b>270</b> comprises an outer ring structure <b>271</b> that is coupled to the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, an inner ring structure <b>272</b> that is coupled to the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>, and a plurality of arm members <b>273</b> extending from the outer ring structure <b>271</b> to the inner ring structure <b>272</b>.

The inner ring structure <b>272</b>, either by itself or collectively with the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> to which it is attached, forms a bottle support structure that is configured to support a bubble solution bottle in an upside-down orientation. Thus, a bubble solution bottle can be placed upside-down with the neck and dispensing opening located within the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. The bubble solution will thereby flow out of the bubble solution bottle and into the storage reservoir <b>253</b> where it can be dispensed onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> as described herein. The inner ring structure <b>272</b>, alone or in combination with the first annular sidewall <b>255</b>, will hold the bubble solution bottle in place in the upside-down orientation. This way, the bubble solution can continue to be dispensed from the bubble solution bottle into the storage reservoir <b>253</b> during operation as more of the bubble solution turns to bubbles.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The bottle support structure formed by the inner ring structure <b>272</b> (alone or in combination with the first annular sidewall <b>255</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>) is arranged so as to surround a portion of the longitudinal axis A-A of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. Thus, when a bubble solution bottle is supported by the bottle support structure as described herein, the longitudinal axis A-A of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> passes through or intersects the bubble solution bottle. Specifically, the longitudinal axis A-A of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> coincides with the longitudinal axis of the bubble solution bottle when the bubble solution bottle is being supported by the bottle support structure. Stated another way, the support member <b>270</b> is configured to support a bubble solution bottle in an upside-down orientation at a position that is radially inward from the air stream so that the bubble solution bottle is at least partially surrounded by the air stream during operation of the fan device <b>210</b>.

The connection post <b>420</b> is hollow in the exemplified embodiment so that the connection post <b>330</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> can be received therein when the apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled. The connection post <b>420</b> also comprises an opening <b>424</b> in the distal end <b>421</b> thereof so that the drive shaft <b>303</b> of the motor <b>302</b> can protrude through the opening <b>424</b> for coupling to the fan device <b>210</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The drip tray <b>400</b> comprises a first alignment feature <b>430</b> and a second alignment feature <b>440</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the first alignment feature <b>430</b> is located on the inner surface <b>422</b> of the connection post <b>420</b> and the second alignment feature <b>440</b> is located on the outer surface <b>423</b> of the connection post <b>420</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, each of the first and second alignment features <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> have a wavy or undulating shape. However, the shapes of the first and second alignment features <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> are not to be limiting in all embodiments. In the exemplified embodiment, the first alignment feature <b>430</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> mates/interacts with the alignment feature <b>335</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and the second alignment feature <b>440</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> mates/interacts with the alignment feature <b>209</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The interaction between these alignment features prevents relative rotation between the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> and between the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> when the apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled and operating. However, because the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, and the drip tray <b>400</b> are coupled together without any fasteners, a user can rotate the components relative to one another if so desired.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Although the alignment features <b>209</b>, <b>335</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> are illustrated and described herein as being located on the various connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> of the different components, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments. The reason for the alignment features <b>209</b>, <b>335</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> in the exemplified embodiment is that the connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> have circular transverse cross-sectional shapes. As a result, simply coupling the various components (i.e., the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, and the drip tray <b>400</b>) together via the connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> will do nothing to prevent the various components from rotating relative to one another. Thus, in another embodiment the connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> may be modified to have a non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape (e.g., triangular, square, rectangular, etc.), and this shape will form the various alignment features <b>209</b>, <b>335</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>. Furthermore, in still other embodiments there may be no detriment to allowing for the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, and the drip tray <b>400</b> to rotate relative to one another during operation, and in fact this may add another dimension of fun to the apparatus <b>100</b>. Thus, the alignment features may be omitted entirely in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, the assembly of the apparatus <b>100</b> will be described. The apparatus <b>100</b> may be sold with the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, and the drip tray <b>400</b> as separate components, although they could also be pre-assembled in other embodiments. The other parts of the apparatus <b>100</b> are generally already coupled to the respective one of the first and second housing assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, although some additional assembly could be required by a consumer after purchase. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, to assemble the apparatus <b>100</b>, the second housing assembly <b>300</b> is placed onto a horizontal surface (i.e., a table, floor, ground, or the like) with the bottom end <b>320</b> in contact with the horizontal surface. Next, the drip tray <b>400</b> is coupled to the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. This is accomplished by moving the drip tray <b>400</b> towards the second housing assembly <b>300</b> with a bottom end <b>450</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> facing the top end <b>321</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>. The drip tray <b>400</b> is moved towards the second housing assembly <b>300</b> until the connection post <b>330</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> nests within the interior of the connection post <b>420</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Thus, the drip tray <b>400</b> is slidably detachably coupled to the second housing assembly <b>300</b> During this process, the drive shaft <b>303</b> of the motor <b>302</b> and the coupler <b>304</b> attached thereto extend through the opening <b>424</b> in the distal end <b>421</b> of the connection post <b>420</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b>. Furthermore, the first alignment feature <b>430</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> interacts/mates with the alignment feature <b>335</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b> by moving the first housing assembly <b>200</b> towards the drip tray <b>400</b>. During this process, the connection post <b>420</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> enters into the connection post <b>209</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and nests therein. Thus, the second housing assembly <b>200</b> is slidably detachably coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b>. Furthermore, the alignment feature <b>209</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> mates with the second alignment feature <b>330</b> of the drip tray <b>440</b>. Moreover, as the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b>, the coupler <b>304</b> that is attached to the drive shaft <b>303</b> of the motor <b>302</b> mates with and becomes operably coupled to the fan device <b>210</b>. Thus, the process of assembling the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, the drip tray <b>400</b>, and the second housing assembly <b>300</b> also results in operably coupling the motor <b>302</b> (which is located within the second housing assembly <b>300</b>) to the fan device <b>210</b> (which is located within the first housing assembly <b>200</b>). The alignment features <b>209</b>, <b>335</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> ensure that when the apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled, the coupler <b>304</b> is properly aligned with the first coupler <b>212</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> so that the coupler <b>304</b> and the first coupler <b>212</b> of the fan device <b>210</b> mate/interact as needed to ensure that the motor <b>302</b> rotates the fan device <b>210</b> during operation.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the interaction between the various connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> can be seen. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> best illustrates how the connection post <b>330</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> nests within the interior of the connection post <b>420</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> and how the connection post <b>420</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b> nests within the interior of the connection post <b>207</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. The interaction of the various alignment features <b>209</b>, <b>335</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> is also best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Although the invention is described herein with certain ones of the connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> entering into and nesting within others, the invention is not to be limited by the exact interaction illustrated and described herein.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In other embodiments, distal ends of the connection posts <b>207</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>420</b> may interact to couple the components together or the like. Thus, variations to that which is described herein may be possible in certain alternative embodiments and such variations and modifications would be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> is illustrated in a fully assembled state with the drip tray <b>400</b> coupled to the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and the first housing assembly <b>200</b> coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b>. When so assembled, the outer surface <b>322</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> is flush with the outer surface <b>405</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b>. Thus, the outer surfaces <b>322</b>, <b>405</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> are seamless and flush at their interface to give the apparatus <b>100</b> a clean appearance. In some embodiments, a bottom surface of the drip tray <b>400</b> may be in surface contact with the top surface <b>321</b> of the second housing assembly <b>300</b>, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">However, when the first housing assembly <b>200</b> is coupled to the drip tray <b>400</b>, an upper edge of the drip tray <b>400</b> (i.e., the distal end <b>407</b> of the sidewall <b>403</b> of the drip tray <b>400</b>) is spaced apart from the bottom end <b>204</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> by an annular air gap <b>199</b>. This allows air to enter into the first housing assembly <b>200</b> from the bottom end <b>204</b> of the first housing assembly <b>200</b> when the fan device <b>210</b> is rotating. Thus, when the fan device <b>210</b> is rotating, the fan device <b>210</b> pulls air into the first housing assembly <b>200</b> through the annular air gap <b>199</b> so that the air stream that generates the bubbles can be generated. Of course, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments. In other embodiments, the first housing assembly <b>200</b> could be flush with the drip tray <b>400</b> when coupled thereto, and the first housing assembly <b>200</b> could have air openings that facilitate the entry of air into the first housing assembly <b>200</b> for the generation of the air stream as described herein.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>C</figref>, the operation of the apparatus <b>100</b> to generate bubbles from a bubble solution will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, first the apparatus <b>100</b> is assembled as described previously by attaching the drip tray <b>400</b> to the second housing assembly <b>300</b> and then attaching the first housing assembly <b>200</b> to the drip tray <b>400</b>. There are no fasteners used to couple these components together. Rather, they merely rest one on top of the other and are held in place due to gravity. The alignment features described above may assist in properly orienting the first and second housing assemblies <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> relative to one another, although the alignment features may also be omitted in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, a bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> is provided. The bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> may be any container or the like having a cavity that is configured to hold and store an amount of a bubble solution. The bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> may have an open top end <b>502</b> that allows for the bubble solution in the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> to be dispensed therefrom. The bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> may have a cap <b>501</b> thereon that closes the open top end <b>502</b> of the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b>. The cap <b>501</b> may be coupled to the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> with a hinge, with mating screw threads, interference fit, snap-fit, or in any other desired manner. To begin use of the apparatus <b>100</b>, the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> is oriented upside-down and placed so that the open top end <b>502</b> faces the storage reservoir <b>253</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. The support member <b>270</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> may hold and retain the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> in the upside-down orientation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring sequentially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>C</figref> concurrently with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>, the operation will be further described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view associated with the relative positioning of the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view associated with the relative positioning of the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view associated with the relative positioning of the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Once the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> is coupled to the apparatus <b>100</b> in its upside-down orientation, the bubble solution will flow out of the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> and into the storage reservoir <b>253</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. The bubble solution will flow into both of the first and second portions <b>257</b>, <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. However, without activating the apparatus <b>100</b> by pressing the actuator <b>309</b>, in some embodiments the bubble solution will not flow to the deliver reservoir <b>352</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b>. Thus, the bubble solution will not flow from the bottle <b>500</b> to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> unless the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is being moved by the motor <b>302</b>. This is due to the ramping of the floor <b>254</b> of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> as described above and best depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>. Thus, until a user presses the actuator <b>309</b> to power the motor <b>302</b>, the bubble solution will not flow to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> and will therefore not be delivered onto the bubble generating apparatus <b>240</b>. This may be preferable because otherwise the bubble solution would begin to drip downwardly from the delivery member <b>252</b> before the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is rotating, which will likely result in much of that bubble solution simply dripping down to the drip tray <b>400</b> rather than being used to load the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. However, in other embodiments as noted above the ramped portion may be omitted so that upon the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> being placed in the upside-down orientation as shown, the bubble solution will flow all the way to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> for delivery to the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>19</b>A</figref>, the paddles <b>290</b> are each supported from above by one of the arm members <b>273</b> of the support member <b>270</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the paddles <b>290</b> are formed from a resilient material, such as for example an elastomeric material, a rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer, or the like. The paddles <b>290</b> may also be formed of other resilient materials, including a flexible plastic, so long as the paddles <b>290</b> are configured to operate/function as described herein. An upper portion <b>291</b> of each of the paddles <b>290</b> is fixed to one of the arm members <b>273</b> and a lower portion of each of the paddles <b>290</b> hangs downwardly from the arm member <b>273</b> without being physically coupled to any other structure. Thus, the paddles <b>290</b> are suspended by the arm members <b>273</b> within the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> of the hub portion <b>251</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b>. In other words, the paddles <b>290</b> are suspended from the arm members <b>273</b> in a cantilevered manner.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The support member <b>270</b> is fixed to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> so as to be static or non-movable relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b>. Thus, the paddles <b>290</b> are also in a fixed position relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b> due to their being coupled directly to one of the arm members <b>273</b> of the support member <b>270</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the paddles <b>290</b> do not rotate during operation but rather they remain fixed as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates as described herein. Thus, the location of the paddles <b>290</b> within the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> changes, but only due to the rotation of the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> and not due to any movement of the paddles <b>290</b>. Of course, in other embodiments the paddles <b>290</b> and the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> may rotate while the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> stays static, in other embodiments the paddles <b>290</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> may rotate in opposite rotational directions while the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> remains static, and in other embodiments the paddles <b>290</b> may rotate while the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> and the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> remain static. Thus, there are variations that are possible in terms of which component is moving/rotating in alternative embodiments while still enabling the apparatus to function as described herein. However, the paddles <b>290</b> and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> should move or rotate relative to one another to facilitate movement of the bubble solution to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Although the paddles <b>290</b> are described as being in a fixed position in the exemplified embodiment and being static relative to the first housing assembly <b>200</b>, it should be appreciated that the paddles <b>290</b> are able to flex and move as the apparatus <b>100</b> is operating. This is because only the upper portions <b>291</b> of the paddles <b>290</b> are affixed to the support member <b>270</b> with the lower portions <b>292</b> of the paddles <b>290</b> hanging freely below the support arms <b>273</b> within the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. This allows the lower portions <b>292</b> of the paddles <b>290</b> to flex or move relative to the upper portions <b>291</b> of the paddles <b>290</b> as the paddles <b>290</b> contact the bubble solution in the storage reservoir <b>253</b> or the floor <b>254</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>, during operation the motor <b>302</b> rotates, which causes the fan device <b>210</b> to rotate and generate an air stream and also causes the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> to rotate. In some embodiments, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> may rotate in a clockwise direction (as shown in the exemplified embodiment), but the invention is not to be so limited and the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> could alternatively rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. As the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the paddles <b>290</b> contact the bubble solution located in the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. The bubble solution is unable to flow up the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> due to its ramped configuration. However, as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the paddles <b>290</b> contact the bubble solution and move (or drive) it upwardly along the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Eventually, the paddles <b>290</b> drive or otherwise move the bubble solution to the terminal end <b>263</b> of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the floor <b>254</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. At such time, the bubble solution flows into the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b> that is located between the stopper wall <b>264</b> and the terminal end <b>263</b> of the second circumferential portion <b>262</b> of the floor <b>254</b> of the second portion <b>258</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>. From the dispensing portion <b>265</b>, the bubble solution readily flows through the opening <b>269</b> in the second annular sidewall <b>256</b> to the delivery reservoir <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Once in the delivery reservoir <b>352</b>, the bubble solution flows out through the apertures <b>354</b> and either: (1) onto one of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b>; or (2) into the drip tray <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">As noted above, during operation the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> is rotating about the rotational axis R<b>1</b>-R<b>1</b>. As the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the delivery member <b>252</b> passes across different ones of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b>. The delivery member <b>252</b> passes over the top of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> in the exemplified embodiment, although the delivery member <b>252</b> could pass beneath the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> in other embodiments as described above. Furthermore, the bubble solution located in the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> of the delivery member <b>252</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>350</b> continuously drips out through the apertures <b>354</b>. Thus, as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> dispenses the bubble solution onto each of the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> in succession. The process continues because as the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> rotates, the paddles <b>290</b> continue to drive or otherwise move the bubble solution into the dispensing portion <b>265</b> of the storage reservoir <b>253</b>, from where the bubble solution flows into the delivery reservoir <b>352</b> for delivery onto the different bubble generating devices <b>241</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As noted above, the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>240</b> are positioned so as to be aligned with the air stream generated by the fan device <b>210</b>.

Then, the bubble solution dispenser <b>250</b> will dispense an additional amount of the bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>241</b> and the process continues indefinitely until either the power source <b>301</b> runs out of power, the user powers the device off (by activating the actuator <b>309</b> a second time), or the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> and the storage reservoir <b>253</b> becomes depleted of bubble solution.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">After use, a user can power the apparatus <b>100</b> off by activating the actuator <b>309</b>. Next, the user detaches the first housing assembly <b>200</b> from the drip tray <b>400</b>. The first housing assembly <b>200</b> can then be washed under a sink faucet or hose as may be desired. The first housing assembly <b>200</b> does not contain or otherwise include any electronic components so washing or rinsing the first housing assembly <b>200</b> does not harm its functionality. Next, the drip tray <b>400</b> is carefully detached from the second housing assembly <b>200</b>. Once detached, a user can pour the bubble solution that was collected in the drip tray <b>400</b> back into the bubble solution bottle <b>500</b> or into another desired location. The drip tray <b>400</b> can then also be washed or rinsed under water. Finally, a user can wipe off the second housing assembly <b>200</b>. The user may not want to wash or rinse the second housing assembly <b>200</b> because it contains all of the electronics for the apparatus <b>100</b>. However, the second housing assembly <b>200</b> can be satisfactorily cleaned by wiping it with a dry or damp cloth, towel, or the like. The second housing assembly <b>300</b> is generally kept away from the bubble solution during use because the bubble solution is only intended to contact the first housing assembly <b>200</b> and the drip tray <b>400</b> and thus there should not be much bubble solution to clean off of the second housing assembly <b>300</b> after use. The apparatus <b>100</b> may then be set aside and stored either as separate components in the disassembled state or in the assembled state after being reassembled.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, an apparatus for generating bubbles <b>1000</b> (hereinafter referred to as the apparatus <b>1000</b>) will be described. The apparatus <b>1000</b> may also be referred to herein as a bubble generating machine. The apparatus <b>1000</b> is designed to generate bubbles from a bubble solution in an automatic fashion by way of moving parts that are operably coupled to a motor. Thus, a bubble solution may be dispensed onto bubble generating devices and then bubbles can be generated from the bubble solution loaded on the bubble generating devices as an air stream flows through the bubble generating devices. In some embodiments, there are no pumps, valves, or other similar types of devices included for facilitating movement of the bubble solution to the bubble generating devices. Thus, the apparatus <b>1000</b> may be devoid of any pumps in some embodiments. Furthermore, in some embodiments a user need not actuate a switch or the like to power on the apparatus <b>1000</b>. Rather, in some embodiments when a container of bubble solution is held by the apparatus <b>1000</b> in an upside down orientation so that the bubble solution is dispensed from the container into the apparatus <b>1000</b>, the apparatus <b>1000</b> is automatically powered on. The details of this functionality will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The apparatus <b>1000</b> comprises a housing <b>1100</b> extending along a longitudinal axis D-D and a drip tray <b>1200</b> that is detachably coupled to the housing <b>1100</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, excess amounts of the bubble solution that are dispensed from the apparatus <b>1000</b> but not loaded onto a bubble generating device will be collected in a collection trough <b>1201</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. The excess bubble solution that is collected in the collection trough <b>1201</b> can later be poured back into a container for reuse. By having the housing <b>1100</b> detachable from the drip tray <b>1200</b>, the drip tray <b>1200</b> can be easily lifted up and tilted to pour the collected excess bubble solution back into a container.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The drip tray <b>1200</b> comprises a floor <b>1202</b>, an outer wall <b>1203</b> protruding from the floor <b>1202</b> along an outer edge of the floor <b>1202</b>, and a drainage member <b>1204</b> protruding from the floor <b>1202</b> in a spaced apart manner from the outer wall <b>1203</b> so that the outer wall <b>1203</b> surrounds the drainage member <b>1204</b>. The space between the inner surface of the outer wall <b>203</b> and the outer surface of the drainage member <b>1204</b> forms the collection trough <b>1201</b>. The collection trough <b>1201</b> has an open top end so that any bubble solution or other fluid collected therein can be readily seen by a user. In this way, a user will readily know when the collection trough <b>1201</b> is becoming full so that the user can shut down the apparatus <b>1000</b> to pour the bubble solution from the collection trough <b>1201</b> back into a container.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The drainage member <b>1204</b> extends from the floor <b>1202</b> to a distal surface <b>1205</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the drainage member <b>1204</b> is not centered along the floor <b>1202</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. Rather, the drainage member <b>1204</b> is offset from a centerpoint of the floor <b>1202</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. As a result, the housing <b>1100</b> does not block visual access to the collection trough <b>1201</b>. Rather, a user could look down onto the apparatus <b>1000</b> from above and some of the collection trough <b>1201</b> would be visible. Thus, a line of sight exists from a top of the apparatus <b>1000</b> to the collection trough <b>1201</b> from a top plan view. Stated another way, the drip tray <b>1200</b> and the housing <b>1100</b> have different footprints which permits ready user visualization of any fluids collected in the collection trough. The drip tray <b>1200</b> comprises a pour spout <b>1209</b> along the outer wall <b>1203</b> to allow for easy pouring of the bubble solution collected in the collection trough <b>1201</b> back into a container or the like.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Furthermore, the drainage member <b>1204</b> comprises a plurality of connection members <b>1206</b> extending from the distal surface <b>1205</b> in a spaced apart manner. In the exemplified embodiment, the connection members <b>1206</b> are arranged circumferentially around the outer surface of the drainage member <b>1204</b> and protrude upwardly away from the distal surface <b>1205</b>. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment each of the connection members <b>1206</b> defines a receiving cavity for receiving a component of the housing <b>1100</b> to couple the housing <b>1100</b> to the drip tray <b>1200</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the exemplified embodiment, the drainage member <b>1204</b> has a plurality of inclined drainage surface <b>1207</b> in the space between each pair of adjacent connection members <b>1206</b>. Specifically, the outer surface of the drainage member <b>1204</b> is sloped between the adjacent connection members <b>1206</b> to facilitate the flow of any excess amounts of the bubble solution down the inclined drainage surfaces <b>1207</b> and into the collection trough <b>1201</b>. The inclined drainage surfaces <b>1207</b> are inclined in a downward direction from the distal surface <b>1205</b> of the drainage member <b>1204</b> towards the collection trough <b>1201</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The housing <b>1100</b> comprises an outer annular wall <b>1101</b> having an outer surface <b>1102</b> that forms an exposed outer surface of the housing <b>1100</b> and an inner surface <b>1103</b> that surrounds or defines an internal cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. A lower portion of the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> terminates in a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart connection members <b>1105</b> that are configured to engage or otherwise interact with the connection members <b>1206</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b> to couple the housing <b>1100</b> to the drip tray <b>1200</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the connection members <b>1105</b> are protuberances that are received within the receiving cavities of the connection members <b>1206</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. Of course, in alternative embodiments an opposite arrangement could be used whereby the connection members <b>1206</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b> are received within cavities of the connection members <b>1105</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. Moreover, other structures and modifications could be used in other embodiment so long as it facilitates a detachable coupling between the housing <b>1100</b> and the drip tray <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the exemplified embodiment, the coupling of the connection members <b>1105</b> of the housing <b>1100</b> to the connection members <b>1206</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b> creates an interference fit or a frictional fit to couple the housing <b>1100</b> to the drip tray <b>1200</b>. The interference fit should be sufficiently snug and tight so that a user can lift the apparatus <b>1000</b> by gripping only the housing <b>1100</b> such that the drip tray <b>1200</b> remains coupled to the housing <b>1100</b>. In other embodiments, fasteners such as screws, bolts, or the like could be used to facilitate the coupling of the housing <b>1100</b> to the drip tray <b>1200</b>. However, the friction fit may be desirable in some embodiments because it allows for an easy detachment of the housing <b>1100</b> from the drip tray <b>1200</b> for cleaning and to pour any bubble solution collected in the collection trough <b>1201</b> back into a container or bottle for storage or re-use. In other embodiments, the connection members may be located along the longitudinal axis D-D rather than circumferentially surrounding the longitudinal axis D-D as with the exemplified embodiment. Various permutations and modifications to the connection members <b>1105</b>, <b>1206</b> may be possible in alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">When the housing <b>1100</b> is coupled to the drip tray <b>1200</b> in the manner described herein, a plurality of air inlet openings <b>1106</b> are formed in the spaces between the connection members <b>1105</b>, <b>1206</b>. The air inlet openings <b>1106</b> allow for ambient air to be pulled into the internal cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b> for purposes of generating an air stream that can be used to generate bubbles from the bubble solution loaded on the bubble generating devices. In the exemplified embodiment, each of the air inlet openings <b>1106</b> is a closed-geometry shaped opening (more specifically, oval in the exemplified embodiment although any other shape could be formed) that is bounded by an edge of two adjacent ones of the connection members <b>1105</b> of the housing <b>1100</b> and an edge of two adjacent ones of the connection members <b>1206</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. Thus, the edges of the connection members <b>1105</b>, <b>1206</b> define the air inlet openings <b>1106</b>. The inclined drainage surfaces <b>1207</b> are located along or adjacent to a bottom of each of the air inlet openings <b>1106</b> such that the excess fluid can flow through the air inlet openings <b>1106</b> and down along the inclined drainage surfaces <b>1207</b> to the collection trough <b>1201</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The apparatus <b>1000</b> further comprises a motor <b>1300</b> positioned in the internal cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>, a fan device <b>1310</b> operably coupled to the motor <b>1300</b> so that the motor can rotate the fan device <b>1310</b> to generate an air stream, a bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> comprising at least one, and more specifically a plurality of bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>, a bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> that dispenses the bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>, and a support member <b>1450</b> for supporting a container <b>1500</b> containing a store of bubble solution <b>1501</b> therein. In the exemplified embodiment, the apparatus <b>1000</b> also comprises a power source <b>1550</b>, which in the exemplified embodiment comprises a plurality of batteries. In other embodiments, the apparatus <b>1000</b> may include a power cord that is configured to be plugged into a wall socket to supply power to the electronic devices of the apparatus <b>1000</b>. Furthermore, other types of power sources can be used and the invention is not limited to batteries and AC power from a socket as noted herein. In the exemplified embodiment, the apparatus also comprises a screen member <b>1600</b> positioned to prevent a user from placing fingers or the like into contact with the fan device <b>1310</b> particularly while it is operating and spinning at high speeds. In the exemplified embodiment, the screen member <b>1600</b> is positioned between the fan device <b>1310</b> and the dip tray <b>1200</b> so that even if a user is able to extend his/her fingers through the air inlet openings <b>1106</b>, the user will not be able to contact the fan device <b>1310</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The fan device <b>1310</b> comprises a hub portion <b>1311</b> and a plurality of blades <b>1312</b> extending outwardly from the hub portion <b>1311</b> to generate an air stream when the fan device <b>1310</b> is rotated. In the exemplified embodiment, the fan device <b>1310</b> comprises three of the blades <b>1312</b>, although more or less blades could be used in other embodiments. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the fan device <b>1310</b> is not limited to being a fan in all embodiments, but can be any device that is configured to generate an air stream when it is powered on. Thus, the fan device <b>1310</b> may be any type of air generator, air flow generator, air stream generator, or the like. In the exemplified embodiment, the fan device <b>1310</b> is coupled to a first shaft <b>1301</b> of the motor <b>1300</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the fan device <b>1310</b> is coupled directly to the motor <b>1300</b> with no intervening gears or the like. Thus, the fan device <b>1310</b> will rotate at the same rotational speed (rotations per minute) as the motor <b>1300</b>. This ensures that a sufficiently viable air stream is generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> to ensure that it is capable of generating bubbles from the bubble solution <b>1501</b> loaded onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. Of course, in other embodiments gears may be coupled to the fan device <b>1310</b> and the motor <b>1300</b> to either speed up or slow down the rotational speed (e.g., revolutions per minute) of the fan device <b>1310</b> as compared to the rotational speed of the motor <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> comprises a plurality of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> as noted above. Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> comprises a hub portion <b>1322</b>, a plurality of arms <b>1323</b> extending radially from the hub portion <b>1322</b> in a spaced apart manner, and the plurality of bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> each coupled to an end of one of the arms <b>1323</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, each of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> is an annular-shaped structure having an inner surface <b>1324</b> that surrounds a central aperture <b>1325</b>. Furthermore, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> comprise a plurality of ribs or ridges <b>1326</b> protruding from the inner surface <b>1324</b> in a spaced apart manner. The ridges <b>1326</b> assist in loading bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>. Specifically, when a bubble solution is dripped onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> or the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> are dipped into a reservoir of bubble solution, the bubble solution adheres to the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> along the ridges <b>1326</b> on the inner surface <b>1324</b>. The bubble solution will then extend across the central aperture <b>1325</b>, thereby forming a film of the bubble solution that fills in the space defined by the inner surface <b>1324</b> of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>. When the bubble solution adheres to the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>, those bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> are considered to be loaded with the bubble solution.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the exemplified embodiment, the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> is operably coupled to a second shaft <b>1302</b> of the motor <b>1300</b>. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> rotates about a rotational axis during use of the apparatus <b>1000</b>. However, in other embodiments the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> may be static/fixed rather than rotating and other features may rotate (specifically, the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>) to ensure that the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> become loaded with the bubble solution. Turning back to the exemplified embodiment, the bubble generating assembly <b>1321</b> is indirectly coupled to the motor <b>1300</b> by a gear assembly <b>1330</b>. The gear assembly <b>1330</b> is designed to slow down the rotational speed of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> relative to the motor <b>1300</b> so that the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> rotates at a slower rotational speed than the motor <b>1300</b>. Thus, the gear assembly <b>1330</b> operates as a speed reducer such that the output gear (the gear furthest from the motor <b>1302</b>) rotates more slowly than the input gear (the gear closest to the motor <b>1300</b>). The exact configuration and arrangement of the gear assembly <b>1330</b> including the number and size of the gears thereof, is not to be limiting of the invention in all embodiments.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">It should be appreciated that in the exemplified embodiment the motor <b>1300</b> controls the movement/rotation of both the fan device <b>1310</b> and the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. In other embodiments, there may be separate motors for controlling rotation of the fan device <b>1310</b> and the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. In still other embodiments, the motor <b>1300</b> may control rotation of the fan device <b>1310</b> but the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> may not rotate. Thus, various modifications to the exemplary embodiment exist and may fall within the scope of the claimed invention. In the exemplified embodiment, it should be appreciated that the rotational axis of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>, the rotational axis of the motor <b>1300</b>, and the rotational axis of the fan device <b>1310</b> are all the same as one another as the same as the longitudinal axis D-D of the housing <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b> and <b>24</b></figref>, the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> and the support member <b>1450</b> will be further described. The bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> comprises a main body portion <b>1401</b> and at least one delivery member <b>1410</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the main body portion <b>1401</b> comprises a floor <b>1402</b> and a sidewall <b>1403</b> extending upwardly from the floor <b>1402</b> so that the floor <b>1402</b> and the sidewall <b>1403</b> collectively define a holding reservoir <b>1404</b>. The holding reservoir <b>1404</b> is generally sized and shaped so as to be able to hold a container of bubble solution therein in an upside-down orientation so that the bubble solution contained in the container can be poured into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates the container <b>1500</b> of bubble solution positioned in the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> in the upside-down orientation.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The at least one delivery member <b>1410</b> extends from the main body portion <b>1401</b> and into or at least into alignment with the interior cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. Thus, the at least one delivery member <b>1410</b> is suspended or cantilevered over the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. Thus, as the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> rotates, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> thereof become aligned with the delivery member <b>1410</b> one at a time so that they can become loaded with the bubble solution as described herein. The at least one delivery member <b>1410</b> comprises a floor <b>1411</b> and a sidewall <b>1412</b> extending upwardly from the floor <b>1411</b> so that the floor <b>1411</b> and the sidewall <b>1412</b> collectively define a delivery reservoir <b>1413</b>. The at least one delivery member <b>1410</b> comprises at least one slit <b>1414</b> (or opening) therein so that bubble solution can fall through the slit for delivery onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The delivery reservoir <b>1413</b> is in fluid communication with the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> so that fluid (such as the bubble solution) in the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> will flow to the delivery reservoir <b>1413</b> where it is eventually dispensed or delivered through the slit <b>1414</b> and onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> as noted above. As described in greater detail below, as the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> is rotated by the motor <b>1300</b>, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> become aligned with and positioned just beneath the delivery member <b>1410</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>. Furthermore, the bubble solution continuously falls through the slit <b>1414</b> so that the at least one delivery member <b>1410</b> drops the bubble solution onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> as they rotate past the delivery member <b>1410</b> to load the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> with the bubble solution. As the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> continues to be rotated by the motor <b>1300</b>, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> become aligned with the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> so that the bubble solution loaded onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> is converted into bubbles.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>24</b></figref>, additional structural details of the housing <b>1100</b> will be provided. The housing <b>1100</b> comprises the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> as previously noted, with the inner surface <b>1103</b> of the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> defining the interior cavity <b>1104</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the motor <b>1300</b>, the fan device <b>1310</b>, the bubble generating device <b>1320</b>, and the gear assembly <b>1330</b> are all positioned within the interior cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. However, in other embodiments one or more of these components may be located external of the interior cavity <b>1104</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. The power source <b>1550</b> may be positioned within the housing <b>1100</b> or external to it in various different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The housing <b>1100</b> also comprises a first inner annular wall <b>1120</b> that is spaced radially inward of the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> and a second inner annular wall <b>1130</b> that is spaced radially inward of the first inner annular wall <b>1120</b>. The first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b> are connected to one another by a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart fins <b>1115</b> for structural rigidity and for managing airflow and reducing turbulence with regard to the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b>. The space between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b> forms an air flow passageway <b>1125</b> through which the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> flows. The air flow passageway <b>1125</b> is essentially the only opening that leads from the fan device <b>1310</b> upward so substantially all (i.e., 95% or more) of the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> is forced through the air flow passageway <b>1125</b>. The air flow passageway <b>1125</b> is an annular passageway that surrounds the longitudinal axis D-D of the housing <b>1100</b>. However, in the exemplified embodiment the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> does not extend a full 360&#xb0; around the longitudinal axis D-D. Rather, the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> extends approximately between 180&#xb0; and 300&#xb0;, more specifically between 180&#xb0; and 280&#xb0;, more specifically between 180&#xb0; and 250&#xb0; around the longitudinal axis D-D with the remainder being a closed space that facilitates flow of excess fluid into the collection trough <b>1201</b> as described in greater detail below. The air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> generally flows upward through the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> and through the central apertures <b>1325</b> of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>. Thus, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, the central apertures of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> are aligned with the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> and remain aligned with the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> as the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> rotates about the rotational axis as described herein.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The space between the first inner annular wall <b>1120</b> and the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> forms an excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b> through which excess amounts of the bubble solution can flow into the collection trough <b>1201</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. The first inner annular wall <b>1120</b> is attached to the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> along a bottom edge of the first inner annular wall <b>1120</b> to form a floor <b>1127</b> of the excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b>. Furthermore, a plurality of openings <b>1128</b> are formed into the floor <b>1127</b> of the excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b> so that the excess bubble solution can flow therethrough and into the collection trough <b>1201</b>. The openings <b>1128</b> are circumferentially spaced apart in the exemplified embodiment, but could be a single elongated opening in other embodiments so long as an opening exists for the excess bubble solution to flow out of the excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b> and into the collection trough <b>1201</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a cross-sectional area of the excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b> continuously increases moving in a direction from the collection trough <b>1201</b> to a distal end <b>1111</b> of the housing <b>1100</b>. This occurs in the exemplified embodiment due to the outer annular wall <b>1101</b> being angled/inclined whereas the first inner annular wall <b>1120</b> is vertical. By varying the cross-sectional area of the excess fluid passageway <b>1126</b> in this way, any excess fluid flowing therethrough is forced to the floor <b>1127</b> and through the openings <b>1128</b> therein so that it can flow into the collection trough <b>1201</b> below. This flow of the excess amounts of the bubble solution will be described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>, <b>33</b>A, and <b>33</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B</figref>, the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> and the support member <b>1450</b> will be described in greater detail. In the exemplified embodiment, the support member <b>1450</b> is pivotably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>. Thus, the support member <b>1450</b> can be pivoted or rotated relative to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> (and relative to the housing <b>1100</b> because the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> is fixedly coupled to the housing <b>1100</b> in the exemplified embodiment) about an axis E-E that is perpendicular to and non-coplanar with the longitudinal axis D-D of the housing <b>1100</b>.

Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> comprises a switch <b>1415</b> located along the sidewall <b>1403</b> of the main body portion <b>1401</b> (the switch <b>1415</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>). In other embodiments, the switch <b>1415</b> could be located on the floor <b>1402</b> or at other locations without affecting the functionality of the apparatus <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, the switch <b>1415</b> may be the only switch provided on the apparatus <b>1000</b> for powering the motor <b>1300</b>. Thus, the switch <b>1415</b> may be alterable between an open state in which the power source <b>1550</b> is not operably coupled to the motor <b>1300</b> (i.e., a circuit between the power source <b>1550</b> and the motor <b>1300</b> is open) and a closed state in which the power source <b>1550</b> is operably coupled to the motor <b>1300</b> to cause the motor <b>1300</b> to rotate about the rotational axis as described herein. Specifically, when the switch <b>1415</b> is in the open state the motor <b>1300</b> is not powered and when the switch <b>1415</b> is in the closed stat the motor <b>1300</b> is powered. Thus, the switch <b>1415</b> operates as a power button for the apparatus <b>1000</b>. As noted above, in the exemplified embodiment the switch <b>1415</b> is the only power button on the apparatus <b>1000</b>, and thus actuation of the switch <b>1415</b> is required to operate the apparatus <b>1000</b> and is the only manner in which the apparatus <b>1000</b> may be powered on.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the exemplified embodiment, the switch <b>1415</b> is a momentary-type switch. Thus, the switch <b>1415</b> is biased into an open state such that no power is transmitted from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b>. Stated another way, the switch <b>1415</b> is normally open and is only closed when the switch <b>1415</b> is being actuated or engaged or pressed. In a momentary-type switch, a force must be applied onto the switch to close the switch and supply power to the motor <b>1300</b> and a cessation or release of the force causes the switch <b>1415</b> to bias back into the open (or off) state. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment when a force is applied onto the switch <b>1415</b> power is transmitted to the motor <b>1300</b> and when no force is applied onto the switch <b>1415</b> no power is transmitted to the motor <b>1300</b>. Of course, in other embodiments the switch <b>1415</b> may be an alternate action switch (such as a flip switch, a toggle switch, or the like), whereby the switch must be &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; to be altered into a continuous on/off state. In such embodiments, in one position of the switch the switch is closed and power is transmitted to the motor <b>1300</b> an in another position of the switch the switch is open and no power is transmitted to the motor <b>1300</b>. While both different types of switches may be used, in the exemplary embodiment the switch <b>1415</b> is a momentary-type switch and it is biased into the open state (i.e., a normally open momentary-type switch) such that no power is transmitted from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b> unless a force is applied onto the switch <b>1415</b> to actuate the switch <b>1415</b> into the closed state.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The support member <b>1450</b> comprises an upstanding wall <b>1451</b> having a front opening <b>1452</b> through which a container of bubble solution may be passed. The upstanding wall <b>1451</b> has an arcuate shape but extends for only part of a ring or loop, thereby leaving the front opening <b>1452</b> open. The upstanding wall <b>1451</b> comprises an inner surface <b>1453</b> that defines a support cavity <b>1454</b> within which a portion of the container <b>1500</b> of bubble solution can be supported. Furthermore, there is a ledge <b>1455</b> extending from the inner surface <b>1453</b> of the upstanding wall <b>1451</b> into the support cavity <b>1454</b> for purposes of supporting the container <b>1500</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the ledge <b>1455</b> comprises a plurality of spaced apart ledge segments, although a singular continuous ledge member could be used in other embodiments. When the container <b>1500</b> is supported by the support member <b>1450</b>, a protrusion on the neck of the container <b>1500</b> is typically supported atop of the ledge <b>1455</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. Furthermore, the upstanding wall <b>1451</b> is somewhat flexible, such that it flexes outwardly as the container <b>1500</b> is being inserted into the support cavity <b>1454</b> and then snaps back into a tight fit against the container <b>1500</b> to hold it in place.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The support member <b>1450</b> further comprises an actuation member <b>1460</b> that is configured to actuate the switch <b>1415</b> on the bubble solution dispenser <b>1450</b> when the support member <b>1450</b> is in the dispensing position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>. In the exemplified embodiment, the actuation member <b>1460</b> comprises a flexible tab <b>1461</b> that is formed by a U-shaped slit <b>1462</b> extending through the upstanding wall <b>1451</b>. Thus, the flexible tab <b>1461</b> is able to flex inwardly into the support cavity <b>1454</b> and outwardly away from the support cavity <b>1454</b> in response to forces acting thereon. In the exemplified embodiment, the flexible tab <b>1461</b> comprises a body portion <b>1463</b>, a first tab portion <b>1464</b> that protrudes from an inner surface of the upstanding wall <b>1453</b> and into the support cavity <b>1454</b>, and a second tab portion <b>1465</b> that protrudes from an outer surface of the upstanding wall <b>1453</b> in a direction away from the support cavity <b>1454</b>. In some embodiments, the switch <b>1415</b> and the actuation member <b>1460</b> may be collectively referred to herein as an actuation assembly.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As described in greater detail below, when the container <b>1500</b> is being supported by the support member <b>1450</b>, the container <b>1500</b> contacts the first tab portion <b>1464</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> and flexes the flexible tab <b>1461</b> radially outward in a direction away from the support cavity <b>1454</b>. Specifically because the first tab portion <b>1464</b> protrudes into the support cavity <b>1454</b>, when the container <b>1500</b> is disposed within the support cavity <b>1454</b> the container <b>1500</b> contacts the first tab portion <b>1464</b> and presses it outwardly. This causes the second tab portion <b>1465</b> to extend further from the outer surface of the upstanding wall <b>1455</b>. Thus, when there is no container in the support cavity <b>1454</b>, the flexible tab <b>1461</b> is in its biased state whereby the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> extends a first distance from an outer surface of the upstanding wall <b>1451</b>. When the container <b>1500</b> is located in the support cavity <b>1454</b> and supported by the support member <b>1450</b>, the flexible tab <b>1461</b> is flexed outwardly so that the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> extends a second distance from the outer surface of the upstanding wall <b>1451</b>, with the second distance being greater than the first distance.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the exemplified embodiment, the outward flexing of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> when the container <b>1500</b> is being supported by the support member <b>1450</b> is what causes the flexible tab <b>1461</b> of the actuation member <b>1460</b> to actuate the switch <b>1415</b>. Specifically, in some embodiments when the support member <b>1450</b> is not supporting a container, putting the support member <b>1450</b> into the dispensing position will not result in the actuation member <b>1460</b> actuating the switch <b>1415</b>. This is because in such embodiments when the container <b>1500</b> is not supported by the support member <b>1450</b>, the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> does not protrude far enough from the upstanding wall <b>1451</b> to engage the switch <b>1415</b>. However, when the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b>, putting the support member <b>1450</b> into the dispensing position will result in the actuation member <b>1460</b> actuating the switch <b>1415</b>. Specifically, because the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> extends further from the upstanding wall <b>1451</b> when the container <b>1500</b> is located in the support cavity <b>1454</b>, the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> is able to contact/engage the switch <b>1415</b> with a sufficient force to actuate the switch <b>1415</b> and power the apparatus <b>1000</b> on.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Thus, in some embodiments the apparatus <b>1000</b> is only powered on when: (1) the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> and the support member <b>1450</b> is in the dispensing position; or (2) a user manually presses the switch <b>1415</b>. However, because the switch <b>1415</b> is a momentary type switch in the exemplified embodiment, requiring a user to have a continuous hold on the switch <b>1415</b> during operation is undesirable. Thus, having the support member <b>1450</b> achieve the actuation of the switch <b>1415</b> is desirable. This also ensures that any time the container <b>1500</b> is supported by the support member <b>1450</b> in the dispensing position so it is dispensing the bubble solution into the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>, the apparatus <b>1000</b> is powered on, thereby preventing the bubble solution from simply flowing into the housing <b>1100</b> during times of non-operation. To state it succinctly, anytime that the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> in the dispensing position (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>B, <b>28</b>, and <b>29</b></figref>), the switch <b>1415</b> will be actuated into the closed state and power will be transmitted from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B</figref>, illustrations are provided showing the container <b>1500</b> being inserted into the support cavity <b>1454</b> of the support member <b>1450</b>. Specifically, the container <b>1500</b> is inserted through the front opening <b>1452</b> in the upstanding wall <b>1451</b>. As the container <b>1500</b> is so inserted, the upstanding wall <b>1451</b> may flex slightly to enable the container <b>1500</b> to be fully inserted into the support cavity <b>1454</b>. Furthermore, once the container <b>1500</b> is snapped into the support cavity <b>1454</b>, the container <b>1500</b> presses on the flexible tab <b>1461</b> of the actuation member <b>1460</b> and pushes the second tab portion <b>1465</b> thereof outwardly, as shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>27</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>1000</b> is illustrated in a perspective view and various cross-sectional views with the support member <b>1450</b> in the non-dispensing position. The support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> as previously described and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>. As noted, when the support member <b>1450</b> is in the non-dispensing position, the bubble solution container <b>1500</b> is substantially upright. As used herein, the term substantially upright indicates a position whereby the bubble solution container <b>1500</b> cannot dispense the bubble solution contained therein by gravity alone. Thus, the term substantially upright may be somewhat dependent on the amount of bubble solution contained therein, because a container can be tilted more without spilling its contents when it contains a lower volume of the contents. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;substantially upright&#x201d; includes the container <b>1500</b> being oriented so that its longitudinal axis F-F is at an angle of between 45&#xb0; and 135&#xb0; relative to a horizontal plane with its top dispensing end <b>1502</b> facing away from a ground surface (the ground surface being any surface upon which the apparatus <b>1000</b> is resting during normal use and operation of the apparatus <b>1000</b>).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>27</b></figref>, when the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> in the non-dispensing position, the switch <b>1415</b> is not being actuated. Thus, in embodiments whereby the switch <b>1415</b> is a momentary switch, the switch <b>1415</b> is in its &#x201c;off&#x201d; state or open state such that no power is being transmitted from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b>. Similar results can be achieved when the switch <b>1415</b> is an alternate action switch.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>30</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>1000</b> is illustrated in a perspective view and various cross-sectional views with the support member <b>1450</b> supporting the container <b>1500</b> and being in the dispensing position. In the exemplified embodiment, the support member <b>1450</b> is pivotably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment altering the support member <b>1450</b> from the non-dispensing position to the dispensing position comprises rotating or pivoting the support member <b>1450</b> about the axis E-E. Of course, in other embodiments the support member <b>1450</b> may be slidably coupled to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> so as to be slid between the dispensing and non-dispensing positions. In still other embodiments, the support member <b>1450</b> may not be attached to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> at all, but may instead simply be placed into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> when desired for use.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">When the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> and altered into the dispensing position, the bubble solution <b>1501</b> begins to flow out of the container <b>1500</b> and into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> of the bubble solution dispenser and from the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> into the delivery reservoir <b>1413</b> of the delivery member <b>1410</b>. This is because the container <b>1500</b> is in an upside-down or substantially upside-down orientation whereby a dispensing end of the container <b>1500</b> is facing downward. The container <b>1500</b> need not be completely vertical and upside-down, but rather needs to be positioned and oriented in such a manner that the bubble solution <b>1501</b> will readily flow out of the container <b>1500</b> and into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">From the delivery reservoir <b>1413</b>, the bubble solution flows out of the slit <b>1414</b> and onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. Furthermore, when the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> in the dispensing position, the motor <b>1300</b> is operating and rotating. Thus, the fan device <b>1310</b> and the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> are also rotating about a rotational axis R<b>2</b>-R<b>2</b> due to their operable coupling to the motor <b>1300</b>. Thus, as the bubble solution becomes loaded on the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> rotate into alignment with the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> so that the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> blows through the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> and converts the bubble solution into bubbles.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">As noted above, when the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> and is in the dispensing position, the switch <b>1415</b> is automatically actuated into the closed state and the motor <b>1300</b> is powered. In the exemplified embodiment, this occurs as follows. When the support member <b>1450</b> is altered, pivoted, rotated, or the like into the dispensing position, the second tab portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> contacts the switch <b>1415</b> and presses against the switch <b>1415</b>. This pressure/force applied onto the switch <b>1414</b> alters the switch <b>1415</b> from its biased/normal open state to a closed state, which in turn causes power from the power source <b>1550</b> to be transmitted to the motor <b>1300</b>. As noted above, the container <b>1500</b> is in contact with the first tab portion <b>1464</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b>, which prevents the flexible tab <b>1461</b> from simply flexing away from the switch <b>1415</b> but instead ensures that the second portion <b>1465</b> of the flexible tab <b>1461</b> will contact the switch <b>1415</b> with sufficient force to actuate the switch <b>1415</b> into the closed state. Thus, anytime the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> and is altered into the dispensing position, the switch <b>1415</b> will be actuated into the closed state to supply power from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b> to initiate operation of the apparatus <b>1000</b>. This ensures bubble solution is not flowing out of the container <b>1500</b> and into the apparatus <b>1000</b> without the apparatus <b>1000</b> and motor <b>1300</b> being powered on.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">It should be noted that opposite motion/movement of the support member <b>1450</b> relative to the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> has the opposite effect in that it alters the switch <b>1415</b> from the closed state (i.e., on state) to the open state (i.e., off state). Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment, altering or pivoting the support member <b>1450</b> from the dispensing position to the non-dispensing position will remove contact between the actuation member <b>1460</b> and the switch <b>1415</b>, which will cause the switch <b>1415</b> to alter into the open state (when the switch <b>1415</b> is a momentary-type switch). In other embodiments where the switch <b>1415</b> is an alternate action switch, the action of moving the support member <b>1450</b> from the dispensing position to the non-dispensing position will toggle the switch <b>1415</b> (rather than simply removing force from being applied onto the switch) to alter the switch <b>1415</b> from the closed state to the open state. In either case, altering/pivoting the support member <b>1450</b> from the dispensing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>) to the non-dispensing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) will alter the switch from the closed state (on state) to the open state (off state) so that power is no longer transmitted from the power source <b>1550</b> to the motor <b>1300</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A, <b>31</b>B, and <b>32</b></figref>, operation of the apparatus <b>1000</b> to generate bubbles will be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B</figref>, the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting or holding the container <b>1500</b> with the container <b>1500</b> containing a supply of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> and the support member <b>1450</b> is in the dispensing position. Thus, the bubble solution <b>1501</b> flows out of the container <b>1500</b> and into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> and from the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> into the dispensing reservoir <b>1413</b>. From the dispensing reservoir <b>1413</b>, the bubble solution <b>1501</b> flows through the slit <b>1414</b> where it is dispensed onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> of the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b>. Furthermore, as noted above, when the support member <b>1450</b> is supporting the container <b>1500</b> and is in the dispensing position, the switch <b>1415</b> is actuated into the closed state. Thus, as the bubble solution <b>1501</b> is being dispensed onto the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> (and the bubble generating assembly <b>1320</b> as a whole) is rotating about the rotational axis R<b>2</b>-R<b>2</b> and the fan device <b>1310</b> is rotating about the rotational axis R<b>2</b>-R<b>2</b>. Thus, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> rotate into alignment with the delivery member <b>1410</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> to become loaded with the bubble solution <b>1501</b>(see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>) and then continue to rotate into alignment with the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> so that the air stream generated by the fan device <b>1310</b> can pass through the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> and generate bubbles <b>1505</b> from the bubble solution <b>1501</b> loaded thereon.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B</figref>, as the above operation is taking place, excess amounts of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> is falling into the collection trough <b>1201</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b>. Specifically, a continuous flow of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> is made to flow through the slit <b>1414</b> in the delivery member <b>1410</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>. Furthermore, the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b> are arranged in a circumferentially spaced apart manner such that there are gaps between adjacent ones of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>. Thus, a portion of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> will be dispensed from the delivery member <b>1410</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> but will not be loaded onto one of the bubble generating devices <b>1321</b>. Instead, this portion of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> will be collected in the collection reservoir <b>1201</b> of the drip tray <b>1200</b> so that it can be poured back into the container <b>1500</b> for re-use.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>, <b>33</b>A, and <b>33</b>B</figref>, the flow of the excess amounts of the bubble solution <b>1501</b> that are dispensed from the delivery member <b>1410</b> but not loaded onto any of the bubble generating members <b>1321</b> will be described. The housing <b>1100</b> comprises at least one funneling reservoir <b>1160</b> located between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, there are two of the funneling reservoirs <b>1160</b>.

The raised platform <b>1150</b>, the funneling reservoirs <b>1160</b>, and the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> are collectively arranged along a loop or ring extending between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b>. Thus, the funneling reservoirs <b>1160</b> and the air flow passageway <b>1125</b> are located along a reference cylinder or a reference ring that is located between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Each of the funneling reservoirs <b>1160</b> is defined between a portion of the first inner annular wall <b>1120</b>, a portion of the second inner annular wall <b>1130</b>, a first upstanding wall <b>1161</b> extending between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b>, and a second upstanding wall <b>1162</b> extending between the first and second inner annular walls <b>1120</b>, <b>1130</b>. The first and second upstanding walls <b>1161</b>, <b>1162</b> are circumferentially spaced apart from one another.

If any of the excess bubble solution <b>1501</b> flows onto the distal surface <b>1205</b> of the drainage member <b>1204</b>, it will flow downwardly towards the air flow passageways <b>1106</b> and down along the inclined drainage surfaces <b>1207</b>. The distal surface <b>1205</b> of the drainage member <b>1204</b> may be inclined from a centerpoint to an outer edge to facilitate this flow direction for the excess bubble solution.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>B</figref>, an alternative mechanism for actuating the switch <b>1415</b> will be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>B</figref>, the apparatus <b>1000</b> is exactly as has been described above, except the support member <b>1450</b> may be omitted. In this embodiment the container <b>1500</b> containing the bubble solution can simply be placed upside-down into the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> instead of it being held by the support member <b>1450</b> and pivoted into position. Because the support member <b>1450</b> is not used in this embodiment, the actuation member <b>1460</b> may not be used to actuate the switch <b>1415</b>. Rather, in this embodiment the container <b>1500</b> comprises an actuation member <b>1560</b> thereon. The actuation member <b>1560</b> may be formed as an integral part of the container <b>1500</b> or it may be formed on a collar or lid that is coupled to the container <b>1500</b>. In any case, when the container <b>1500</b> is placed in an upside-down orientation within the holding reservoir <b>1404</b> of the bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b>, the actuation member <b>1560</b> will engage and actuate the switch <b>1415</b> in the same manner as this was accomplished by the actuation member <b>1460</b> in the previously described embodiment. This will cause the apparatus <b>1000</b> to operate with various features rotating as noted above. The bubble solution dispenser <b>1400</b> and/or the container <b>1500</b> may also have alignment features in this embodiment to ensure that the container <b>1500</b> is positioned in an appropriate orientation so that the actuation member <b>1560</b> engages the switch <b>1415</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range.
