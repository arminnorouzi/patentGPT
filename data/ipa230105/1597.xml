Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to computer numeric controlled (CNC) multi-ply cutting machines that uses a knife that reciprocates and rotates as a tool for cutting garment parts from multi-ply fabrics. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a swivel assembly for a the knife in a CNC multi-ply cutting machine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer numeric controlled machines may use a knife as a cutting tool for automated cutting of garment parts from stacked layers of fabric. An exemplary cutting tool for automated cutting of garment parts is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,360,639 to Gerber Technology, Inc. on Mar. 26, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A well-known usage of such a machine is the computer automation for precise cutting of multi-ply fabrics. Typically, a knife blade is positioned within a rotatable knife holder, and is operated by a crankshaft and a motor to cut a variety of intricate shapes from layers of fabric. Generally, the knife and knife holder are positioned within a cutter tube, and the knife holder and crankshaft are connected by a connecting rod. The knife holder and connecting rod are attached to each other by a swivel joint, which allows the knife and cutter tube to rotate while the connecting rod remains in a fixed orientation while reciprocating.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A drawback of prior art swivel assemblies is that the parts wear. As the parts wear, a significant amount of noise can occur due to reciprocating at high speeds such as 4,000 rpm. Furthermore, the mass of the swivel assembly subjects the components to significant forces resulting in the deformation and wear of these components. This also causes the quality of the fabric cut to degrade. As a result of the excessive noise and/or poor performance from worn components, the swivel assemblies are changed quite frequently.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cutting machine <b>100</b> is illustrated including a cutter tube <b>112</b> for holding a reciprocating and rotating knife assembly <b>114</b>. The knife assembly <b>114</b> vertically slides into and is held by the cutter tube <b>112</b>. A theta motor <b>110</b> rotates the cutter tube <b>112</b>, and thereby positions the knife of the knife assembly <b>114</b> into a desired orientation. The knife assembly <b>114</b> also couples to a twist joint <b>116</b> that reciprocates in a linear motion as driven by a Lanchester arrangement <b>102</b>. The prior art relies on a heat treatment and nitride coating to control component wear and the level of noise.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art for a swivel joint assembly having a reduced level of force interaction to extend the longevity of the swivel joint and decrease noise output. It will be appreciated that the CNC multi-ply cutting machines used with the prior art may be retrofitted to employ a new swivel knife holder assembly in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The objective of the disclosure is to provide a swivel assembly for a multi-ply cutter that reduces the level of noise output and overall wear and tear. The level of noise output is reduced through the reduction of radial and vertical clearance, which results in the reduction of overall backlash, chatter causing noise and wear.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment, the swivel knife holder assembly includes a shoulder screw defining an axis, and having a proximal threaded end and a distal head, and mounted on the shoulder screw is a bobbin assembly. The swivel knife holder assembly also includes a shell defining an interior, and having a distal opening and a proximal opening. A core is secured in the interior and is coupled to a knife for cutting fabric material. The proximal opening of the shell is defined by a flange and houses the shoulder screw therein. A stem threadably couples to the proximal threaded end of the shoulder screw. The stem secures the bobbin assembly within the shell and also includes a mounting surface for engaging a reciprocating drive mechanism.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the bobbin assembly comprises a thrust bearing adjacent the distal head, a spacer for guiding the thrust bearing rotation, and a shock-absorbing member adjacent the spacer. The thrust bearing is pre-loaded with a compressive force applied by the flange by displacing the at least one shock-absorbing member. The compressive force should exceed an inertial force associated with a reciprocation of the knife. The shock-absorbing member is selected from the group consisting of a wavey washer, coil spring, polymer disc, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the thrust bearing is anti-friction bearings having rolling elements, and the rolling elements can be at least one of a ball, cylindrical needle, and tapered pin. The knife holder can also include a top washer surrounding a base of the stem to provide additional support. In another embodiment, the flange segments the interior creating a first pocket between the distal head of the shoulder screw and the flange, and a second pocket between the flange and the base of the stem with a first bobbin assembly in the first segment and a second bobbin assembly in the second segment. The core can be secured to the shell by any means such as a screw, a pin or adhesive and the like.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to a swivel knife holder assembly for a reciprocating knife including a shoulder screw defining an axis, the shoulder screw having a proximal threaded end and a distal head and a bobbin assembly mounted on the shoulder screw to freely swivel for absorbing axial load, wherein the bobbin assembly comprises a thrust bearing adjacent the distal head, a spacer for guiding the thrust bearing rotation, and a shock-absorbing member adjacent the spacer for absorbing axial load. A shell defines an interior and has a distal opening and a proximal opening, wherein the proximal opening is defined by a flange. The shell is configured to engage a rotating drive mechanism to swivel about the axis. A stem threadably couples to the proximal threaded end of the shoulder screw to enclose the interior. The stem also has a mounting surface for engaging a reciprocating drive mechanism. A core mounts in the interior for holding the knife and rotating with the shell.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still another embodiment, the subject technology is directed to a swivel knife holder assembly for a reciprocating knife with the holder assembly comprising a shell defining an interior with a distal opening and a proximal opening. The shell has a flange segmenting the interior into a distal pocket and a proximal pocket. A shoulder screw extends from the distal pocket to the proximal pocket along an axis. A first bobbin assembly mounts on the shoulder screw adjacent a head of the shoulder screw in the distal pocket and a second bobbin assembly mounts on the shoulder screw in the proximal pocket. Each bobbin assembly includes a thrust bearing/spacer assembly for rotating about the axis within the respective pocket. At least one shock-absorbing member absorbs axial load and axial tolerances in at least one of the pockets. A stem threadably couples to a threaded end of the shoulder screw to enclose the proximal pocket and apply axial compression to the shock-absorbing member. The stem also has a mounting surface for engaging a reciprocating axial drive mechanism. A core mounts in the distal pocket for enclosing the distal pocket and holding the knife. A rotating drive mechanism swivels the shell so that the core swivels about the axis and, in turn, the knife swivels to a desired orientation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the shell has a relatively square cross-sectional shape with flat corner to match a complimentarily shaped shell holder of the drive mechanism for version control. In other words, the shell holder of the drive mechanism has an interior that is substantially square except for an angled corner so that older, out-of-date square shells cannot be mounted thereon. The single flat corner arrangement also sets the orientation of the shell in the holder if needed. It is envisioned that many similar structures or keying features can accomplish the same function. Similarly, the core can include a transverse pin so that only a matching angled corner knife may be mounted therein for version control. The shock-absorbing member may be one or more of a wavey washer, coil spring, polymer disc, a rubber ring, a leaf spring, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It will be appreciated that the thrust bearings of the disclosure decrease the backlash within the swivel joint and therefore reduce overall noise and wear. Moreover, the thrust bearings of the disclosure do not require heat treatment or a nitride coating, and therefore last longer while being less costly to manufacture. It will also be appreciated that the spacers have an inner circular base for housing of the thrust bearings, thereby allowing for rotational movement about a radial axis of rotation when under compressive force. Furthermore, the shock-absorbing member absorbs axial compression and reduces overall load. Nitride coatings for swivel assemblies may be costly, therefore it will be further appreciated that the disclosure reduces manufacturing costs as shock-absorbing members, thrust bearings, and spacers are inexpensive and easily manufactured.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The accompanying drawings, referred to herein and constituting a part hereof, illustrate a preferred embodiment of the disclosure and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a CNC multi-ply cutting machine using a reciprocated knife as a cutting tool for cutting garment parts from multi-ply fabrics in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the exterior of a swivel knife holder assembly for a reciprocated knife in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a magnified perspective view of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional exploded view taken along cut line A-A of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the interior assembly of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates across-sectional exploded view of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional exploded view of another swivel knife holder assembly in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional exploded view of still another swivel knife holder assembly in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates a plan view of components of a bobbin assembly of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of components of a bobbin assembly of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates a possible first assembly step for the components of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates a possible second assembly step for the components of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> illustrates a possible third assembly step for the components of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref> illustrates a possible fourth assembly step for the components of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The advantages, and other features of the method disclosed herein, will become more readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description of certain preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings, which set forth representative embodiments of the present invention and wherein like reference numerals identify similar structural elements.

The interior <b>222</b> is divided into two pockets <b>225</b>, <b>227</b> by an inner flange <b>228</b>, which forms an intermediate opening <b>229</b>. The proximal pocket <b>225</b> is enclosed by the washer <b>260</b> and stem <b>250</b> while the distal pocket <b>227</b> is enclosed by the core <b>240</b>.

The core <b>240</b> includes a radial slot <b>242</b>, deep enough to house the knife <b>202</b> therein. The core <b>240</b> further includes a cross-drilled bore <b>244</b> perpendicular to the radial slot <b>242</b>. The cross-drilled bore <b>244</b> runs through the core <b>240</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the bore <b>244</b> has a threaded insert <b>247</b> for mating with the screw <b>251</b>. Thus, when the bore <b>244</b> is aligned with the throughbore <b>218</b> of the shell <b>210</b>, a screw <b>251</b> can be received therein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The core <b>240</b> also defines a transverse pinhole <b>248</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). The pinhole <b>248</b> aligns with the throughbore <b>218</b> of the shell <b>210</b> to receive a roll-pin <b>219</b> that fixes the core <b>240</b> in the distal pocket <b>227</b>. The core <b>240</b> is further secured within the shell <b>210</b> by the screw <b>251</b>.

The shoulder screw <b>282</b> also has the first bobbin assembly <b>270</b><i>a </i>mounted thereon and secured by the stem <b>250</b>, threadably fastened thereon. Adjacent the head <b>282</b> of the shoulder screw <b>282</b> is the core <b>240</b>. As detailed above, the core <b>240</b> includes a radial slot <b>282</b> having a roll-pin <b>219</b> therein for securing the core <b>240</b> to the shell <b>210</b> when the core is inserted therein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> further illustrates the knife <b>202</b> secured within the radial slot <b>242</b> of the core <b>240</b>.

It will be appreciated that the screw <b>251</b> maintains the position of the knife <b>202</b>, thereby preventing any misalignment during reciprocation and rotation. In still another embodiment, another roll-pin is only inserted into the core so that only a knife with an angled corner can fit into the core.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional exploded view of the swivel knife holder assembly <b>200</b> fully assembled in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. When rotational force is applied to the shell <b>210</b> by the theta drive, the shell <b>210</b>, the core <b>240</b> and the knife <b>202</b>, which are all coupled together, freely rotate to position the knife <b>202</b> in the desired orientation while the stem <b>250</b> and shoulder screw <b>282</b>, which are coupled together, do not rotate about the axis &#x201c;a&#x201d;. The thrust bearings <b>272</b><i>a</i>. <b>272</b><i>b </i>of the bobbin assemblies <b>270</b><i>a</i>, <b>270</b><i>b </i>facilitate this rotation without binding despite the axial tolerances of the bobbin assemblies <b>270</b><i>a</i>, <b>270</b><i>b </i>in the pockets <b>225</b>, <b>227</b> being filled by the wavy washers <b>280</b>. Thus, when rotational force is applied to the shell <b>210</b> by the theta drive, the knife <b>202</b> freely rotates. The bobbin assemblies <b>270</b><i>a</i>, <b>270</b><i>b </i>also absorb the axial load on the swivel assembly <b>200</b> during reciprocating motion by further compression.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As can be seen, the bobbin assemblies of the swivel knife holder assembly in accordance with the present disclosure increase the longevity of the swivel knife holder assembly by threefold compared to prior art devices. Specifically, the shock-absorbing members (e.g., wavy washers) of the bobbin assemblies absorb axial compression, thereby reducing the overall wear and tear of the bobbin assembly. The absorption of axial compression also reduces the level of noise output by softening the impact of the bobbin assemblies against the flange and shell of the swivel knife holder assembly. Moreover, the thrust bearings allow for rotation of the interior assembly of the swivel knife holder assembly about the axis of rotation despite the amount of compression applied to the bobbin assemblies. The flange prevents the shoulder screw from exiting the shell in response to an upward force, and the stem prevents the shoulder screw from exiting the shell in response to a downward force. In short, the use of the bobbin assemblies reduces noise output and overall wear and tear.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The thrust bearings are preferably preloaded by a compressive force applied by the shoulder screw. The preload is preferably within the range of 80-120 lbs. The preload is governed by the displacement of the at least one shock-absorbing member, and preferably exceeds the inertial force associated with the reciprocation of the swivel knife holder assembly and knife to assure zero clearance between the thrust bearing surfaces of the first and second bobbin assemblies. It will be appreciated that at least one shock-absorbing member is sufficient for causing the preload, but that the presence of a shock-absorbing member in each bobbin limits the inertial force shock in both the upward and downward. It will be further appreciated that the swivel knife holder assembly in accordance with the present disclosure significantly reduces manufacturing costs. The elements used in the bobbin assemblies of the swivel knife holder assembly are inexpensive and easily replaceable, thus, reducing costs for production of the same. It is envisioned that the shock absorbing members can be selected from the group consisting of split washers, coil springs, leaf springs, elastic or rubber elements and the like as well as combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be appreciated by those having skill in the art that the swivel knife holder assembly does not require a shock-absorbing member in each bobbin assembly. In the alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, three hundred series numbers are used but like references numbers are used to indicate similar elements wherever possible. The two shock-absorbing members <b>380</b> are located in the first bobbin assembly <b>370</b><i>a</i>, and no shock-absorbing members are located in the second bobbin assembly <b>370</b><i>b</i>. Although two shock-absorbing members <b>380</b> are seen in the second bobbin assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that only one shock-absorbing member is necessary. It is also noted that bore <b>344</b> defines an initial relatively larger unthreaded portion <b>245</b> and smaller threaded portion <b>246</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the swivel knife holder assembly is not limited to any number of bobbin assemblies. As seen in the alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, four hundred series numbers are used but like references numbers are used to indicate similar elements wherever possible. The intermediate opening in the interior <b>422</b> of the shell <b>410</b> is omitted and only a single bobbin assembly is present. In this embodiment, the flange <b>428</b> of the shell <b>410</b> at the proximal opening <b>424</b> provides structure against which the shock-absorbing member <b>480</b> of the single bobbin assembly <b>470</b> compresses. As only a single bobbin assembly <b>470</b> exists, the threaded end <b>486</b> of the shoulder screw <b>482</b> protrudes outwardly from the proximal opening of the shell <b>410</b>, and the stem <b>450</b> is threadably fastened thereon to secure the single bobbin assembly <b>470</b> within the shell <b>410</b>. As detailed above, only a single shock-absorbing member <b>480</b> is necessary, but additional shock-absorbing members may be used to further distribute absorption of the axial load from reciprocating.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> illustrate possible assembly steps for the components of the swivel knife holder assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates a first step of placing the second bobbin assembly <b>270</b><i>b </i>on the shoulder screw <b>282</b> of the swivel knife holder assembly <b>200</b>. The second bobbin assembly <b>270</b><i>b </i>may be preassembled and placed on the shoulder screw <b>282</b>. Preferably, at least one of the spacers <b>274</b><i>a </i>is a tight fit with the thrust bearing <b>272</b><i>a </i>so that a light press is required. Alternatively when the bobbin assembly is not preassembled, the first spacer <b>274</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the shoulder screw, resting against the head <b>288</b> of the shoulder screw <b>282</b>. Next, the thrust bearing <b>272</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the shoulder screw <b>282</b> atop the first spacer <b>274</b><i>a</i>, and a second spacer <b>274</b><i>a </i>is mounted thereon. The spacers <b>274</b><i>a </i>and thrust bearing <b>272</b><i>a </i>are mounted such that rolling elements <b>278</b> of the thrust bearing <b>272</b><i>a </i>are coupled to the inner circular race <b>275</b> of the spacers <b>274</b><i>a</i>. At this point, the shoulder screw <b>282</b> with first bobbin assembly <b>270</b><i>a </i>can be placed in the distal pocket <b>227</b> with the threaded end <b>286</b> extending through the intermediate opening <b>229</b> of the flange <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates another step in which the swivel gauge assembly <b>200</b> is measured to check if a shim is necessary. The shoulder screw <b>282</b> is supported firmly in place with a solid dowel <b>281</b>. With the second bobbin assembly <b>270</b><i>b </i>in place and the two wavy washers <b>280</b><i>a</i>, <b>280</b> on the shoulder screw <b>282</b>, a precision calibration spacer <b>297</b> is placed on the two wavy washers <b>280</b>. The precision calibration spacer <b>297</b> should be flush with the proximal end surface <b>231</b> of the shell <b>210</b> to indicate that a proper amount of compression will be applied with mounting the stem <b>250</b>. If not flush, one or more shims, such as a thin washer, can be added on to the shoulder screw <b>282</b> until within tolerance. Once ready, the spacers <b>274</b> and thrust bearing <b>272</b> are put in place, the stem <b>250</b> can be tightly secured to the threaded end <b>286</b> of the shoulder screw <b>282</b> with a screw adhesive.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, the core <b>240</b> is placed into the distal pocket <b>227</b> of the interior <b>222</b> of the shell <b>210</b> so that the throughbore <b>220</b> and pinhole <b>248</b> align. A jig <b>299</b> is used to hold the shell <b>210</b> steady and a piece of cardboard or like element can be placed in the radial slot <b>242</b> to rotate the core <b>240</b> as needed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>, once the core <b>240</b> is in position, the roll-pin <b>219</b> is pressed into place.
