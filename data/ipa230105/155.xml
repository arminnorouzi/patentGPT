Materials that may be vaporized include, but are not limited to, dried plant material such as herbs, liquid-based compositions such as oils, and wax-based compositions. Such materials may be referred to as &#x201c;vaping materials&#x201d; herein. The vapor generated from such materials can then be delivered to a user by inhalation during a &#x201c;vaping&#x201d; session.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable vaporizer apparatuses for personal use may be assembled from basic parts such as a mouthpiece, a vaporizing chamber for holding a material for vaporizing, a heater, a battery, etc. When the material for vaporizing is depleted, the vaporizer apparatus may be refilled. However, repeated refilling of the vaporizer apparatus may require that a user must assemble and disassemble these various parts over and over again, which can result in parts being lost. In addition, the mouthpiece may be exposed when the vaporizer apparatus is not in use between &#x201c;vaping&#x201d; sessions. This can be unhygienic for a user to position his or her mouth on the mouthpiece during a subsequent &#x201c;vaping&#x201d; session and can possibly lead to the unintentional inhalation of materials that may have fallen into the mouthpiece.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect, there is provided a vaporizer apparatus, comprising: a

As also noted above, in other embodiments, rather than a single dual-cartridge structure, two separate cartridges, each comprising a respective reservoir, vaporizing chamber and/or heating element, may be received in the head <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">A user may select a desired mode of operation using the user interface <b>160</b>. The mode of operation may be a vapor mix ratio. For example, a user may press a button (e.g. button <b>118</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>15</b></figref>) to cycle through available modes until the visual indicator <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) indicates the desired mix ratio. The processor, upon receiving user input, via the user interface <b>160</b> controls the flow of the first and second vapors through the first and second vapor airflow paths <b>168</b><i>a </i>and <b>168</b><i>b </i>as a function of the selected mix ratio. Optionally, the vaporizer apparatus may further include one or more airflow sensors that measure airflow through the body <b>102</b> and/or head <b>104</b>. The sensor output may be provided to the processor <b>156</b>. Example methods for controlling the mix ratio will now be discussed, although embodiments are not limited to these specific examples.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">In some embodiments, the power level provided to the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may vary as a function of the selected mix ratio. For example, for a 50/50 mix ratio, the wattage provided to each of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be the same (e.g. high power for both, or medium power for both). For a 75/25 mix ratio, the wattage may be high for the first heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>and low for the second heating element <b>154</b><i>b</i>. In this context, high may be 100% max power and low may be 50% max power. However, the exact relative powers and power ratios may vary and may depend on the materials being vaporized in the first and second vaporizing chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b</i>. For a 100/0 mix ratio, the output wattage may be 100% wattage for the first heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>and 0% for the second heating element <b>154</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">As yet another option, timing of the activation of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be a function of the desired mix ratio. The duration for which the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>are activated to vaporize material may be referred to as a &#x201c;burn time&#x201d;. The burn time duration may, for example, be based on an expected (e.g. typical) inhale time of a user. For example, it may be assumed that the user will typically inhale for two seconds. For a 50/50 mix ratio (i.e. 50%), the burn times for both vaporizing chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>may be the same. For example, both vaporizing chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>may burn for approximately two seconds. For a 75/25 mix ratio (i.e. 75%), the burn time of the second vaporizing chamber <b>152</b><i>b </i>may be reduced. As an example, the first vaporizing chamber may burn for approximately two seconds and the second vaporizing chamber may burn for approximately 0.5 seconds. For a 100/0 mix ratio (i.e. 100%), the burn time for the first vaporizing chamber <b>152</b><i>a </i>may be approximately two seconds, and the burn time for the second vaporizing chamber <b>152</b><i>b </i>may be zero. The burn times described above are only examples, and other different relative burn times may be used in other implementations.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">As another option, the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be controlled to individually and selectively generate vapor at variable rates to provide the selected vapor mix. The heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be controlled by the processor <b>156</b> to vary the rate of vapor production. For example, power to each of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be &#x201c;pulsed&#x201d; at variable rates. For each heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b</i>, the respective &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; rate may determine the rate of vapor production. For example, a faster pulse rate may produce a higher flow of vapor than a slower pulse rate. The total airflow through the paths <b>168</b><i>a </i>and <b>168</b><i>b </i>may be approximately the same (or similar), but the density of vapor in the air that flows through such paths may vary by this method.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">For example, if the selected ratio is 100% the first vapor and 0% the second vapor, the heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>may be pulsed to generate vapor while the second heating element <b>154</b><i>b </i>is not pulsed at all. For a 50/50 mix ratio (i.e. 50%), each of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be pulsed at the same rate(s). For a ratio that is 25% the first vapor and 75% the second vapor, the first heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>may be pulsed at a slower rate than the second heating element <b>154</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">The specific pulse rate(s) of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may also vary dependent on other factors, such as vaporizing chamber temperature, airflow rate (e.g. when a user is currently inhaling vs. when a user is not currently inhaling), and/or other factors. Thus, the pulse rate(s) for selected mix ratios may not be limited to a single pulse rate for each heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, power levels supplied to the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b </i>may be controlled to control the mix ratio.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">The vaporizer apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a respective temperature sensor (not shown) for each of the vaporizing chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b</i>. The temperature sensors may be located within or near the vaporizing chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>to measure the temperatures therein. Temperature feedback may be received by the processor <b>156</b> and used to dynamically control the pulse rate(s) of the heating elements <b>154</b><i>a </i>to <b>154</b><i>b </i>to maintain the respective temperatures within a set range.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">As yet another example, the vapor flow control system may comprise first and second electromagnetic switch elements. The magnetically controlled elements may each open and close an airflow path for a different vapor at variable and selective rates to achieve the desired vapour ratio. For example, the first and second airflow paths (e.g. paths <b>168</b><i>a </i>and <b>168</b><i>b</i>) for the first and second vapours may each have a respective electromagnetically controlled switch that can be rapidly opened or closed to block or allow airflow therethrough. Each of the first and second electromagnetically controlled switches may be controlled rapidly at relative rates necessary for the vapor ratio. Thus, in this example, rather than controlling a pulse rate of the heater, a pulse rate of the electromagnetically controlled gate or switch is used to control vapor flow.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">The first and second electromagnetic switches may be controlled so that one of the first and second vapour paths is always open at any given time. For example, the first and second first and second electromagnetic switches may be activated in an alternating manner (between the first and second vapour paths). In order to achieve a 50/50 ratio, the open and closed cycle for each switch may be equal. For a 25/75 ratio, the first path may have a shorter &#x201c;open&#x201d; portion of the open/close cycle, while the second path has a longer &#x201c;open&#x201d; portion of the open/close cycle. For a 100% to 0% ratio, the desired vapor path may be left open, and the other closed.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">For each electromagnetic switch, a spring or other biasing element may be used to close the respective path, and an electromagnet, when activated, could open the path (similar to a solenoid switch, for example). In other words, the default position of the switch may be closed. In such embodiments, rather than activating the vaporizer in response to sensing a user trying to draw vapor through the mouthpiece, a button may be used to control usage. As another option, a separate sensor configured to sense if someone is using the mouthpiece may be used. For example, the sensor may be a touch sensor on the mouthpiece. The sensor may be an air pressure sensor that senses suction and/or an airflow sensor.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In some embodiments, the currently selected mode of operation (e.g. mix ratio) may be determined on factors other than, or in addition to user input. The mix ratio may be selected based on current time and/or location information, as determined by the optional clock <b>176</b> and/or location module <b>178</b>, for example. For example, at certain times of day (e.g. work hours) and/or locations (e.g. workplace) one of the first and second vapors may be restricted to 0%. For example, a vapor including one or more psychoactive components may be restricted to use during certain times of day such as non-work or after-work hours. The vapor including one or more psychoactive components may be restricted to use in certain locations, such as non-work locations, or certain geographic regions. Restricting the flow of one of the vapors may comprise deactivating or disabling (not allowing) activation of the corresponding heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>or <b>154</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">As yet another option, the vaporizer apparatus <b>100</b> may include one or more controllable airflow restriction mechanisms. For example, the vaporizer apparatus <b>100</b> may include optional first and second airflow baffles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b</i>, which are positioned and configured to regulate airflow through the first and second vapor airflow paths <b>168</b><i>a </i>and <b>168</b><i>b </i>respectively. The baffles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b </i>are one of multiple options for controlling the vapor mix ratio. The first and second airflow baffles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b </i>are controlled by the processor <b>156</b> in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">The first and second airflow baffles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b </i>may be controlled by the processor <b>156</b> to provide the selected mix ratio. For example, if the selected ratio is 100% the first vapor and 0% the second vapor, the first baffle <b>180</b><i>a </i>may be fully opened and the second baffle <b>180</b><i>b </i>may be fully closed. For a 50/50 mix ratio, each of the baffles <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b </i>may be fully open, or both may be partially open to the same degree, such that the vapor flow in each of the first and second vapor airflow paths <b>168</b><i>a </i>and <b>168</b><i>b </i>is substantially similar. For a ratio that is 25% the first vapor and 75% the second vapor, the first baffle <b>180</b><i>a </i>may be only slightly open, while the second baffle <b>180</b><i>b </i>is mostly open, where the difference in baffle positions is designed to give the proper mix. While a vapor is set to 0%, the heat element may be inactive for the corresponding vaporizing chamber so that vapor is not produced.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">Embodiments are not limited to baffles, and any other suitable mechanism controllable to modify airflow resistance may be used rather than baffles. Embodiments are also not limited to physical airflow resistance mechanisms for controlling vapor mix ratios.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In some embodiments, the first and second materials may both contain one or more psychoactive components, or may be substantially free of psychoactive components. The first and second materials may have different flavors, or other different characteristics, and the mix ratio may be set according to the desired vaping experience.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a cross-sectional partial view of the vaporizer apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> to <b>18</b></figref>, with the cartridge <b>134</b> removed from the head <b>104</b>.

For example, an identification or verification code may be retrieved from the cartridge <b>134</b> and verified by the processor <b>156</b>. A plurality of cartridges may be provided, each having a unique identification or verification code associated therewith. Upon successful verification, operation of the vaporizer apparatus for vaping may be enabled. If verification is unsuccessful, operation of the vaporizer apparatus for vaping may be disabled.

The processor <b>156</b> may alternatively change the mix ratio setting of the vaporizer apparatus <b>100</b> responsive to determining that the reservoir <b>150</b><i>a </i>or <b>150</b><i>b </i>is empty or below a threshold. For example, if the first material in the first reservoir <b>150</b><i>a </i>is below a threshold, then the ratio may be set to 100% vapor from the second material in the second reservoir <b>150</b><i>b </i>(or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The determination that one or more reservoirs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>are empty or below a threshold may be based on a timer. For example, a given material (e.g. oil strain) may be known to vaporize at an approximate rate, and a time to vaporize a substantial amount of the material may be predetermined. The processor may then determine that the total vaporization time for the cartridge <b>134</b> has approached or passed that predetermined time. For example, the predetermined vaporization time to substantially use up a given material may be approximately 30 minutes.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">The determination that one or more reservoirs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>are empty or below a threshold may be based on a measured resistance or current of the heating element <b>154</b><i>a </i>or <b>154</b><i>b</i>. The resistance or current may be dependent on the amount of the material in the reservoir, and the dependence may be known or approximated based on empirical measurements. For example, a resistance measured at the heating element may be approximately: 400 Ohm when the corresponding reservoir is approximately full; 350 Ohm when the corresponding reservoir is approximately half full; and 193 Ohm when the corresponding reservoir is approximately empty.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">The determination that one or more reservoirs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>are empty or below a threshold may be based on an airflow characteristic (e.g. airflow pressure) measured by a sensor.
