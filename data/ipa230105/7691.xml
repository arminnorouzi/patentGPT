These wireless networks may be multiple-access networks capable of supporting multiple users by sharing the available network resources. Such networks may be multiple access networks that support communications for multiple users by sharing the available network resources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of such a network is the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN). The UTRAN is the radio access network (RAN) defined as a part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a third generation (3G) mobile phone technology supported by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Examples of multiple-access network formats include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) networks, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, and Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless communication network may include several components. These components may include wireless communication devices, such as base stations (or node Bs) that may support communication for a number of user equipments (UEs). A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base station to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A base station may transmit data and control information on the downlink to a UE and/or may receive data and control information on the uplink from the UE. On the downlink, a transmission from the base station may encounter interference due to transmissions from neighbor base stations or from other wireless radio frequency (RF) transmitters. On the uplink, a transmission from the UE may encounter interference from uplink transmissions of other UEs communicating with the neighbor base stations or from other wireless RF transmitters. This interference may degrade performance on both the downlink and uplink.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, the possibilities of interference and congested networks grows with more UEs accessing the long-range wireless communication networks and more short-range wireless systems being deployed in communities. Research and development continue to advance wireless technologies not only to meet the growing demand for mobile broadband access, but to advance and enhance the user experience with mobile communications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following summarizes some aspects of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding of the discussed technology.

The example aspects of COT aware sensing and resource selections may further increase transmission reliability by selecting sidelink resources that offer a higher LB T success rate among the available transmission resources.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This disclosure relates generally to providing or participating in authorized shared access between two or more wireless communications systems, also referred to as wireless communications networks. In various embodiments, the techniques and apparatus may be used for wireless communication networks such as code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) networks, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) networks, orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, LTE networks, GSM networks, 5th Generation (5G) or new radio (NR) networks, as well as other communications networks. As described herein, the terms &#x201c;networks&#x201d; and &#x201c;systems&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, flash-OFDM and the like. UTRA, E-UTRA, and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, long term evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents provided from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP), and cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known or are being developed. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations that aims to define a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone specification. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) is a 3GPP project which was aimed at improving the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile phone standard. The 3GPP may define specifications for the next generation of mobile networks, mobile systems, and mobile devices. The present disclosure is concerned with the evolution of wireless technologies from LTE, 4G, 5G, NR, and beyond with shared access to wireless spectrum between networks using a collection of new and different radio access technologies or radio air interfaces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular, 5G networks contemplate diverse deployments, diverse spectrum, and diverse services and devices that may be implemented using an OFDM-based unified, air interface. In order to achieve these goals, further enhancements to LTE and LTE-A are considered in addition to development of the new radio technology for 5G NR networks. The 5G NR will be capable of scaling to provide coverage (1) to a massive Internet of things (IoTs) with an ultra-high density (e.g., &#x2dc;1M nodes/km<sup>2</sup>), ultra-low complexity (e.g., &#x2dc;10s of bits/sec), ultra-low energy (e.g., &#x2dc;10+years of battery life), and deep coverage with the capability to reach challenging locations; (2) including mission-critical control with strong security to safeguard sensitive personal, financial, or classified information, ultra-high reliability (e.g., &#x2dc;99.9999% reliability), ultra-low latency (e.g., &#x2dc;1 ms), and users with wide ranges of mobility or lack thereof; and (3) with enhanced mobile broadband including extreme high capacity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 Tbps/km<sup>2</sup>), extreme data rates (e.g., multi-Gbps rate, 100+Mbps user experienced rates), and deep awareness with advanced discovery and optimizations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Devices, networks, and systems may be configured to communicate via one or more portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided, based on frequency or wavelength, into various classes, bands, channels, etc. In 5G NR two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; (mmWave) band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;mmWave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the above aspects in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;mmWave&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, or may be within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">5G NR devices, networks, and systems may be implemented to use optimized OFDM-based waveform features. These features may include scalable numerology and transmission time intervals (TTIs); a common, flexible framework to efficiently multiplex services and features with a dynamic, low-latency time division duplex (TDD) design or frequency division duplex (FDD) design; and with advanced wireless technologies, such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), robust millimeter wave (mmWave) transmissions, advanced channel coding, and device-centric mobility. Scalability of the numerology in 5G NR, with scaling of subcarrier spacing, may efficiently address operating diverse services across diverse spectrum and diverse deployments. For example, in various outdoor and macro coverage deployments of less than 3 GHz FDD/TDD implementations, subcarrier spacing may occur with 15 kHz, for example over 1, 5, 10, 20 MHz, and the like bandwidth. For other various outdoor and small cell coverage deployments of TDD greater than 3 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 30 kHz over 80/100 MHz bandwidth. For other various indoor wideband implementations, using a TDD over the unlicensed portion of the 5 GHz band, the subcarrier spacing may occur with 60 kHz over a 160 MHz bandwidth. Finally, for various deployments transmitting with mmWave components at a TDD of 28 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 120 kHz over a 500 MHz bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The scalable numerology of the 5G NR facilitates scalable TTI for diverse latency and quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, shorter TTI may be used for low latency and high reliability, while longer TTI may be used for higher spectral efficiency. The efficient multiplexing of long and short TTIs to allow transmissions to start on symbol boundaries. 5G NR also contemplates a self-contained integrated subframe design with uplink/downlink scheduling information, data, and acknowledgement in the same subframe. The self-contained integrated subframe supports communications in unlicensed or contention-based shared spectrum, adaptive uplink/downlink that may be flexibly configured on a per-cell basis to dynamically switch between uplink and downlink to meet the current traffic needs.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For clarity, certain aspects of the apparatus and techniques may be described below with reference to example 5G NR implementations or in a 5G-centric way, and 5G terminology may be used as illustrative examples in portions of the description below; however, the description is not intended to be limited to 5G applications.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, it should be understood that, in operation, wireless communication networks adapted according to the concepts herein may operate with any combination of licensed or unlicensed spectrum depending on loading and availability.

The wireless communications system <b>100</b> includes base stations <b>105</b>, UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or NR network. In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, or communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with UEs <b>115</b> via one or more base station antennas. Base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by those skilled in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or some other suitable terminology. Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> of different types (e.g., macro or small cell base stations). The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of base stations <b>105</b> and network equipment including macro eNBs, small cell eNBs, gNBs, relay base stations, and the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each base station <b>105</b> may be associated with a particular geographic coverage area <b>110</b> in which communications with various UEs <b>115</b> is supported. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b> via communication links <b>125</b>, and communication links <b>125</b> between a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may utilize one or more carriers. Communication links <b>125</b> shown in wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Downlink transmissions may also be referred to as forward link transmissions while uplink transmissions may also be referred to as reverse link transmissions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The geographic coverage area <b>110</b> for a base station <b>105</b> may be divided into sectors making up a portion of the geographic coverage area <b>110</b>, and each sector may be associated with a cell. For example, each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or various combinations thereof. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and, therefore, provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, and overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b> or by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous LTE/LTE-A/LTE-A Pro or NR network in which different types of base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; refers to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier), and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID)) operating via the same or a different carrier. In some examples, a carrier may support multiple cells, and different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., machine-type communication (MTC), narrowband Internet-of-things (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), or others) that may provide access for different types of devices. In some cases, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical entity operates.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>115</b> may also be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client. A UE <b>115</b> may also be a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone (UE <b>115</b><i>a</i>), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wearable device (UE <b>115</b><i>d</i>), a tablet computer, a laptop computer (UE <b>115</b><i>g</i>), or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also refer to a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet-of-things (IoT) device, an Internet-of-everything (IoE) device, an MTC device, or the like, which may be implemented in various articles such as appliances, vehicles (UE <b>115</b><i>e </i>and UE <b>115</b><i>f</i>), meters (UE <b>115</b><i>b </i>and UE <b>115</b><i>c</i>), or the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices, and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via machine-to-machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay that information to a central server or application program that can make use of the information or present the information to humans interacting with the program or application. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples, half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving &#x201c;deep sleep&#x201d; mode when not engaging in active communications, or operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications). In other cases, UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions), and a wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to provide ultra-reliable communications for these functions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain cases, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or device-to-device (D2D) protocol). One or more of a group of UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>, or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some cases, groups of UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some cases, a base station <b>105</b> may facilitate the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications may be carried out between UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> and with one another. For example, base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>) or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one packet data network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by base stations <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be connected to the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be connected to the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), or a packet-switched (PS) streaming service.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At least some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity may communicate with UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other access network transmission entities, which may be referred to as a radio head, a smart radio head, or a transmission/reception point (TRP). In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band, since the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features. However, the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. Transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter range (e.g., less than 100 km) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band. The SHF region includes bands such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, which may be used opportunistically by devices that may be capable of tolerating interference from other users.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE <b>115</b>. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include operations by different network operating entities (e.g., network operators), in which each network operator may share spectrum. In some instances, a network operating entity may be configured to use an entirety of a designated shared spectrum for at least a period of time before another network operating entity uses the entirety of the designated shared spectrum for a different period of time. Thus, in order to allow network operating entities use of the full designated shared spectrum, and in order to mitigate interfering communications between the different network operating entities, certain resources (e.g., time) may be partitioned and allocated to the different network operating entities for certain types of communication.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, a network operating entity may be allocated certain time resources reserved for exclusive communication by the network operating entity using the entirety of the shared spectrum. The network operating entity may also be allocated other time resources where the entity is given priority over other network operating entities to communicate using the shared spectrum. These time resources, prioritized for use by the network operating entity, may be utilized by other network operating entities on an opportunistic basis if the prioritized network operating entity does not utilize the resources. Additional time resources may be allocated for any network operator to use on an opportunistic basis.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Access to the shared spectrum and the arbitration of time resources among different network operating entities may be centrally controlled by a separate entity, autonomously determined by a predefined arbitration scheme, or dynamically determined based on interactions between wireless nodes of the network operators.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various implementations, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ license assisted access (LAA), LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band (NR-U), such as the 5 GHz ISM band. In some cases, UE <b>115</b> and base station <b>105</b> of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate in a shared radio frequency spectrum band, which may include licensed or unlicensed (e.g., contention-based) frequency spectrum. In an unlicensed frequency portion of the shared radio frequency spectrum band, UEs <b>115</b> or base stations <b>105</b> may traditionally perform a medium-sensing procedure to contend for access to the frequency spectrum. For example, UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b> may perform a listen before talk (LBT) procedure such as a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the shared channel is available.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A CCA may include an energy detection procedure to determine whether there are any other active transmissions on the shared channel. For example, a device may infer that a change in a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of a power meter indicates that a channel is occupied. Specifically, signal power that is concentrated in a certain bandwidth and exceeds a predetermined noise floor may indicate another wireless transmitter. A CCA also may include message detection of specific sequences that indicate use of the channel. For example, another device may transmit a specific preamble prior to transmitting a data sequence. In some cases, an LBT procedure may include a wireless node adjusting its own backoff window based on the amount of energy detected on a channel and/or the acknowledge/negative-acknowledge (ACK/NACK) feedback for its own transmitted packets as a proxy for collisions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In general, four categories of LBT procedure have been suggested for sensing a shared channel for signals that may indicate the channel is already occupied. In a first category (CAT <b>1</b> LBT), no LBT or CCA is applied to detect occupancy of the shared channel. A second category (CAT <b>2</b> LBT), which may also be referred to as an abbreviated LBT, a single-shot LBT, or a 25-&#x3bc;s LBT, provides for the node to perform a CCA to detect energy above a predetermined threshold or detect a message or preamble occupying the shared channel. The CAT <b>2</b> LBT performs the CCA without using a random back-off operation, which results in its abbreviated length, relative to the next categories.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A third category (CAT <b>3</b> LBT) performs CCA to detect energy or messages on a shared channel, but also uses a random back-off and fixed contention window. Therefore, when the node initiates the CAT <b>3</b> LBT, it performs a first CCA to detect occupancy of the shared channel. If the shared channel is idle for the duration of the first CCA, the node may proceed to transmit. However, if the first CCA detects a signal occupying the shared channel, the node selects a random back-off based on the fixed contention window size and performs an extended CCA. If the shared channel is detected to be idle during the extended CCA and the random number has been decremented to <b>0</b>, then the node may begin transmission on the shared channel. Otherwise, the node decrements the random number and performs another extended CCA. The node would continue performing extended CCA until the random number reaches 0. If the random number reaches 0 without any of the extended CCAs detecting channel occupancy, the node may then transmit on the shared channel. If at any of the extended CCA, the node detects channel occupancy, the node may re-select a new random back-off based on the fixed contention window size to begin the countdown again.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A fourth category (CAT <b>4</b> LBT), which may also be referred to as a full LBT procedure, performs the CCA with energy or message detection using a random back-off and variable contention window size. The sequence of CCA detection proceeds similarly to the process of the CAT <b>3</b> LBT, except that the contention window size is variable for the CAT <b>4</b> LBT procedure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Use of a medium-sensing procedure to contend for access to an unlicensed shared spectrum may result in communication inefficiencies. This may be particularly evident when multiple network operating entities (e.g., network operators) are attempting to access a shared resource. In wireless communications system <b>100</b>, base stations <b>105</b> and UEs <b>115</b> may be operated by the same or different network operating entities. In some examples, an individual base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be operated by more than one network operating entity. In other examples, each base station <b>105</b> and UE <b>115</b> may be operated by a single network operating entity. Requiring each base station <b>105</b> and UE <b>115</b> of different network operating entities to contend for shared resources may result in increased signaling overhead and communication latency.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some cases, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, peer-to-peer transmissions, or a combination of these. Duplexing in unlicensed spectrum may be based on frequency division duplexing (FDD), time division duplexing (TDD), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some examples, base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use a transmission scheme between a transmitting device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>) and a receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>), where the transmitting device is equipped with multiple antennas and the receiving device is equipped with one or more antennas. MIMO communications may employ multipath signal propagation to increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers, which may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream, and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams. Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam or receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying certain amplitude and phase offsets to signals carried via each of the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. For instance, some signals (e.g. synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions, which may include a signal being transmitted according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by the base station <b>105</b> or a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for subsequent transmission and/or reception by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based at least in in part on a signal that was transmitted in different beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions, and the UE <b>115</b> may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal it received with a highest signal quality, or an otherwise acceptable signal quality. Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>), or transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>, which may be an example of a mmW receiving device) may try multiple receive beams when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive beams or receive directions. In some examples a receiving device may use a single receive beam to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive beam may be aligned in a beam direction determined based at least in part on listening according to different receive beam directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio, or otherwise acceptable signal quality based at least in part on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In certain implementations, the antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays, which may support MIMO operations, or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some cases, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In additional cases, UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. HARQ feedback is one technique of increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., signal-to-noise conditions). In some cases, a wireless device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot, while in other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Time intervals in LTE or NR may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit, which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/30,720,000 seconds. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), where the frame period may be expressed as T<sub>f</sub>=307,200 T<sub>s</sub>. The radio frames may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) ranging from 0 to 1023. Each frame may include 10 subframes numbered from 0 to 9, and each subframe may have a duration of 1 ms. A subframe may be further divided into 2 slots each having a duration of 0.5 ms, and each slot may contain 6 or 7 modulation symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain 2048 sampling periods. In some cases, a subframe may be the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In other cases, a smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be shorter than a subframe or may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs) or in selected component carriers using sTTIs).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some wireless communications systems, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. In some instances, a symbol of a mini-slot or a mini-slot may be the smallest unit of scheduling. Each symbol may vary in duration depending on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation, for example. Further, some wireless communications systems may implement slot aggregation in which multiple slots or mini-slots are aggregated together and used for communication between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The term &#x201c;carrier,&#x201d; as may be used herein, refers to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting communications over a communication link <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier of a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band that is operated according to physical layer channels for a given radio access technology. Each physical layer channel may carry user data, control information, or other signaling. A carrier may be associated with a pre-defined frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)), and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by UEs <b>115</b>. Carriers may be downlink or uplink (e.g., in an FDD mode), or be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode). In some examples, signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple sub-carriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The organizational structure of the carriers may be different for different radio access technologies (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). For example, communications over a carrier may be organized according to TTIs or slots, each of which may include user data as well as control information or signaling to support decoding the user data. A carrier may also include dedicated acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals or system information, etc.) and control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier. In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. In some examples, control information transmitted in a physical control channel may be distributed between different control regions in a cascaded manner (e.g., between a common control region or common search space and one or more UE-specific control regions or UE-specific search spaces).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of predetermined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 MHz). In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions or all of the carrier bandwidth. In other examples, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a predefined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or RBs) within a carrier (e.g., &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; deployment of a narrowband protocol type).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. In MIMO systems, a wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b>) may have a hardware configuration that supports communications over a particular carrier bandwidth, or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> and/or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with more than one different carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> on multiple cells or carriers, a feature which may be referred to as carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both FDD and TDD component carriers.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize enhanced component carriers (eCCs). An eCC may be characterized by one or more features including wider carrier or frequency channel bandwidth, shorter symbol duration, shorter TTI duration, or modified control channel configuration. In certain instances, an eCC may be associated with a carrier aggregation configuration or a dual connectivity configuration (e.g., when multiple serving cells have a suboptimal or non-ideal backhaul link). An eCC may also be configured for use in unlicensed spectrum or shared spectrum (e.g., where more than one operator is allowed to use the spectrum, such as NR-shared spectrum (NR-SS)). An eCC characterized by wide carrier bandwidth may include one or more segments that may be utilized by UEs <b>115</b> that are not capable of monitoring the whole carrier bandwidth or are otherwise configured to use a limited carrier bandwidth (e.g., to conserve power).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In additional cases, an eCC may utilize a different symbol duration than other component carriers, which may include use of a reduced symbol duration as compared with symbol durations of the other component carriers. A shorter symbol duration may be associated with increased spacing between adjacent subcarriers. A device, such as a UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b>, utilizing eCCs may transmit wideband signals (e.g., according to frequency channel or carrier bandwidths of 20, 40, 60, 80 MHz, etc.) at reduced symbol durations (e.g., 16.67 microseconds). A TTI in eCC may consist of one or multiple symbol periods. In some cases, the TTI duration (that is, the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be an NR system that may utilize any combination of licensed, shared, and unlicensed spectrum bands, among others. The flexibility of eCC symbol duration and subcarrier spacing may allow for the use of eCC across multiple spectrums. In some examples, NR shared spectrum may increase spectrum utilization and spectral efficiency, specifically through dynamic vertical (e.g., across the frequency domain) and horizontal (e.g., across the time domain) sharing of resources.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a design of a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b>, which may be one of the base station and one of the UEs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Sidelink communications were introduced in LTE to allow a UE to send data to another UE without tunneling through the base station and/or an associated core network. The LTE sidelink technology had been extended to provision for device-to-device (D2D) communications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, and/or cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications. Similarly, 5G NR may be extended to support sidelink communications, D2D communications, V2X communications, and/or C-V2X over licensed bands and/or unlicensed bands.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Sidelink communications can be communicated over a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) and a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH). The PSCCH and PSSCH are analogous to a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in downlink communication between a BS and a UE. For instance, the PSCCH may carry sidelink control information (SCI) and the PSSCH may carry sidelink data (e.g., user data). Each PSCCH is associated with a corresponding PSSCH, where SCI in a PSCCH may carry reservation and/or scheduling information for sidelink data transmission in the associated PSSCH. Use cases for sidelink communication may include V2X, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), industrial IoT (IIoT), and/or NR-lite.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a device-to-device communication or other types of communications with another user equipment device independent of any tunneling through the base station (e.g., gNB) and/or an associated core network. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink transmitting UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a sidelink transmission operation. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sidelink receiving UE&#x201d; can refer to a user equipment device performing a sidelink reception operation. A sidelink UE may operate as a transmitting sidelink UE at one time and as a receiving sidelink UE at another time.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">NR supports two modes of radio resource allocations (RRA), a mode-1 RRA and a mode-2 RRA, for sidelink over a licensed spectrum. The mode-1 RRA supports network controlled RRA that can be used for in-coverage sidelink communication. For instance, a serving base station may determine radio resources on behalf of a sidelink UE and transmit an indication of the radio resources to the sidelink UE. The mode-2 RRA supports autonomous RRA that can be used for out-of-coverage sidelink UEs or partial-coverage sidelink UEs. For instance, an out-of-coverage sidelink UE or a partial-coverage UE may be preconfigured with a sidelink resource pool and may select a radio resource from the preconfigured sidelink resource pool for sidelink communication.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For mode-2 RRA, a sidelink UE may perform sensing in a sidelink resource pool. The sensing may include decoding SCI and/or measuring signal energy in the channel. For SCI decoding, the UE may blindly decode SCI from a PSCCH of each resource. If the decoding is successful, the UE may record the decoded SCI. For signal measurements, the UE may receive a signal from each resource and compute a reference signal received power (RSRP) and/or receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) for each resource. The UE may also record the signal measurements. The UE may generate a packet (e.g., a medium access control (MAC), packet data unit (PDU)) for transmission. Upon generating the packet, the UE may trigger a resource selection. The UE may define a sensing window and a resource selection window in the resource pool with respect to a time when the resource selection is triggered. The sensing window may be located prior to the trigger, and the resource selection window may be located after the trigger. The UE may determine the sensing window and the resource selection window based on a set of parameters, which may be preconfigured and/or predetermined).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The UE may identify candidate resources within the resource selection window based on past sensing results (e.g., decoded SCI and/or signal measurements) obtained in the sensing window. In other words, the UE may predict resource usages in the resource selection window based on the past sensing results. The UE may randomly select a resource from the identified candidate resources. The UE may transmit a sidelink transmission (e.g., including SCI in a PSCCH and the packet in a PSSCH) using the selected resource. In some instances, the UE may select multiple resources from the candidate resources, for example, a first resource for an initial transmission of the packet and a second resource for a retransmission of the packet when hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is used for the packet transmission.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an NR-U network <b>30</b> configured for sidelink communications between any one or more of UEs <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>115</b><i>c</i>.

COT sharing nodes, UEs <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b>, and <b>115</b><i>d</i>, can start transmissions at selected resource blocks within shared COT region <b>402</b> even if there is a gap larger than 25 &#x3bc;s between the end of the COT initiating device's, UE <b>115</b><i>b</i>'s, last transmission. It should further be noted that, in such a scenario, there is a possibility that another radio access technology (RAT) transmitter may occupy the shared resources where there is a large gap (&#x3e;25 &#x3bc;s), which could cause LBT failure and resource reselection.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In such existing scenarios associated with sidelink COT sharing, a question may exist as to how the MAC layer of the sidelink transmitting UE knows the resource candidates in a legacy resource selection window are located within a shared COT region (referred to as &#x201c;in-COT&#x201d;) or outside of a COT (referred to as &#x201c;out-COT&#x201d;).
