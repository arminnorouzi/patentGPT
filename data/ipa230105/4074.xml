The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to an optical apparatus, and particularly relates to a projection apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of projection technology, users' requirements for the quality of the projected image (e.g., resolution, brightness, and color purity) are increasing, and accordingly, the heat generated by the operation of the light source and light valve is also increasing. In general, in order to improve the brightness or color purity, a common practice is to add other colors of laser diode (LD) light source, such as red laser diode, or other colors of light emitting diode (LED), such as red light emitting diode, resulting in a significant increase in the overall heat generated by the operation of the light source. In detail, the interior of the projection apparatus is equipped with thermal fin and fan, in which the thermal fins are thermally coupled to a heat source (e.g., a light source and a light valve) and the fan is configured to generate forced convection to bring outside cold air into the interior of the projection apparatus. Then, the cold air exchanges heat inside the projection apparatus to form hot air, and the hot air is forcibly exhausted by the fan.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In existing projection devices, the air inlet is located on the rear cover of the casing, while the air outlet is located on the side cover of the casing. To improve the heat dissipation efficiency and light output efficiency, the light source is located in the upstream of the flow field, and the projection lens is located roughly in the middle and downstream of the flow field in contrast. In other words, after the cold air enters from the air inlet to the interior of the casing, the cold air first exchanges heat with the light source to form hot air, and then flows to the air outlet. During the flow of hot air to the air outlet, the hot air flows through the projection lens, resulting in poor heat dissipation and thermal expansion of the projection lens, causing the focal length to drift, thus affecting the image quality. To solve the problem of heat expansion of the projection lens, the design of air inlet in the bottom cover of the casing has been proposed. However, because the bottom cover of the casing is close to the desktop and has a high flow resistance, it is not easy for cold air to enter the interior of the casing from the air inlet of the bottom cover, which has a limited effect on the heat dissipation of the projection lens.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Further, the information disclosed in the Background section does not mean that one or more problems to be resolved by one or more embodiments of the invention was acknowledged by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure provides a projection apparatus having favorable heat dissipation efficiency and capable of providing favorable image quality.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other purposes and advantages of the disclosure may be further understood from the technical features disclosed in the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve one or part or all of the above objectives or other objectives, an embodiment of the disclosure provides a projection apparatus including a casing, a projection lens, a first light source module, a second light source module, a first thermal module, a second thermal module, a first fan, and a second fan. The casing includes a bottom cover, a front cover, a rear cover opposite to the front cover, a first side cover, and a second side cover opposite to the first side cover. The front cover, the rear cover, the first side cover, and the second side cover are disposed around the bottom cover and define an internal space. The projection lens is disposed in the casing. The bottom cover has a first air inlet connected to the internal space and corresponding to the projection lens, and the first air inlet is located between the front cover and the rear cover. An extension line of an optical axis of the projection lens divides the internal space into a first area and a second area. The rear cover has a second air inlet connected to the first area, and the first side cover has a first air outlet connected to the first area. The first light source module, the second light source module, the first thermal module, the second thermal module, the first fan, and the second fan are disposed in the first area. The first light source module is thermally coupled to the first thermal module. The first thermal module is located between the first air inlet and the first fan, and the first fan is located between the first thermal module and the first air outlet. The second light source module is thermally coupled to the second thermal module. The second thermal module is located between the second air inlet and the second fan, and the second fan is located between the second thermal module and the first air outlet.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the above, the embodiments of the disclosure have at least one of the following advantages or effects. According to the embodiments of the disclosure, heat generated during operation of the first light source module and the second light source module is exhausted to outside of the casing through two different heat dissipation ways, thus helping to improve heat dissipation efficiency of the projection apparatus. Furthermore, the heat generated during the operation of the first light source module is transferred to the first thermal module, and then cold air flowing into the first area from the first air inlet of the bottom cover exchanges heat with the first thermal module to form hot air. On the other hand, the heat generated during the operation of the second light source module is conducted to the second thermal module, and then cold air flowing into the first area from the second air inlet of the rear cover exchanges heat with the second thermal module to form hot air. Finally, the hot air is exhausted from the internal space of the casing through the first air outlet of the first side cover. In addition, the cold air flowing into the first area from the first air inlet of the bottom cover cools the projection lens before flowing to the first thermal module. In other words, the projection lens is located upstream of flow field, so the projection lens may be cooled by cold air to avoid thermal expansion, thus improving the quality of the image projected by the projection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other objectives, features and advantages of the present invention will be further understood from the further technological features disclosed by the embodiments of the present invention wherein there are shown and described preferred embodiments of this invention, simply by way of illustration of modes best suited to carry out the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosure, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.
