Multi-point transmission schemes have been a part of the third generation (3G) specification for long-term evolution (LTE) networks since Release 11. They have been proven to be a powerful concept in achieving higher throughput and capacity, especially at the cell edge. However, the early versions of multi-point transmission schemes, especially those described in 3G Release 11, require ultra low latency transport support for fast coordination between the multiple-transmission points and a cloud based or centralized radio access network (C-RAN) architecture. With a C-RAN architecture, the baseband processing for many cells is centralized and a centralized scheduler is employed to coordinate transmissions between the TPs. These types of multi-point transmission schemes are referred to as &#x201c;coordinated&#x201d; multi-point (CoMP) transmission schemes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">5G wireless systems represent the next major phase of mobile telecommunications standards beyond. Rather than faster peak Internet connection speeds, 5G planning aims at higher capacity than 3G and fourth generation (4G) LTE systems, allowing higher number of mobile broadband users per area unit, and allowing consumption of higher or unlimited data quantities. This would make it feasible for a large portion of the population to stream high-definition media many hours per day with their mobile devices, when out of reach of wireless fidelity hotspots.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multi-point transmission has become an essential technique to improve the fairness and reliability of a wireless network. Multi-point transmission will be particularly important in future wireless networks such as 5G networks and beyond, since operating at high frequency makes cell edge guarantee a very difficult proposition. However, the low latency transport and C-RAN architecture requirements of CoMP transmission schemes are becoming progressively more difficult to achieve in advanced wireless communication systems, such as advanced LTE systems, 5G systems, and beyond. This is because advanced wireless networks require super low latency and high bandwidth. For example, in 5G networks, the time-scales over which TP schedulers need to be coordinated can be significantly less than the times-scales in LTE, due to a smaller transmission time interval (TTI) used to achieve super low latency (e.g., from about 125 micro seconds (&#x3bc;sec) to about 250 &#x3bc;sec for 5G compared to 1.0 millisecond (msec) for LTE). With such a tight scheduling time-scale for coordination, it is difficult to realize a C-RAN architecture for 5G under certain scenarios. Accordingly, multi-point transmission schemes that do not require the tight scheduling coordination between TPs associated with current CoMP transmission schemes are needed for advanced wireless networks.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an example wireless communication system that facilitates asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides an illustration demonstrating principles of an example LTE CoMP transmission scheme in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides an illustration demonstrating principles of an example asynchronous multi-point transmission scheme in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> presents high level a block diagram of an example UE configured to operate using asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> presents a flow diagram of an example process facilitating asynchronous multi-point transmission by two or more TPs transmission based on UE determined rank and layer partitioning between the two or more TPs, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> presents a flow diagram of an example process facilitating asynchronous multi-point transmission by two or more TPs transmission based on UE determined PRB partitioning between the two or more TPs, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> presents a high level block diagram of an example network TP device configured to facilitate asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example method that facilitates asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another example method that facilitates asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example method that facilitates asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts an example schematic block diagram of a computing environment with which the disclosed subject matter can interact.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of a computing system operable to execute the disclosed systems and methods in accordance with an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The subject disclosure is directed to computer processing systems, computer-implemented methods, apparatus and/or computer program products that facilitate asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes for 5G MIMO networks. With the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, instead of having the network devices (e.g., the network TPs, the network scheduler(s) devices, etc.) perform coordination task between TPs, the coordination can be performed completely by the UE or distributed between the UE and the TPs. This allows the plurality of TPs (e.g., two or more) to run with little or no coordination. In addition, a centralized scheduling entity is not required. On the contrary, independent schedulers can be deployed at each TP in the network and the TPs respectively communicating with a UE can autonomously perform radio frequency (RF) signaling procedures with the UE. As a result, the subject multi-point transmission schemes do not require ultra low latency transport nor a C-RAN architectures.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one or more embodiments, in order to achieve multi-point transmission with relaxed TP coordination, respective TPs communicating with a UE can be configured to send separate code-words to the UE. Unlike traditional CoMP transmission, in this case, the separate code-words can include different information intended for the UE. In particular, each TP can be configured to transmit multiple layers and multiple code-word(s) to the UE and the UE can be configured to interpret the different spatial layers and code-words received from the respective TPs. Because the code-words and spatial layers transmitted by each TP do not need to be coordinated (i.e., the same), each TP can use independent schedulers. In addition, since separate schedulers can be used, it is not necessary for the physical resource block (PRB) allocation (i.e., resource allocation) of the spatial layers and code-word(s) from all the TPs to be same. As a result, the resource blocks and spatial layers allocated from each TP can also be independent. Further, since the UE receives the spatial layers from the plurality of TP independently, there is no need to maintain a strict quasi co-located (QCL) criteria between the TPs.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, various embodiments, the UE can partition the spatial layers and the PRBs between the TPs (e.g., based on channel state information (CSI) measured and/or determined by the UE). In some implementations, in association with partitioning the spatial layers, the UE can ensure the layer mapping is different for each TP to avoid having the TPs using the same layer(s). In one or more embodiments, the UE can also be configured to partition the transmission rank between the TPs based on the partitioned PRB. In association with partitioning the transmission rank between the TPs, the UE can also be configured to partition the rank to ensure that the total rank of the transmission across all the TP does not exceed the maximum rank capability of the UE. The UE can use all or a combination of some of these capabilities to perform the multi-point transmission coordination on its end and indicate to the network TPs the transmission parameters and hypothesis for each TP. For example, the UE can be configured to provide the respective TPs with feedback regarding the partitioned spatial layers, PRB and transmission rank. The TPs can then employ the feedback when sending code-word transmissions to the UE. In various additional embodiments, the TPs or their schedulers can be configured to perform some &#x201c;slow&#x201d; coordination to ensure that the total rank of the transmission across all the TP does not exceed the maximum rank the UE can handle and the layer mapping is different from each TP to avoid using the same layer on two TPs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The subject, asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes remove the need for the infrastructure based coordination required for LTE CoMP transmission. Unlike the LTE CoMP transmission, the subject multi-point transmission schemes do not require ultra low latency transport between TPs for fast coordination. Nor do the subject multi-point transmission schemes require centralized scheduling, such as that provided by a C-RAN like architecture (which is mandatory for LTE CoMP transmission but can be hard to achieve). The ability for the proposed asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes to work with independent schedulers and minimal coordination make them extremely valuable for 5G MIMO technology, making the deployment of 5G networks significantly easier.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, a method is provided that includes receiving, by a device comprising a processor, a first data signal from a first TP device of a wireless communication network, wherein the first data signal comprises first code-word information generated based on a data directed to the device from another device.

Additionally, substantially all aspects disclosed herein can be exploited in legacy telecommunication technologies.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one or more embodiments, system <b>100</b> is adapted to facilitate asynchronous multi-point transmission between the TPs (e.g., network TP devices <b>104</b>) and UEs (UE <b>102</b>) of the system <b>100</b>. Multi-point transmission is a concept wherein data is transmitted to a UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>) from geographically separated TPs (e.g., network TP devices <b>104</b>) to improve performance, especially for those UEs that would otherwise, in the case of downlink, see significant interference from multiple transmission points. In traditional LTE multi-point transmission schemes such as CoMP transmission, transmissions sent by the respective TPs (e.g., the network TP devices <b>104</b>) to the UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>) must be tightly coordinated with respect to transmission signal content, transmission parameters and timing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> presents an illustration demonstrating principles of a traditional LTE CoMP transmission scheme <b>200</b> in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure. For example, the LTE CoMP transmission scheme <b>200</b> can represent the classic joint transmission (JT) schemes as defined in the LTE Release 11.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, two network nodes, TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b> respectively, are transmitting data signals to a UE <b>102</b>. Traditional multi-point transmission schemes as used in LTE require all the TPs to transmit the same data content. For example, in the embodiment shown, TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b> are respectively transmitting code-words 1-N. The term &#x201c;code-word&#x201d; refers to the user data before it is formatted for transmission. One or two code-words may be used per TTI depending on the conditions of the channel and the use case. In the most common case of a single user MIMO (SU-MIMO), two code-words are sent to a single handset UE per TTI.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition to transmitting the same code-words, with traditional LTE multi-transmission schemes, the respective TPs must transmit data signals using the same transmission formatting parameters, including but not limited to: layer mapping, modulation and coding schemed (MCS) level, occupied PRBs for each of the code-words, etc. For example, in conventional non-CoMP multi-antenna (MIMO) operation and CoMP operation, the respective TPs adapts the transmission parameters based on the quality of the link to the UE. In this so-called &#x201c;link adaptation&#x201d; as commonly adopted in modern wireless communications, the UE <b>102</b> needs to estimate a channel state information (CSI) for a hypothetical data transmission. To support joint transmission associated with CoMP, the UE has to feedback the CSI information, assuming joint transmission from the aggregated set of antennas corresponding to the transmission points (e.g., TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b>). Such CSI could include information related to the transmission rank, which is essentially the number of spatial streams transmitted to a UE, the channel quality index information, which is essentially the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) that can be supported on each of the code-words that may be mapped to the spatial streams, and the precoding matrix index (PMI), which is the precoding weights used on the aggregated set of antennas channel quality information (CQI or sum CQI) and the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The respective TPs then coordinate common transmission parameters (e.g., using a shared scheduler <b>201</b>) for usage when transmitting data signals to the UE. In particular, based on feedback received from the UE <b>102</b>, the scheduler <b>201</b> can determine ideal parameters for layer mapping, MCS level, occupied PRBs for each of the code-words, etc. For example, in the embodiment shown, a common PRB allocation of the code-words is shared between the respective TPs and applied to the signals respectively transmitted by the TPs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, with LTE CoMP, the timing of reception, by the UE, of respective signals transmitted by different TPs must also be coordinated. For example, when the code-words, spatial layers, PRB allocation, etc. of the respective signals received by the UE from the different TPs are the same, the UE signals are intended to be interpreted by the UE as echoes of one another. The UE is configured to interpret both signals as a unified signal in accordance with multipath signaling techniques. In order for the UE to interpret both signals in accordance with multipath processing, both signals need to be received within a minimal time delay. Accordingly, with traditional LTE CoMP techniques, the respective TP must coordinate their transmissions in the time domain to appear to be what is referred to herein as quasi co-located (QCL), to the UE. The term QCL indicates that the signals transmitted by the respective TPs are received at the UE with sufficient time-frequency coherence to be received with a single synchronization instance (e.g., within a single fast Fourier transform (FFT)). Therefore, even though the TPs are not actually co-located they appear as such to the receiver at the UE.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">With Reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in order to achieve coordinated signaling between TPs with respect to content, formatting, and time, traditional LTE CoMP schemes require the network (e.g., network <b>100</b>) to employ a C-RAN or C-RAN like architecture to centralize the scheduling operations and implement an ultralow latency transport between TPs. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the TPs share a centralized scheduler <b>201</b> that performs the coordination both the TPs. Alternatively, multiple schedulers can be used for the respective TPs as long as &#x201c;ideal&#x201d; backhaul is achieved. In this context &#x201c;ideal&#x201d; backhaul refers to having zero latency and infinite bandwidth between the schedulers therefore any kind of coordination between the schedulers can be achieved instantly. In the case of 5G these limitations needed for tight TP coordination become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the shrinking latency budget and increasing transport bandwidth targeted with 5G networks. For example, in 5G networks, to achieve super low latency, the TTI over which TP schedulers need to be coordinated can be less than 250 &#x3bc;sec to even about 125 &#x3bc;sec. This time scale interval is significantly less than that require for traditional LTE, which is about 1.0 msec. With such a tight scheduling time-scale for coordination, the stringent coordination requirements of traditional LTE multi-point transmission techniques make it very difficult to nearly impossible to achieve CoMP transmission while providing the ultra low latency and high bandwidth desired for advanced wireless communication networks (e.g., 5G networks).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The disclosed multi-point transmission techniques mitigate the restrictions attributed to the tight coordinated scheduling requirements of CoMP transmission schemes using a techniques referred to herein as asynchronous multi-point transmission. The subject multi-point transmission techniques are referred to as &#x201c;asynchronous&#x201d; because unlike traditional LTE multi-point transmission schemes like CoMP transmission, the TPs of system <b>100</b> (i.e., the network TP devices <b>104</b>) do not need to tightly coordinate data transmissions sent by two or more of the TPs (e.g., the respective network TP devices <b>104</b>) to a single UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>), with respect to content, formatting and timing. On the contrary, with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, the code-words and/or one or more of the transmission parameters (e.g., such as layer mapping, MCS level, occupied PRBs for each of the code-words, etc.) sent from the different geographically separated TPs (e.g., the respective network TP devices <b>104</b>) to the UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>) can be different. In addition, because the UE receives the code-words and spatial layers from the respective TPs independently, there is no need to maintain a strict QCL timing criteria between the multiple TPs. Thus, the TPs or schedulers for the TPs can perform little or no coordination/synchronization with respect to transmission signal content, formatting and timing. Further, a centralized scheduler or scheduling system is also not needed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides an illustration demonstrating principles of an example asynchronous multi-point transmission scheme <b>300</b> in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, two network nodes, TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b> respectively, are transmitting data signals to a UE <b>102</b>. However, unlike the traditional LTE CoMP transmission schemes (e.g., scheme <b>200</b>), the data streams include different code-words. For example, TP<b>2</b> is transmitting code-words 1-M and TP<b>2</b> is transmitting code-words M+1 to N. The term code-word is used in wireless communication technology to refer to PHY layer encoded bits. In accordance with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, reference to code-words being different can mean one of the following: 1. the code-words include or represent the same data, yet have different encoding schemes; 2. the code-words include or represent different subsets or portions of the same data and have same encoding schemes; or 3. the code-words include or represent different subsets or portions of the same data, yet have different encoding schemes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, data that is processed via one or more network devices <b>108</b> and sent to the respective TPs as assigned by the data assignment platform <b>110</b> is sent to and received at the respective TPs as one or more data transport blocks. When a data transport block is received by a network TP device <b>104</b>, the data transport block is processed into a code-word prior to sending to the UE in a data signal. There are a number of steps involved in this process, depending on the length of the transport block. For example, in some implementations, the network TP device (or the scheduler of the network TP device) can first append a 24 bit checksum (CRC) to the transport block. This CRC is used to determine whether the transmission was successful or not, and triggers Hybrid ARQ to send an ACK or NACK, as appropriate. Then the transport block is segmented into code blocks. A code block must be between 40 and 6144 bits long. If the transport block is too small, it is padded up to 40 bits; if the transport block is too big, it is divided into smaller pieces, each of which gets an additional 24 bit CRC. Next, each code block is processed with a &#x2153; turbo coder and the resulting code blocks are reassembled into a single codeword. A codeword, then, is essentially a transport block with error protection. In various transmission protocols, the UE may be configured to receive one or two transport blocks (and hence one or two code-words) in a single TTI.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In traditional CoMP transmission schemes, a network node (e.g., the data assignment platform <b>110</b>) receives data directed to the UE and sends copies of the same data to the respective TPs participating in multi-point transmission. For example, the network node sends, (or directs a network device to send), data transport blocks to each of the TPs, wherein each of the data transport blocks include the same data. The respective TPs then process the data transport blocks into data signals comprising same code-words (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), wherein each of the code-words represent the same data. The respective TPs also coordinate processing of the respective transport blocks into the same code-words (wherein the respective code-words have the same encoding scheme). In this case, the UE receives data signals from the respective TPs that include different copies of the data from different transmission points. This type of transmission scheme is used to increase the reliability that the UE receives at least one copy of the data in case the communication links between the UE and one or more of the respective TPs are unreliable.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, the respective TPs can send the UE the same data or different data. In particular, in some embodiments, when data directed to the UE is received and processed by the data assignment platform <b>110</b>, the data assignment platform can send the respective TPs data transport blocks that include or represent same copies of the data. The TPs can then process the data transport blocks into data signals respectively comprising code-words representative of the same data. In other embodiments, the data assignment platform <b>110</b> can divide the data directed to the UE into two or more different portions or subsets of the data. The data assignment platform <b>110</b> can further send (or direct a network device <b>108</b> to send), each of the TPs data transport blocks that respectively represent different portions of subsets of the data. Each of the TPs can then process their respective portions or subsets of the data into data signals comprising different code-words, wherein the code-words respectively represent the different portions or subsets of the data. At the receiver side, the UE can combine the respective portions to generate a data stream, structure, etc., representative of the data as a whole. Breaking up the data directed to a UE into different portions or subsets and having different TPs transmit the different portions or subsets to the UE increases the overall signaling throughput.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to the respective TPs being able to transmit the UE different portions or subsets of a data traffic directed to the UE, the manner in which the respective TPs process a data transport block into a code-word does not need to be synchronized. As a result, the respective TPs can generate code-words with different encoding schemes. Accordingly, in some implementations, the code-words transmitted by the respective TPs can represent the same data sent to the UE by another device (e.g., same data packet or packets, data stream, data block, data segment, etc.), yet having different encoding schemes. In other implementations, the code-words transmitted by the respective TPs can represent different subsets or portions of the same data sent to the UE by another device and have same encoding schemes. Still in other implementations, the code-words transmitted by the respective TPs can represent different subsets or portions of the same data sent to the UE by another device and have different encoding schemes. Finally, in some implementations, the code-words transmitted by the respective TPs can represent the same data have same encoding schemes (as with traditional CoMP). With these implementations however, the data signals sent by the respective TPs can still be unsynchronized in time and frequency (e.g., PRB allocation and spatial layer allocation, as discussed below).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition to transmitting different code-words, unlike the traditional LTE CoMP transmission schemes (e.g., scheme <b>200</b>), with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes (e.g., scheme <b>300</b>), the respective TPs can transmit the data signals using different transmission formatting parameters, (e.g., layer mapping, MCS level, occupied PRBs for each of the code-words, etc.). For example, in the embodiment shown, TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b> have independent schedulers, schedulers <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> respectively. Each of the schedulers can independently analyze CSI feedback provided thereto by the UE <b>102</b> and autonomously determine PRB allocation for the code-words. For instance, the PRB allocation of the code-words from scheduler <b>301</b> is different from the PRB allocation of the code-words from scheduler <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, (e.g., scheme <b>300</b>), separate code-word(s) can be transmitted from each TP (e.g., TP<b>1</b> and TP<b>2</b>). Unlike traditional multi-point transmission, with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, the TPs are not required to transmit the same information. Rather each TP can transmit multiple layers and multiple code-word(s) to the UE. As a result, the respective TPs can employ independent schedulers (e.g., schedulers <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>). Since separate schedulers are used it is not necessary for the PRB allocation (resource allocation) of the layers and code-word(s) from all the TPs to be same. This is at the core of the asynchronous multi-point transmission where the resource blocks allocated from each TP are independent. In addition, the TPs can schedule data transmission using independent schedulers with &#x201c;non-ideal&#x201d; backhaul between them. In this context &#x201c;non-ideal&#x201d; backhaul refers to having non-zero latency and finite bandwidth between the schedulers, thereby facilitating substantially long term coordination between the schedulers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, since the UE receives the spatial layers from the TPs independently there, is no need to maintain a maintain strict time-frequency synchronization (e.g., QCL appearance) between the multiple TP. In particular, multiple and separate layers of the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) are transmitted from different TP (e.g., the different network TP devices <b>104</b>) which can be treated as regular single user (SU)-MIMO at the UE. In some embodiments, the UE can optionally use advanced receiver processing techniques to address the possible inter-layer interference. In association with relaxing the QCL requirements associated with CoMP schemes, with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, the amount and type of the CSI information provided by the UE to the respective TPs can vary. For example, in some implementations, only a subset of QCL related assumption information can be provided to the TPs (or their schedulers) by the UE <b>102</b> (e.g., beamforming weights, delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, and average delay) in order to achieve the relaxed QCL requirements of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes. The type and amount of QCL assumption information needed to achieve the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission scheme should be evaluated carefully and can depend on the UE receive capability.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In accordance with various implementations, since the different TPs (e.g., the network TP devices <b>104</b>) transmit multiple layers to the UE <b>102</b> independently, the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes can account for the case where the total transmitted rank exceeds that maximum rank handling capability of the UE. For example, if the UE has a maximum rank handling capability of 4 layers and each TP schedules 3 layers for the code-word(s) it is transmitting then the total rank at the UE is 6, more than what the UE can receive. In this scenarios the UE will not be able to decode the data and the transmission will be wasted. Therefore, even though respective TPs can employ separate schedulers, some degree of coordination with respect to rank and layer partitioning between the respective TPs can provided by the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, in order to achieve rank and layer partitioning, the TPs (e.g., network TP devices <b>104</b>) or their schedulers (not shown) can be configured to perform some &#x201c;slow&#x201d; TP coordination (e.g., wherein slow means with relatively low transport latency) to ensure that the total rank of the transmissions across all the TPs does not exceed the maximum rank the UE can handle and the layer mapping is different from each TP to avoid using the same layer on two or more TPs. In other embodiments, the UE can take on the responsibility of partitioning/assigning the spatial layers, PRB and transmission rank between TPs. For example, the UE <b>102</b> can be configured to determine (e.g., based on CSI, UE capability information, etc.) how to partition the spatial layers, PRB and transmission rank. The UE can further provide the respective TPs with feedback regarding the partitioned spatial layers, PRB and transmission rank. The TPs can then employ the feedback when formatting and sending code-word transmissions to the UE. These rank and layer partitioning coordination features are described in greater detail infra with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The subject, asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques remove the need for the infrastructure based coordination required for LTE CoMP transmission. Unlike the LTE CoMP transmission, the asynchronous subject multi-point transmission schemes do not require ultra low latency transport between TPs for fast coordination. Nor do the subject multi-point transmission schemes require centralized scheduling, such as that provided by a C-RAN like architecture (which is mandatory for LTE CoMP transmission but can be hard to achieve). Multi-point transmission has become an essential technique to improve the fairness and reliability of wireless communication networks. Multi-point transmission will be particularly important in future wireless networks such as 5G networks and beyond, since operating at high frequency makes cell edge guarantee a very difficult proposition. The ability for the proposed asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes to work with independent schedulers and minimal coordination make them extremely valuable for 5G MIMO technology.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> presents a high level block diagram of an example UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>) configured to operate using asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.

For example, the communication component <b>402</b> can include a reception component <b>404</b> that can include hardware and/or software to facilitate receiving and processing radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted to the UE <b>102</b> from another device. The communication component <b>402</b> can also include a transmission component <b>406</b> that can include hardware and/or software that facilitates transmitting RF data signals to other devices, including the respective network TP devices <b>104</b> of system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the communication component <b>402</b> can includes a single antenna or port. In other embodiments, the communication component <b>402</b> can include a plurality of antenna's or ports. In various exemplary embodiments, the communication component <b>402</b> can support MIMO wireless communication protocols, including at least relatively simultaneous reception (e.g., in accordance with the relaxed QCL requirements of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques) of data signals transmitted by two or more geographically separated TPs. For example, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure, the receiver <b>404</b> can include hardware and software configured to receive and process (e.g., decode), RF data signals transmitted from two or more geographically separated TPs in accordance with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Unlike traditional LTE CoMP multi-point transmission schemes, the data signals received and processed by the reception component <b>404</b> from two or more geographically separated TPs can be different with respect to content/information, formatting and/or reception time. For example, each of the data signals received from the respective TPs can include different code-word data. Unlike traditional multi-point transmission, with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes the TPs are not required to transmit the same information. Rather each TP can transmit different code-words and the reception component <b>404</b> can be configured to decode, process and combine the different code-word information included in the respective data signals to output a single data stream, data structure, data block, etc., that represents the original data sent to the UE and then assigned to the respective TPs (e.g., by the data assignment platform <b>110</b>). As discussed above, the code-words can be different based on one of the following: e following: 1. they include or represent the same data, yet have different encoding schemes; 2. they include or represent different subsets or portions of the same data and have same encoding schemes; or 3. they include or represent different subsets of portions of the same data, yet have different encoding schemes.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, to the data signals received from different TPs possibly including one or more different code-words, the code-words can be partitioned or mapped onto different spatial layers of the PDSCH. For example, with spatial multiplexing transmission techniques, one or more code-words may be distributed across 1, 2, 3 or 4 spatial layers. In various implementations, the number of layers used in any particular transmission depends (at least in part) on the rank indication (RI) feedback received from the UE, which identifies how many layers the UE can discern and/or is capable of handling. With the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques, each of the TPs can include schedulers that independently determine the spatial layers used for data transmission. Thus, the reception component <b>404</b> can receive data signals from different geographically separated TPs, wherein at least one of the data signals includes one or more code-words mapped to different spatial layer(s) than another data signal. In various implementations, the receiver component <b>404</b> can further process the different spatially partitioned data signals using SU-MIMO processing techniques with optional advanced receiver processing to address potential inter-layer interference.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the frequency allocation of the respective data signals received by the UE <b>102</b> receiver from two or more TPs can also by unsynchronized and thus vary. In particular, since separate schedulers are used by the respective TPs to schedule the respective data signals, it is not necessary for the PRB allocation (resource allocation) of the layers and code-word(s) from all the TPs to be same (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). This is at the core of the asynchronous multi-point transmission where the resource blocks allocated from each TP are independent. Thus, in various implementations, the resource blocks configurations of the respective data signals received by the UE <b>102</b> reception component <b>404</b> from two or more different TPs can vary.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, another criteria relaxed as a result of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes is that the TPs do not need to maintain strict time-frequency synchronization between. Multiple and separate layers of PDSCH are transmitted from different TPs which can be treated as regular SU-MIMO at UE side. Thus, in various embodiments, the timing of transmission and thus reception of the data signals from the respective TPs is not coordinated to maintain the QCL appearance requirement associated with CoMP. For example, in accordance with the subject asynchronous transmission techniques, the UE <b>102</b> reception component <b>404</b> can receive data signals from two or more TPs representative of a same data transport packet, yet the timing of transmission and thus reception of the data signals can be unsynchronized. For example, the window of time between reception of the different data transmissions can vary and be greater than a minimum window of time required for CoMP (e.g., greater than 3 ms).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, in accordance with various implementations of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques, the UE <b>102</b> reception component <b>404</b> can receive two or more data signals from two or more network TPs respectively. Because tight coordinated scheduling between the TPs (or their schedulers) is not performed with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques, one or more of the data signals will (most likely in the absence of a chance coincidence) vary by at least one of: code-word(s) represented, spatial layer mapping, PRB allocation, or timing of receipt. The receiver component <b>404</b> can however be configured to account for this variance and to decode and interpret the data signals to output a single data stream or data packet representative of the original (same) data packet/transport block provided to the respective TPs.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one or more embodiments, the data signals transmitted by two or more TPs in accordance with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques, can be independently process by the respective TPs (or their schedulers) based in part on CSI feedback information provided by the UE to the respective TPs. For example, the particular code-word(s), layer mapping configuration, PRB assignment, MCS level, etc., of each of the data signals transmitted by the respective TPs can be determined based in part on CSI received from the UE <b>102</b>. This CSI information can include one or more parameters related to but not limited to: transmission rank information (RI), the channel quality index information, MCS information, PMI information, beamforming weights, delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, and average delay, and the like. According to these embodiments, the UE can include CSI component <b>408</b> to determine CSI information for provision to the respective TPs. For example, the UE <b>102</b> can include CSI component <b>408</b> to perform CSI estimation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In wireless communications, channel state information (CSI) refers to known channel properties of a communication link. This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with distance. The method is called channel estimation. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving reliable communication with high data rates in MIMO systems. CSI needs to be estimated at the receiving device (i.e., the UE <b>102</b> with respect to multi-point transmission) and quantized and fed back to the transmitting device (e.g., the network TP device), although reverse-link estimation is possible in TDD systems. Therefore, the transmitter and receiver can have different CSI. The CSI at the transmitter and the CSI at the receiver are sometimes referred to as CSIT and CSIR, respectively.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one or more embodiments, in association with facilitating asynchronous multi-point transmission, the CSI component <b>508</b> can be configured to determine different CSI information for the respective TPs. The different CSI information can respectively represent the channel conditions associated with the respective links between the UE <b>102</b> and each of the TPs. For example, the UE can be configured with CSI resources (CSI-RS) from each of the TPs participating in an asynchronous multi-point transmission scheme. However, instead of measuring all the CSI-RS as a single CSI resource, the CSI component <b>508</b> can be configured to determine or measure the CSI-RS from each TP independently. This can be achieved by configuring the CSI component <b>508</b> to measure only partial CSI-RS or by configuring the CSI component <b>508</b> to measure the CSI-RS from each TP as a separate resource. The CSI component <b>508</b> can further be configured to provide each of the TPs with the CSI-RS information determined independently each TP. Each TP can thus make their own decisions regarding code-word(s), signal layer and frequency formatting, PRB allocation, etc., based in part of the individual CSI-RS information provided thereto.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, two or more TPs transmit multiple layers to each UE independently. Accordingly, in some scenarios, without any coordination between the TPs, the total transmitted rank may exceed that maximum rank handling capability of the UE. In some embodiments, in order to prevent this scenario, the TPs or their schedulers can perform some soft coordination to ensure the rank is partitioned between the TPs such that the total transmission rank does not exceed the maximum rank handling capability of the UE. This soft coordination can involve, rank and spatial layer partitioning as well as PRB partitioning. These soft coordination techniques are discussed in greater detail infra with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and the soft coordination component <b>718</b>. In other embodiments, the UE can be configured to perform some UE side processing to partition rank, spatial layer mapping and PRB assignments between the respective TPs. The UE can further be configured to instruct the respective TP to process and format data packets or data transfer blocks accordingly in association with jointly transmitting data signals representative of the data packets/blocks to the UE. According to these embodiments, the UE can include rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, layer partitioning component <b>414</b> and PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> presents a flow diagram of an example process <b>500</b> facilitating asynchronous multi-point transmission by two or more TPs transmission based on UE determined rank and layer partitioning between the two or more TPs, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure. In one or more embodiments, process <b>500</b> can be performed by UE <b>102</b> using CSI component <b>408</b>, rank partitioning component <b>512</b> and layer partitioning component <b>516</b>.

For example, for each TP involved in the multi-point transmission scheme, the CSI component <b>408</b> can determine CSI-RI information associated with the communication link established between the UE and the TP. At <b>504</b>, using the rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, the UE can determine the total rank of the shared PDSCH channel based on the collective CSI-RS information. For example, based on the CSI-RS information for each UE TP link, the UE can determine individual transmission ranks associated with each link. The UE can then determine the total rank of the channel based on the sum of the ranks associated with each link. At <b>506</b>, using the rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, the UE determines whether the total rank of the channel exceeds the UE maximum rank.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">If at <b>506</b>, the UE determines the total rank does not exceed the UE maximum rank capability, then method <b>500</b> continues to <b>508</b>, wherein the UE sends the CSI-RS information for the respective TPs to the respective TPs. Then at <b>510</b>, the UE receives data signals from the respective TPs based (in part) on the CSI-RS information. For example, the respective TPs can determine how to process a jointly received data transport block for transmitting to the UE based on the respective CSI-RS information provided to each TP from the UE. In some embodiments, the respective TPs can independently determine how to configure the code-word(s), how to map the code-word(s) to one or more spatial layers, how to assign the code-word(s) to respective PRB, etc. The TPs can further send the UE with data signals comprising information representative of the code-word(s) in their determined transmission format without synchronizing the time of transmission. Accordingly, in various embodiments, the respective data signals received by the UE from the different TPs will not be synchronized in time, frequency and/or (code-word) content. In some implementations, the TPs can perform some soft coordination prior to sending the data signals to the UE (which are received at <b>510</b>) in order to ensure the total rank of the transmissions does not exceed the maximum rank capability of the UE (as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and the soft coordination component <b>718</b>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">If at <b>506</b>, the UE determines the total rank does exceed the UE maximum rank capability, then method <b>500</b> continues to <b>512</b>. At <b>512</b>, using the rank partitioning component <b>412</b> and the layer partitioning component <b>514</b> respectively, the UE then determines an optimum rank and layer partitioning assignment between the TPs that results in the total rank being less than or equal to the UE maximum rank. For example, the UE can partition the spatial layers between the TPs so that the layer mapping is different from each TP to avoid using the same layer on two or more TPs. The UE can further determine an optimum combination of transmission rank from each TP. Then at <b>514</b>, the UE can send the respective TPs, the CSI-RS information determined for the respective TPs, and rank/layer partitioning assignment information for the respective TPs. For example, the rank/layer partitioning assignment information can indicate to each TP, what transmission rank they are authorized to employ and what spatial layers the respective TPs can use. At <b>516</b>, the UE receive data signals from the respective TPs based on the CSI-RS information (as described above) and the rank/layer partitioning information, wherein the respective data signals are not synchronized in time, frequency and/or (code-word) content. For example, upon the receipt of the rank/layer partitioning assignment information, each TP can be configured to transmit only the spatial layers to which it is assigned and its transmission rank cannot exceed the partitioned rank as indicated by the UE for that TP. However, in some implementations, each TP can choose the PRB allocation completely independently since there is no possibility of the total transmission rank from all the TP even exceeding the maximum rank handling capability of each UE.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In various embodiments, in addition to partitioning the rank and spatial layers employed by respective TPs to transmit data signals to the UE, the UE can also be configured to partition PRB. For example, another possible way to avoid the overall transmission rank from exceeding the UE's maximum rank capability is by partitioning the PRBs between the multiple TPs. So, in essence, each TP can be allowed to transmit only over a subset of the system bandwidth and by ensuring that each TP transmits on disjoint and non-overlapping portions of the system bandwidth we can avoid the case where the transmission rank exceeds the maximum rank handling capability of the UE. As described infra with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and the soft coordination component <b>718</b>, in some embodiments, this disjoint PRB allocation can be achieved by coordination between the multiple schedulers of the respective TPs (much like the rank/layer partitioning). However, in various alternative embodiments, the UE can also be configured to determine the optimum choice of PRBs from each TP using PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>. The UE can then send feedback to the respective TPs directing them to apply PRB assignment configuration determined by the PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> presents a flow diagram of an example process <b>600</b> facilitating asynchronous multi-point transmission by two or more TPs transmission based on UE determined PRB partitioning between the two or more TPs, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure. In one or more embodiments, process <b>600</b> can be performed by UE <b>102</b> using CSI component <b>408</b>, the rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, and PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, in one implementation, in association with partitioning rank and spatial layers, at <b>602</b>, the CSI component <b>408</b> can measure CSI-RS information for TPs independently, wherein the TPs are associated with performing multi-point transmission with the UE. For example, for each TP involved in the multi-point transmission scheme, the CSI component <b>408</b> can determine CSI-RI information associated with the communication link established between the UE and the TP. At <b>604</b>, using the PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>, the UE can determine authorized PRB assignments for the respective TPs based on the CSI-RS information. For example, for each TP, the UE can determine a different set or group of one or more PRBs the TP can use to transmit code-word data. In one or more implementations, the UE can observe the channel over the entire system bandwidth and determines which TP is the best serving TP for a given PRB or group of PRB. Once the best TP is determined for each PRB or group of PRBs, the UE can then also compute a TP specific rank based on the PRB or group of PRBs the TP is allocated. At <b>606</b>, using the PRB partitioning component <b>416</b> and/or the rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, the UE determine transmission ranks for the respective TPs based on their respective authorized PRB assignments such that the total rank of the channel does not exceed the maximum rank of the UE. Once important consideration is that the rank is TP specific and is computed only using the PRBs that the UE has chosen for the given TP.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At <b>608</b>, the UE can send the respective TPs, the CSI-RS information determined for the respective TPs, and PRB/rank partitioning assignment information regarding authorized PRB assignments or ranks for the respective TPs. For example, once the optimum PRB partitioning between the TPs is determined the UE indicates its choice to the network and it also indicates which TP is allowed to transit on which PRB using what transmission rank. At <b>610</b>, the UE receive data signals from the respective TPs based on the CSI-RS information (as described above) and the PRB rank/layer partitioning information, wherein the respective data signals are not synchronized in time, frequency and/or (code-word) content. For example, upon the receipt of this feedback, each TP can be configured to transmit only on the PRBs it is configured to and its transmission rank cannot exceed the rank as indicated by the UE for that TP. This way each TP can choose the PRB allocation completely independently as long as it chooses from the group of PRB it is allocated for the given UE. This also ensures that the maximum transmission rank for a given PRB is less than or equal to the maximum rank handling capability of the UE.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> presents a high level block diagram of an example network TP device (e.g., network TP device <b>104</b>) configured to facilitate asynchronous multi-point transmission in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure.

The communication component <b>702</b> can also facilitated wired and wireless communication between the network TP device <b>104</b> and one or more network devices (e.g., one or more network devices <b>108</b> of the core wireless communication network <b>106</b>), etc. The communication component <b>702</b> can be or include hardware (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), one or more transmitters, one or more receivers, one or more transceivers, one or more decoders), software (e.g., a set of threads, a set of processes, software in execution) or a combination of hardware and software that facilitates one or more of the various types of wireless and wireless communications described herein. For example, the communication component <b>702</b> can include a reception component <b>704</b> that can include hardware and/or software to facilitate receiving and processing radio frequency (RF) signals received from the UE <b>102</b>. The communication component <b>702</b> can also include a transmission component <b>706</b> that can include hardware and/or software that facilitates transmitting RF data signals to other devices, such as the UE <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the communication component <b>702</b> can includes a single antenna or port. In other embodiments, the communication component <b>702</b> can include a plurality of antenna's or ports.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In various exemplary embodiments, the communication component <b>702</b> can support MIMO wireless communication protocols, including at least relatively simultaneous transmission (e.g., in accordance with the relaxed QCL requirements of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques) of data by the network TP device <b>104</b>, and other network TP devices participating in asynchronous multi-point transmission, to a UE. For example, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the subject disclosure, the receiver <b>704</b> can include hardware and software configured to receive transport block data from the PDCP, RLS and MAC layers of a core wireless communication network. The transport block data is the data protocol unit (PDU) that the PHY layer (e.g., the network TP device <b>104</b>) as data directed to a particular UE (e.g., UE <b>102</b>). The network TP device <b>104</b> can be configured to process the data transport block in accordance with one or more aspects of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques (e.g., using the scheduler component <b>716</b>) for sending to the UE via the transmitter component <b>706</b>. The transmitter component <b>706</b> can thus include hardware and/or software to facilitate transmitting the processed data transport block as a data signal to the UE.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As previously described, unlike traditional LTE CoMP multi-point transmission schemes, the data signals sent to a UE by two or more geographically separated TPs can be different with respect to content/information, formatting and/or reception time. For example, a data signal transmitted by the network TP device <b>104</b> can include one or more code-words that represent a portion of data directed to the UE, wherein the one or more other TPs transmit data signals that included code-words representative of the other portions of the data. In another implementation, the network TP device <b>104</b> can transmit a code-word that includes or represents the same data as other code-words transmitted by the one or more other TPs, yet the respective code-words may differ in encoding schemes. In various embodiments, the respective TPs can transmit different code-words because the network TP device <b>104</b> and the other respective TP devices can process data-transport blocks independently and without synchronization or coordination with one another (e.g., using individual schedulers such as scheduler component <b>716</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, the network TP device <b>104</b> can include scheduler component <b>104</b> to facilitate processing and scheduling data transmissions for the network TP device <b>104</b> in accordance with one or more aspects of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes. The scheduler component can include code-word scheduling <b>720</b>, layer scheduling component <b>722</b>, PRB scheduling component <b>724</b>, and timing scheduling component <b>726</b>. The code-word scheduling component <b>720</b> can be configured to process received data transport blocks into code-words. The layer scheduling component <b>722</b> can be configured to map code-words to one or more spatial layers (e.g., of the PDSCH), the PRB scheduling component <b>724</b> can be configured to allocate the code-words and the spatial layers to PRB (e.g., of the PDSCH), and the timing scheduling component <b>726</b> can be configured to schedule the transmission time of data signals sent by the network TP device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In accordance with one or more embodiments, the code-word scheduling component <b>720</b> performs little or no coordination with one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers) in association with generating code-word information from a received data transport block. Accordingly, the code-word information generated by the code-word scheduling component <b>720</b> can be different than the code-word information generated by the one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, to the data signals (generated from the same data transport block) transmitted different TPs possibly including data representing one or more different code-words, the code-words can be partitioned or mapped onto different spatial layers of the PDSCH. For example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the layer scheduling component <b>722</b> can be configured to perform little or no coordination with one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers) in association with mapping code-word information to one or more spatial layers (e.g., of the PDSCH). Accordingly, the data signals generated by the scheduler component <b>716</b> can have different spatial layer mappings relative to data signals generated by the one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, the frequency allocation of the respective data signals (generated from the same data transport block) transmitted to the UE by the network TP device <b>104</b> and one or more other TP can also be unsynchronized and thus vary. In particular, since separate schedulers are used by the respective TPs to schedule the respective data signals, it is not necessary for the PRB allocation (resource allocation) of the layers and code-word(s) from all the TPs to be same (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). This is at the core of the asynchronous multi-point transmission where the resource blocks allocated from each TP are independent. Thus, in various implementations, the PRB scheduling component <b>724</b> can be configured to perform little or no coordination with one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers) in association with allocating code-word information to one or more PRB (e.g., of the PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, another criteria relaxed as a result of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes is that the TPs do not need to maintain strict time-frequency synchronization between. Multiple and separate layers of PDSCH are transmitted from different TPs which can be treated as regular SU-MIMO at UE side. Thus, in various embodiments, the timing of transmission and thus reception of the data signals from the respective TPs is not coordinated to maintain the QCL appearance requirement associated with CoMP. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the timing scheduling component <b>726</b> can be configured to perform little or no coordination with one or more other TP devices (or their schedulers) in association with scheduling the transmission time of data signals sent by the network TP device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the scheduling component <b>716</b> or one or more components of the scheduling component <b>716</b> (e.g., soft coordination component <b>718</b>, code-word scheduling component <b>720</b>, layer scheduling component <b>722</b>, PRB scheduling component <b>724</b>, and timing scheduling component <b>726</b>) can be provided on a separate network device that is communicatively coupled to the network TP device <b>104</b>. For example, in some implementations, the scheduler component <b>716</b> can be, or be included at, a dedicated scheduler device (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;scheduler&#x201d;), that is communicatively coupled to the network TP device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one or more embodiments, the data signals transmitted by two or more TPs in accordance with the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission techniques, can be independently process by the respective TPs (or their schedulers) based in part on CSI feedback information provided by the UE to the respective TPs. For example, the particular code-word(s), layer mapping configuration, PRB assignment, transmission time, MCS level, etc., of the data signals processed and scheduled by the scheduler component <b>716</b> be determined based in part on CSI received from the UE <b>102</b>. This CSI information can include one or more parameters related to but not limited to: transmission rank information (RI), the channel quality index information, MCS information, PMI information, beamforming weights, delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain, and average delay, and the like. According to these embodiments, the network TP device <b>105</b> can include CSI component <b>708</b> to receive CSI information from a UE and provide the information to the scheduler component <b>716</b> to facilitate processing data transport blocks. In various embodiments, the CSI information received by the CSI component <b>708</b> from a UE will be tailored to the network TP device <b>104</b> based on the wireless communication link established between the network TP device <b>104</b> and the UE. For example, a UE can be configured with CSI-RS resources from multiple TPs. But instead of measuring all the CSI-RS as a single CSI-RS resource the UE can be configured to measure the CSI-RS from each TP independently and report the CSI-RS to each TP independently. In various additional embodiments, the CSI component <b>708</b> can also measure transmitter side CSI information (e.g., CSIT), and the scheduler component <b>716</b> can also employ the CSIT in association with independently processing and scheduling data transport blocks.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In various embodiments of the subject asynchronous multi-point transmission schemes, two or more TPs transmit multiple layers to each UE independently. Accordingly, in some scenarios, without any coordination between the TPs, the total transmitted rank may exceed that maximum rank handling capability of the UE. In some embodiments, in order to prevent this scenario, the TPs or their schedulers can perform some soft coordination to ensure the rank is partitioned between the TPs such that the total transmission rank does not exceed the maximum rank handling capability of the UE. According to these embodiments, the scheduler component <b>716</b> can include soft coordination component <b>718</b> to facilitate this soft coordination. The soft coordination component <b>718</b> can be configured to facilitate partitioning the rank, spatial layers and/or PRB between the respective TPs. The soft coordination component <b>718</b> for example can be configured to partition rank, spatial layer and/or PRB in a same or similar manner as the rank partitioning component <b>412</b>, the layer partitioning component <b>414</b> and the PRB partitioning component <b>416</b>, respectively. The coordination performed by the soft coordination component <b>718</b> is considered &#x201c;soft&#x201d; because the time-scale of this soft coordination is not the same as the TTI (transit time interval). This is because rank changes in the channel are observed over much longer time-scales. Therefore, latency of several TTIs or several tens of TTIs can be enough for this kind of slow coordination to partition the ranks, layers and/or PHBS between the TPs.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, with respect to rank and layer partitioning, the soft coordination component <b>718</b> can receive information from the other respective TPs (e.g., via their soft coordination components) regarding their individual ranks and determine whether a total rank of the channel exceeds a total rank of the UE (e.g., based on information RI received from the UE). Based on a determination that the total rank exceeds the UE maximum rank, the soft coordination component can partition the rank between the respective UEs such that the partitioned rank does not exceed the UE maximum rank. The soft coordination component <b>718</b> can also partition the layers between the respective TPs such that they use different and non-overlapping layers. The soft coordination component can then instruct each of the other TPs regarding their rank/layer assignments and their schedulers can configured the data signals accordingly. It should be appreciated that any one of the TPs can take on the coordination role and this can be agreed to by the respective TPs or assigned to a particular TP by the network. In other embodiments, a centralized scheduling device can perform this soft coordination that partitions the rank and layer assignments between the TPs. The PRB can be partitioned between the TPs using a same or similar process.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In other embodiments, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the UE can take on the responsibility of portioning the rank, spatial layers and PHB between the respective TPs. According to these embodiments, in one implementation, the scheduler component <b>716</b> can receive information determined by the UE assigning the TP to a particular rank and spatial layer configuration. Upon the receipt of this feedback the scheduler component can configure data signals for transmission accordingly. For example, the scheduler component layer scheduling component <b>722</b> can configure a data signal for transmission by the network TP only using the spatial layers and rank it is assigned by the UE. However, the PRB scheduling component <b>724</b> can choose the PRB allocation at will (without synchronization with the other TPS PRB allocation) since there is no possibility of the total transmission rank from all the TPs exceeding the maximum rank handling capability of each UE. In another implementation, the scheduler component <b>716</b> can receive information determined by the UE assigning the TP to a particular rank and PRB configuration. The PRB configuration can identify a group of PRB that the network TP is authorized to use as well as the authorized rank. Upon receipt of this feedback, PRB scheduling component <b>724</b> can be configured to employ allocate the code-word information to one or more of the PRB included in the assigned group and the transmission rank cannot exceed the rank as indicated by the UE for that TP. This way each TP can choose the PRB allocation completely independently as long as it chooses from the group of PRBs it is allocated from the UE. This also ensures that the maximum transmission rank for a given PRB is less than or equal to the maximum rank handling capability of the UE.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In view of the example system(s) described above, example method(s) that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can be better appreciated with reference to flowcharts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.

In various implementations, the first code-word information and the second code-word information are different based on usage of separate and unsynchronized transmission signal schedulers (e.g., schedulers <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>) by the first TP device and the second TP device, respectively.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some implementations, the timing of transmission of the first data signal and the second data signal by the first and second TPs can also be unsynchronized.

For example, the first data signal and the second data signal can comprise the different and non-overlapping PRB allocations based on usage of separate and unsynchronized transmission signal schedulers by the first TP device and the second TP device, respectively. In some aspects, despite using separate and unsynchronized schedulers resulting in the different and non-overlapping PHB allocations, the total rank of the first data signal and the second data signal does not exceed a maximum rank capacity of the device. In particular, as described herein, one way to avoid the overall transmission rank from exceeding the UE's maximum rank capability is by partitioning the PRBs between the multiple TPs. For example, by directing each TP to transmit only over a subset of the system bandwidth and ensuring that each TP transmits on disjoint and non-overlapping portions of the system bandwidth, the case where the transmission rank exceeds the maximum rank handling capability of the UE is avoided. In one implementation, this disjoint PRB allocation is achieved based on a result of a PRB partitioning coordination procedure performed between the first TP device and the second TP device.

In this case the spatial layers are partitioned between the multiple TPs with the constraint that the sum of the partitioned layers across all the TPs is equal to or less than the maximum rank that the UE can receive. In one implementation, this spatial layer partitioning is achieved based on a result of a spatial layer and rank partitioning coordination procedure performed between the first TP device and the second TP device.
