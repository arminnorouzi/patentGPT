However, the existing technical structure is complex and requires a large change to the cache, which brings a large area overhead.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a storage circuit, a chip, a data processing method, and an electronic device. The storage circuit includes an input control circuit and a memory. The input circuit is configured to receive n input data and an input control signal; perform first data processing on the n input data based on the input control signal to obtain n intermediate data corresponding to the n input data one by one; write the n intermediate data and a sign signal corresponding to the n input data into the memory; the memory is configured to store the n intermediate data and the sign signal. Different values of the sign signal represent different processing processes of the first data processing, respectively, and n is a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the storage circuit provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, the first data processing is performed on the input data based on the input control signal to obtain the intermediate data, so that the intermediate data stored in the memory can meet the needs of the user. For example, in a case where the memory is the cache, based on the input control signal, the input data stored in the cache is continuously inverted, so as to ensure that the duty cycle of the data stored in the cache is close to or equal to 50%, thereby delaying the aging of the cache, effectively reducing the influence of the aging effect on the cache, greatly prolonging the service life of the cache, and reducing the design overhead. In addition, the type of the first data processing is identified by the sign signal, so that when the intermediate data is output, the intermediate data can be processed based on the sign signal to obtain accurate output data (e.g., the same as the input data).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings, but the present disclosure is not limited to these specific embodiments. In order to keep the following description of the embodiments of the present disclosure clear and concise, the detailed description of some known functions and known components is omitted in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a storage circuit provided by at least one embodiment of the present disclosure; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of another storage circuit provided by at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the storage circuit <b>10</b> includes an input control circuit <b>100</b> and a memory <b>200</b>. For example, the memory <b>200</b> may be a cache, such as L1 Cache and L2 Cache. It should be noted that the memory <b>200</b> may also be other types of memory, and the present disclosure does not specifically limit the type of the memory <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the input control circuit <b>100</b> is configured to receive n input data and an input control signal; perform first data processing on the n input data based on the input control signal to obtain n intermediate data corresponding to the n input data one by one; write the n intermediate data and a sign signal corresponding to the n input data into the memory <b>200</b>. The memory <b>200</b> is configured to store the n intermediate data and the sign signal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, different values of the sign signal respectively represent different processing processes of the first data processing, and n is a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, each input data may be one-bit (1 bit) data, for example, each input data may be a binary number, and the value of each input data may be a binary number of 1 or 0. It should be noted that the present disclosure is not limited to this, and each input data may be two-bit data (i.e., 2 bits), three-bit data (i.e., 3 bits), or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, in some embodiments, the input control circuit <b>100</b> is further configured to determine a sign signal corresponding to the n input data based on the input control signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, in some embodiments, the input control signal may be one-bit data (i.e., 1 bit), and the sign signal may also be one-bit data. The input control signal and the sign signal may be binary numbers, for example, the input control signal may be 0 or 1, and the sign signal may also be 0 or 1. However, the present disclosure is not limited to this case, and the input control signal and the sign signal may also be two-bit data (i.e., 2 bits), three-bit data (i.e., 3 bits), etc. For example, the input control signal may be 00, 01, 10, or 11, and the sign signal may also be 00, 01, 10, or 11. In addition, the input control signal and the sign signal may also be ternary numbers, quaternary numbers, or decimal numbers. The present disclosure does not limit the specific forms and values of the input control signal and the sign signal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, in some examples, the sign signal is the same as the input control signal, that is, the input control circuit <b>100</b> directly inputs the input control signal into the memory <b>200</b> as the sign signal. In this case, if the input control signal is 1, the sign signal is 1; if the input control signal is 0, the sign signal is 0. For example, in other examples, the sign signal and the input control signal may be different from each other, such as inverted from each other, that is, the input control circuit <b>100</b> may perform inverse processing on the input control signal to obtain the sign signal. In this case, if the input control signal is 1, the sign signal is 0; if the input control signal is 0, the sign signal is 1. It should be noted that the embodiments of the present disclosure are described by taking a case that the input control signal and the sign signal are the same and both are one-bit data as an example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the storage circuit <b>10</b> further includes an input control signal generator <b>300</b>. The input control signal generator <b>300</b> is configured to generate the input control signal and output the input control signal to the input control circuit <b>100</b>. In the storage circuit provided by the present embodiment, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> located outside the memory <b>200</b> generates the input control signal, and the first data processing is controlled to be performed on the input data based on the input control signal. The method to obtain the input control signal is simple and flexible, and the input control signal generator <b>300</b> outputs the input control signals meeting different requirements, so that different data processing on the input data can be implemented, which is convenient to achieve different design requirements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the different values of the sign signal are values randomly generated, and the different values of the sign signal include a first value and a second value. The first value may be 1, and the second value may be 0, so that the sign signal may be a random number sequence consisting of 0 and 1. For example, the sign signal may be represented as 0011010110110110010 . . . . For example, on the whole, such as in the whole life cycle of the cache, the ratio of the first value of the sign signal to the second value of the sign signal is within a predetermined range, and the predetermined range may be 2/3&#x2dc;3/2, so that in the random number sequence of the sign signal, the ratio of the number of the first values in the random number sequence to the total number of values in the random number sequence (that is, the number of data (one bit) included in the random number sequence) may be 40%&#x2dc;60%. The embodiments of the present disclosure are described by taking a case that the first value is 1 and the second value is 0 as an example.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, in some embodiments, the sign signal is a one-bit random number sequence in which the first value and the second value randomly appear, and the change interval between adjacent two values in the sign signal is 1 minute. That is, the change of the sign signal may be that: the value of the sign signal is the first value during the first minute, the value of the sign signal is the second value during the second minute, the value of the sign signal is the second value during the third minute, the value of the sign signal is the first value during the fourth minute, and so on. The duty cycle of this random number sequence is about 50%, that is, the value of the sign signal is the first value during 50% of the whole life cycle of the cache.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, because the input control signal is the same as the sign signal, that is, different values of the input control signal may also include the first value and the second value, the ratio of the first value of the input control signal to the second value of the input control signal is within a predetermined range on the whole, that is, in the whole life cycle of the cache. The input control signal generator <b>300</b> may randomly output a value of the input control signal every minute, that is, during the first minute, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the first value, and the value of the input control signal is the first value at this time; during the second minute, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the second value, and the value of the input control signal is the second value at this time; during the third minute, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the second value; and during the fourth minute, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the first value, and so on. For example, within a period of one month, the ratio of the first value of the input control signal to the second value of the input control signal is within the predetermined range.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be noted that the present disclosure does not limit the specific value of the input control signal generated by the input control signal generator <b>300</b> in each time period. For example, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the first value from the first minute to the tenth minute (or from the first minute to the sixtieth minute, etc.), that is, the value of the input control signal is the first value at this time; and the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may output the second value from the eleventh minute to the twenty-fifth minute (or from the sixtieth minute to the eighty-fifth minute), that is, the value of the input control signal is the second value at this time, etc. The input control signal generator <b>300</b> randomly generates the first value or the second value, as long as the ratio of the first value of the input control signal to the second value of the input control signal is within the predetermined range on a whole (during the life cycle of the cache).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the input control signal may be directly generated by a random number generation unit in the chip, that is, the input control signal generator <b>300</b> may be a random number generation unit in the chip.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the value of the sign signal being the first value indicates that the first data processing is inverse processing; the value of the sign signal being the second value indicates that the first data processing is hold processing, and the processing process of the inverse processing is different from that of the hold processing. That is, when the value of the input control signal is the first value, the first data processing is the inverse processing, and when the value of the input control signal is the second value, the first data processing is the hold processing. In this case, when performing the step of performing the first data processing on the n input data based on the input control signal to obtain the n intermediate data corresponding to the n input data one by one, the input control circuit <b>100</b> performs the following steps: in response to the value of the input control signal being the first value, performing the inverse processing on the n input data to obtain the n intermediate data; in response to the value of the input control signal being the second value, performing the hold processing on the n input data to obtain the n intermediate data, that is, directly taking the n input data as the n intermediate data.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the intermediate data obtained by performing inverse processing on the input data is different from the input data, while the intermediate data obtained by performing hold processing on the input data is the same as the input data. Taking the input data being binary data as an example, the inverse processing means that: if the input data is 1, the intermediate data obtained by performing the inverse processing on the input data is 0, and if the input data is 0, the intermediate data obtained by performing the inverse processing on the input data is 1. The hold processing means that: if the input data is 1, the intermediate data obtained by performing the hold processing on the input data is 1; if the input data is 0, the intermediate data obtained by performing the hold processing on the input data is 0.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be noted that the present disclosure is not limited to the above-described case. In some embodiments, the value of the sign signal being the first value indicates that the first data processing is mapping processing based on a first mapping table; the value of the sign signal being the second value indicates that the first data processing is mapping processing based on a second mapping table, and the processing process of the mapping processing based on the first mapping table is different from the processing process of the mapping processing based on the second mapping table. For example, in some embodiments, the input data may be a 2-bit binary number, and the mapping processing based on the first mapping table means that: mapping data 00 to data 11, mapping data 01 to data 10, mapping data 10 to data 01, and mapping data 11 to data 00. The mapping processing based on the second mapping table means that: mapping data 00 to data 00, mapping data 01 to data 01, mapping data 10 to data 10, and mapping data 11 to data 11. In this case, when the input data is 00, the intermediate data obtained by performing the mapping processing on the input data based on the first mapping table is 11, while the intermediate data obtained by performing the mapping processing on the input data based on the second mapping table is 00.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, in addition to the first value and the second value, the different values of the sign signal may also include a third value, etc., and the embodiments of the present disclosure do not specifically limit the number of the different values. For example, the value of the sign signal being the third value indicates that the first data processing is the mapping processing based on a third mapping table; the processing process of the mapping processing based on the third mapping table is different from the processing process of the mapping processing based on the first mapping table and the processing process of the mapping processing based on the second mapping table.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the storage circuit <b>10</b> further includes an output control circuit <b>400</b>.
