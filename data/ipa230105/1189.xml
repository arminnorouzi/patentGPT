More specifically, this invention relates to novel devices and methods for delivering molecules to cells situated at, near and/or adjacent to a predetermined insertion track site of an elongate single-needle electrode. Still more specifically, the invention concerns the electroporated delivery of substances into cells along and in the vicinity of the needle track made by insertion of the electrode from the surface of a tissue and into the tissue to a depth of from 3 millimeters to 3 cm, which tissues can comprise any tissues, including without limitation skin, striated and smooth muscle, mucosa, and organs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any such information is prior art, or relevant, to the presently claimed inventions, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electroporation has been applied to delivering molecules to subsurface tissues using various multiple-electrode designs such as arrays of two or more electrodes that typically are designed as needle electrodes for insertion into said tissue. Generally, such arrays define a treatment zone lying between the needle electrodes of the array. Such treatment zones therefore comprise a three dimensional volume of tissue wherein cells within the treatment zone are exposed to an electric field of an intensity sufficient to cause temporary or reversible poration, or even sometimes irreversible poration, of the cell membranes to those cells lying within and or near the three dimensional volume.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current practices for electroporating cells in tissue include use of significant voltages in order to impart through the three dimensional treatment zone a relatively uniform electric field. By &#x201c;relatively uniform&#x201d; is meant that electric lines of force coincident with application of an electric pulse sufficient to cause poration is imparted across the cells somewhat evenly throughout the three dimensional treatment zone volume. Ultimately, a large number of electrode needles combined with large injection volumes and high electrical fields have been necessary to ensure a sufficient overlap between an injected drug and the tissue volume experiencing the electrical field since typically, the injection bolus that is delivered to the tissues quickly spreads from the injection site. Use of high electric fields and large electrode arrays has several drawbacks. For example, use of many needles and high electric field (voltages) causes more pain while high injection volume makes dosing difficult to control as it causes waste of the drug (most of the drug is not getting into the cells as it will be outside the treatment zone). Also, use of such multiple needle devices is cumbersome and a cause for apprehension from the standpoint of the patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Besides the invasive aspect of a device with multiple needles, typical electroporation techniques, as stated above, result in variability in electroporation of cells within a treatment zone. This is a drawback to medical use of electroporation in that dispersion of treatment molecules of the injected bolus into surrounding tissue results in loss of control as to the amount of such treatment molecule that is ultimately transfected into cells within the treatment zone by the electroporation event. Thus, a need exists in the electroporation arts for a device and method to narrow or refine control over &#x201c;dosing&#x201d; of treatment molecules into specific and well defined delivery sites within a patient's tissue. Likewise, there is still a need in the art for methodologies and devices that can electroporate with less invasiveness and impart less pain from the electric field pulse employed in the delivery of therapeutic substances to various tissues including skin, muscle, mucosa and organs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first embodiment, this invention provides for electroporation of cells in situ, particularly cells that are located subcutaneously, intradermally, subdermally, and/or intramuscularly (particularly skeletal muscle, striated, and smooth muscle, e.g., heart, muscle). In a related embodiment, the invention provides for the electroporation of cells near and/or adjacent to the track made by insertion of the single elongate needle electrode into tissue. For example, cells that become electroporated using the invention device are those situated within a radius from the needle track anywhere from between 0.0 and 5 mm so as to comprise a generally cylindrical treatment zone imparted by the novel design and pulsing of and of the electric field imparted into the tissue by the single-needle electrode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second embodiment, the invention provides for any number of structural arrangements providing for at least two opposite electrode leads (i.e., at least one anode and at least one cathode) situated in association with a single elongate electrically inert shaft, which shaft itself can comprise electrodes and an electrically inert material, such as a medically acceptable plastic or polycarbonate, filling the space between the electrodes a 0.05 mm to a 1.5 mm between, or can comprise just elongate opposing spaced electrodes. In either embodiment, the electrodes of the tissue penetrating single needle electrode or electrode containing shaft have spaced dimensions of between 0.05 mm and 1.5 mm. In a related embodiment, the electrodes themselves can have a length exposed along the elongate shaft anywhere from the whole needle length to just a section of the needle, such as near the shaft penetration tip. Further, the electrodes can have cross sectional dimensions of between 0.005 and 0.80 mm. In yet another structural arrangement embodiment, the single needle electrode can comprise a hypodermic needle comprising at least two elongate electrodes spaced along at least a portion of the length of the hypodermic needle exterior. For example, the hypodermic needle can include at least two electrodes (i.e., an anode and a cathode) running along a portion of the length of the needle. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) In working embodiments, each electrode is connected to a source of electric energy for generating an electric field between opposite poles, i.e., one electrode is an anode and the other a cathode electrode. In other examples, multiple electrodes can be formed on the exterior of a hypodermic injection needle such as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> comprising multiple straight and parallel electrodes, or as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> comprising multiple electrodes spiraled around the injection needle. In still further embodiments, the single-needle electrodes can be manufactured using any number of well understood methods including etching and layering per Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. In such manufacturing methods, micromachining processes are used to add or strip away layers of substances important to the proper annealing, insulation, and conduct of electric pulses and circuitry. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A</figref>, B, C, D and E are photographs of the embodiment wherein the electrodes are etched on to the delivery needle shaft. Specifically, gold electrode layering has been coated above a layer of and inert substance (parylene) which itself had been layered over the hypodermic needle shaft. Additional methods for manufacturing the elongate electrodes include extrusion technologies wherein the electrode leads are formed into and or along the shaft of an electrically inert composition having insulating qualities, such a plastic, a polyester derivative, or polyvinylchloride (PVC), or insulative carbon fiber. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b></figref> A and B, an elongate hollow needle can be extruded with electrode component, such as for example, wire either along opposite sides of the hollow shaft or in a spiral fashion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> B. Further still, the needle shaft can also comprise sections with no exposed electrodes. For example, one end of the needle shaft connects to a hub forming a connector for connecting to a source of fluid, such as for example, a syringe. Insulation near or along such section of the shaft may provide for additional lessening of electric stimulus sensation noticeable by the patient. In yet a further embodiment with respect to any such electrode configuration described herein, each of the electrodes are individually energizable so that any combination of the electrodes may be energized in pairs (i.e., a cathode and anode) simultaneously together, or in any given sequence, and further using any type of pulse including without limitation monopolar, bipolar, exponential decaying, or pulse train combinations of any of the former.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a third embodiment, the invention provides for use of relatively low voltage and/or low current, which in turn not only provides sufficient electrical energy for causing reversible poration of cells in the treatment zone, but also allows for a low pain level experienced by subjects during application of electric pulses into the surrounding tissue, said application using nominal electric field strengths of generally between 1 and 100 V, typically between 2 and 50V, an more preferably between 3 and 25V. In a related aspect, electric current employed in the invention device and methods uses generally between 1-400 mAmps, typically between 5-200 mAmps, and more preferably between 20 and 100 mAmps. In a related embodiment, the amperage chosen depends on the total surface area of the electrodes. For example, the device may employ a range between 10 to 40, or 25 to 100, or 50 to 150, or 125 to 200, or 175 to 250, or 225 to 300, or 250 to 300 or 300 to 400 mAmps depending upon the total electrode surface area of each electrode. The smaller the surface area, the lower the amperage necessary to achieve an electroporating electric filed in the in situ tissue. Pulses can be applied for between 1 and 1000 millisec.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the invention provides for delivery of treatment molecules at various concentrations (e.g., for example, between 0.05 &#x3bc;g-3 mg/ml) and preferably at low bolus volumes (e.g., for example, generally 1 &#x3bc;l to 1 ml). In a related embodiment, using a structural embodiment inclusive of a delivery tube associated with the single needle electrode shaft, the volume of treatment molecules immediately following injection into the tissue (such as a controlled injection wherein the injectate is delivered during insertion of the needle) surprisingly remains to a substantial level in the vicinity of the injection needle track. Treatment molecules are contemplated to include therapeutic drugs, e.g., small molecules, organic compounds, as well as proteins, and nucleic acids encoding polypeptides having either a biologic activity or that will induce an immune response in the host once such polypeptide is expressed in the electroporated cell. The polypeptides once expressed in the cell are available for interacting with cellular metabolic machinery and immune system pathways.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment, electrical energy used to pulse the tissue provides for a unique electric field that is unlike prior applied fields used for electroporation of similar tissues. Specifically, prior art electric fields intentionally and inherently impart what has been recognized in the electroporative arts as a &#x201c;uniform&#x201d; electric field meaning that the applied electrical energy is of sufficient strength to impart a nominal field strength and a relatively even voltage drop across the treatment zone created by widely separating the electrodes a given distance apart from one another and placing the target treatment zone optimally central between said spaced electrodes. Such electrode array designs when pulsed in tissue tend to electroporate cells primarily within the zone bordered by the electrodes generally in the vicinity of the electric lines of force and to a smaller degree a zone of cells situated just adjacent and surrounding the three dimensional treatment zone.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In contrast, the current invention uses electric fields that comprise a generally cylindrical or columnar &#x201c;non-uniform&#x201d; field that is created about the length of the needle shaft thereby creating a treatment zone of cells lying within an area close enough to the centrally placed electrodes to be subjected to an electroporation field &#x201c;outside&#x201d; the immediate location of the electrodes, of sufficient strength to porate said cells. Such a treatment zone is completely external to and surrounding the central needle and electrodes and the non-uniform field dissipates relative to the distance outward from the electrode/needle. Generally, it is thought that the dissipation in electrical energy as the distance from the single needle electrode increases is parallel to the dissipation found in other physical phenomenon wherein energy, here energy sufficient to reversibly porate cells, dissipates at an exponential rate. However, such dissipation rate if applicable does not negatively affect the functioning of the invention device or the intended outcome of delivering substances into cells in a defined zone. Thus, since electrical energy necessary to cause cell poration dissipates with the distance from the electrical field source, the area around the needle tract that is susceptible to electroporation is inherently confined to a central core correlating to the length of the needle track and laterally to a given radius forming therefore a generally cylindrical treatment zone of variable radii depending upon the pulse energy imparted to the electrodes. In a further related embodiment, the more energy used to pulse, the greater the potential to damage cells directly in contact with the electrodes. It is yet a further intention of the invention methods to employ the ability to cause such damage for the purpose of further stimulating the immune system. Thus, treatment regimens can be used that intentionally impart a greater rather than a lesser energy so as to provide a stimulus for immune response activity around the treatment site.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other embodiments, the device can be used to deliver drugs, natural polypeptides having a biologic activity, and genes encoding such polypeptides that can be expressed in situ in cells within the treatment zone for treating disorders or for modulating an immune response in the host and/or for treating a variety of diseases including but not limited to diseases caused by pathogenic organisms and viruses and cancers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following drawings, detailed description, and appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This specification contains at least one figure executed in color.

Embodiments for electrodes can employ a variety of electrode structural designs. For example, anode and cathode electrodes can be placed in association with a delivery needle that run parallel to one-another and to the length of the delivery needle such as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, or that are parallel to each other but are spiraled around the needle shaft as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. The invention device also includes electric conduits connecting each of said electrodes to an electrical energy source wherein said electrodes when said needle is inserted into a patient tissue are capable of being energized individually, generating an electric field to cells in a treatment zone surrounding said needle sufficient to cause cells along and near a track made by insertion of said needle into said tissue to become reversibly porated so as to allow treatment molecules to enter said cells.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Manufacture of such electrode containing fluid delivery needles can be carried out by any number of well know methods including micromachining such as commonly understood as MEMs technology. For example, a standard hypodermic needle (which can be any gauge such as 20 gauge, 21 gauge, 22 gauge, 23 gauge, 24 gauge, 25 gauge 26 gauge, 27 gauge, 28 gauge and 29 gauge) can be coated with an electrically inert material followed by deposition of electrically conductive material such as gold, followed in turn by etching away conductive material in the orientation desired on the surface of the needle. Specifically, generally the process comprises cleaning the hypodermic needle shaft in preparation for deposition of the inert substance, for example, a polymer having properties of evenly adhering to surfaces, such as parylene. Following stripping of the metal shaft, parylene is deposited, such as by vacuum deposition, on to the needle. This is in turn patterned using a laser to deposit electrode conductable material, such as gold, followed in turn by selective removal of the gold to form electrodes in a predetermined pattern on the needle shaft. In the current invention, the use of MEMs technology provides for an ability to manipulate the three dimensional needle and coatings and etchings on a miniature scale. The capability to manufacture a single needle electrode is proven by the photographs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A</figref> to E. Manufacture can also be carried out by extrusion technology. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>, in this aspect the electrodes <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) are extruded as fine wire filaments with an electrically inert substance such as polyvinylchlorine or the like in a linear fashion. The tip of the needle <b>204</b> can be machined or cut to a penetrating tip and at the other end fitted to a hub <b>200</b> comprising electrode leads <b>201</b><i>a </i>and <b>201</b><i>b </i>and a fitting <b>205</b> for attachment to a source of fluid medium. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> depicts an example of a structural embodiment comprising an extruded needle with spiral electrodes and electrode leads <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a second embodiment, the invention comprises a method for delivering molecules to cells in vivo comprising providing to a patient's tissue containing said cells an injection needle further comprising at least two elongate electrodes (i.e., a cathode and an anode) positioned along the needle shaft and at least a reservoir containing said molecules wherein said reservoir and molecules are in fluid communication with a lumen running through said needle shaft, injecting the molecules into said tissue, and energizing the electrodes with electrical energy to provide an electric pulse sufficient to cause cells in the vicinity of the injection site and needle track to become reversibly porated, thereby electroporating said cells for their uptake of said molecules.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a third embodiment, the device provides for electroporation of cells in a narrowly defined location, particularly cells along or near the track make by the injection needle. Generally, the cells considered within the treatment site are those cells lying in a radius around the needle track of about 5 mm, more typically about 3 mm, and even more particularly about 2 mm, and most particularly about 1 mm. In a related embodiment, the generation of electric filed sufficient for electroporation of cells within said treatment site is a field that weakens outward from the central injection needle such that the treatment site is defined by the inability of the pulse energy to extend into the tissues beyond a certain distance from the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further related embodiment, the invention calls for the novel use of a single elongate probe (which comprises the injection needle and electrodes) for performing in situ electroporation of a highly localized set of cells in the tissue.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, the invention device may be used with any of a variety of electric pulsing conditions. For example, the electrodes can be charged with at least one pulse of constant current in the range of between 1-400 mAmps, typically between 5-200 mAmps, and more preferably between 20 and 100 mAmps. In another example, the electrodes can be charged with a voltage pulse in the range of 1 to 100 volts. Further, the electric pulse can be either a monopolar or a bipolar pulse wherein said pulse can be a single, a double or a multiple pulse sequence having various characteristics such as a set voltage drop, variable shaped pulse trains, or pulses employing constant current.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other embodiments, the device and method provide for delivering or transfecting pharmaceutical drugs, proteins, nucleic acids including DNA and RNA, and synthetic modifications thereof as are well known to those of skill in the art, into patient tissues, particular to cells residing in the subcutaneous, intradermal, and subdermal spaces as well as skeletal and striated muscle compartments of a mammalian body, and organs including heart, lung, pancreas, spleen, liver, and organs of the alimentary tract. Once transfected with the selected material, cells will be directly affected by the activity of the drug, or protein or nucleic acid. Where nucleic acids are transfected, typically such nucleic acids are employed for the protein encoded thereby which can be expressed in the cells of the treatment site. Further, the substances can comprise cytokines, chemokines, and immune relevant bioactive molecules including such active molecules as immune modulating molecules selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, GM-CSF, M-CSF, G-CSF, LIF, LT, TGF-&#x3b2;, IFN, TNF-&#x3b1;, BCGF, CD2, or ICAM.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the material to be delivered to the cells can be delivered in a liquid form in a volume of between 0.01 ml to 1 ml. In one embodiment, nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide can be dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). The exact solvent, however, is not critical to the invention. For example, it is well known in the art that other solvents such as sucrose are capable of increasing nucleic acid uptake in skeletal muscle. In a related embodiment, the volume to be delivered can be adjusted in relation to the length of the needle (since the length of the needle shaft will determine both the volume of the substance being transported therethrough) and, the needle track made so as to determine the volume of the space available for said substance to fill upon it being expressed through the needle and into the needle track and surrounding tissue. For example, a 2 mm long needle can be used for delivering substances to skin layer tissues and provide for injection of a volume in the range of 0.01 ml to 0.05 ml, while a 5 mm long needle can be used to deliver volumes in the range of 0.1 ml to 0.15 ml, and a 1.5 to 2 cm long needle can be used for delivering volumes in the range of 0.3 ml to 0.5 ml.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Other substances may also be co-transfected with the molecule of interest for a variety of beneficial reasons. For example, the molecule P199 (lee, et al. PNAS, 4524-8, 10, 89 (1992)), which is known to seal electropermeabilized membranes, may beneficially affect transfection efficiencies by increasing the survival rate of transfected muscle fibers.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the electrode carrying hypodermic needle is inserted into a patient tissue to a desired depth of penetration. The plunger of the attached syringe is activated to inject the volume of liquid containing the selected material for injection, and the electrodes are immediately thereafter, or alternatively simultaneously with the injection of the material, energized with at least one pulse of electric energy sufficient to cause at least some of the cells in the treatment zone to become reversibly porated. Although the syringe plunger is typically activated using animate means, such as by use of the hand, the syringe can also be affixed to a holding device such as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, or even an automatic dispensing apparatus, such as a device disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/612,304 filed Jul. 3, 2003 which is herein incorporated in it entirety by reference.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In other embodiments, the invention can be applied to electroporation of cells at various depths from the surface of a body tissue. For example, besides electroporation of cells residing within muscle tissue compartments in which delivery of substances are initiated by injection of materials into the tissue in an orientation approximating 90 degrees from the surface of the tissue, in one embodiment the invention device can be used to electroporate cells in the subcutaneous, intradermal, or subdermal spaces of skin. It can also be used to electroporate substances into lymph nodes, or tissue layers in other organs such as cardiac and blood vessel tissue. With respect to electroporating cells in any of these locals, use of the device for electroporating cells in such tissue layers can include use of either short needles having a length sufficient for penetrating outer portions of the tissue layers (i.e., skin, subdermal, etc.) for injection and electroporation at approximately a 90 degree angle to the tissue surface, or where a delivery needle is relatively long, such as between 3 and 4 cm, insertion of the single needle can be made at an acute angle to the surface tissue using a holding device as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. This will allow for electroporation of a larger portion of tissue within the desired layer. Further, the acute angle of insertion can be between 3 to 25 degrees of angle from the tissue surface. Such tissue surface can be described as forming generally a flat surface area forming a plane encompassing the site for insertion of the single needle/electrode. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> to D, the syringe can be connected to an attachment means which is designed to hold the syringe at a set angle on a planar guide tray 100 with the needle placed a set distance X into the tissue as determined based on the predetermined desired depth of insertion of the needle into the tissue. The guide tray with exposed needle is brought into contact with the tissue surface such that the needle inserts the tissue at the prescribed acute angle. After the needle is so inserted and the therapeutic substance expelled from the syringe, the electrodes can be energized to bring about delivery of the injected material into the subcutaneous, intradermal, or subdermal cells. Use of the device at an oblique angle as discussed above can also apply to electroporating various layers of organ tissue.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The following examples are given to illustrate various embodiments which have been made of the present invention.

Further embodiments include mechanisms for keeping the plunger <b>9</b> in a semi fixed open/retracted or a closed/expelled position, such as, for example, dimples <b>15</b> and recesses <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>*. It should be clear to one of skill in the art that regardless of the method employed to provide for semi fixed positioning of the sharps cover <b>11</b> and plunger <b>9</b>, such positioning can easily be changed with either animate energy, such as force by hand, or mechanically, such as by an electronically driven actuator. The distal end of the sharps cover <b>11</b> can include removably attached thereto a sterility cover <b>60</b>. The electrode needle <b>10</b> further can comprise a lumen running therethrough ending in tissue piercing tip <b>22</b>, and orifice <b>25</b> for connecting to the reservoir <b>20</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The injection needle <b>10</b> can be of a gage between 18 and 29 standard hypodermic needle gauge sizes. In a preferred embodiment, the delivery needle comprises at least one pair of electrodes, such as electrodes <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The electrodes comprise at least one anode and one cathode electrodes which are in electrical communication with electrode leads <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Depending upon the design chosen for any particular invention product, the leads can terminate in a lead terminal <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, for example), or connect by any other means with lead wires running from the electrode to a source of electrical energy, such as a pulse generator.

Alternatively, the reservoir can be filled with a substance of interest by either drawing such substance into the reservoir through the electrode needle <b>10</b> by extracting the plunger <b>9</b>, or preferably, the reservoir can first be cleared of the plunger by retracting the plunger to the open position followed by delivering to the reservoir the substance by injecting it into the reservoir via the resilient seal <b>12</b>, similarly to the procedure commonly performed in the extracting of drugs from sterile vials into syringes and introducing them into another reservoir.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The delivery needle <b>10</b> with its array of electrodes (such as electrodes <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>and <b>52</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, or <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, respectively) can be inserted into the tissue, usually at an approximate 90 degrees to the tissue surface, or alternatively at an acute angle with respect to the tissue surface, and the substance injected into the needle track and local tissues. The electrodes can be energized using a pulse generator either following the injection of said substance, or can be energized simultaneously with said injection of substance. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when energized with an electric pulse, the electrodes support the generation of an electric field <b>20</b> that provides for sufficient energy to cause reversible poration of the cells within said field. The electric filed generated is non-uniform in that it exponentially decreases by the distance from the needle track <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Thus, the electric field sufficient to provide such poration has, depending upon the energy employed, symmetrical lateral dimensions (a)&#xd7;(b) (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) forming a set diameter of an electroporating electric field which, with respect to the needle track length, forms a defined three dimensional volume. Generally, the poration sufficient electric field has a radius from the electrode needle <b>10</b> of between 0 and 5 mm, typically between 0 and 4 mm, and preferably between 0 and 3 mm and most preferably between 0 and 2 mm.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As is easily understood by those having skill in the electroporation arts, the field generated by the current invention's single needle electrode, unlike prior electroporation apparatuses, is a non-uniform electric field wherein the field intensity is greater near the needle and diminishes as measured outward from the electrodes In contrast to the current electrode arrangement, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts prior electrode arrangements wherein a uniform electric filed is employed across a large volume treatment site. The instant invention is measurably distinct from former concepts that suggested a need to utilize a &#x201c;uniform&#x201d; field. Here, the invention employs a non-uniform field which provides for reversible poration of cells to a greater amount near the position of the delivery needle, i.e., the needle tract. This in turn allows a clear benefit to determine the precise location of those cells receiving a known dose of therapeutic materials. This invention through its embodiments therefore provides for &#x201c;fitting&#x201d; the electric field to the injection site so as to distribute material to cells more uniformly and confined to a local tissue area as opposed to the variable distribution allowed for with electroporation systems that use a conventional uniform electric field and an outer array of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">With respect to the electrodes generally, they can comprise any metal but preferably are a metal that does not impart a toxicity due to metal ions to the cells of the electroporated tissue.

The rabbit was then shaved at the site where the injection was to be made, i.e., into the quadricepts muscle. A hole was poked in the skin covering the muscle by first inserting an 18 gauge needle, and then slightly widened using a scalpel. A single needle electroporation device, made from an 18 gauge needle with two parallel electrodes applied opposite one another to the outer surface of the needle (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), was then slowly inserted into the muscle tissue, periodically pausing to inject DNA every few millimeters to a final insertion depth of approximately 25 mm. A total of 500 ul of DNA-containing solution containing 100 ug gWizGFP was injected into each injection site. Shortly after completing the injection and while the needle/electrode device was still inserted to its final insertion depth, electroporation was commenced. Specifically, five 250 mA pulses, each of twenty millisecond (ms) duration, were applied to the electroporation needle device at 10 Hz intervals (i.e., 100 ms) using an Elgen 1000 (Inovio AS, Oslo, Norway) current-clamped pulse.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Four days post-treatment the animals were humanely euthanized.
