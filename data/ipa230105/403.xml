The subject pulls the other end <b>210</b><i>b </i>enough for the right wrist to be fixed to the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example and fixes the wearing portion <b>210</b> in this state with the fixing mechanism of the fixing portion <b>212</b>. In this way, the subject can put on the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example with one hand (the left hand in the present embodiment). The subject can also use the wearing portion <b>210</b> to fix the wrist to the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example, thereby stabilizing the wearing state of the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example. Consequently, the positional relationship between the wrist and the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example is less likely to change during measurement. This enables stable measurement of the pulse wave and improves measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, movement of the moveable portion of the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example at the time of wearing of the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example is described.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To wear the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example, the subject inserts the wrist along the x-axis direction into the space formed by the wearing portion <b>210</b>, the base <b>211</b>, and the measurement unit <b>220</b>, as described above. The measurement unit <b>220</b> is configured to be rotatable in the direction of the arrow A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> relative to the base <b>211</b>. At this time, the subject can therefore insert the wrist while rotating the measurement unit <b>220</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. By the measurement unit <b>220</b> being configured in this way to be rotatable, the subject can insert the wrist while appropriately changing the direction of the measurement unit <b>220</b> in accordance with the positional relationship between the subject and the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example. This makes it easier for the subject to wear the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">After inserting the wrist into the space formed by the wearing portion <b>210</b>, the base <b>211</b>, and the measurement unit <b>220</b>, the subject places the pulse pad <b>132</b> in contact with the skin above the radial artery of the wrist. The body <b>221</b> is configured to be displaceable in the direction of the arrow D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The first arm <b>134</b> of the sensor <b>130</b> connected to the body <b>221</b> is therefore also displaceable in the direction of the arrow D, which is the z-axis direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Therefore, the subject can displace the first arm <b>134</b> in the direction of the arrow D in accordance with the size, thickness, and the like of the subject's wrist so that the pulse pad <b>132</b> comes into contact with the skin above the radial artery. The subject can fix the body <b>221</b> at the position of displacement. The electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example thus facilitates adjustment of the position of the sensor <b>130</b> to a suitable position for measurement. The electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example thereby improves measurement accuracy. The body <b>221</b> has been described as displaceable in the z-axis direction in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, but the body <b>221</b> is not necessarily configured to be displaceable in the z-axis direction. It suffices for the body <b>221</b> to be configured to be capable of adjusting the position in accordance with the size, thickness, and the like of the wrist, for example. The body <b>221</b> may, for example, be configured to be displaceable in a direction intersecting the xy plane, which is the surface of the base <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the pulse pad <b>132</b> is in contact with the skin above the radial artery in a direction orthogonal to the skin surface, the pulsation transmitted to the first arm <b>134</b> increases. In other words, when the displacement direction of the pulse pad <b>132</b> (the direction indicated by the arrow E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is a direction orthogonal to the skin surface, the pulsation transmitted to the first arm <b>134</b> increases, and the accuracy with which pulsation is acquired can increase. In the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example, the body <b>221</b> and the sensor <b>130</b> connected to the body <b>221</b> are configured to be rotatable about the shaft <b>224</b> with respect to the exterior portion <b>222</b>, as indicated by the arrow C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The subject can thereby adjust the direction of the sensor <b>130</b> so that the displacement direction of the pulse pad <b>132</b> is a direction orthogonal to the skin surface. In other words, the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example enables adjustment of the direction of the sensor <b>130</b> so that the displacement direction of the pulse pad <b>132</b> is a direction orthogonal to the skin surface. The electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example thereby enables adjustment of the direction of the sensor <b>130</b> in accordance with the shape of the subject's wrist. This facilitates transmission of a change in the pulsation of the subject to the first arm <b>134</b>. The electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example thereby improves measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The subject places the pulse pad <b>132</b> in contact with the skin above the radial artery of the wrist, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, and then pulls the other end <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the wearing portion <b>210</b> to fix the wrist to the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example. The exterior portion <b>222</b> is configured to be rotatable in the direction of the arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Therefore, when the subject pulls the wearing portion <b>210</b>, the exterior portion <b>222</b> rotates about the shaft S1, and the upper end is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis. In other words, the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. The first arm <b>134</b> is connected to the second arm <b>135</b> via the elastic body <b>140</b>. Therefore, when the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis, the pulse pad <b>132</b> is biased towards the radial artery by the elastic force of the elastic body <b>140</b>. Consequently, the pulse pad <b>132</b> can more reliably capture changes in the pulse. The electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example thereby improves measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rotation direction of the exterior portion <b>222</b> (the direction indicated by arrow B) and the rotation direction of the first arm <b>134</b> (the direction indicated by the arrow E) may be substantially parallel. As the rotation direction of the exterior portion <b>222</b> and the rotation direction of the first arm <b>134</b> are closer to being parallel, the elastic force of the elastic body <b>140</b> acts more efficiently on the first arm <b>134</b> when the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis. The range over which the rotation direction of the exterior portion <b>222</b> and the rotation direction of the first arm <b>134</b> are substantially parallel includes the range over which the elastic force of the elastic body <b>140</b> acts on the first arm <b>134</b> when the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, the surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>on the front side of the exterior portion <b>222</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is substantially rectangular, with the long sides in the up-down direction. The surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>includes a notch <b>222</b><i>c </i>at the upper end on the side in the negative direction of the y-axis. The notch <b>222</b><i>c </i>makes the surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>less likely to contact the skin above the radial artery when the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. This helps to prevent pulsation of the radial artery from being hindered by contact with the surface <b>222</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, when the upper end of the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the end <b>222</b><i>d </i>at the lower side of the notch <b>222</b><i>c </i>contacts the wrist at a different position than the radial artery. When the end <b>222</b><i>d </i>comes into contact with the wrist, the exterior portion <b>222</b> is no longer displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis beyond the contact position. The end <b>222</b><i>d </i>can therefore prevent the exterior portion <b>222</b> from being displaced beyond a predetermined position. If the exterior portion <b>222</b> were displaced in the negative direction of the y-axis beyond a predetermined position, the first arm <b>134</b> would be strongly pressed towards the radial artery by the elastic force of the elastic body <b>140</b>. Pulsation of the radial artery would therefore tend to be hindered. Since the exterior portion <b>222</b> includes the end <b>222</b><i>d</i>, the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example can prevent an excessive pressure from acting on the radial artery from the first arm <b>134</b>, making the pulsation of the radial artery less likely to be hindered. In this way, the end <b>222</b><i>d </i>functions as a stopper that restricts the range over which the exterior portion <b>222</b> is displaceable.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the present embodiment, the rotation shaft S2 of the first arm <b>134</b> may be disposed at a position away from the side of the surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>in the negative direction of the y-axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. When the rotation shaft S2 is disposed near the side of the surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>in the negative direction of the y-axis, the changes in pulsation of the radial artery might not be captured accurately due to the first arm <b>134</b> touching the subject's wrist. The position of the rotation shaft S2 away from the side of the surface <b>222</b><i>b </i>in the negative direction of the y-axis can reduce the probability of the first arm <b>134</b> touching the wrist, thereby making it easier for the first arm <b>134</b> to capture changes in pulsation more accurately.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The subject pulls the other end <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the wearing portion <b>210</b> and fixes the wearing portion <b>210</b> with the fixing mechanism of the fixing portion <b>212</b> to wear the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example on the wrist. Once worn on the wrist in this way, the electronic device <b>100</b> of the second example measures the subject's pulse wave by the first arm <b>134</b> changing in the direction indicated by the arrow E together with changes in pulsation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The above-described first and second examples of the electronic device <b>100</b> merely illustrate example configurations of the electronic device <b>100</b>.

The electronic device <b>100</b> estimates the blood glucose level using this estimation formula.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Estimation theory related to estimating the blood glucose level based on the pulse wave is now described. As a result of an increase in the blood glucose level after a meal, the blood fluidity reduces (viscosity increases), blood vessels dilate, and the amount of circulating blood increases. Vascular dynamics and hemodynamics are determined so as to balance these states. The reduction in blood fluidity occurs, for example, because of an increase in the viscosity of blood plasma or a reduction in the deformability of red blood cells. Dilation of blood vessels occurs for reasons such as secretion of insulin, secretion of digestive hormones, and a rise in body temperature. When blood vessels dilate, the pulse rate increases to suppress a reduction in blood pressure. Furthermore, the increase in the amount of circulating blood compensates for blood consumption for digestion and absorption. The postprandial vascular dynamics and hemodynamics due to these causes are also reflected in the pulse wave. The electronic device <b>100</b> can therefore estimate the blood glucose level based on the pulse wave.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">An estimation formula for estimating the blood glucose level based on the above estimation theory can be derived by performing regression analysis on sample data of postprandial pulse waves and blood glucose levels obtained from a plurality of subjects. By applying the derived estimation formula to the index in accordance with the subject's pulse wave at the time of estimation, the subject's blood glucose level can be estimated. If the estimation formula is derived in particular by performing regression analysis using sample data for which variation in the blood glucose level is close to a normal distribution, the blood glucose level of the subject being tested can be estimated. The estimation formula may, for example, be derived by partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. In PLS regression analysis, a regression coefficient matrix is calculated by using the covariance of the outcome variable (feature amount of the estimation target) and the explanatory variable (feature amount used for estimation) to perform multiple regression analysis by adding to the variable in order from the component with the highest correlation between the outcome variable and the explanatory variable.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">&#x201c;Preprandial&#x201d; as used in the present disclosure refers to before a meal is taken, such as when fasting. &#x201c;Postprandial&#x201d; as used in the present disclosure refers to a time after a meal is taken, such as the time when the effects of the meal are reflected in the blood at a predetermined time after the meal is taken. As described in the present embodiment, &#x201c;postprandial&#x201d; in the case of the electronic device <b>100</b> estimating the blood glucose level may refer to the time at which the blood glucose level increases (for example, approximately one hour after the start of the meal).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example pulse wave to illustrate an example of an estimation method based on pulse waves. The estimation formula for estimating blood glucose level is, for example, derived by regression analysis related to age, an index SI indicating the rising of a pulse wave (rising index), an augmentation index (AI), and pulse rate PR.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The rising index SI is derived in accordance with the waveform indicated in the area D1 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In greater detail, the rising index SI is the ratio of the first local minimum to the first local maximum in the acceleration pulse wave yielded by the second derivative of the pulse wave. For example, for the acceleration pulse wave illustrated as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the rising index SI is expressed as b/a. The rising index SI decreases because of a reduction in fluidity of the blood, secretion of insulin, dilation (relaxation) of blood vessels due to increased body temperature, and the like after a meal. In the acceleration pulse wave b/a, b is negative, and a is positive. In this case, b/a is negative. A smaller value of b/a means that b is growing in the negative direction.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The AI is an index represented by the ratio between the magnitudes of the forward wave and the reflected wave of the pulse wave.

Since the acquired pulse wave may, for example, include noise that is due to body movement of the subject, the pulse wave may be corrected by a filter that removes the direct current (DC) component, so as to extract only the pulsation component.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Propagation of the pulse wave is a phenomenon in which pulsation due to blood extruded from the heart is transmitted through artery walls or blood. The pulsation due to blood pumped from the heart reaches the peripheries of limbs as a forward wave, a portion of which is reflected at locations such as where a blood vessel branches, or where the diameter of a blood vessel changes, and returns as a reflected wave. AI is the quotient when the magnitude of the reflected wave is divided by the magnitude of the forward wave and is expressed as Ain=(PRn-PSn)/(PFn-PSn). Here, AIn is the AI for each pulse beat. AI may, for example, be calculated by measuring the pulse wave for several seconds and calculating the average AIave of the AIn for each pulse beat (n=an integer from 1 to n). The AI is derived from the waveform indicated in area D2 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.

The pulse wave illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is greatly affected by the reflected wave, represented by the second peak. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates the acceleration pulse wave of the pulse wave illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The effect of the reflected wave also appears in the waveform of the acceleration pulse wave, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, for example. When AI becomes small, AI may be difficult to detect or may disappear and be undetectable. Examples of when AI becomes small are when blood vessels dilate or the blood glucose level is high.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Therefore, instead of or in addition to the AI, the estimation formula may be derived using another index. The use of another index AIt is now described as an example. All is the rate of change in the pulse wave at a predetermined time after the peak of the pulse wave. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates an example pulse wave to illustrate the AIt. The AIt is the ratio of P3 to P1, where P1 is the height of the peak of the pulse wave, and P3 is the height of the pulse wave after a predetermined time &#x394;t from the point in time when P1 appears. In other words, AIt=P3/P1. The predetermined time &#x394;t may be a time before the effect of the reflected wave appears. For example, if the pulse wave velocity is 10 m/sec, and the distance from the heart to the main reflection point inside the body is 1 m round trip, then the time until the reflected wave makes a round trip is 100 msec. The predetermined time &#x394;t may, for example, be 100 msec calculated in this way. In other words, suppose the main reflection point of the reflected wave of AI is the abdominal aortic bifurcation. Also suppose that the round-trip distance between the heart and the abdominal aortic bifurcation is 2L, and the pulse wave velocity is PWV. This yields &#x394;t=2L/PWV. The pulse wave velocity of the abdominal aorta is generally thought to be 10 m/sec. The value of L is generally 50 cm. Accordingly, &#x394;t=2L/PWV=100/1000=0.1 sec.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Naturally, the predetermined time &#x394;t may vary depending on individual differences in the round-trip distance 2L and the pulse wave velocity PWV, the measurement time, the state of health, or other factors. For example, the round-trip distance 2L and the pulse wave velocity PWV may vary from the aforementioned example values due to age, sex, health status, or other factors. The predetermined time &#x394;t may therefore vary from 100 msec and may be a numerical value in a certain range. For example, the predetermined time &#x394;t may be 100 msec or less, or 100 msec or more. Setting the predetermined time &#x394;t in this way facilitates accurate calculation of the AIt even when the reflected wave disappears. Depending on the waveform of the pulse wave, the use of Mt as an index related to pulse wave can improve the estimation accuracy of the subject's blood glucose level as compared to when AI is used. The predetermined time &#x394;t is the time around which the reflected wave appears. The effect of the reflected wave is often included in the AIt.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref>, the change from the preprandial pulse waveform to the postprandial pulse waveform is now described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref> are graphs illustrating the change from the preprandial pulse waveform to the postprandial pulse waveform in the present embodiment.
