The ultrasound catheter includes a transducer for transmitting and receiving ultrasound, a drive shaft that rotates the transducer, and a sheath that rotatably accommodates the transducer and the drive shaft. The transducer is rotationally driven by the drive shaft in the sheath to transmit and receive the ultrasound, and acquires an image in the living body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An inner lumen of a blood vessel of a heart, a lower limb, or an abdomen is larger than that of a blood vessel such as a coronary artery. In observation with an ultrasound catheter in the large inner lumen, as a distance from the ultrasound transducer to an observation target increases, the ultrasound spreads, and therefore observation of the observation target becomes relatively difficult. Therefore, an ultrasound catheter that can acquire a relatively highly accurate image even in a heart, a blood vessel of a lower limb or an abdomen, or the like having a large inner lumen is desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An ultrasound catheter and an ultrasound catheter system are disclosed that can acquire an image of an observation target with relatively high accuracy even when the ultrasound catheter and the ultrasound catheter system are inserted into a relatively large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An ultrasound catheter is disclosed that includes: an outer sheath in which an accommodation lumen configured to extend from a proximal end to a distal end is formed; an inner sheath configured to move in the accommodation lumen along an axis of the outer sheath; a drive shaft configured to rotate in the inner sheath and/or the outer sheath; and a transducer that is disposed on a distal side of the inner sheath in the accommodation lumen, and that is fixed to a distal end of the drive shaft, in which the outer sheath includes a bent portion that is bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on a proximal side of a most distal end of the accommodation lumen, and a tubular portion that has an axis having a radius of curvature larger than a radius of curvature of an axis of the bent portion, the tubular portion being positioned on a distal side of the bent portion and on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen, and the outer sheath is rotatable with respect to the inner sheath.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An ultrasound catheter system is disclosed that includes an ultrasound catheter; and a drive device configured to drive the ultrasound catheter, in which the ultrasound catheter includes an outer sheath in which an accommodation lumen configured to extend from a proximal end to a distal end is formed, an inner sheath configured to move in the accommodation lumen along an axis of the outer sheath, a drive shaft configured to rotate in the inner sheath and/or the outer sheath, a transducer that is disposed on a distal side of the inner sheath in the accommodation lumen, and that is fixed to a distal end of the drive shaft, a first housing to which a proximal portion of the outer sheath is fixed and through which the drive shaft and the inner sheath pass, and a second housing that is disposed on a proximal side of the first housing, to which a proximal portion of the inner sheath is fixed, and configured to rotatably hold the drive shaft, in which the outer sheath includes a bent portion that is bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on a proximal side of a most distal end of the accommodation lumen, and a tubular portion that has an axis having a radius of curvature larger than a radius of curvature of an axis of the bent portion, the tubular portion being positioned on a distal side of the bent portion and on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen, in which the outer sheath is rotatable of the inner sheath, in which the drive device includes a proximal side support portion configured to support the second housing, a movement portion configured to move the proximal side support portion in an axial direction, a drive unit configured to transmit a rotational force to the drive shaft, and a distal side support portion configured to rotatably support the first housing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the outer sheath is rotated with respect to the inner sheath, the ultrasound catheter configured as described above can freely adjust a distance and an angle of the transducer, which is in the accommodation lumen positioned in the tubular portion on the distal side of the bent portion, with respect to an observation target. Therefore, the ultrasound catheter can acquire an image of the observation target with relatively high accuracy even when the ultrasound catheter is inserted into a relatively large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the first housing supported by a distal side support portion is rotatable, by rotating the outer sheath fixed to the first housing with respect to the inner sheath, the ultrasound catheter system configured as described above can freely adjust the distance and the angle of the transducer, which is in the accommodation lumen positioned in the tubular portion on the distal side of the bent portion, with respect to the observation target. Therefore, the ultrasound catheter system can acquire an image of the observation target with relatively high accuracy even when the ultrasound catheter system is inserted into a relatively large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An axis of the tubular portion may be linear. Accordingly, since the transducer to be moved in the accommodation lumen is moved linearly, obtained images can be rather easily connected in the axial direction, and a relatively highly accurate three-dimensional image can be acquired.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The outer sheath may include may include two or more bent portions at different positions in an axial direction. Accordingly, as compared with a case where the outer sheath includes only one bent portion, it is rather easy to dispose the transducer at a desirable position.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">At least one of the two or more bent portions may be bent toward a side opposite to another of the two or more bent portions. Accordingly, the distal portion of the outer sheath can be disposed at a position offset from the proximal portion of the outer sheath while having a shape close to parallel to the proximal portion of the outer sheath. Therefore, the distal portion of the outer sheath is rather easily disposed along a wall of an inner lumen of a heart or an inner lumen such as a blood vessel. Therefore, the transducer that pulls back along the axis can be disposed at a desirable position with respect to the observation target in a relatively large range of the outer sheath in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The ultrasound catheter may include the two or more portions bent toward the same side. Accordingly, an angle of each bent portion of the outer sheath can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a load on the drive shaft that is movable in an axial direction while being rotated in the bent portion, and to help prevent occurrence of a rotation failure or a failure in movement in the axial direction. Further, since the outer sheath can be largely bent as a whole by the two or more bent portions, orientation is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The transducer may be configured to move in the accommodation lumen in an axial direction beyond the bent portion. Accordingly, the transducer can acquire an image of an internal structure of a living body positioned in a relatively large range beyond the bent portion in an axial direction of the accommodation lumen.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A bending angle of the axis of the bent portion may be 5&#xb0; to 20&#xb0;. When the bending angle is not too small, it is relatively easy to set an offset amount of the outer sheath to a desirable value. Further, when the bending angle is not too large, rotation and movement in the axial direction of the drive shaft, which moves in the axial direction while being rotated in a state of being bent in the bent portion, are less likely to be hindered.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The outer sheath may include a proximal side tubular portion on a proximal side of a bent portion on a most proximal side, and a distal portion length, which is a length from the bent portion on a most proximal side to a most distal end of the outer sheath along a linear reference line where an axis of at least a distal portion of the proximal side tubular portion is positioned, may be, for example, 20 mm to 150 mm. Accordingly, a length of a portion offset with respect to the proximal side tubular portion can be set, for example, to a length appropriate for observation in a heart or a blood vessel having a relatively large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The outer sheath may include the proximal side tubular portion on the proximal side of the bent portion on the most proximal side, and an offset amount, which is a length from the linear reference line where the axis of at least the distal portion of the proximal side tubular portion is positioned to an axis of a portion farthest in a direction perpendicular to the reference line of a portion on a distal side of the bent portion of the outer sheath on the most proximal side, may be, for example, 5 mm to 30 mm. Since the offset amount has an appropriate magnitude, it is relatively easy to bring the outer sheath close to the observation target in the heart or the blood vessel having the large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An ultrasound catheter is disclosed, comprising: an outer sheath, the outer sheath includes an accommodation lumen configured to extend from a proximal end to a distal end of the outer sheath; a drive shaft configured to move in an axial direction of the outer sheath; a transducer fixed to a distal end of the drive shaft; the outer sheath includes a bent portion, the bent portion being bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on a proximal side of a most distal end of the accommodation lumen, and a tubular portion having a linear axis, the tubular portion being positioned on a distal side of the bent portion and on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen; the outer sheath is rotatable with respect to the drive shaft; and wherein the transducer is configured to move in the accommodation lumen in the axial direction of the outer sheath beyond the bent portion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view showing an ultrasound catheter according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> show cross-sectional views of the ultrasound catheter before a transducer is pulled back, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a distal portion and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a proximal portion.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing an ultrasound catheter system including the ultrasound catheter.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show views of a holding portion of a drive device, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a front view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a side view.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a state where the ultrasound catheter is supported by a distal end support portion of the drive device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> show cross-sectional views showing a state where the transducer of the ultrasound catheter is pulled back, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows the distal portion and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows the proximal portion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustrative view of a treatment method using the ultrasound catheter according to the present embodiment, in which the ultrasound catheter uses a front view, a biotissue uses a cross-sectional view, and both the front view and the cross-sectional view are illustrative views schematically showing the ultrasound catheter and the biotissue, respectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an illustrative view of another example of the treatment method using the ultrasound catheter according to the present embodiment, in which the ultrasound catheter uses a front view, the biotissue uses a cross-sectional view, and both the front view and the cross-sectional view are illustrative views schematically showing the ultrasound catheter and the biotissue, respectively.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> show plan views showing modifications of the ultrasound catheter, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> shows a first modification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> shows a second modification, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> shows a third modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings is a detailed description of embodiments of an ultrasound catheter and an ultrasound catheter system that acquire an image by being inserted into an inner lumen such as a heart or a blood vessel.

Accordingly, air in the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> can be removed, and a periphery of the transducer unit <b>40</b> can be filled with the saline solution.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, circulation of the saline solution is continued or stopped by the pump device <b>90</b>, and the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> can be inserted into the lumen in the living body.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, a surgeon percutaneously inserts the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> into the femoral vein. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, under observation with X-rays, the surgeon pushes forward the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> inserted into the blood vessel, and causes the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> to reach the right atrium HRa via an inferior vena cava Iv. The surgeon disposes a most distal end of the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> at a position beyond an oval fossa Fo that is an observation target (on a side close to a superior vena cava with respect to the oval fossa Fo). Further, the surgeon percutaneously inserts a sheath <b>100</b> into the femoral vein, and causes the sheath <b>100</b> to reach the right atrium HRa via the inferior vena cava Iv.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> is coupled to the drive device <b>80</b>. That is, the engagement portion <b>65</b> of the first housing <b>60</b> is surrounded by the two inner ring members <b>99</b>, and the engagement portion <b>65</b> and the inner ring members <b>99</b> are disposed between the two outer ring members <b>96</b> in an open state. Thereafter, the two outer ring members <b>96</b> are closed, and fixed by the fixing mechanism <b>98</b>. Accordingly, the first housing <b>60</b> is supported by the distal side support portion <b>83</b> so as to be rotatable and immovable in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the joint <b>75</b> of the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> is connected to the proximal side support portion <b>812</b> of the drive unit <b>81</b>. Accordingly, a signal can be transmitted and received between the transducer unit <b>40</b> and the drive device <b>80</b>. Further, the drive shaft <b>50</b> can rotate and move by the drive unit <b>81</b> and the movement portion <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the surgeon performs a pull-back operation while rotating the drive shaft <b>50</b> while acquiring image data from the transducer unit <b>40</b> by the drive device <b>80</b>. The pull-back operation can be performed by operating the movement portion <b>82</b> connected to the proximal portion of the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> by the control unit <b>89</b>. The acquired data is subjected to a digital processing by the control unit <b>89</b>, and then displayed on the display unit <b>88</b> as image data (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The display unit <b>88</b> can display the image data substantially in real time. The surgeon disposes the transducer <b>41</b> at a specific position in a rotation direction and an axial direction in which the oval fossa Fo can be observed while checking the display unit <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the surgeon rotates the first housing <b>60</b> rotatably supported by the distal side support portion <b>83</b> to rotate the outer sheath <b>20</b> in a state where pull-back and rotation of the drive shaft <b>50</b> by the drive device <b>80</b> are fixed. The outer sheath <b>20</b> includes the first bent portion <b>24</b> at the distal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b>. Therefore, the surgeon can freely adjust a distance and an angle of an offset portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> with respect to the observation target. When an offset lower portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> is rotated, positions of the transducer <b>41</b> and the drive shaft <b>50</b> disposed in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> also change accordingly. Therefore, the surgeon can freely adjust the distance and the angle of the transducer <b>41</b> disposed in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> of the outer sheath <b>20</b> with respect to the observation target. For example, by rotating the outer sheath <b>20</b>, the surgeon can bring the transducer <b>41</b> relatively close to the oval fossa Fo that is an observation target such that the oval fossa Fo can be rather easily observed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the surgeon causes a septum puncture needle <b>101</b> to reach the right atrium HRa via the sheath <b>100</b>. Next, the surgeon checks that the septum puncture needle <b>101</b> is directed toward the oval fossa Fo under ultrasound observation by the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b>. Thereafter, the surgeon punctures the oval fossa Fo with the septum puncture needle <b>101</b> under the ultrasound observation. Accordingly, it is possible to reliably prevent a portion other than the oval fossa Fo from being punctured by the septum puncture needle <b>101</b>. Thereafter, the surgeon removes the septum puncture needle <b>101</b>, the sheath <b>100</b>, and the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b>, and completes the procedure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment includes: the outer sheath <b>20</b> in which the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> that extends from the proximal end to the distal end is formed; the inner sheath <b>30</b> that can move in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> along the axis of the outer sheath <b>20</b>; the drive shaft <b>50</b> that can rotate in the inner sheath <b>30</b> and/or the outer sheath <b>20</b>; and the transducer <b>41</b> that is disposed on the distal side of the inner sheath <b>30</b> in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, and that is fixed to the distal end of the drive shaft <b>50</b>, in which the outer sheath <b>20</b> includes the first bent portion <b>24</b> that is bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on the proximal side of a most distal end of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, and the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> that have the axis having the radius of curvature larger than the radius of curvature of the axis of the first bent portion <b>24</b>, the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> being positioned on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> and on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, in which the outer sheath <b>20</b> is rotatable with respect to the inner sheath <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Since the outer sheath <b>20</b> is rotated with respect to the inner sheath <b>30</b>, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> configured as described above can freely adjust the distance and the angle of the transducer <b>41</b>, which is in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> positioned in the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b>, with respect to the observation target. Therefore, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> can acquire an image of the observation target with relatively high accuracy even when the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> is inserted into a large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The axes of the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> are linear. Accordingly, since the transducer <b>41</b> to be moved in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> is moved linearly, obtained images can be rather easily connected in the axial direction, and a relatively highly accurate three-dimensional image can be acquired.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The outer sheath <b>20</b> can include the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b> at different positions in the axial direction. Accordingly, as compared with a case where the outer sheath <b>20</b> includes only one bent portion, it is relatively easy to dispose the transducer <b>41</b> at a desirable position.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The second tubular portion <b>27</b>, which is at least one of the bent portions, is bent toward a side opposite to the first tubular portion <b>25</b>, which is at least one of other bent portions. Accordingly, the distal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> can be disposed at a position offset from the proximal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> while having a shape close to parallel to the proximal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b>. Therefore, the distal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> is rather easily disposed along a wall of the inner lumen of the heart or the inner lumen such as a blood vessel. Therefore, the transducer <b>41</b> that pulls back along the axis can be disposed at a desirable position with respect to the observation target in a large range of the outer sheath <b>20</b> in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The transducer <b>41</b> can move in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> in the axial direction beyond the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the transducer <b>41</b> can acquire an image of an internal structure of a living body positioned in a large range beyond the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b> in an axial direction of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The bending angle of the axis of the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b> can be, for example, 5&#xb0; to 20&#xb0;. When the bending angle is not too small, it is relatively easy to set the offset amount L<b>2</b> of the outer sheath <b>20</b> to a desirable value. Further, when the bending angle is not too large, rotation and movement in the axial direction of the drive shaft <b>50</b>, which moves in the axial direction while being rotated in a state of being bent in the bent portion, are less likely to be hindered.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The outer sheath <b>20</b> includes the proximal side tubular portion <b>23</b> on the proximal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> that is a bent portion on a most proximal side. The distal portion length L<b>1</b>, which is a length from the first bent portion <b>24</b> to the most distal end of the outer sheath <b>20</b> along the linear reference line X where the axis of at least the distal portion of the proximal side tubular portion <b>23</b> is positioned, is 20 mm to 150 mm. Accordingly, a length of a portion offset with respect to the proximal side tubular portion <b>23</b> can be set to a length appropriate for observation in a heart or a blood vessel having a large inner lumen. Further, since the distal portion length L<b>1</b> is an appropriate length, it is rather easy to set the offset amount L<b>2</b> of the outer sheath <b>20</b> to a length appropriate for observation in the heart or the blood vessel having the large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The outer sheath <b>20</b> includes the proximal side tubular portion <b>23</b> on the proximal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> that is a bent portion on the most proximal side. The offset amount L<b>2</b> that is a length from the linear reference line X where the axis of at least the distal portion of the proximal side tubular portion <b>23</b> is positioned to the axis of the portion farthest in the direction perpendicular to the reference line X of a portion on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> of the outer sheath <b>20</b> is 5 mm to 30 mm. Since the offset amount L<b>2</b> has an appropriate magnitude, it is rather easy to bring the outer sheath <b>20</b> close to the observation target in the heart or the blood vessel having the large inner lumen.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ultrasound catheter system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> and the drive device <b>80</b> that drives the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b>, in which the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> includes the outer sheath <b>20</b> in which the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> that extends from the proximal end to the distal end is formed; the inner sheath <b>30</b> that can move in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> along the axis of the outer sheath <b>20</b>; the drive shaft <b>50</b> that can rotate in the inner sheath <b>30</b> and/or the outer sheath <b>20</b>; the transducer <b>41</b> disposed on the distal side of the inner sheath <b>30</b> in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, and fixed to the distal end of the drive shaft <b>50</b>; the first housing <b>60</b> to which the proximal portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> is fixed and through which the drive shaft <b>50</b> and the inner sheath <b>30</b> pass; and the second housing <b>70</b> that is disposed on the proximal side of the first housing <b>60</b>, to which the proximal portion of the inner sheath <b>30</b> is fixed, and that rotatably holds the drive shaft <b>50</b>, in which the outer sheath <b>20</b> includes the first bent portion <b>24</b> that is bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, and the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> that have the axis having the radius of curvature larger than the radius of curvature of the axis of the first bent portion <b>24</b>, the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> being positioned on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b> and on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, in which the outer sheath <b>20</b> is rotatable with respect to the inner sheath <b>30</b>, in which the drive device <b>80</b> includes the proximal side support portion <b>812</b> that can support the second housing <b>70</b>, the movement portion <b>82</b> that can move the proximal side support portion <b>812</b> in the axial direction, the drive unit <b>81</b> that can transmit the rotational force to the drive shaft <b>50</b>, and the distal side support portion <b>83</b> that can rotatably support the first housing <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the first housing <b>60</b> supported by the distal side support portion <b>83</b> is rotatable, by rotating the outer sheath <b>20</b> fixed to the first housing <b>60</b> with respect to the inner sheath <b>30</b>, the ultrasound catheter system <b>1</b> configured as described above can freely adjust the distance and the angle of the transducer <b>41</b>, which is in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> positioned in the first tubular portion <b>25</b> and the second tubular portion <b>27</b> on the distal side of the first bent portion <b>24</b>, with respect to the observation target.

The present treatment method includes: inserting, into the blood vessel, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> in which the transducer <b>41</b> rotatable and movable in the axial direction is provided in the outer sheath <b>20</b> in which the accommodation lumen <b>28</b> that extends from the proximal end to the distal end is formed and that includes the bent portion bent and shaped in advance at a predetermined angle on the proximal side of the most distal end of the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>, and causing the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> to reach the right atrium HRa via the inferior vena cava Iv; acquiring an ultrasound image by moving the transducer <b>41</b> along the axis while rotating the transducer <b>41</b> in the accommodation lumen <b>28</b>; rotating the outer sheath <b>20</b> to adjust a position of a portion on the distal side of the bent portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b> with respect to the oval fossa Fo that is an observation target; and acquiring an ultrasound image of the oval fossa Fo by the transducer <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the treatment method configured as described above, by rotating the outer sheath <b>20</b> of the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> inserted into the large inner lumen of the heart, the position and the angle of the transducer <b>41</b>, which is disposed in the outer sheath <b>20</b> on the distal side of the bent portion of the outer sheath <b>20</b>, with respect to the oval fossa Fo can be freely adjusted. Therefore, in the present treatment method, it is possible to acquire an image of the oval fossa Fo, which is the observation target, with relatively high accuracy even when the treatment is performed in the large inner lumen of the heart. Therefore, in the present treatment method, for example, it is possible to safely puncture the oval fossa Fo while checking the oval fossa Fo.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment described above, and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art within a scope of the technical idea of the present disclosure. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment may be inserted into one of two adjacent blood vessels and used to observe a blood vessel into which the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> is not inserted. For example, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> can be inserted into a vein Ve of a lower limb or an abdomen to observe an inside of an artery Ar adjacent to the vein Ve. Therefore, for example, when a procedure of inserting an atherectomy device into an artery and scraping and removing a calcified lesion is performed, the calcified lesion and the atherectomy device in the artery Ar can be observed.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As in a first modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, only one bent portion (for example, the first bent portion <b>24</b>) may be provided.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As in a second modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> may include at least two bent portions (for example, the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b>) bent toward the same side. Accordingly, in the outer sheath <b>20</b>, respective angles of the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b> can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a load on the drive shaft <b>50</b> that is movable in an axial direction while being rotated in the first bent portion <b>24</b> and the second bent portion <b>26</b>, and to help prevent occurrence of a rotation failure or a failure in movement in the axial direction. Further, since the outer sheath <b>20</b> can be largely bent as a whole by at least two bent portions, orientation is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As in a third modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, in the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b>, a wire <b>29</b> that protrudes from a distal end of the outer sheath <b>20</b> in a distal end direction may be formed.

The wire <b>29</b> has a function as a guide wire for selecting a blood vessel to be advanced when the ultrasound catheter <b>10</b> is pushed forward in the blood vessel.
