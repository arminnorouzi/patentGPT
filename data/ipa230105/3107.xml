Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Well completion operations in the oil and gas industry often involve hydraulic fracturing (often referred to as fracking or fracing) to increase the release of oil and gas in rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid (e.g., frac fluid) containing a combination of water, chemicals, and proppant (e.g., sand, ceramics) into a well at high pressures. The high pressures of the fluid increases crack size and crack propagation through the rock formation releasing more oil and gas, while the proppant prevents the cracks from closing once the fluid is depressurized. Fracturing operations use high-pressure pumps to increase the pressure of the frac fluid. Unfortunately, the proppant in the frac fluid increases wear and maintenance on the high-pressure pumps.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood when the following detailed description is read with reference to the accompanying figures in which like characters represent like parts throughout the figures, wherein:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a frac system with a hydraulic energy transfer system;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a hydraulic turbocharger;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a reciprocating isobaric pressure exchanger (reciprocating IPX);</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a reciprocating IPX;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary isobaric pressure exchanger (rotary IPX);</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary IPX in a first operating position;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary IPX in a second operating position;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary IPX in a third operating position;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary IPX in a fourth operating position;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a frac system with a hydraulic energy transfer system; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a frac system with a hydraulic energy transfer system.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. These described embodiments are only exemplary of the present invention. Additionally, in an effort to provide a concise description of these exemplary embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As discussed in detail below, the frac system or hydraulic fracturing system includes a hydraulic energy transfer system that transfers work and/or pressure between a first fluid (e.g., a pressure exchange fluid, such as a substantially proppant free fluid) and a second fluid (e.g., frac fluid, such as a proppant-laden fluid). For example, the first fluid may be at a first pressure between approximately 5,000 kPa to 25,000 kPa, 20,000 kPa to 50,000 kPa, 40,000 kPa to 75,000 kPa, 75,000 kPa to 100,000 kPa or greater than the second pressure of the second fluid. In operation, the hydraulic energy transfer system may or may not completely equalize pressures between the first and second fluids. Accordingly, the hydraulic energy transfer system may operate isobarically, or substantially isobarically (e.g., wherein the pressures of the first and second fluids equalize within approximately +/&#x2212;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent of each other).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hydraulic energy transfer system may also be described as a hydraulic protection system, hydraulic buffer system, or a hydraulic isolation system, because it blocks or limits contact between a frac fluid and various hydraulic fracturing equipment (e.g., high-pressure pumps), while still exchanging work and/or pressure between the first and second fluids. By blocking or limiting contact between various pieces of hydraulic fracturing equipment and the second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid), the hydraulic energy transfer system reduces abrasion/wear, thus increasing the life/performance of this equipment (e.g., high-pressure pumps). Moreover, it may enable the frac system to use less expensive equipment in the fracturing system, for example high-pressure pumps that are not designed for abrasive fluids (e.g., frac fluids and/or corrosive fluids). In some embodiments, the hydraulic energy transfer system may be a hydraulic turbocharger, a rotating isobaric pressure exchanger (e.g., rotary IPX), or a non-rotating isobaric pressure exchanger (e.g., bladder, reciprocating isobaric pressure exchanger). Rotating and non-rotating isobaric pressure exchangers may be generally defined as devices that transfer fluid pressure between a high-pressure inlet stream and a low-pressure inlet stream at efficiencies in excess of approximately 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% without utilizing centrifugal technology.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As explained above, the hydraulic energy transfer system transfers work and/or pressure between first and second fluids. These fluids may be multi-phase fluids such as gas/liquid flows, gas/solid particulate flows, liquid/solid particulate flows, gas/liquid/solid particulate flows, or any other multi-phase flow. Moreover, these fluids may be non-Newtonian fluids (e.g., shear thinning fluid), highly viscous fluids, non-Newtonian fluids containing proppant, or highly viscous fluids containing proppant. The proppant may include sand, solid particles, powders, debris, ceramics, or any combination therefore.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the frac system <b>10</b> (e.g., fluid handling system) with a hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. In operation, the frac system <b>10</b> enables well completion operations to increase the release of oil and gas in rock formations. The frac system <b>10</b> may include one or more first fluid pumps <b>18</b> and one or more second fluid pumps <b>20</b> coupled to a hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. For example, the hydraulic energy system <b>12</b> may include a hydraulic turbocharger, rotary IPX, reciprocating IPX, or any combination thereof. In addition, the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> may be disposed on a skid separate from the other components of a frac system <b>10</b>, which may be desirable in situations in which the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> is added to an existing frac system <b>10</b>. In operation, the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> transfers pressures without any substantial mixing between a first fluid (e.g., proppant free fluid) pumped by the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> and a second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid or frac fluid) pumped by the second fluid pumps <b>20</b>. In this manner, the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> blocks or limits wear on the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> (e.g., high-pressure pumps), while enabling the frac system <b>10</b> to pump a high-pressure frac fluid into the well <b>14</b> to release oil and gas. In addition, because the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> is configured to be exposed to the first and second fluids, the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> may be made from materials resistant to corrosive and abrasive substances in either the first and second fluids. For example, the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> may be made out of ceramics (e.g., alumina, cermets, such as carbide, oxide, nitride, or boride hard phases) within a metal matrix (e.g., Co, Cr or Ni or any combination thereof) such as tungsten carbide in a matrix of CoCr, Ni, NiCr or Co.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b>. As explained above, the frac system <b>10</b> may use a hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> as the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. In operation, the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> enables work and/or pressure transfer between the first fluid (e.g., high-pressure proppant free fluid, substantially proppant free) and a second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid) while blocking or limiting contact (and thus mixing) between the first and second fluids. As illustrated, the first fluid enters a first side <b>42</b> of the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> through a first inlet <b>44</b>, and the second fluid (e.g., low-pressure frac fluid) may enter the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> on a second side <b>46</b> through a second inlet <b>48</b>. As the first fluid enters the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b>, the first fluid contacts the first impeller <b>50</b> transferring energy from the first fluid to the first impeller; this drives rotation of the first impeller <b>50</b> about the axis <b>52</b>. The rotational energy of the first impeller <b>50</b> is then transferred through the shaft <b>54</b> to the second impeller <b>56</b>. After transferring energy to the first impeller <b>50</b>, the first fluid exits the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> as a low-pressure fluid through a first outlet <b>58</b>. The rotation of the second impeller <b>56</b> then increases the pressure of the second fluid entering the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> through the inlet <b>48</b>. Once pressurized, the second fluid exits the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> as a high-pressure frac fluid capable of hydraulically fracturing the well <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to block contact between the first and second fluids, the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> includes a wall <b>62</b> between the first and second sides <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>. The wall <b>62</b> includes an aperture <b>64</b> that enables the shaft <b>58</b> (e.g., cylindrical shaft) to extend between the first and second impellers <b>50</b> and <b>56</b> but blocks fluid flow. In some embodiments, the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> may include gaskets/seals <b>66</b> (e.g., annular seals) that may further reduce or block fluid exchange between the first and second fluids.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a reciprocating isobaric pressure exchanger <b>90</b> (reciprocating IPX). The reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> may include first and second pressure vessels <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> that alternatingly transfer pressure from the first fluid (e.g., high-pressure proppant free fluid) to the second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid, frac fluid) using a valve <b>96</b>. In other embodiments, there may be additional pressure vessels (e.g., <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, or more). As illustrated, the valve <b>96</b> includes a first piston <b>98</b>, a second piston <b>100</b>, and a shaft <b>102</b> that couples the first piston <b>98</b> to the second piston <b>100</b> and to a drive <b>104</b> (e.g., electric motor, hydraulic motor, combustion motor, etc.). The drive <b>104</b> drives the valve <b>96</b> in alternating axial directions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> to control the flow of the first fluid entering through the high-pressure inlet <b>110</b>. For example, in a first position, the valve <b>96</b> uses the first and second pistons <b>98</b> and <b>100</b> to direct the high-pressure first fluid into the first pressure vessel <b>92</b>, while blocking the flow of high-pressure first fluid into the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> or out of the valve <b>96</b> through the low-pressure outlets <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. As the high-pressure first fluid enters the first pressure vessel <b>92</b>, the first fluid drives a pressure vessel piston <b>116</b> in axial direction <b>118</b>, which increase the pressure of the second fluid within the first pressure vessel <b>92</b>. Once the second fluid reaches the appropriate pressure, a high-pressure check valve <b>120</b> opens enabling high-pressure second fluid to exit the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> through the high-pressure outlet <b>122</b> for use in fracing operations. While the first pressure vessel <b>92</b> discharges, the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> prepares the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> to pressurize the second fluid. As illustrated, low-pressure second fluid enters the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> through a low-pressure check valve <b>124</b> coupled to a low-pressure second fluid inlet <b>126</b>. As the second fluid fills the second pressure vessel <b>94</b>, the second fluid drives a pressure vessel piston <b>128</b> in axial direction <b>130</b> forcing low-pressure first fluid out of the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> and out of the valve <b>96</b> through the low-pressure outlet <b>114</b>, preparing the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> to receive high-pressure first fluid.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> with the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> discharging high-pressure second fluid, and the first pressure vessel <b>92</b> filling with low-pressure second fluid. As illustrated, the valve <b>96</b> is in a second position. In the second position, the valve <b>96</b> directs the high-pressure first fluid into the second pressure vessel <b>94</b>, while blocking the flow of high-pressure first fluid into the first pressure vessel <b>92</b>, or out of valve <b>96</b> through the low-pressure outlets <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. As the high-pressure first fluid enters the second pressure vessel <b>94</b>, the first fluid drives the pressure vessel piston <b>128</b> in axial direction <b>118</b> to increase the pressure of the second fluid within the second pressure vessel <b>94</b>. Once the second fluid reaches the appropriate pressure, a high-pressure check valve <b>132</b> opens enabling high-pressure second fluid to exit the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> through the high-pressure outlet <b>134</b> for use in fracing operations. While the second pressure vessel <b>94</b> discharges, the first pressure vessel <b>92</b> fills with the second fluid passing through a low-pressure check valve <b>136</b> coupled to a low-pressure second fluid inlet <b>138</b>. As the second fluid fills the first pressure vessel <b>92</b>, the second fluid drives the pressure vessel piston <b>116</b> in axial direction <b>130</b> forcing low-pressure first fluid out of the first pressure vessel <b>92</b> and out through the low-pressure outlet <b>112</b>. In this manner, the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> alternatingly transfers pressure from the first fluid (e.g., high-pressure proppant free fluid) to the second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid, frac fluid) using the first and second pressure vessels <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>. Moreover, because the pressure vessel pistons <b>116</b> and <b>128</b> separate the first and second fluids, the reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> is capable of protecting fracing system equipment (e.g., high-pressure fluid pumps fluidly coupled to the high-pressure inlet <b>110</b>) from contact with the second fluid (e.g., corrosive and/or proppant containing fluid).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of a rotary isobaric pressure exchanger <b>160</b> (rotary IPX) capable of transferring pressure and/or work between first and second fluids (e.g., proppant free fluid and proppant laden fluid) with minimal mixing of the fluids. The rotary IPX <b>160</b> may include a generally cylindrical body portion <b>162</b> that includes a sleeve <b>164</b> and a rotor <b>166</b>. The rotary IPX <b>160</b> may also include two end caps <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> that include manifolds <b>172</b> and <b>174</b>, respectively. Manifold <b>172</b> includes respective inlet and outlet ports <b>176</b> and <b>178</b>, while manifold <b>174</b> includes respective inlet and outlet ports <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. In operation, these inlet ports <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> enabling the first fluid (e.g., proppant free fluid) to enter the rotary IPX <b>160</b> to exchange pressure, while the outlet ports <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> enable the first fluid to then exit the rotary IPX <b>160</b>. In operation, the inlet port <b>176</b> may receive a high-pressure first fluid, and after exchanging pressure, the outlet port <b>178</b> may be used to route a low-pressure first fluid out of the rotary IPX <b>160</b>. Similarly, inlet port <b>180</b> may receive a low-pressure second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid, frac fluid) and the outlet port <b>182</b> may be used to route a high-pressure second fluid out of the rotary IPX <b>160</b>. The end caps <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> include respective end covers <b>184</b> and <b>186</b> disposed within respective manifolds <b>172</b> and <b>174</b> that enable fluid sealing contact with the rotor <b>166</b>. The rotor <b>166</b> may be cylindrical and disposed in the sleeve <b>164</b>, which enables the rotor <b>166</b> to rotate about the axis <b>188</b>. The rotor <b>166</b> may have a plurality of channels <b>190</b> extending substantially longitudinally through the rotor <b>166</b> with openings <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> at each end arranged symmetrically about the longitudinal axis <b>188</b>. The openings <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> of the rotor <b>166</b> are arranged for hydraulic communication with inlet and outlet apertures <b>196</b> and <b>198</b>; and <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> in the end covers <b>172</b> and <b>174</b>, in such a manner that during rotation the channels <b>190</b> are exposed to fluid at high-pressure and fluid at low-pressure. As illustrated, the inlet and outlet apertures <b>196</b> and <b>198</b>, and <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> may be designed in the form of arcs or segments of a circle (e.g., C-shaped).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, a controller using sensor feedback may control the extent of mixing between the first and second fluids in the rotary IPX <b>160</b>, which may be used to improve the operability of the fluid handling system. For example, varying the proportions of the first and second fluids entering the rotary IPX <b>160</b> allows the plant operator to control the amount of fluid mixing within the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. Three characteristics of the rotary IPX <b>160</b> that affect mixing are: (1) the aspect ratio of the rotor channels <b>190</b>, (2) the short duration of exposure between the first and second fluids, and (3) the creation of a fluid barrier (e.g., an interface) between the first and second fluids within the rotor channels <b>190</b>. First, the rotor channels <b>190</b> are generally long and narrow, which stabilizes the flow within the rotary IPX <b>160</b>. In addition, the first and second fluids may move through the channels <b>190</b> in a plug flow regime with very little axial mixing. Second, in certain embodiments, the speed of the rotor <b>166</b> reduces contact between the first and second fluids. For example, the speed of the rotor <b>166</b> may reduce contact times between the first and second fluids to less than approximately 0.15 seconds, 0.10 seconds, or 0.05 seconds. Third, a small portion of the rotor channel <b>190</b> is used for the exchange of pressure between the first and second fluids. Therefore, a volume of fluid remains in the channel <b>190</b> as a barrier between the first and second fluids. All these mechanisms may limit mixing within the rotary IPX <b>160</b>. Moreover, in some embodiments, the rotary IPX <b>160</b> may be designed to operate with internal pistons that isolate the first and second fluids while enabling pressure transfer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref> are exploded views of an embodiment of the rotary IPX <b>160</b> illustrating the sequence of positions of a single channel <b>190</b> in the rotor <b>166</b> as the channel <b>190</b> rotates through a complete cycle.

As described in detail below, the rotary IPX <b>160</b> facilitates pressure exchange between first and second fluids (e.g., proppant free fluid and proppant-laden fluid) by enabling the first and second fluids to momentarily contact each other within the rotor <b>166</b>. In certain embodiments, this exchange happens at speeds that result in limited mixing of the first and second fluids.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the channel opening <b>192</b> is in a first position. In the first position, the channel opening <b>192</b> is in fluid communication with the aperture <b>198</b> in endplate <b>184</b> and therefore with the manifold <b>172</b>, while opposing channel opening <b>194</b> is in hydraulic communication with the aperture <b>202</b> in end cover <b>186</b> and by extension with the manifold <b>174</b>. As will be discussed below, the rotor <b>166</b> may rotate in the clockwise direction indicated by arrow <b>204</b>. In operation, low-pressure second fluid <b>206</b> passes through end cover <b>186</b> and enters the channel <b>190</b>, where it contacts the first fluid <b>208</b> at a dynamic fluid interface <b>210</b>. The second fluid <b>206</b> then drives the first fluid <b>208</b> out of the channel <b>190</b>, through end cover <b>184</b>, and out of the rotary IPX <b>160</b>.

As explained above, the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> or reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> protect hydraulic fracturing equipment (e.g., high-pressure pumps), while enabling high-pressure frac fluid to be pumped into the well <b>14</b> during fracing operations. As illustrated, the frac system <b>10</b> includes one or more first fluid pumps <b>18</b> and one or more second fluid pumps <b>20</b>. The first fluid pumps <b>18</b> may include a low-pressure pump <b>234</b> and a high-pressure pump <b>236</b>, while the second fluid pumps <b>20</b> may include a low-pressure pump <b>238</b>. In some embodiments, the frac system <b>10</b> may include additional first fluid pumps <b>18</b> (e.g., additional low-, intermediate-, and/or high-pressure pumps) and second fluid pumps <b>20</b> (e.g., low-pressure pumps). In operation, the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> and second fluid pumps <b>20</b> pump respective first and second fluids (e.g., proppant free fluid and proppant laden fluid) into the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> where the fluids exchange work and pressure.

As a result, the hydraulic turbocharger <b>40</b> and reciprocating IPX <b>90</b> high-pressure pump <b>236</b> protect the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> from exposure to the second fluid (e.g., proppant containing fluid). In other words, the second fluid pumps <b>18</b> are not subject to increased abrasion and/or wear caused by the proppant (e.g., solid particulate).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated, the first fluid low-pressure pump <b>234</b> fluidly couples to the first fluid high-pressure pump <b>236</b>. In operation, the first fluid low-pressure pump <b>234</b> receives the first fluid (e.g., proppant free fluid, substantially proppant free fluid) and increases the pressure of the first fluid for use by the first fluid high-pressure pump <b>236</b>. The first fluid may be a combination of water from a water tank <b>244</b> and chemicals from a chemical tank <b>246</b>. However, in some embodiments, the first fluid may be only water or substantially water (e.g., <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>95</b>, or more percent water). The first fluid high-pressure pump <b>236</b> then pumps the first fluid through a high-pressure inlet <b>240</b> and into the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. The pressure of the first fluid then transfers to the second fluid (e.g., proppant laden fluid, frac fluid), which enters the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> through a second fluid low-pressure inlet <b>242</b>. The second fluid is a frac fluid containing proppant (e.g., sand, ceramic, etc.) from a proppant tank <b>248</b>. After exchanging pressure, the second fluid exits the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b> through a high-pressure outlet <b>250</b> and enters the well <b>14</b>, while the first fluid exits at a reduced pressure through the low-pressure outlet <b>252</b>. In some embodiments, the frac system <b>10</b> may include a boost pump <b>254</b> that further raises the pressure of the second fluid before entering the well <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After exiting the outlet <b>252</b> at a low-pressure, the first fluid may be recirculated through the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> and/or pass through the mixing tank <b>256</b>. For example, a three-way valve <b>258</b> may control whether all of or a portion of the first fluid is recirculated through the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>, or whether all of or a portion of the first fluid is directed through the mixing tank <b>256</b> to form the second fluid. If the first fluid is directed to the mixing tank <b>256</b>, the mixing tank <b>256</b> combines the first fluid with proppant from the proppant tank <b>248</b> to form the second fluid (e.g., frac fluid). In some embodiments, the mixing tank <b>256</b> may receive water and chemicals directly from the water tank <b>244</b> and the chemical tank <b>246</b> to supplement or replace the first fluid passing through the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. The mixing tank <b>256</b> may then combine these fluids with proppant from the proppant tank <b>248</b> to produce the second fluid (e.g., frac fluid).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to control the composition (e.g., the percentages of chemicals, water, and proppant) and flow of the first and second fluids, the frac system <b>10</b> may include a controller <b>260</b>. For example, the controller <b>260</b> may maintain flow, composition, and pressure of the first and second fluids within threshold ranges, above a threshold level, and/or below a threshold level. The controller <b>260</b> may include one or more processors <b>262</b> and a memory <b>264</b> that receives feedback from sensors <b>266</b> and <b>268</b>; and flow meters <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> in order to control the composition and flow of the first and second fluids into the hydraulic energy transfer system <b>12</b>. For example, the controller <b>260</b> may receive feedback from sensor <b>266</b> that indicates the chemical composition of the second fluid is incorrect. In response, the controller <b>260</b> may open or close valves <b>274</b> or <b>276</b> to change the amount of chemicals entering the first fluid or entering the mixing tank <b>256</b> directly. In another situation, the controller <b>260</b> may receive a signal from the flow meter <b>272</b> in the first fluid flow path that indicates a need for an increased flow rate of the first fluid. Accordingly, the controller <b>260</b> may open valve <b>278</b> and valve <b>274</b> to increase the flow of water and chemicals through the frac system <b>10</b>. The controller <b>260</b> may also monitor the composition (e.g., percentage of proppant, water, etc.) of the second fluid in the mixing tank <b>256</b> with the level sensor <b>268</b> (e.g., level control). If the composition is incorrect, the controller <b>260</b> may open and close valves <b>258</b>, <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, <b>278</b>, <b>280</b>, and <b>282</b> to increase or decrease the flow of water, chemicals, and/or proppant into the mixing tank <b>256</b>.

For example, some embodiments may include multiple low-pressure pumps <b>234</b> and <b>238</b> to compensate for pressure losses in fluid lines (e.g., pipes, hoses). In operation, the rotary IPX <b>160</b> enables the first and second fluids (e.g., proppant free fluid and proppant laden fluid) to exchange work and pressure while reducing or blocking contact between the second fluid (e.g., proppant laden fluid, frac fluid) and the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the frac system <b>10</b> is capable of pumping the second fluid at high pressures into the well <b>14</b>, while reducing wear caused by the proppant (e.g., solid particulate) on the first fluid pumps <b>18</b> (e.g., high-pressure pump <b>236</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In operation, the first fluid low-pressure pump <b>234</b> receives the first fluid (e.g., proppant free fluid, substantially proppant free fluid) and increases the pressure of the first fluid for use by the first fluid high-pressure pump <b>236</b>.

In other words, the fluid exiting the low-pressure outlet <b>252</b> may be a combination of the first fluid plus some of the second fluid that did not exit the rotary IPX <b>160</b> through the high-pressure outlet <b>250</b>. In order to protect the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>, the frac system <b>10</b> may direct a majority of the combined fluid (i.e., a mixture of the first and second fluids) to the mixing tank <b>256</b> where the combined fluid is converted into the second fluid by adding more proppant and chemicals. Any excess combined fluid not needed in the mixing tank <b>256</b> may be sent to a separator <b>300</b> (e.g., separator tank, hydro cyclone) where proppant is removed, converting the combined fluid into the first fluid. The substantially proppant free first fluid may then exit the separator <b>300</b> for recirculation through the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>. The remaining combined fluid may then exit the separator tank <b>300</b> for use in the mixing tank <b>256</b>. The ability to direct a majority of the combined fluid exiting the rotary IPX <b>160</b> into the mixing tank <b>256</b> enables the frac system <b>10</b> to use a smaller separator <b>300</b> while simultaneously reducing thermal stress in the frac system <b>10</b>. For example, as the high-pressure pump <b>236</b> pressurizes the first fluid, the pressurization heats the first fluid. By sending a majority of the previously pressurized first fluid through the mixing tank <b>256</b> and then into the well <b>14</b>, the frac system <b>10</b> reduces thermal stress on the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>, the rotary IPX <b>160</b>, and other frac system <b>10</b> components. Moreover, a smaller separator may reduce the cost, maintenance, and footprint of the frac system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the mixing tank, water <b>256</b>, chemicals, and proppant are combined in the proper percentages/ratios to form the second fluid (e.g., frac fluid).

For example, the controller <b>260</b> may receive feedback from sensor <b>266</b> that indicates the chemical composition of the second fluid is incorrect. In response, the controller <b>260</b> may open or close a valve <b>274</b> to change the amount of chemicals entering the mixing tank <b>256</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>260</b> may also monitor the percentage of proppant, water, etc. in the second fluid in the mixing tank <b>256</b> with the level sensor <b>268</b> (e.g., level control). If the composition is incorrect, the controller <b>260</b> may open and close valves <b>274</b>, <b>282</b>, and <b>302</b> to increase or decrease the flow of water, chemicals, and/or proppant into the mixing tank <b>256</b>. In another situation, the controller <b>260</b> may receive a signal from the flow meter <b>272</b> that indicates the flow rate of the first fluid is too high or low. The controller <b>260</b> may then increase or decrease the speed of the low-pressure pump <b>234</b> to change the flow rate of the first fluid. The frac system <b>10</b> may also monitor the flow rate of the second fluid with the flow meter <b>270</b>. If the flow rate of the second fluid is too high or low, the controller <b>260</b> may manipulate the valves <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>; and/or increase/decrease the speed of the second pumps <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>260</b> may also monitor a sensor <b>306</b> (e.g., vibration, optical, magnetic, etc.) that detects whether the rotary IPX <b>160</b> is no longer rotating (e.g., stalled). If the rotary IPX <b>160</b> stalls, the controller <b>160</b> may open a bypass valve <b>308</b> and close valves <b>304</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>312</b> to block the flow of fluid from the low-pressure outlet <b>252</b> to the mixing tank <b>256</b>, as well as block the flow of the first fluid through the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>. The controller <b>260</b> may then open the valve <b>302</b> to pump water directly into the mixing tank <b>256</b> to produce the second fluid. The second fluid low-pressure pump <b>238</b> will then pump the second fluid through the rotary IPX <b>160</b> and bypass valve <b>308</b> to the first fluid pumps <b>18</b>. The first fluid pumps <b>18</b> will then increase the pressure of the second fluid driving the second fluid through the rotary IPX <b>160</b> and into the well <b>14</b> for fracing. In this manner, the frac system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> enables continuous fracing operations if the rotary IPX <b>160</b> stalls.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein.
