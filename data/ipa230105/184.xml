Typically, this type of apparel fits closely to the human body so that the pads are positioned over a specified area. For example, a pair of athletic pants may include pads over the thighs, hips, and/or knees to cushion falls. It is desirable for the pads to remain over the specified areas in response to all movements of the wearer, so that the apparel is comfortable and also so that the pads are properly positioned for absorbing impacts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When designing an article of apparel for a close fit to the human body, different body shapes and sizes must be considered. Different individuals within a particular garment size will have different body shapes and sizes. For example, two individuals wearing the same pant size may have very different waist to inseam dimensions. These variable measurements between similarly sized individuals makes proper design of closely fitting garments difficult.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to accounting for different body measurements for different individuals within a size, various contours of the human body must also be considered when designing closely fitting articles of apparel. If a garment is not properly sized for a particular wearer, the wearer may experience undesirable tightness, looseness, or bunching at various locations in response to normal movements, such as when crouching or squatting in a pair of athletic pants. An improper fit may result in discomfort, excessive wear, or bending or creasing of the garment at the poorly fitting locations. Additionally, the improper fit may result in the shifting and/or bunching of the protective padding included in the apparel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide a garment or other article of apparel capable of conforming to various body shapes within a given size range. It would also be desirable to provide a garment or other article of apparel that includes padding to protect the wearer from impacts. In addition, it would be desirable for such a garment or article of apparel to be relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, protective padding adapted to contour to the wearer is provided. For example, the protective padding is a multilayer panel possessing a low or a negative Poisson's ratio value. The protective padding may be incorporated into an article of apparel at selected apparel locations. By way of example, there is provided an article of apparel including an auxetic foam layer, a fabric layer, and a bonding layer located between the auxetic foam layer and the fabric layer. The bonding layer defines a plurality of openings, and each of the openings defines a reentrant shape.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, an article of apparel includes an auxetic foam layer and a bonding layer bonded to the auxetic foam layer and defining a plurality of openings. Each of the openings defines a reentrant shape, and the plurality of openings configures the bonding layer as an auxetic.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, an article of apparel includes an auxetic layer that is auxetic in three dimensions, and a bonding layer bonded to the auxetic layer. The bonding layer is auxetic in only two dimensions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The foregoing aspects and other features of an article of apparel are explained in the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an elevational view of an article of apparel including auxetic panels;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded sectional view of an auxetic panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing a base fabric layer, an auxetic layer, a bonding layer, and an outer fabric layer;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the bonding layer including an array of reentrant openings formed therethrough;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is cross sectional view of an auxetic panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a relaxed configuration;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a cross sectional view of the auxetic panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in response to tensile forces and showing an expansion in size that is characteristic of auxetic materials;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a cross sectional view of an auxetic panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a relaxed state and contoured to a wearer's knee;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a cross sectional view of the auxetic panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> in response to compressive forces and showing a contraction in size that is characteristic of auxetic materials.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph of force versus time as applied to various products including the auxetic panels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top plan view showing a bonding layer of an alternative embodiment of an auxetic panel including regions of tuned auxetic response.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and described in the following written specification.

The article of apparel <b>100</b> is pants configured, in one embodiment, for athletic events in which impacts occur, such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, martial arts, and the like. As disclosed herein, the article of apparel <b>100</b> is typically worn tight against the wearer's body with the protective panels <b>104</b> covering the wearer's hips, knees, and/or shins. The article of apparel <b>100</b> positions the panels <b>104</b> to cover and to protect certain portions of the wearer's body from impacts. The article of apparel <b>100</b> including the panels <b>104</b> provides the wearer with impact resistance that is comfortable and lightweight. Moreover, the article of apparel <b>100</b> with the panels <b>104</b> also provides the wearer with a fit that resists wear, bending, and creasing in response to movements of the wearer during crouching, squatting, kicking, bending, and the like. Therefore, the article of apparel <b>100</b> with the panels <b>104</b> has the same or better comfortable range of motion as a pair of leggings or tights without the panels <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;article of apparel&#x201d; as used herein refers to any garment, footwear, or accessory configured to be worn on or carried by a human. Examples of the article of apparel <b>100</b> include, helmets, hats, caps, shirts, pants, shorts, sleeves, knee pads, wrist pads, elbow pads, shoes, boots, backpacks, duffel bags, cinch sacks, and straps, as well as numerous other products configured to be worn on or carried by a person.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;impact&#x201d; as used herein includes the types of impacts that an athlete typically endures during sporting events, practice, competition, and the like. The type of impact varies by sport, and may include impacts to the shins while playing soccer, falling hard on the knees while playing football, sliding to reach a base while playing baseball, and strikes to the body and legs in martial arts.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Based on the above, to suit a particular sport or athletic activity, the article of apparel <b>100</b> may include a different configuration of the panels <b>104</b> than is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such as one or more shin panels, one or more knee panels, one or more hip panels, and any other combination of the panels <b>104</b>. Some embodiments of the article of apparel <b>100</b> include additional panels <b>104</b> such as tailbone protection, crotch protection, and/or groin protection. An additional embodiment, the article of apparel <b>100</b> is formed from one panel <b>104</b> that encompasses the entire article of apparel <b>100</b> or substantially the entire of the article of apparel <b>100</b>. For example, the article of apparel <b>100</b> may be an athletic knee pad the entirety of which is a protective panel <b>104</b>. The protective panels <b>104</b> are also referred to herein as padding panels, compression panels, or shaping panels.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary protective panel <b>104</b> includes four layers including a base fabric layer <b>108</b>, an foam layer <b>112</b>, a bonding layer <b>116</b>, and an outer fabric layer <b>120</b>. In comparison, regions of the article of apparel <b>100</b> not including (spaced apart from) the protective panels <b>104</b> may include only the base fabric layer <b>108</b>. Stated another way, one or more of the foam layer <b>112</b>, the bonding layer <b>116</b>, and the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> is not present at regions of the article of apparel <b>100</b> spaced apart from the auxetic panels <b>104</b>. Each layer of the auxetic panels <b>104</b> is described herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base fabric layer <b>108</b>, which is also referred to herein a first fabric layer, a material layer, a textile layer, and an inner layer, is positioned closest to the wearer's skin. The base fabric layer <b>108</b> forms the basic garment. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pants are formed by the base fabric layer <b>108</b>. The base fabric layer <b>108</b> is a stretchable material, such as Lycra&#xae;, Spandex&#xae;, or other types of elastane fabric. In one embodiment, the base fabric layer <b>108</b> is a compression fabric that fits tightly against the wearer's body. Compression fabric is configured to fit tightly to the body, applying pressure thereto. For example, the compression fabric may possess a compression level of at least four mmHg, including 8-15 mmHg (low), 15-20 mmHg (medium), and 20-30 mmHg (high). The base fabric layer <b>108</b> may be a low friction textile to enable sliding along the wearer's skin for comfortable movement of the panels <b>104</b> relative to the skin.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the foam layer <b>112</b> is positioned on the base fabric layer <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the foam layer <b>112</b> is not bonded to the base fabric layer <b>108</b>; accordingly, movement of the foam layer <b>112</b> relative to the base fabric layer <b>108</b> may occur in response to movements of the wearer and in response to deformation of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An exemplary foam layer <b>112</b> is formed from auxetic foam, such that the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is an auxetic foam layer. Conventional foams have uniform physical properties and positive Poisson's ratios. Auxetic foam, in contrast, possess a negative Poisson's ratios. Accordingly, under tensile load, auxetic foam experiences transverse expansion when stretched in an axial direction. Upon application of a compressive load (such as an impact), moreover, auxetic foam contracts in the transverse direction (when compressed in the axial direction). Exemplary auxetic foams include auxetic polyurethane foams manufactured by Auxadyne, LLC. The auxetic layer <b>112</b> may include a sheet of the auxetic foam (i.e. an auxetic foam layer) that is from 5 mm to 5 cm in thickness. In a preferred embodiment, the auxetic foam <b>112</b> is approximately 10 mm thick. The auxetic foam may possess a density of from approximately 20 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to 40 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>in a relaxed state. In the relaxed state, no external compressive or tensile forces are acting on the auxetic layer <b>112</b>. The term &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; as used herein, means within 5% of the stated value. By way of specific example, the auxetic foam is a 60 ppi polyester urethane foam with a density of approximately 25-35 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the auxetic foam of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is produced by heating a standard open cell foam (e.g., a polyurethane foam) and compressing the heated foam in all three dimensions. The auxetic foam is then cooled while under compression. Such processing transforms the standard open cell foam into a foam in which ribs/walls defining the foam cells are buckled inwardly to form a reentrant cell structure. The reentrant cell structure causes the foam to become auxetic.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;auxetic,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to a material or structure that has a negative Poisson's ratio.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;Poisson's ratio&#x201d; is a measure of the Poisson effect and is defined as the negative ratio of a transverse strain to an axial strain. Thus, for example, when a tension force is applied to the auxetic layer <b>112</b> along an axis <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) resulting in a positive strain, the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is configured to exhibit positive strain along axes <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that are perpendicular to the axis <b>152</b> (i.e. the material expands in directions transverse to the direction of stretching). Similarly, when a compressive force is applied to the auxetic layer <b>112</b> along an axis <b>156</b> resulting in a negative strain, the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is configured to exhibit negative strain along the axes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> that are perpendicular to the axis <b>156</b>. Upon release of the tension or compressive force upon the auxetic layer <b>112</b>, the recovery power of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> returns the layer <b>112</b> to its original shape/dimensions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Whether a structure has a negative Poisson's ratio and is auxetic, may depend upon the degree to which the structure is stretched. Some structures have a negative Poisson's ratio up to a certain stretch threshold, but when stretched past the threshold have a positive Poisson's ratio. For example, when the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is stretched lengthwise past a threshold, the cells and segments of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> may be stretched to an extent that the auxetic layer <b>112</b> becomes slightly thinner before the layer is torn apart or otherwise damaged. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;auxetic&#x201d; as used herein refers to structures or materials that have a negative Poisson's ratio within certain stretch thresholds. Furthermore, while the term &#x201c;auxetic&#x201d; is used to refer to a structure that has a negative Poisson's ratio, it will be recognized that structures may be &#x201c;near auxetic&#x201d;. A &#x201c;near auxetic&#x201d; structure is a structure having a Poisson's ratio of approximately zero or less than 0.15.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bonding layer <b>116</b> is an intermediate adhesive layer located between the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> and the auxetic layer <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the bonding layer <b>116</b> includes a heat-activated adhesive applied to a film, material, fabric, textile, or cloth. The bonding layer <b>116</b> may include any suitable type of adhesive. The bonding layer <b>116</b> includes adhesive on both an upper side and a lower side and, accordingly, is a dual-sided adhesive layer (i.e. double-sided tape). The lower side of the bonding layer <b>116</b> is bonded to the auxetic layer <b>112</b>, and the upper side of the bonding layer <b>116</b> is bonded to the outer fabric layer <b>120</b>, such that the bonding layer <b>116</b> glues the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> to the auxetic layer <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the bonding layer <b>116</b> includes a thin polymer film formed from polypropylene and/or polyurethane. Exemplary materials produced by Bemis Associates Inc., which are suitable for use as the bonding layer <b>116</b> include Bemis&#xae; Flowfree&#x2122; and Bemis&#xae; High Recovery. The bonding layer <b>116</b> has a high recovery of from 95% to 100%. The bonding layer <b>116</b> is also referred to as Bemis&#xae; tape and Bemis&#xae; film.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the bonding layer <b>116</b> includes a plurality of openings <b>160</b> formed therein, which configures the bonding layer <b>116</b> as an auxetic, which is also referred to as an auxetic material. The bonding layer <b>116</b> including the openings <b>160</b> is configured to exhibit an auxetic response in two dimensions. In one embodiment, the openings <b>160</b> are laser cut into the bonding layer <b>116</b>. The pattern of openings <b>160</b> drive the expansion and/or stretch of the bonding layer <b>116</b> and also effectively change the Poisson's ratio of the bonding layer <b>116</b> to a negative value. For example, the bonding layer <b>116</b> with the openings <b>160</b> is auxetic at least in response to tensile forces along the axes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, which are parallel to a surface <b>164</b> of the bonding layer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For purposes of this disclosure, a material is an &#x201c;auxetic&#x201d; and/or exhibits &#x201c;auxetic properties&#x201d; or an &#x201c;auxetic response&#x201d; by reacting to an applied stress or force by deforming in a manner that results in a negative Poisson's Ratio.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The plurality of openings <b>160</b> are shaped and positioned to configure the bonding layer <b>116</b> as an auxetic bonding layer. The openings <b>160</b> are reentrant shapes, which include one or more internal angles <b>168</b> that are reflexive (i.e. possessing a value between 180&#xb0;-360&#xb0;. In the field of geometry, a reentrant shape may also be referred to as a &#x201c;concave&#x201d;, or &#x201c;non-convex&#x201d; polygon or shape, which is a shape having an interior angle <b>168</b> with a measure that is greater than 180&#xb0;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the bonding layer <b>116</b> includes an array of the openings <b>160</b>, which all have the same shape and the same rotational orientation.

The outer fabric layer <b>120</b> is formed, in one embodiment, from four-way stretch fabric or another suitable high recovery material, such as Lycra&#xae;, Spandex&#xae;, or other types of elastane fabric. The outer fabric layer <b>120</b>, in some embodiments, is also formed from compression fabric. Accordingly, the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> assists in the recovery of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> and the bonding layer <b>116</b> from a stretched configuration to a relaxed configuration. Moreover, the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> promotes a tight positioning of the auxetic panels <b>104</b> against the wearer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, when the auxetic panel <b>104</b> is stretched, the elasticity of the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> pulls portions of the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> into the openings <b>160</b> formed in the bonding layer <b>116</b>. As a result, the reentrant shape of the openings <b>160</b> is visible as depressions formed in the outer fabric layer <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, the article of apparel <b>100</b> having the auxetic panels <b>104</b> provides the wearer with comfortable impact protection. The article of apparel <b>100</b> is comfortable because the auxetic panels <b>104</b> conform closely to the contours of the wearer's body without wrinkling, creasing, or bunching. The conforming nature of the auxetic panels <b>104</b> is achieved by features of each layer thereof.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The auxetic panels <b>104</b> exhibit the auxetic response based on the wearer's movements and based on impacts exerted upon the auxetic panels <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, an unstretched (i.e. relaxed) auxetic panel <b>104</b> is shown, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, tensile forces are applied to the auxetic panel <b>104</b> along the axis <b>152</b>. In response to the tensile forces, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> becomes thicker along the axis <b>156</b> and wider along the axis <b>154</b>. The change in thickness and width occurs due to hinge-like structures within the foam of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>, which flex when stretched.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> exhibits an auxetic response to a compressive force along the axis <b>156</b>. The compressive force is perpendicular to the surface <b>164</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the bonding layer <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> forms to the contours of a joint region <b>136</b> of the wearer. The exemplary joint region <b>136</b> corresponds to the area of the wearer's knee <b>140</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the joint region <b>136</b> and the auxetic panel <b>104</b> are spaced apart from the floor <b>144</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the joint region <b>136</b> strikes or impacts the floor <b>144</b> and compresses the auxetic panel <b>104</b> between the floor <b>144</b> and the joint region <b>136</b> to apply the compressive force to the auxetic panel <b>104</b>. The compressive force causes an area of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> to contract along the axes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, such that a region of increased density <b>148</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) is temporarily formed at the area of impact. The region of increased density <b>148</b> absorbs and dissipates impact forces, thereby protecting the joint region <b>136</b> and providing impact resistance.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> behaves differently than a non-auxetic panel, which would tend to lengthen, to thin, and to decrease in density at the area of impact in response to the compressive forces along the axis <b>156</b>. By increasing in density at the area of impact, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> offers increased impact protection to the wearer, as compared to a non-auxetic pad.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The density of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is selected so that the auxetic layer <b>112</b> easily bends around the contours of the wearer's body. The auxetic response of the auxetic panels <b>104</b> also promotes the conforming and comfortable characteristics of the article of apparel <b>100</b>. For example, when the user tightly bends their leg, tensile forces cause the thickness of the auxetic panel <b>104</b> to increase, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. The increase in thickness results in fewer wrinkles and creases in the auxetic panel <b>104</b> and increases the comfort for the wearer. The increase in thickness also provides the article of apparel <b>100</b> with a smooth and wrinkle free appearance for most or all positions of the wearer, and for many different sizes of wearers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The bonding layer <b>116</b> increases the comfort of the article of apparel <b>100</b> by exhibiting an auxetic response that, in one embodiment, is complementary to the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>. For example, the increase in thickness and width exhibited by the auxetic layer <b>112</b> in response to tensile forces along the axis <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), is uninhibited by the bonding layer <b>116</b> having the openings <b>160</b>, which also exhibits an auxetic response to the tensile forces. In one embodiment, the bonding layer <b>116</b> and the auxetic layer <b>112</b> change size approximately to the same degree in response to tensile forces. In this way, the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> is fully achieved and is not diminished or dampened by the bonding layer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bonding layer <b>116</b> with the openings <b>160</b> is also complementary to the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b> when subject to the compressive forces. Specifically, the bonding layer <b>116</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> &#x201c;shrink&#x201d; or fold in on each other so as not to diminish or dampen the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>. To this end, in response to an impact, the outer fabric layer <b>120</b> may be drawn inside of the openings <b>160</b> slightly, and the openings <b>160</b> move toward a closed position to enable formation of the area of increased density <b>148</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The auxetic layer <b>112</b> is auxetic in three dimensions, and the bonding layer <b>116</b> is auxetic in only two dimensions. Specifically, the bonding layer <b>116</b> exhibits an auxetic response only in a plane defined by the two axes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, which is parallel to the surface <b>164</b> of the bonding layer <b>116</b>. The bonding layer <b>116</b> does not become thicker along the axis <b>156</b> in response to tensile forces along the axes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. Moreover, if the bonding layer <b>116</b> were isolated and subject to compressive forces along the axis <b>156</b>, the bonding layer <b>116</b> would not exhibit an auxetic response. Thus, in an embodiment, the bonding layer <b>116</b> is not auxetic in a third dimension perpendicular to the surface <b>164</b> of the bonding layer <b>116</b>. The bonding layer <b>116</b> is only auxetic in two dimensions, because the film-like bonding layer <b>116</b> has substantially no thickness in the third dimension along the axis <b>156</b>. The auxetic layer <b>112</b>, however, has a sizable thickness in three dimensions and, therefore, is auxetic in all three dimensions. In particular, when stretched by the tensile forces along the axis <b>152</b>, the auxetic layer <b>112</b> exhibits an auxetic response along the axes <b>154</b> and <b>156</b>. The auxetic layer <b>112</b> and the bonding layer <b>116</b> are both auxetic in the two dimensions defining the surface <b>164</b> of the bonding layer <b>116</b>, and the auxetic layer <b>116</b> is auxetic in an additional dimension that is perpendicular to the surface <b>164</b> of the bonding layer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, two types of auxetic panels <b>104</b> are subject to an impact test and the results are compared to a silicone slab substrate and a hexfoam layer. In the test, baseline curve <b>184</b> corresponds to a baseline machine calibration in which an 8.5 kg free weight (not shown) is dropped onto a slab of silicone rubber (not shown and also referred to herein as a silicone slab substrate). The measured displacement is the compressive movement of the silicone rubber in response to the impact from the free weight. The comparatively dense silicone rubber exhibits little displacement (i.e. less than 2 mm) and absorbs almost 1200N of force. The silicone rubber establishes the baseline curve <b>184</b> or reference curve against which three foam products are compared.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The curve <b>188</b> corresponds to a test of a first auxetic panel <b>104</b>, as disclosed herein, having a first auxetic layer <b>112</b> with a first density. During the test, the auxetic panel <b>104</b> is positioned on the silicone slab and the free weight is dropped onto the auxetic panel <b>104</b>, such that the auxetic panel <b>104</b> is compressed between the free weight and the silicone slab. The displacement of the curve <b>188</b> is a measure of how much the auxetic panel <b>104</b> was compressed by the free weight along the axis <b>156</b>. According to the curve <b>188</b>, the first auxetic panel <b>104</b> absorbed about 950N of force and was displaced by almost 4 mm.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The curve <b>192</b> corresponds to a second auxetic panel <b>104</b>, as disclosed herein, having a second auxetic layer <b>112</b> with a second density. For example, the second density of the second auxetic panel may be less than the first density of the first auxetic panel <b>104</b>. The second auxetic panel <b>104</b> was subject to the same test. According to the curve <b>192</b>, the second auxetic panel <b>104</b> absorbed about 1000N of force and was displaced by almost 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The curve <b>196</b> corresponds to a test of a non-auxetic pad (not shown) so as to determine quantitative benefits for impact protection provided by the auxetic panels <b>104</b>. The non-auxetic pad includes a hexfoam layer (not shown) that is non-auxetic. There are no auxetic components included in the non-auxetic pad, and the non-auxetic pad does not include the bonding layer <b>116</b> having the openings <b>160</b>. The hexfoam is provided as one of the foams manufactured D30&#xae;. The non-auxetic pad was subject to the same test as the two auxetic panels described above. According to the curve <b>196</b>, the non-auxetic pad absorbed about 650N of force and was displaced by slightly over 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first and second auxetic panels <b>104</b> provide better impact protection than the non-auxetic pad without excessive displacement. Specifically, the auxetic panels <b>104</b> absorbed 300N and 350N more, respectively, than was absorbed by the non-auxetic pad. The first and second auxetic panels <b>104</b>, therefore, performed better as an impact absorbing layer by absorbing more force than the non-auxetic pad.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the first and second auxetic panels <b>104</b> exhibited more displacement than the silicone slab, but less displacement than the non-auxetic pad. During experimentation, it was discovered that the silicon slab is too heavy and does not offer enough displacement to comfortably cushion impacts. Moreover, the silicon slab does not sufficiently conform to the body, such as around joint region <b>136</b> and joints, such as knees <b>140</b>, elbows, hips, and other highly curved body regions. Further, during experimentation, it was discovered that the non-auxetic pad with the D30&#xae; foam exhibited too much displacement and transferred too much force to the body. The non-auxetic pad was too squishy and not dense enough to stay properly in position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The auxetic panels <b>104</b> of the curves <b>188</b> and <b>192</b> provide a desirable level of impact protection, are lightweight, and conform to the body very well. Thus, the auxetic panels <b>104</b> provide an optimized level of impact protection, while also being comfortable, and lightweight.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the embodiments described above, the auxetic panels <b>104</b> are positioned on an outside surface of the base fabric layer <b>108</b> that forms the article of apparel <b>100</b>.

The auxetic panel <b>104</b>&#x2032; includes a portion <b>208</b>&#x2032; and three tuned portions <b>212</b>&#x2032;, <b>216</b>&#x2032;, <b>220</b>&#x2032;, which exhibit a different auxetic response than the portion <b>208</b>&#x2032;. In general, the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; are formed in areas in which an auxetic response is desired, and the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; are not formed in areas in which the auxetic response is not desired or should be diminished. The portion <b>212</b>&#x2032; has smaller openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; and an increase in the concentration or density of the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; (i.e. more openings per unit area). As such, the portion <b>212</b>&#x2032; tends to result in the enhancement of the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>&#x2032;, and the portion <b>212</b>&#x2032; may exhibit a greater auxetic response than the portion <b>208</b>&#x2032;, in response to the same force. The portion <b>216</b>&#x2032; has a decrease in density and size of the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; and tends to attenuate the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>&#x2032;. The portion <b>220</b>&#x2032; with none of the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; further reduces the auxetic response. Decreasing or eliminating the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032; attenuates, dampens, and/or diminishes the auxetic response because without the openings <b>160</b>&#x2032;, the bonding layer <b>116</b>&#x2032; resists the auxetic response of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>&#x2032; and prevents the auxetic movement of the auxetic layer <b>112</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an example, the configuration of the auxetic panel <b>104</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> positions the portion <b>208</b>&#x2032; over the wearer's knee where impacts are expected, and positions the portions <b>212</b>&#x2032;, <b>216</b>&#x2032;, and <b>220</b>&#x2032; near the wearer's lower thigh where, in this example, impacts are less expected.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same should be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character.
