The wellhead structure supports various casing strings that extend into the well. One or more casing hangers are typically landed in the high-pressure wellhead housing, with each casing hanger being located at the upper end of a string of casing that extends into the well. A tubing hanger is also typically landed in the wellhead or a tubing head. A string of production tubing is supported by the tubing hanger. The production tubing extends through the production casing and provides a path for conveying production fluids from the formation to the wellhead. The area between the production tubing and the production casing is referred to as the annulus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An oil/gas well also typically includes a production tree (also referred to as a Christmas tree) that is mounted on the high-pressure housing. The production tree includes a main production bore. Production bore stabs are commonly positioned between the main production bore of a production tree and the production bore of the tubing hanger so as to provide a flow passageway between those two production bores. This arrangement permits the production bore of the production tree and the production bore of the tubing hanger to be fluidly isolated from other bores and passageways within the completion system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> depict various aspects of one illustrative example of a prior art two-piece production/annulus bore stab <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the prior art production/annulus bore stab <b>10</b> taken through the axial length of the production/annulus bore stab <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are transverse cross-sectional views of the production/annulus bore stab <b>10</b> taken where indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In other applications, such bores may be formed by other manufacturing processes, e.g., laser boring, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art after a complete reading of the present application, one illustrative example of a novel one-piece production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b> with integral fluid flow paths <b>103</b> formed entirely within the one-piece body <b>102</b> disclosed herein provides some distinct advantages relative to prior art production bore stabs and annulus bore stabs. One problem associated with the illustrative prior art production/annulus stab body <b>10</b> discussed in the background section of this application involved maintaining seal integrity under operational conditions. That is, each of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> and the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b> are essentially two separate pressure vessels that may experience different thermal loads (e.g., different temperatures) when in service. Such different thermal loads may cause the inner production stab body <b>11</b> and the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b> to exhibit different amounts of radial and/or axial expansion under certain operating conditions. In turn, such differences in radial and/or axial expansion between the inner production stab <b>11</b> and the outer annulus stab <b>12</b> can cause problems with respect to maintaining the integrity of the seals, e.g., the primary metal seal <b>19</b> and/or the secondary metal seal <b>17</b>, on the prior art production/annulus stab <b>10</b>. The novel one-piece production annulus stab <b>100</b> may help to eliminate or at least reduce this problem due to its one-piece construction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another problem with the prior art production/annulus stab <b>10</b> was related to the required radial thickness of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> and/or the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b>. That is, each of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> and the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b> are essentially two separate pressure vessels that must be designed for the unique loading conditions experienced by each of these separate pressure vessels during operation. More specifically, since there were no lateral seals between the fluid flow paths <b>27</b>, the exterior surface of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> was subjected to an external pressure which tended to compress the inner production stab body <b>11</b>. The radial thickness of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> was increased to resist this external pressure. Additionally, due to the two-piece configuration of the prior art production/annulus bore stab <b>10</b>, the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b> was subjected to an internal pressure (the annulus pressure) at its inner surface due to the presence of the fluid flow paths <b>27</b>. Thus, the radial thickness of this outer annulus stab body <b>12</b> had to be sufficient to accommodate this additional pressure loading. In contrast, the novel one-piece production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b> disclosed herein is essentially a single pressure vessel. Of course, that single pressure vessel will also have to be designed and sized for all loading conditions, e.g., internal and external pressures. However, due to the unique one-piece configuration of the production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b> disclosed herein, as well as the placement of the individual fluid flow paths <b>103</b> within the body <b>102</b>, the overall radial thickness of the body <b>102</b> will typically be less than the combined radial thicknesses of the inner production stab body <b>11</b> and the outer annulus stab body <b>12</b>. Other advantages of the various embodiments of the one-piece production bore stab <b>100</b> disclosed herein may be apparent to those skilled in the art after a complete reading of the present application.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref> depict various aspects of yet another embodiment of a production/annulus bore stab with integral flow paths disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is perspective view of this illustrative example of a production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b> disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional perspective view of the first end <b>104</b> of the production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional perspective view of the second end <b>106</b> of the production/annulus bore stab <b>100</b>.
