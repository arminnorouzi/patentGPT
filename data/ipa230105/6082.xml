STATEMENT</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The project leading to this application has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 727523.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of photovoltaic devices. More particularly, it relates to single-side-contacted solar cells.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Single-side-contacted solar cells are arranged such that the electrical interconnections between the individual photovoltaic junctions are entirely situated on one face of the cell, typically the back face thereof, since this side is intended to face away from the sun when in use and hence the electrical interconnections do not shade the photovoltaically-active regions of the device. Many back-contact PV cells use copper or silver busbars in electrical connection with electrically-conductive fingers made of screen-printed silver paste arranged to collect current from the hole-collecting and electron-collecting zones of the PV device. These busbars and fingers are printed in several steps over selectively-deposited insulation layers arranged so as to ensure that the busbars are only in contact with the correct fingers, and do not create shunts with the incorrect ones. This requires deposition of significant amounts of material, of which silver is particularly expensive, and is uneconomic for reasons of the material cost, and also results in a relatively long processing time involving a large number of steps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO2014/124675 presents a partial solution to this problem by using back-contacted solar cells with busbar-less grid design comprising interrupted fingers interconnected with wires. However, the manufacture of such cells is complex, notably due to the fact that the dielectric layer is provided over the whole surface of the cell and has to be penetrated by the material of the fingers in order to make electrical contact with the underlying photovoltaically active substrate. The choice of SiNx, SiOx or AlyOx for the dielectric layer requires a large number of fabrication steps.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aim of the present invention is thus to at least partially overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This aim is attained by a method of manufacturing a single-side-contacted photovoltaic device, as described in claim <b>1</b>. This method comprises the steps of:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a) providing a photovoltaically-active substrate comprising one or more layers and defining a plurality of alternating hole collecting zones (such as p-type semiconductor zones) and electron collecting zones (such as n-type semiconductor zones) arranged in adjacent parallel strips considered in the plane of the photovoltaically-active substrate so as to define photovoltaic junctions. This substrate can for instance be a monocrystalline silicon wafer which, depending on the photovoltaic technology being applied, may also comprise one or more further layers formed thereupon so as to define a silicon heterojunction cell which constitutes the substrate. Other PV technologies in which the hole collecting and electron collecting zones are arranged in the same manner are also possible;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">b) depositing a conductive layer, such as a layer of transparent conductive oxide (TCO), doped polycrystalline silicon, metal or similar, directly or indirectly on the surface of said zones. This conductive layer typically covers between 90% and 100% of said zones;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">c) depositing at least one conductive track extending along at least part of each of said zones, on top of the conductive layer, each zone hence having its own track or tracks situated thereupon;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">d) selectively forming a dielectric layer (i.e. an insulating layer) on each of said zones, so as to leave an exposed area free of dielectric at the join between adjacent zones;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">e) etching said conductive layer in said exposed areas so as to remove the material of this layer in these areas and hence prevent short circuits between adjacent zones. In this step, the dielectric, which may e.g. be a resist material (e.g. a photoresist, a thermally-curable polymer or similar), a self-assembled monolayer or other etch-resistant substance, acts as an etching mask so as to selectively etch the conductive layer and thereby to leave the underlying substrate exposed;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">f) applying a plurality of interconnecting conductors so as to electrically interconnect at least a portion of said hole collecting zones with each other, and to electrically interconnect at least a portion of said electron collecting zones with each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This method is particularly simple, and uses the dielectric layer in two roles, i.e. as an etch mask for etching the conductive layer, and also as part of the structure of the photovoltaic device. This reduces the number of processing steps to a minimum.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageously, each of said zones has a plurality of conductive tracks separated by gaps provided thereupon, with the gaps of each zone facing a track of the adjacent zone(s). Considered another way, each zone has an interrupted track upon it. This arrangement enables simple application of the interconnecting conductors without any risk that one makes an electrical contact with a track situated on the wrong zone, thereby causing a shunt. In essence, the interconnecting conductors for the hole collecting zones pass between the tracks of the electron collecting zones and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, each of said tracks can be continuous and in step d) the dielectric layer is formed with greater thickness or width so as to expose the tracks at locations where electrical connections between said tracks and said interconnecting conductors are not desired, and lesser thickness or width where electrical connections between said tracks and said interconnecting conductors are desired.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, each of said tracks can be shaped as a hollow lozenge, each zone having one or more such lozenge-shaped tracks situated thereupon. Since such forms of track have two potential contact points with the interconnects, this reduces the chance of not making a connection when the interconnects are applied. In such a case, it is also possible for each of said lozenge-shaped tracks to be filled with a solder material such as InSn, BiSnAg or similar subsequent to step c) but before step f).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Advantageously, said dielectric material is an organic material such as a thermoset resist, a photoresist, a polymer or a self-assembled monolayer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In all cases, said at least one conductive track may be fully embedded in said selectively-formed dielectric layer, particularly in the case with uninterrupted tracks, or may protrude therefrom.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously, subsequent to step e) but before step f), an optional insulating layer may be provided upon the areas of the substrate exposed by etching in step e), so as to eliminate all risk of electrical shunts caused by the conductors. Such a layer of insulator, which is distinct from the dielectric layer described above, guarantees that the interconnecting conductors cannot touch the substrate and thereby make undesired electrical contact therewith.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Advantageously, step d) comprises at least one of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">deposition of said dielectric layer with subsequent selective removal thereof, e.g. by photolithography, laser ablation or similar;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">selective deposition of said dielectric layer;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0023">selective deposition of lines of dielectric so as to delimit the boundaries of the dielectric layer, followed by selective deposition of said dielectric layer between said lines of said dielectric.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Advantageously, said tracks and/or said interconnecting conductors are provided with a layer of solder material thereupon, such as InSn, BiSnAg or similar. This improves the connection between the tracks and the interconnects.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Advantageously, step f) comprises an application of heat and pressure to the electrical interconnectors so as to embed them at least partially into said dielectric material. In the case in which the dielectric is a photoresist material, this softens and/or melts the material, bonding the interconnects to the tracks. Furthermore, if either or both of the interconnects and the tracks has a layer of solder material such as InSn, BiSnAg or similar provided thereupon, this can be melted in order to further improve the electrical connection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Advantageously, said selectively-formed dielectric remains in the finished photovoltaic device, keeping the number of processing steps down to a minimum. In the case in which the dielectric is itself transparent, the resulting photovoltaic device can be used in a bifacial PV module, so as to also be able to harvest reflected light impinging on its back side.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The invention furthermore relates to a single-side-contacted photovoltaic device comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">a photovoltaically-active substrate, such as a monocrystalline silicon wafer, defining a plurality of alternating hole collecting zones (such as p-type semiconductor zones) and electron collecting zones (such as n-type semiconductor zones) arranged in parallel strips considered in the plane of the layer;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">a conductive layer such as a layer of transparent conductive oxide (TCO), doped microcrystalline silicon, metal or similar, situated directly or indirectly upon said zones and patterned such that the junctions between adjacent zones are free of transparent conductive oxide so as to prevent short circuits between zones of different types;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0030">at least one conductive track extending along at least part of each of said zones;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0031">a dielectric (i.e. insulating) layer situated on said conductive layer;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0032">a plurality of interconnecting conductors arranged so as to electrically interconnect at least a portion of said hole collecting zones with each other, and to electrically interconnect at least a portion of said electron collecting zones with each other.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">This device is simple, and can be manufactured in a minimum number of steps by the method described above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">Advantageously, said dielectric material is an organic material such as a photoresist or a self-assembled monolayer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">Advantageously, an insulating layer may be situated upon at least part of the substrate exposed by etching, i.e. at the interfaces between the zones, to eliminate all risk of the interconnecting conductors making undesired electrical contact with the substrate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0036">Further details of the invention will appear more clearly upon reading the following description in reference with the annexed figures, which illustrate:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: a schematic plan view of a photovoltaic device according to a first embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: a schematic partial sectional view along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: a schematic partial sectional view along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>: schematic partial sectional views of a method according to the invention, along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>: a schematic plan view of a photovoltaic device according to a further embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>: a schematic partial sectional view along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>: a schematic plan view of a photovoltaic device according to a further embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>: a schematic partial sectional view along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>: a schematic plan view of a photovoltaic device according to a further embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>: a schematic partial sectional view along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>: a schematic plan view of a photovoltaic device according to a further embodiment of the invention;

The areas free of conductive layer <b>5</b> are typically centred on the interface between the zones <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, although can be arranged asymmetrically with respect thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0054">Upon each conductive layer <b>5</b> is a patterned dielectric (i.e. insulating) layer <b>7</b> (e.g. having a conductivity of less than 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/m) in which at least one electrically-conductive track <b>9</b> is at least partially embedded, extending along at least part of each zone <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>. As illustrated, these tracks <b>9</b> are interrupted such that a mid-point of each track <b>9</b> in any given zone <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>faces a midpoint of the gap between tracks <b>9</b> in the adjacent zone <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The tracks <b>9</b> may be fully embedded in the dielectric layer <b>7</b>, or may protrude therefrom. The tracks typically have a width between 1 &#x3bc;m and 300 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 20 &#x3bc;m and 100 &#x3bc;m, and a thickness of between 1 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 3 &#x3bc;m and 20 &#x3bc;m. Although the sections of track <b>9</b> have been illustrated with single lines, each zone <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>may comprise a plurality of parallel tracks, the number of which can vary depending on the sheet resistance of the conductive layer <b>5</b> and of the underlying substrate <b>3</b>, and can comprise between 1 and 10, preferably between 1 and 4 parallel tracks.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0055">The electrically-conductive tracks <b>9</b> may be e.g. formed from silver paste, copper plating, gold plating, conductive ink or any other convenient electrically-conducting material as is generally known. Silver paste is the best option amongst these and can be printed on the conductive layer <b>5</b> e.g. by screen printing, but the others are not to be construed as being excluded. In the case in which the tracks <b>9</b> are fully embedded in the dielectric layer <b>7</b>, materials which are not stable to the etchant in question can be used safely, since they are protected therefrom by the dielectric <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">The dielectric layer <b>7</b> in question is typically an organic substance and can, for instance, be a photoresist, a self-assembled monolayer or any other convenient selectively-removable or selectively-depositable layer, for reasons that will become apparent in the discussion of the method of the invention below. In the case of a resist material, typical thickness is between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 40 &#x3bc;m, further preferably between 1 &#x3bc;m and 15 &#x3bc;m. Such a resist typically is an organic layer formed of a compound having a carbon chain at least three carbons long, which may be hardened by heat, UV light or similar. In the case in which the tracks <b>9</b> are fully embedded in a resist material <b>7</b>, the thickness of this latter over the top of the tracks should be between 0.05 &#x3bc;m and 40 &#x3bc;m. The layer <b>7</b> may be a photoresist patterned by well-known lithographic techniques, a thermoset resist that is deposited by screen printing or CNC-controlled printing, a hotmelt polymer deposited by CNC-controlled printing, may be deposited via a vacuum process such as physical vapour deposition or chemical vapour deposition (depending on the material), or similar. Furthermore, dielectric material <b>7</b> is ideally transparent to visible and infrared light, which is particularly advantageous in bifacial applications.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">A plurality of interconnecting conductors, i.e. interconnectors, <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, extending substantially perpendicular to the tracks <b>9</b>, interconnect each set of zones <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>respectively, and transport current. To this end, the interconnectors <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>are in electrical contact with the corresponding tracks <b>9</b>, for instance by being soldered thereto with low-temperature solder, or simply by being glued thereto by the dielectric <b>7</b> in the case in which it is a resin such as a resist material. A particularly suitable technology for the interconnects are copper wires coated with a thin low melting point alloy layer supported by a polymer foil, as described in the publication &#x201c;SMARTWIRE SOLAR CELL INTERCONNECTION TECHNOLOGY&#x201d;, Faes et al, Proc. 29<sup>th </sup>Eur. Photovoltaic Sol. Energy Conf., January 2014. However, conventional wires or ribbons connected to the tracks <b>9</b> by solder, conductive ink, silver paste, conductive organic coating (like PEDOT-PSS for example), mechanical contacts or similar are also possible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">An optional insulating layer <b>15</b> (e.g. having a conductivity of less than 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/m) may be provided at least in the gaps between each stack of conductive layer <b>5</b> and dielectric layer <b>7</b>, i.e. at the interfaces between the zones <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>. This insulating layer <b>15</b> hence covers the areas of the substrate <b>3</b> not covered by dielectric layer <b>7</b> and eliminates the risk that the interconnecting conductors <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>may come into electrical contact with the surface of the substrate <b>3</b> and cause electrical shunts. The insulating layer <b>15</b>, which is distinct from the dielectric layer <b>7</b> and is deposited in a separate (optional) step (see below), may extend to the same height above the substrate <b>5</b> as the dielectric layer <b>7</b>, or may have a thickness such that its upper surface is situated above or below that of the dielectric layer <b>7</b>. In terms of materials for the insulating layer <b>15</b>, this may be of the same material or a different material as the dielectric layer <b>7</b> (see the materials listed in respect of this latter, which are also suited for the insulating layer <b>15</b>), and may likewise be formed by the processes listed in respect of this latter.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">Alternatively, the insulating layer <b>5</b> may be deposited over the entire surface of the cell.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">The complete cell <b>1</b> is furthermore encapsulated (not illustrated), as is generally known, for instance by being laminated into a sandwich structure with a suitable transparent polymer encapsulant, suitable front sheet and suitable back sheet.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>represent schematically a method according to the invention, for manufacturing the cell <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, in cross section along the line B-B.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the photoactive layer <b>3</b> is first provided, as discussed previously.

In the case in which the tracks <b>9</b> are made from silver paste, this can simply be printed, for instance by means of screen printing, CNC-controlled printing, or other convenient type of printing. In the case of copper, this can be deposited over the whole surface and selectively etched as is generally known.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0064">A dielectric layer is then provided on the surface of the conductive layer <b>5</b> and on the tracks <b>9</b>, which may be fully embedded therein (as illustrated) or may protrude from the free surface thereof, which permits easy electrical testing of the cell <b>1</b> prior to applying the interconnects <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>. This dielectric is an organic compound, and can e.g. be a photoresist, a self-assembled monolayer, or similar. In the case of a self-assembled monolayer, this can be e.g. 12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,15,15-Nonafluoropentadecylphosphonic acid, 12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,16,16,17,17-Tridecafluoroseptadecylphosphonic acid, 12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,16,16,17,17,18,18,19,19,19-Heptadecafluorononadecylphosphonic acid, 10-((3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10-Heptadecafluorodecyloxy)carbonyl)decylphosphonic acid, 5,7,7-Trimethyl-2-(4,4-dimethylpentan-2-yl)octylphosphonic acid, Diethyl-12-pentafluorophenoxydodecylphosphonate, octadecylphosphonic acid, decylphosphonic acid, dodecylphosphonic acid, octylphosphonic acid, 10,11-Bis(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,9-Heptadecafluorononyl)icosane-1,20-diyldiphosphonic acid or any other convenient SAM.

In the case of a photoresist, this can be a positive or a negative resist, either the exposed or unexposed portions of the layer being subsequently removed with solvent depending on the type of resist used. Alternatively, in a non-illustrated embodiment, the dielectric layer <b>7</b> may be deposited in a patterned fashion e.g. by printing, hence avoiding the steps of selective removal. As a result, the areas immediately adjacent to the joins between the zones <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>are devoid of dielectric <b>7</b> and are hence exposed to attack from an etching agent.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0066">The patterned dielectric layer <b>7</b> is then used as a mask for etching the underlying conductive layer <b>5</b>, so as to create discrete contacts with the underlying zones <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, without shunts between them, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>. This etching can be carried out e.g. by means of a dilute acid, after which the workpiece is rinsed. If insulating layer <b>15</b> is present, it is subsequently deposited e.g. by screen printing, CNC-controlled printing or similar, as schematically indicated by the arrow. If deposited over the whole surface rather than selectively in the gaps between areas of dielectric layer <b>7</b>, other deposition processes such as vacuum processes (i.e. PVD, CVD in function of the material) are possible.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0067">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>, the interconnects <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>are applied either as wires or ribbons supported by a machine, or as a &#x201c;smartwire&#x201d;-type assembly as discussed above. During this step, heat and pressure may be applied, which will cause the interconnects <b>11</b><i>a </i>to bond to the corresponding tracks <b>9</b>. If the interconnects <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>are coated in a low-temperature solder material as described in the referenced publication (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), this melts and solders the tracks <b>9</b> and interconnects <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>together at the points of contact.
