The technology can minimize the usage of the grinding fluid (which is about a thousandth of the usage of a traditional pouring type lubrication mode) on the premise of ensuring effective lubrication and cooling effect, thereby reducing production cost, environmental pollution and damage to human bodies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nano-jet MQL is established based on the theory of heat transfer enhancement. The theory of heat transfer enhancement shows that the heat transfer capacity of solid is much higher than that of liquid and gas. A thermal conductivity coefficient of solid materials is several orders of magnitude higher than that of fluid materials at room temperature. Solid particles can be added into an MQL medium to significantly increase the thermal conductivity coefficient of a fluid medium, improve the convective heat transfer capacity, and greatly make up for a defect of insufficient cooling capacity of MQL. In addition, nanoparticles also have special tribological characteristics in lubrication and tribology, such as wear resistance and friction reduction as well as high bearing capacity. Nano-jet MQL means that nano-solid particles are added into the MQL fluid medium to prepare a nanofluid, i.e., nanoparticles, a lubricant (oil or an oil-water mixture) and a high-pressure gas are mixed and atomized and then sprayed into the grinding region in the form of jet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Droplets produced by a nanofluid minimal quantity lubrication (NMQL) technology enter the grinding region under the carrying action of high-pressure gas to play the roles of cooling and lubrication. However, movement paths of the droplets are uncontrollable, and problems of droplet diffusion, drift and the like exist. Droplets drift into the working environment, thereby not only polluting the environment, but also threatening health of operators and reducing an effective utilization rate of the grinding fluid at the same time, and causing waste of resources. Nowadays, influences of lubrication liquid and cooling fluid on the health of operators when machining with MQL are attracting much attention. For example, operators will suffer from various respiratory diseases, comprising occupational asthma, allergic pneumonia, loss of lung function, and skin diseases such as allergy, oil acne and skin cancer. To solve the realistic problem, researchers proposed electrostatic atomization MQL through a lot of exploration work, and hoped to realize controllable transportation of atomized droplets and further improve an atomization effect through the action of electric field force.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The patent having an application number of 201310042095.9 discloses a nanofluid electrostatic atomization controllable jet MQL grinding system. In the solution, a corona charging technology is adopted to charge the MQL liquid at a nozzle outlet; the droplets will be further broken up under the action of a high-voltage electric field; and small droplets formed by breakup will be controllably conveyed to the grinding region along a direction of an electric field line, thereby effectively cooling and lubricating the grinding region. The patent having an application number of 201310050221.5 discloses a cutting fluid aerosol MQL method. In the solution, a corona discharging principle is also adopted to break up and transport the lubrication liquid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors found that there are few technologies for lubrication with electrostatic atomization in the field of machining in currently published literatures and the technologies are not yet mature. At present, a mode of corona discharge (discharge at a tip of an electrode needle) is mostly used for charge transportation of lubrication oil. However, corona discharge has problems of small corona region and poor chargeability, which causes waste of energy while increasing use voltage. Contact charge (direct contact of a high-voltage power supply with a nozzle) can effectively increase the charge quantity of the lubrication liquid, but has a risk of electricity leakage. At present, MQL equipment suitable for contract charge does not appear on the market. In fact, the MQL liquid at the nozzle outlet is stretched into a series of small liquid columns under the action of external forces such as the compressed air and the electric field force and then is broken up into droplets when the contact charge is used. The liquid columns have extremely uneven diameters in such a process, so that the particle size distribution of the subsequently formed small droplets is relatively dispersed, which is not conducive to the controllability of droplet size. Meanwhile, the small liquid columns at the nozzle outlet severely fluctuate under the action of turbulent flow formed by the compressed air, which is very unfavorable to the control of subsequent conveying routes of the droplets.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Besides the above problems, the inventors also found that noise will be made when the compressed air is sprayed out from the nozzle due to relatively high pressure of the compressed air, and the noise will affect hearing heath of the operators. In addition, it was found in the grinding system using MQL that a pipeline for conveying nanofluids was often blocked due to strong adsorption performance of nanoparticles, which greatly affects use performance of the grinding system and is also a problem urgent to be solved in the electrostatic atomization MQL system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a micro-texture electrostatic nozzle, wherein a series of micro-bulges are arranged on an inner side surface of an acceleration chamber to greatly improve oleophilic performance of the inner surface of the acceleration chamber.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The technical solution of the micro-texture electrostatic nozzle in the first aspect of the present disclosure is as follows:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The micro-texture electrostatic nozzle comprises a nozzle core, wherein an upper nozzle body is connected above the nozzle core;

The nozzle has relatively high requirements for velocity distribution and turbulence intensity of jet. The design of the nozzle requires that the jet velocity is relatively uniform, a velocity gradient is not easy to be too large, the turbulence intensity of the jet is low, the jet is not easy to have relatively large fluctuations, the concentration distribution of droplets at a nozzle outlet is uniform, and a concentration gradient of the jet is not easy to be too large. According to research experience of relevant workers, under the same inlet and outlet conditions, in velocity distribution, the velocity distribution at an outlet of the cylindrical nozzle is the most uneven, the central velocity distribution is greatly different from the boundary velocity distribution, the velocity distribution at the outlet of the conical column diverging nozzle is the most uniform, and the velocity distribution of the conical column diverging nozzle is stronger than that of the conical nozzle. In turbulence intensity, the turbulence intensity of the conical column diverging nozzle is the largest, and the turbulence intensity of the conical column diverging nozzle is between the cylindrical nozzle and the conical nozzle. In concentration distribution of the droplets at the nozzle outlet, the concentration distribution of the droplets at the outlet of the conical nozzle is the most uniform.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In conclusion, the conical column-shaped nozzle has a relatively uniform velocity distribution at the outlet, a relatively small turbulence intensity distribution at the outlet and the most uniform concentration distribution of the droplets at the outlet. Therefore, the conical column-shaped nozzle, i.e., such a nozzle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, is adopted in the present embodiment according to requirements on jet characteristics.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a micro-texture electrostatic nozzle according to the present embodiment comprises an upper nozzle body <b>42</b>, a lower nozzle body <b>43</b>, an insulation sealing ring <b>44</b>, a nozzle core <b>45</b>, an annular check ring <b>46</b>, an MQL liquid conveying pipe interface <b>47</b>, an air storage chamber <b>48</b>, spiral air holes <b>49</b>, a gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>, an acceleration chamber <b>51</b>, a nozzle outlet <b>52</b>, a high-voltage wire interface <b>53</b>, a high-voltage wire outlet through hole <b>54</b>, a check ring placement groove <b>55</b>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b> and micro-bulges <b>57</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The upper nozzle body <b>42</b> is connected above the nozzle core through threads; the lower nozzle body <b>43</b> is connected below the nozzle core <b>45</b> through threads; and the insulation sealing ring <b>44</b> is arranged between the upper nozzle body <b>42</b> and the lower nozzle body <b>43</b> and can effectively prevent gas in the nozzle from leaking. The upper nozzle body <b>42</b> and the lower nozzle body <b>43</b> are made of insulation materials; and the nozzle core <b>45</b> is made of a metal conductive material. The MQL liquid conveying pipe interface <b>47</b> is arranged above the upper nozzle body <b>42</b> and can be connected with an insulation coil pipe <b>37</b> through threads; therefore, compressed air flowing through the insulation coil pipe <b>37</b> can enter the electrostatic nozzle. The air storage chamber <b>48</b> is arranged in the nozzle core <b>45</b>, plays the roles of storing the compressed air and reducing pressure, and plays the same role as a free space formed between the upper nozzle body <b>42</b> and the nozzle core <b>45</b>. The gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>, the acceleration chamber <b>51</b> and the nozzle outlet <b>52</b> are sequentially arranged inside the nozzle core <b>45</b> from top to bottom. A contraction angle &#x3b1; of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b> is between 5&#xb0; and 20&#xb0;; the nozzle outlet has a diameter of B and a length of L; a value of L/B is between 2 and 6; and &#x3b1; is 13&#xb0;, B is 1 mm, and L/B is 4 in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The check ring placement groove <b>55</b> is arranged above the nozzle core <b>45</b>; and the annular check ring <b>46</b> is fixedly bonded in a groove of the check ring placement groove <b>55</b>. The annular check ring <b>46</b> is an insulation annular rubber ring with elasticity; 4-10 V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b> are distributed on the annular check ring <b>46</b> in a form of arrays; and 8 sheets are taken for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b> are pasted around the annular check ring <b>46</b> by one circle to cover an annular central hole; the insulation oil pipe <b>38</b> penetrates through centers of a plurality of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b> and enters the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>; the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b> have special properties, can perform strong reversible contraction similar to muscle under the action of an external electric field, and can tightly wrap the insulation oil pipe <b>38</b> to avoid the backflow of airflow and lubrication liquid caused by the airflow in the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>. The annular check ring <b>46</b> has certain elasticity, and has the amount of elastic deformation capable of counteracting the amount of contraction of the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>nanofiber sheets <b>56</b>. The spiral air holes <b>49</b> are formed in the nozzle core <b>45</b> and are distributed along an outer wall of the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> in the form of arrays. An inlet axis is tangent to a wall surface of an inner cavity of the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>. The compressed air flows through the spiral air holes <b>49</b> and enters the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> at a tangential velocity v. The compressed air enters the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> through a plurality of spiral air holes <b>49</b> at the same time, and a speed direction of the compressed air does not intersect with an axial center. As a result, the incoming airflow has a moment of momentum to the axial center, which prompts the airflow to rotate about the axial center in the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> and simultaneously propels the airflow toward the direction of the nozzle outlet, thereby driving the nanofluid to rotate to form vortex. The vortex is formed so that the MQL liquid is fully mixed with the compressed air and turbulent flow is also formed at the same time. The acceleration chamber <b>51</b> and the nozzle outlet <b>52</b> are mainly used for acceleration of jet and spreading of the lubrication liquid in the nozzle. The lubrication liquid is usually pulled into a liquid film or a liquid line in the nozzle and at the outlet, and finally is broken up into droplets under the action of external forces such as aerodynamic force and electrostatic force. The high-voltage wire interface <b>53</b> is arranged on the nozzle core <b>45</b>; the high-voltage wire outlet through hole <b>54</b> is formed in the lower nozzle body <b>43</b>; and a DC high-voltage wire <b>8</b> can penetrate through the high-voltage wire outlet through hole <b>54</b> to be connected with the high-voltage wire interface <b>53</b> so as to supply power to the nozzle core <b>45</b>. A series of micro-bulges <b>57</b> are arranged on the inner wall of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b>. Specific shapes and positions of the micro-bulges <b>57</b> are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>-<b>6</b>, the micro-bulges <b>57</b> are uniformly distributed on the inner wall of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b>. The micro-bulges are hexagonal prisms in the present embodiment, and similarly, the micro-bulges <b>57</b> may be cylinders, cones or polygonal prisms. Various micro-bulges <b>57</b> have a horizontal center distance a of 5-50 &#x3bc;m, a vertical center distance b of 5-50 &#x3bc;m, a side length c of 2-7 &#x3bc;m, a height h of 3-30 &#x3bc;m and an area occupation ratio &#x3b7; (i.e., a ratio of a projected area of all the micro-bulges <b>57</b> to an area of the inner surface of the entire acceleration chamber <b>51</b>) of 20-80%.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, a is 15 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;3 &#x3bc;m, b is 15 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;3 &#x3bc;m, c is 4 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;0.5 &#x3bc;m, h is 10 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;1 &#x3bc;m, and &#x3b7; is 40%; and a square having the side length of L is taken from the inner surface of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b> as an analysis unit having the area of L<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that the active design of a roughness factor of the inner surface of the acceleration chamber of the nozzle can be realized by setting parameters of the micro-bulges.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The formation of the turbulent flow in traditional electrostatic nozzles is not conducive to the uniform spreading of the MQL liquid. The MQL liquid and the compressed air become extremely unstable under the mixing action of spiral airflow, and have uneven velocity distribution and relatively high turbulence intensity. The phenomena become particularly apparent after acceleration in the acceleration chamber, which eventually causes uneven size distribution of the droplets sprayed from the nozzle.

The micro-texture electrostatic nozzle according to the present embodiment is characterized in that a series of micro-bulges are arranged on the inner side surface of the acceleration chamber to greatly improve the oleophilic performance of the inner surface of the acceleration chamber; the inner surface of the acceleration chamber can effectively adsorb MQL liquid flowing out of the mixing chamber due to the oleophilic performance, thereby improving the movement resistance of the MQL liquid, forming the uniform oil film under the pulling effect of the compressed air, greatly reducing the disturbance of jet and improving the uniformity of the liquid lines of the liquid film, so that the finally formed droplets are distributed more uniformly and the movement paths of the droplets are more controllable.

Since the spiral air holes <b>49</b> are distributed along an outer wall of the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> in the form of arrays, an inlet axis is tangent to a wall surface of an inner cavity of the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b>; and the compressed air flows through the spiral air holes <b>49</b> and enters the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> at a tangential velocity v. The compressed air enters the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> through a plurality of spiral air holes <b>49</b> at the same time, and a speed direction of the compressed air does not intersect with an axial center. As a result, the incoming airflow has a moment of momentum to the axial center, which prompts the airflow to rotate about the axial center in the gas-liquid mixing chamber <b>50</b> and simultaneously propels the airflow toward the direction of the nozzle outlet, thereby driving the nanofluid to rotate to form vortex. The vortex is formed so that the MQL liquid is fully mixed with the compressed air and turbulent flow is also formed at the same time. The MQL liquid is fully mixed with the compressed air and then passes through two parts comprising the acceleration chamber <b>51</b> and the nozzle outlet <b>52</b>; in this process, the mixed flow is accelerated and spread; and the lubrication liquid is usually pulled into a liquid film or a liquid line in the nozzle and at the outlet, and finally is broken up into droplets under the action of external forces such as aerodynamic force and electrostatic force. The formation of the turbulent flow in traditional electrostatic nozzles is not conducive to the uniform spreading of the MQL liquid. The MQL liquid and the compressed air become extremely unstable under the mixing action of spiral airflow, and have uneven velocity distribution and relatively high turbulence intensity. The phenomena become particularly apparent after acceleration in the acceleration chamber <b>51</b>, which eventually causes uneven size distribution of the droplets sprayed from the nozzle. Relatively large fluctuation of the formed liquid line is also not conducive to the controllable transportation after forming droplets. In order to solve the problem, a series of micro-bulges <b>57</b> are arranged on the inner surface of the acceleration chamber, have shapes and distributions as described above, and are prepared into a charge nozzle containing a micro-texture in the solution.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Beneficial effects of the micro-texture charge nozzle can be analyzed by a Yong's equation and a Wenzel model. A contact angle of liquid on a solid surface is determined by mutual balance of surface tensions among solid, air and liquid interfaces; and a final balance state enables a total energy of the system to tend to be minimum, so that the liquid is generally in a steady state or metastable state on the solid surface.

Hexagonal prism micro-bulges used in the solution are uniformly distributed on the surface having a unit area of L<sup>2</sup>; the hexagonal prism micro-bulges have a side length of c, a height of h, and a distribution number of n able to be determined according to &#x3b7; and the actual area of the inner surface of the acceleration chamber; and the roughness factor r per unit area at this moment can be calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0114" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>r</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <msup>         <mi>L</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>+</mo>        <mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>n</mi>          <mo>&#xb7;</mo>          <mn>6</mn>         </mrow>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>ch</mi>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <msup>        <mi>L</mi>        <mn>2</mn>       </msup>      </mfrac>      <mo>.</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>6</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0115" num="0108">It can be seen from the equation (6) that the active design of roughness factor r can be realized by setting the number n, side length c and height h of the micro-bulges.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0109">The inner surface of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b> can effectively adsorb MQL liquid flowing out of the mixing chamber <b>50</b> due to the oleophilic performance, thereby improving the movement resistance of the MQL liquid, forming the uniform oil film under the pulling effect of the compressed air, greatly reducing the disturbance of jet and improving the uniformity of the liquid lines of the liquid film, so that the finally formed droplets are distributed more uniformly and the movement paths of the droplets are more controllable.

A specific atomization mechanism of the MQL liquid can be expressed as follows.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0111">Electrostatic atomization is a phenomenon that the electrostatic force overcomes the surface tension of liquid to break up the liquid into tiny mist droplets. The nozzle core <b>45</b> is in contact with the MQL liquid so that the surface of the liquid carries a lot of homo-charges, thereby improving activity of the surface of the liquid, making the surface molecules subject to significant directional arrangement and reducing the surface tension. The surface tension will gradually decrease with the increase of the charge quantity under a condition of constant liquid volume. When the surface tension is not large enough to bind the liquid, the liquid will be broken up into fine mist droplets under mutual repulsion between the homo-charges on the surface and disturbance of liquid surface caused by the external forces.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0112">When a high relative velocity exists between the droplets and the surrounding air, the splitting of the droplets is controlled by the aerodynamic pressure, the surface tension and the viscous force. For the liquid with relatively low viscosity, the breakup of the droplets is mainly determined by the aerodynamic pressure and the surface tension. The aerodynamic pressure on the liquid film, the liquid line and large droplets is 0.5&#x3c1;<sub>g </sub>&#x394;V<sup>2</sup>, wherein &#x3c1;<sub>g </sub>refers to the air density and &#x394;V refers to a gas-liquid relative velocity.

In addition, if the droplets reach a stable state in the airflow, after the droplets are charged with static electricity, the We number is increased; the surface tension of the liquid is decreased and is not enough to resist the aerodynamic pressure; and the droplets will be further deformed and broken up. Therefore, the particle size of the mist droplets after being charged with static electricity is smaller under the condition of same gas-liquid parameters.

The DC voltage stabilizing unit V<b>2</b> is a main energy source for power conversion; the high-frequency pulse booster is rectified by the voltage-doubling rectification circuit to obtain high-voltage static electricity; a base pulse signal is obtained by the self-excited oscillation circuit, and is boosted by the high-frequency pulse booster after being amplified by the power amplification circuit; and finally, a high-voltage signal is outputted and passes through the voltage-doubling rectification circuit to output a DC high voltage.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0124">The power supply is characterized by generating relatively high electrostatic high voltage and having small power supply current, which is generally not greater than 500 &#x3bc;A. The constant-current automatic control circuit automatically samples the electrostatic working current of the voltage-doubling rectification circuit, so that the working current will not rise under constant current when a working load is normally increased. When an external load exceeds an allowable current, the self-excited oscillation circuit stops oscillation to cut off the high voltage. This characteristic is reliable to the safety of operators due to once approaching or touching a high-voltage end, a weak shock current is caused and the high-voltage output is cut off at the same time to avoid danger of life.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 6</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0125">A controllable jet MQL grinding system in the present embodiment differs from the controllable jet MQL grinding system in the embodiment 5 in that: the electrostatic nozzles are different in structures.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0126">The controllable jet MQL grinding system according to the present embodiment comprises the two-stage composite micro-texture electrostatic nozzle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b></figref>(<i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0127">Specific working processes of the controllable jet MQL grinding system in the present embodiment are the same as those in the embodiment 5, except that:</p><p id="p-0141" num="0128">The inner surface of the traditional nozzle is relatively smooth and the value of r is relatively small; in the solution, a series of micro-bulges <b>57</b> are arranged on the inner side surface of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b>; the micro-bulges <b>57</b> are of a two-stage composite structure and are composed of first-stage micro-bulges <b>65</b> and second-stage micro-bulges <b>66</b>; compared with an individual micro-bulge structure, the composite micro-bulges will undoubtedly increase of the value of r and make r much greater than 1, thereby greatly improving oleophilic performance of the inner surface of the acceleration chamber <b>51</b>.
