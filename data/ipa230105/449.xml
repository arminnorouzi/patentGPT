Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Example embodiments relate to an imaging apparatus such as a computer tomographic (CT) system and a driving method thereof enabling high spatial, timing and energy resolution with smaller form factor and lower power consumption.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An imaging apparatus, for example, an X-ray computed tomographic (CT) system comprises a gantry including a rotating part that rotates around an imaging target, a bed on which a subject is placed so as to pass through the inside of the gantry in the direction of the central axis of the rotation, a moving bed supporting member, and a slip ring around the rotating part enabling an electrical connection with an operation and monitoring console which reconstructs the subject image using the image data transferred via the slip ring. Inside the rotating part, a detector composed of a group of a large number of image pickup elements, a circuit board for processing signals from the detector, an X-ray generating part at a position facing each other across an imaging object such as a subject, cooling fan, and a high-voltage power supply circuit are incorporated. A conventional CT system is a large, heavy, and expensive image diagnostic equipment. In addition to the costs of the building where the CT system is installed including the cost of a large power supply and air conditioning systems, also maintenance cost to keep the CT system with optimal performance and conditions at all times cause a heavy financial burden.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some example embodiments provide X-ray CT systems having reduced size and cost, which will contribute to the health maintenance of people all over the world. Particularly, it is desired to detect cancers and other diseases in their early stages and reduce the increasing medical expenses. Even in developing countries, other remote areas and depopulated areas, it is necessary to provide the latest and highest level of medical services to eliminate the medical disparities resulting from natural disasters and regional conflicts. Various unsolved technical problems, such as increased size and cost of a CT system, still remain and an effective breakthrough has not been found yet. One of the factors that hinder the downsizing of conventional CT system may be the difficulty to reduce the size and weight of the gantry. The inner diameter of the rotating part in the gantry is required to be an inner diameter dimension such that a human body can move and pass in the body axis direction with a margin, for example, an inner diameter of 80 cm or more. The outer diameter of the gantry usually exceeds 100 cm because the X-ray source and detector parts must be installed. Generally, a detector, a detector signal processing circuit, an X-ray source, an X-ray source drive control circuit, and cooling fan need to rotate inside the gantry. However, the X-ray source, the X-ray source drive control circuit, the air-cooling fan, for example, are heavy weight. Therefore, it should be necessary to suppress vibrations and noises associated with the rotation and to minimize adverse effects on the entire system caused by the inertial moment of the heavy components rotating at a speed of 1 to 2 revolutions per second on a circle with a diameter of 80 cm or more. Furthermore, in order to move the subject in the body axis direction, it is necessary to move the bed on which the subject is placed forward or backward at a predetermined speed. Considering the variety of subjects and their weight range like several kilograms to 200 kilograms, the bed moving means also needs to ensure robustness capable of covering such a weight range and stable movement of the bed. As a result, such a conventional CT system is prevented from being used on the bedside of a patient or during surgery. In addition, it is difficult to realize a small medical examination vehicle equipped with a CT system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The detector or the like rotates inside the gantry around the body axis direction at a speed of about 1 to 2 revolutions per second. In order to supply power or read out an output signal from a detector or the like, transmission and reception of a signal, or transmission or reception of power is performed by a mechanical contact means called a slip ring. For the electrical connection by the slip ring, it is necessary to keep the rotation speed low and to reduce the number of output signal lines from the detector. In order to reduce the number of signal lines, serialization of the parallel signal read through the slip ring is adopted. However, when a large amount of image data is serially transmitted, the transmission frequency rises, and then it becomes necessary to develop some custom semiconductor elements such as a high-speed line buffer element, for example. With increase in the transmission frequency, more power consumption and heat generation cannot be avoided. In recent years, the slice width is being widened so that the wide area can be exposed by one-time X-ray pulse irradiation. As a result, in addition to increasing the weight of the gantry, it also needs to increase the size of the X-ray generator. The light receiving area (or the number of slices) in the body axis direction is expanded, which increases the light receiving area of the detector used or the total number of pixels requiring further increases the speed and the capacity of data transmission and high-speed real-time recording. A data processing speed exceeding 1 gigabyte/second is required when the number of slices is 64, for example. In order to record a large amount of data in real time at high speed, it is necessary to use a plurality of hard disks such as RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) in combination. In addition to the realization of such high-speed, large-volume data processing, transmission and recording, it is also a problem to be solved by at least one example embodiment of the inventive concepts to reduce the radiation exposure dose of the subject.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electric power feeding to the X-ray source or the like may cause a problem. Increasing the slice width, the X-ray source increases in size and the amount of current supplied to the X-ray source drive circuit and a high-voltage generation circuit has tended to increase as an X-ray tube current increases. Therefore, the slip ring needs to flow a large amount of current by sliding the brush on the slip ring, which may cause heat generation and seizure on the contact surface. Therefore, maintenance such as surface polishing of the slip ring and brush electrode or regular replacement of these parts are required. For the CT system installation, new design specifications on the building, floor strength, air conditioning equipment and their dedicated power supply system may be reconsidered. The cost of introducing a CT system is not only the installation cost of the CT system itself, but also the cost required for the building including the air conditioning and power supply system, or regular maintenance cost of the temperature and humidity management around the system or the entire building throughout the year. In the case of use outdoor or at a remote location, a large-capacity and stable commercial power for the CT system should be provided, however it may be difficult for a private power generator or a battery to supply enough electric power to the CT system. Therefore, we may need to use sunlight or other natural energy fully or partially in addition to the significant reduction of the power consumption and the energy loss of the CT system. Problems in the CT system to be solved are the reduction of its size, weight, power consumption, and the periodic maintenance load as well as enabling the CT system to be used hybridlike for multiple purposes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An image pickup apparatus according to at least one example embodiment of the inventive concepts, for example, a CT system has a gantry having a rotating part that rotates about a body axis direction, a gantry table on which the gantry is placed, a control part for processing and displaying image data obtained from the gantry, and an operating part of the CT system.

Further, a detector drive and its output signal processing circuit, an image memory for recording the output signal of the detector, and a rechargeable battery for driving these components are incorporated inside the rotating part.

A CT system may have an energy recovery brake circuit in the rotating part, where an electromotive force in the induction coils, induced by the moment of inertia about the rotating part, may be converted into the electric energy and stored. Alternatively, a plurality of induction coils are arranged along the circumference of the fixed part inside the gantry surrounding the circumference of the rotating part, and the permanent magnets are arranged along the circumference of the rotating part so that the N poles and the S poles are alternately placed.

Then, the movement of the gantry in the direction of the central axis is stopped at a predetermined position, and the electric signal recorded in the image memory is read out from the rotating part interface through the host interface. A method of driving the CT system includes steps, the gantry starts to move in the central axis direction of the gantry, the light emitted from the light source is converted into an electric signal by the detector and recorded the electrical signal into the image memory while the rotating part is rotating.

Alternatively, the gantry of the CT system stops its movement in the direction of the central axis at a predetermined position, and then the rechargeable battery is supplied power charged from the host interface via the rotating part interface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As is discussed in greater detail below, a CT system equipped with a detector array having low noise and low power consumption can be realized using a CMOS type sensor in which a signal processing circuit is integrated on-chip or by laminating an element on the sensor. In addition, since an extremely sensitive detector can be used to reduce the amount of the radiation exposure to the subject. Further, the reduction in the size and weight of the CT system and the reduction in power consumption can significantly reduce the space for installing the CT system, the construction of the building and the power supply, the air conditioning equipment, and the maintenance cost. Further, the slip ring and the brush electrode for making an electrical connection with the slip ring are not necessary, which greatly reduces sparks and breakdowns to improve the reliability. In addition, the annual maintenance cost for maintaining the optimal system performance such as periodical parts replacement and maintenance can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the rotational moment of the rotating part after each imaging operation is converted into electric energy to be recovered, and the recovered electric energy can be reused for the rotational movement at the next imaging operation. As a result, it may reduce the size of the built-in rechargeable battery in the rotating part, shorten the charging time, or increase the number of times of photographing after charging. Moreover, since the components in the gantry, such as the X-ray source, the X-ray detector, and the rechargeable battery have a cartridge structure, the gantry itself does not need to be disassembled and repaired, and only the defective part is extracted, and a new part is installed instead. As a result, annual maintenance costs and equipment downtime to keep optimal performance of the CT system all the time may be greatly reduced. By replacing the gantry itself, the light source or the detector module according to the diagnostic purposes, it may not be necessary to install all kinds of image diagnostic apparatus like X-ray CT and PET (Positron Emission Tomography), for example, as for the orthopedic surgery, cardiology, and gastroenterology fields. According to at least one example embodiment of the inventive concepts, one hybrid CT system can be applied to various diagnoses in different medical fields. Even in an operating room or inpatient ward in a hospital, doctors can quickly and easily determine the initial diagnosis and treatment plan at the bedside without moving emergency or seriously injured patients who were carried in due to an accident. The CT system can be made smaller and lighter, and the power consumption or the load of repair and maintenance can be reduced. Therefore, the CT system can be moved by a vehicle and enables a quick and accurate initial diagnosis even in a remote place or in the area hit by a disaster, developing countries, other remote areas or depopulated areas by providing the latest and high-level medical services. As a result, the medical disparities due to natural disasters or regional conflicts, for example, can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By changing the gantry, the light source or the sensor cartridges, or adding the gantry for PET or the gantry using the near infrared light source in one CT system, multi-image diagnosis obtained from different light source energies can be realized in a variety of medical fields such as orthopedic surgery, circulatory organ, digestive organ departments, for example. Further, world-wide advanced medical activities will be expanded with the widespread of highly functional medical examination vehicles equipped with inspection equipment like the CT system disclosed in at least one example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to at least one example embodiment, a computed tomographic (CT) system may include a gantry including a rotating part.

With reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, a CT system <b>100</b> is described according to at least one example embodiment. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a side view of the CT system <b>100</b> as seen from the X-axis direction. The CT system <b>100</b> has a structure including a gantry table <b>7</b>, pedestals (<b>9</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>2</b>) supporting the gantry table <b>7</b>, and a gantry <b>5</b> movable in the Z-axis direction on the gantry table <b>7</b>, such that the gantry <b>5</b> is movable in relation to the gantry table <b>7</b> in the Z-axis direction between various positions in relation to the gantry table <b>7</b> within a gantry moving range. A rotating part <b>23</b> with a rotation center axis <b>1</b> (also referred to herein as a central axis of the Z-axis direction) is placed inside the gantry <b>5</b>. An operation and control part, also referred to herein interchangeably as a control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>, and a display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b> are provided. The control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> and the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b> are communicatively coupled to each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, such that the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b> is configured to display images based on signals generated at the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> and transmitted to the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b>. The control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> is communicatively coupled (also referred to herein as electrically coupled) to at least the gantry table <b>7</b> via cable <b>40</b>-<b>3</b>. A tomographic image reconstructed by an imaging circuit and software (e.g., by at least the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>) in response to an imaging operation being performed by some or all of the CT system <b>100</b> may be displayed on the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b>. A movable gantry carriage <b>11</b> has a drive unit (e.g., gantry carriage driving motor <b>17</b>) configured to move the gantry <b>5</b> in the Z-axis direction within the gantry moving range, and wheels <b>15</b> are attached to the lower portion of the gantry <b>5</b>.

A &#x201c;rechargeable battery,&#x201d; such as rechargeable battery <b>27</b>, is also referred to herein interchangeably as a &#x201c;secondary battery,&#x201d; such as a lithium ion battery. While the light source is described herein as an X-ray generator <b>25</b>, it will be understood that example embodiments are not limited thereto: the light source may be an X-ray light source (e.g., X-ray generator) or a near infrared (NIR) light source, for example. As is discussed in detail below, the X-ray generator <b>25</b>, the rechargeable battery <b>27</b>, and the image memory <b>35</b> may have a cartridge type structure, which can be easily inserted or removed individually to or from the rotating part <b>23</b>. Each cartridge and the rotating part <b>23</b> can be electrically connected by metal contacts between these two portions. The rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> may be a non-contact interface described below in detail, or a contact interface (also referred to herein as a mechanical interface) using an electrically conductive electrode. The X-ray beam <b>26</b> emitted from the X-ray generator <b>25</b> is transmitted through a subject (not shown in the figure) on the bed <b>3</b> and reaches the sensor array <b>31</b> (e.g., implement X-ray irradiation of the sensor array <b>31</b>, where the sensor array <b>31</b> may be configured to sense the incident X-ray beam and generate an output signal (e.g., digital data) based on said X-ray irradiation). A weight balance unit which adjusts the weight balance during the rotating part rotates may be provided. Preferably, the X-ray generator <b>25</b> may be an X-ray generator using a carbon nanomaterial such as carbon nanotube (CNT), for example, as a field electron emission source. Using the carbon nano material as the cold cathode material, preheating may not be required, and then the size and power consumption of the X-ray generator <b>25</b> can be reduced as compared with the case of conventional X-ray tube, and the high voltage control circuit <b>29</b> can be downsized, and a cooling fan can be downsized or even eliminated. In at least one example embodiment, the sensor array <b>31</b> is incorporated inside the rotating part <b>23</b>.

In such a case, some of the sensor peripheral circuits, an image memory device, and a host interface, for example, may be located at the fixed part of the gantry <b>5</b> and thus may also be outside the rotating part <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a circuit block diagram used inside the rotating part <b>23</b>, particularly showing the sensor array <b>31</b> and its sensor peripheral circuit <b>33</b> explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, which includes a sensor driving and control circuit <b>41</b>, a signal amplifying and AD converter circuit <b>43</b>, a signal scanning and control circuit <b>45</b>, a digital signal processing circuit <b>47</b>, and a parallel to serial conversion circuit <b>49</b>, for example. Some of said circuits may be combined in a single circuit configured to perform the functionality of said circuits. For example, the gantry <b>5</b> may include a detector control and signal processing circuit that combines some or all of the sensor driving and control circuit <b>41</b>, the signal amplifying and AD converter circuit <b>43</b>, the signal scanning and control circuit <b>45</b>, the digital signal processing circuit <b>47</b>, and the parallel to serial conversion circuit <b>49</b> and may be configured to drive sensor array <b>31</b> and process an output signal from the sensor array <b>31</b> (e.g., an output signal generated by one or more sensor units <b>30</b> of the sensor array <b>31</b> in response to X-ray irradiation thereof). The sensor units <b>30</b>, and thus the sensor array <b>31</b>, are configured to generate an output signal (e.g., digital data) based on X-ray irradiation thereof (e.g., said sensor units <b>30</b> may generate an output signal based on photoelectric conversion of incident light in response to X-ray irradiation of said sensor units <b>30</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the sensor array <b>31</b> has a plurality of sensor units <b>30</b> arranged in an arc-shaped and placed regularly in the Z-axis direction in order to increase its slice number or width. As for the sensor unit <b>30</b>, in addition to the conventional TFT type sensor, a small electron multiplication type sensor (like the Micro PMT element manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics KK), an avalanche effect type (APD) sensor, an amplification type detector, or a photon counting type detector, for example, can be also used. In addition, a CMOS type sensor which integrates an AD conversion circuit, and a signal processing circuit on-chip, for example, can realize high-speed and low-noise signal reading. Since these sensor units <b>30</b> have high sensitivity or low noise characteristics, the total amount of X-ray irradiation or exposure dose can be decreased. It also becomes easy to increase the scanning speed in the Z-axis direction by short-time pulse irradiation. Further, as will be discussed in detail below, if it is not necessary to further increase the X-ray irradiation area, the high current flow with high voltage required for the X-ray generator will not be increased. In addition to reducing the weight of the rotating part <b>23</b> by thinning it in the Z-axis direction, the stability and durability of the carbon nanomaterial used as a field electron emission source can be improved. As will be discussed in detail below, the sensor unit <b>30</b> has an on-chip scintillator layer which converts an incident X-ray into a visible light corresponding to a band gap of a semiconductor material like a silicon (Si) used for the sensor unit <b>30</b>. Thus, the sensor unit <b>30</b> may generate an output signal based on said visible light (e.g., based on photoelectric conversion of said visible light).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The output signal from the sensor array <b>31</b> (generated, for example, based on the sensor unit <b>30</b> being irradiated with X-rays generated by the X-ray generator <b>25</b>) is converted into digital data (16 bits, for example), also referred to herein as &#x201c;image data,&#x201d; by the signal amplifying and AD converter circuit <b>43</b> and sent to the digital signal processing circuit <b>47</b> via the signal scanning and control circuit <b>45</b>. In order to directly record the image data sent from the digital signal processing circuit <b>47</b>, an image memory <b>35</b> is built in the rotating part <b>23</b>. With this configuration, high-speed memory writing becomes possible because parallel recording can be performed directly on the image memory <b>35</b> via the bus line <b>38</b> without performing parallel to serial conversion. Although a magnetic recording medium can be used as the image memory <b>35</b>, a semiconductor memory such as a DRAM or a NAND flash memory may be preferable from the viewpoint of recording speed and reliability. On the other hand, unlike the image capturing step, it may not be necessary to read the image data from the image memory <b>35</b> in real time manner. The image data can be read out after the image capturing step (also referred to herein as the imaging operation) is completed and after the rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b> and the movement of the gantry <b>5</b> are stopped. Thus, the image data can be output as a serial data to the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the parallel to serial conversion circuit <b>49</b>. With such a configuration, the number (e.g., quantity) of terminals in the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> can be reduced by this serialization. Regarding the electrical connecting means between the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, where the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> are mechanical interfaces, there are a plurality of connectors inside the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of the rotating part <b>23</b>, with the shape of a concave structure like a female connection terminal <b>6</b>. There are the same number of connection terminals <b>4</b> with the shape of a convex structure on the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> side, and then the electrical connection between the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> can be made by inserting the connection terminals <b>4</b> into the concave shape connection terminals <b>6</b> when said terminals are aligned, for example when the respective longitudinal axes of the connection terminals <b>4</b> are aligned with corresponding respective connection terminals <b>6</b>, also referred to herein as connectors, connector electrodes, or the like. Such alignment and insertion, to enable electrical connection between the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> may be enabled when the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> are face to face with each other (e.g., when the gantry <b>5</b> is at the predetermined position, when the rotating part <b>23</b> is at the particular rotational position, etc.). Unlike the case using the conventional slip ring which is a dynamic mechanical and sliding contact is used, the image data recorded and stored inside the rotating part <b>23</b> is moving (e.g., when the imaging operation is being performed) can be readout from the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> to the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., further readout to the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> for processing via electrically connected interfaces <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> and cable <b>40</b>-<b>3</b>) during the time when the rotating part <b>23</b> is stopped. With such a configuration, the slip ring having undesirable side effects can be eliminated, and high-speed rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b>, like 2 revolutions per second or more, for example, may be easily obtained. A sensor unit <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>5</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, for example, will be discussed below. Assuming the number (e.g., quantity) of pixels of the sensor unit <b>30</b> in the body axis (Z-axis) direction to be 1000, the arrangement pitch of the pixels to be 50 micron meters (&#x3bc;m), and the rotation speed of the rotating part <b>23</b> to be 5 revolutions per second, the moving speed of the gantry <b>5</b> in the body axis (Z-axis) direction can be estimated about 25 centimeters (cm) per second. As described above, with reducing the weight and increasing the rotating speed of the rotating part <b>23</b>, the scanning speed in the body axis (Z-axis) direction can be increased. Therefore, the amount of total X-ray exposure to a body being imaged by the CT system may be reduced without increasing the number of slices in the body direction, and image inspection accuracy can be improved by the pixel miniaturization. In addition, this configuration may be also useful for imaging constantly moving organs such as the human heart.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> shows a block diagram showing the X-ray generator <b>25</b> (also referred to herein as a light source) and the high voltage control circuit <b>29</b> (also referred to herein as a light source drive control circuit) inside the rotation part <b>23</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the CT system <b>200</b> has a portion <b>9</b>-<b>3</b> which stands upright in the Y-axis direction from the gantry table <b>7</b>, which is hereinafter referred to as a cradle <b>9</b>-<b>3</b>. Inside the rotating part <b>23</b>, as already described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the parts having the cartridge structure (not shown in this figure) are used. The cradle <b>9</b>-<b>3</b> has a space (indicated by the broken line portion <b>37</b>) for retracting the gantry <b>5</b>, the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of the rotating part <b>23</b> inside the gantry <b>5</b> is a contactless interface <b>12</b>, and the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> is a contactless host interface <b>10</b>. These contactless interfaces are close to each other face to face (e.g., when a distance between the interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> is reduced or minimized due to motion of the gantry <b>5</b> and/or rotating part <b>23</b>) such that the interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may be configured to be electrically connected to each other based on an interaction of an electromagnetic field therebetween due to the proximity of the interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> to each other, and they can perform non-contact power supply charging the lithium ion battery (e.g., rechargeable battery <b>27</b>) inside the rotating part <b>23</b> and exchanging data or signals between the rotating part <b>23</b> and the host side (e.g., control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> via the gantry table <b>7</b>). The arrangement of contactless interfaces of the host interface side <b>10</b> and the rotating part side <b>12</b> being close to and face each other in the direction of the rotation center axis <b>1</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. With this configuration, the non-contact interface <b>12</b> can approach the non-contact interface <b>10</b> in the direction in which the gantry <b>5</b> moves in the Z-axis direction. The gantry <b>5</b> has a rotating part <b>23</b> which rotates around the rotation center axis <b>1</b>. The driving method of the rotating part uses the rotation motor <b>19</b> and the timing belt <b>21</b> (not shown in this figure) as described above. An energy recovery brake circuit (<b>50</b>) may be also incorporated inside the rotating part <b>23</b> as discussed in detail below. Further, in the case power is not supplied from the rail <b>13</b> for the gantry <b>5</b> movement, a rechargeable battery (not shown) may be used in the gantry <b>5</b>.

The sample called a standard object or a phantom, for example, is examined in advance whether the sensor (e.g., sensor array <b>31</b>) or the light source (e.g., X-ray generator <b>25</b>) used inside the rotating part <b>23</b> is functioning properly or not. Further, an inspection probe (not shown in the figure) inspecting or calibrating the rotating part <b>23</b> may be provided inside the cradle <b>9</b>-<b>3</b>.

A hold mechanism (not shown in the figure) for holding or fixing the gantry <b>5</b> in place in relation to the gantry table <b>7</b> may be provided inside the space <b>37</b>. With this configuration, the gantry <b>5</b> can be protected from mechanical shock when the CT system <b>200</b> is transported or moved. As described above, the cradle <b>9</b>-<b>3</b> can provide necessary functions for the stable gantry <b>5</b> driving, maintaining safety and system performance.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a block diagram related to electromagnetic induction type wireless power feeding circuits and wireless communication circuits with respect to the non-contact interface section (<b>10</b> and <b>12</b>). As shown in the figure, the circuit configuration on the contactless host interface side (<b>10</b>) includes an AC to DC converter (<b>10</b>-<b>3</b>) that converts a commercial power supply (<b>10</b>-<b>2</b>) (e.g., an external alternating current (AC) power supply network to which the gantry table <b>7</b> is communicatively coupled) into a direct current (DC), and a high frequency inverter (<b>10</b>-<b>4</b>) which outputs a high frequency square waveform. A waveform shaping circuit (<b>10</b>-<b>5</b>) converting the square waveform into a sine waveform is connected to the primary winding coil L<b>1</b> (<b>10</b>-<b>1</b>) via an insulated transformer (<b>10</b>-<b>6</b>) for ensuring safety. On the other hand, the secondary winding coil L<b>2</b> (<b>12</b>-<b>1</b>) is connected to a load such as a secondary battery (<b>12</b>-<b>2</b>), also referred to herein as a rechargeable battery, via a rectifying and waveform smoothing circuit (<b>12</b>-<b>4</b>) converting the high frequency current to a direct current followed by a reverse current blocking diode (<b>12</b>-<b>3</b>), for example. The contactless interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> may be configured to be electrically connected in a contactless manner based on an interaction of an electromagnetic field therebetween, based at least on the gantry <b>5</b> being at the predetermined position such that the interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are face to face with each other, such that a distance between the interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> is reduced or minimized such that interaction of an electromagnetic field between windings coils L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> (<b>10</b>-<b>1</b>) and (<b>10</b>-<b>2</b>) is enabled.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As for the transmitting and receiving control signals or image data, a wireless communication system based on near-field magnetic field coupling for example, may be used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, antennas A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> closely face each other between non-contact interfaces <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively.

A spiral coil or a coupling capacitor electrode may be used as the near-field antenna (e.g., antennas A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>), for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, it may be also preferable to introduce a high-speed and large-capacity communication method such as so-called 5G, for example, enabling a high-speed and a large-capacity CT image data transmission owing to the increased data transfer speed of giga (G) bits per second or more. Further, the wireless power feeding and the wireless communication system may be performed by sharing the same coil or antenna.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Controllers as described herein with reference to any example embodiments, and/or any portions thereof (including, without limitation, controllers <b>10</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>12</b>-<b>7</b>) may include, may be included in, and/or may be implemented by one or more instances of processing circuitry such as hardware including logic circuits; a hardware/software combination such as a processor executing software; or a combination thereof.

As shown in the figure, after the movement of the gantry <b>5</b> and the start of rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b> (driving step S<b>11</b>), imaging by X-ray irradiation is started, such that the X-ray generator emits X-rays and the sensor array <b>31</b> is subjected to X-ray irradiation by at least some of said X-rays, such that one or more sensor units <b>30</b> of the sensor array <b>31</b> generate one or more output signals, provided (e.g., via processing of the output signals by one or more circuits) as image data or digital data, in response to said X-ray irradiation (S<b>12</b>). The digital data obtained from the sensor array <b>31</b> is recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> in real time (S<b>13</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the digital data can be recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> as the parallel data without parallel to serial conversion. After the image capturing is completed (S<b>14</b>), the gantry <b>5</b> is stopped at a predetermined position in relation to the gantry table <b>7</b> such that the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> are face to face with each other and configured to be electrically connected with each other (e.g., via mechanical engagement of respective connectors when the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> are mechanical interfaces, or interaction of electromagnetic field therebetween when the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> are contactless interfaces) (S<b>15</b>), and the data recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> is read from the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> (S<b>16</b>). The data read from the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> may be communicated to the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., via cable <b>40</b>-<b>3</b>). The control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> may perform an image reconstructing process on said data. After the image reconstructing process is performed at the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> may be configured to cause an image based on said reconstructing process to be displayed on the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b>, followed by the CT system entering a standby state (S<b>18</b>). The lithium ion battery <b>27</b> may be charged (S<b>17</b>) at the same time as the driving step (S<b>16</b>) or during the standby period (S<b>18</b>), and then the driving sequences is completed.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is a plan view of the CT system <b>300</b>, particularly showing the inside structure of the gantry <b>5</b>-<b>2</b>, as viewed from the Z-axis direction according to at least one example embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a cross sectional view of the gantry <b>5</b>-<b>2</b> used in the CT system <b>300</b> with a view direction of the X-axis or Y-axis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, in at least one example embodiment, an X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m</i>, a rechargeable battery <b>27</b><i>m</i>, a high voltage control circuit <b>29</b><i>m</i>, an energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> which will be discussed below for example, are placed inside the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b>. On the other hand, many sensor units <b>30</b> mounted on the entire circumference are placed inside the annular fixed part <b>24</b> having the same rotation center as that of the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b>. In this example embodiment, the fixed part <b>24</b> is attached to the inner peripheral portion of the gantry <b>5</b>-<b>2</b> and is located inside the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> as shown in the X-Y plan view. The gantry rotation motor <b>19</b> and the timing belt <b>21</b> which rotates the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> are also described. This setup may be like so-called Nutate-Rotate type CT system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the X-rays (broken line arrow) emitted from the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>may be blocked by the fixed part <b>24</b>, and therefore fixed part <b>24</b> is shifted in the Z-axis direction with respect to the mounting position of the sensor unit <b>30</b>. The X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m</i>, the rechargeable battery <b>27</b><i>m</i>, the high voltage control circuit <b>29</b><i>m</i>, the image memory <b>35</b><i>m</i>, and the sensor driving and control circuit <b>41</b><i>m </i>are cartridge type structure, which can be easily attached or detached, as will be described in detail below.

The fixed part <b>24</b> and the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> are incorporated inside the gantry <b>5</b>-<b>2</b>. The difference from the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is that the diameter of the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> containing the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>is smaller than the diameter of the inner peripheral portion of the fixed part <b>24</b>. The X-rays emitted from X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>can reach the sensor units <b>30</b> without being blocked by the fixed part <b>24</b>. This setup may be like so-called Stationary Rotate type CT system. However, in the case of the conventional structure using a slip ring and electrode brush, their contact surface may heat up causing seizure, and the sensor unit <b>30</b> may make an erroneous photoelectric conversion of incident X-rays due to a light emission phenomenon caused by an electric spark when a high voltage or large current flow is applied from the brush electrode to the slip ring sliding with a high speed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">This configuration may cause non-uniform X-ray irradiation of the sensor units <b>30</b> because the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> is located opposed to the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>in between the central axis of the rotation center and on the optical path of the X-rays emitted from the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m</i>. A structure that solves this problem will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>5</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a plan view illustrating the structure of the CT system <b>400</b> according to at least one example embodiment, particularly inside the gantry part, as viewed from the Z-axis direction.

Sensor units <b>30</b> (not shown in this figure) are arranged on the entire inner circumference of the fixed part <b>24</b>. The rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> has an X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m</i>, a light source drive circuit and a secondary battery which is also referred to herein interchangeably as a rechargeable battery (not shown in this figure), for example. An opening <b>28</b> marked by a broken line A is formed at the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b>, and defined by the rotating part <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> so that the X-rays emitted from the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>can transmit or pass therethrough. With this configuration, intensity of X-ray beam <b>26</b> and its traveling direction may not be affected. The opening <b>28</b> does not necessarily have to be an empty space where all the members are removed (air only), and a protective cover made of resin having a high X-ray transmittance, for example, may exist. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the structure inside the gantry when the opening <b>28</b> is viewed from the X-axis or Y-axis direction.

Alternatively, if the rotating part interface <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> is formed in a ring shape over the entire circumference of the annular side surface of the rotating part <b>23</b>, the rotating part interface <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> and the convex type connection terminals <b>4</b> may be electrically connected regardless of the stationary position of the rotating part <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to at least one example embodiment, the rotating part of the CT system <b>600</b>, particularly inside the gantry <b>5</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>8</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a plan view of the rotating part <b>23</b> inside the gantry <b>5</b> as seen from the Z-axis direction, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> show the enlarged structure of the broken line portion <b>39</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. As explained above, the rotation part <b>23</b> has the X-ray generator <b>25</b>, the rechargeable battery <b>27</b>, the high voltage control circuit <b>29</b>, the sensor array <b>31</b>, the sensor peripheral circuit <b>33</b> including the signal amplification, AD conversion circuit, the signal scanning and control circuit, for example. The sensor driving and control circuit <b>41</b>, a non-contact interface <b>12</b>, and a digital signal processing circuit (not shown in the figure), a parallel to serial conversion circuit (not shown in the figure) are also incorporated inside the rotation part <b>23</b>. As will be described below, the energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> is placed in the fixed part or the rotating part <b>23</b> inside the gantry. The electromagnetic induction coil <b>36</b>-<b>1</b>, which may in some example embodiments refer to a plurality of induction coils is provided around either the rotating part <b>23</b> or the fixed part. The energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> utilizes the electromotive force induced in the electromagnetic induction coil, to convert an electromotive force in the electromagnetic induction coil <b>36</b>-<b>1</b>, induced by a moment of inertia about the rotating part <b>23</b>, into electric energy.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the structure (<b>39</b>-<b>1</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, for example, the N pole and the S pole of the permanent magnet (<b>34</b>-<b>1</b>) are alternately arranged along the ring-shaped side of the fixed part so that N poles and S poles of the permanent magnets are alternately facing the annular part of the rotating part. On the side of the rotating part, the induction coil(s) (<b>36</b>-<b>1</b>) is/are wound around the iron core(s) (<b>32</b>-<b>1</b>). Therefore, the energy recovery braking circuit <b>50</b> may be provided inside the rotating part <b>23</b>. On the other hand, in the structure (<b>39</b>-<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, for example, the N pole and the S pole of the permanent magnet (<b>34</b>-<b>2</b>) are alternately arranged along the ring-shaped side of the rotating part so that N poles and S poles of the permanent magnets are alternately facing the circumference of the fixed part. On the side of the fixed part, the induction coil(s) (<b>36</b>-<b>2</b>) is/are wound around the iron core(s) (<b>32</b>-<b>2</b>). Therefore, the energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> may be provided inside the fixed part. This structure may be like that of so-called a direct drive (DD) motor, which is not necessary to rotate the rotating part using an external motor and a timing belt. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> may be preferable if electric energy is stored in the rechargeable battery <b>27</b> inside the rotating part <b>23</b> or an electric double layer capacitor as described below. In the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, an electromotive force is generated in the induction coil (<b>36</b>-<b>1</b>) even when the rotating part <b>23</b> is forcibly rotated by an external motor via a timing belt, as described below, and then it is also possible to charge the rechargeable battery <b>27</b>. Even after providing the forcible rotation described above, the rotational energy generated in the induction coil (<b>36</b>-<b>1</b>) is recovered to the rechargeable battery or an electric double layer capacitor until the rotation stops as discussed in detail below.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Preferably, a neodymium magnet, for example, may be used as the permanent magnet. As will be described below, the rotational movement of the rotating part inside the gantry is unnecessary after the imaging operation is completed. However, it may be possible to convert the moment of inertia of the rotating part into an electric energy without stopping the rotary motion mechanically, and then energy saving effect can be obtained. The energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> has such a role in this example embodiment. Rotation (imaging mode) and stop (standby mode) motions are frequently repeated, so that the above mentioned rotation energy recovery effect of the rotating part is remarkable, particularly, in the case of high-speed scanning with increasing the number of rotations of the rotating part.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In the CT system according to at least one example embodiment of the inventive concepts, the imaging operation starts after the rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b> starts. The imaging operation may include the X-ray generator generating X-rays to irradiate the sensor array <b>30</b>, such that the sensor array <b>30</b> generates one or more output signals in in response to X-ray irradiation thereof by the X-ray generator <b>25</b>, where said output signals may be processed to provide image data, also referred to herein as digital data. The rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b> decelerates, and then the rotational motion stops after completing the imaging sequence. As described above, rotation start and stop motions are repeated within a short time and imaging operations. Effective reuse of the rotational kinetic energy of the rotating part <b>23</b> may reduce the power consumption of the rechargeable battery <b>27</b> and save energy. The energy recovery brake circuit <b>50</b> provided inside the rotating part <b>23</b> may include a bidirectional DC-DC converter <b>42</b> connected to the rechargeable battery <b>27</b>, and a DC-AC converter <b>46</b> connected to the other end of the bidirectional DC-DC converter <b>42</b>. The other end of the DC-AC converter <b>46</b> is connected to the induction coil <b>36</b>. The induction coil <b>36</b> is connected to a capacitor, preferably an electric double layer capacitor <b>44</b>, via an AC-DC converter <b>48</b>. Further, the electric double layer capacitor <b>44</b> is connected to the bidirectional DC-DC converter <b>42</b>. The rotary kinetic energy of the rotating part <b>23</b> can be converted into counter electromotive force generated in the induction coil <b>36</b>, which can charge the electric double layer capacitor <b>44</b>. Also, the rechargeable battery <b>27</b> can be charged via the bidirectional DC-DC converter <b>42</b>. In general, the energy recovery efficiency using a capacitor may be about 90% or more, which may be higher than that of the case using a rechargeable battery of around 60% efficiency. Particularly, with this configuration, it may be useful for the CT system in which the rotating part <b>23</b> is decelerated (energy recovery) and is immediately rotated (discharged) repeatedly. With respect to the bidirectional DC-DC converter <b>42</b>, a circuit system in which a step-down chopper circuit and a step-up chopper circuit are combined, or a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) system using a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and an AD converter may be used.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a flowchart describing the driving method when the energy recovery brake circuit is used like the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, for example. As shown in the figure, after the rotation of the rotating part <b>23</b> is started, then the bed or the gantry begins to move (driving step S<b>21</b>). In the next step, imaging by X-ray irradiation (e.g., the imaging operation) proceeds (S<b>22</b>). The imaging operation may include the X-ray generator generating X-rays to irradiate the sensor array <b>30</b>, such that the sensor array <b>30</b> generates one or more output signals in in response to X-ray irradiation thereof by the X-ray generator <b>25</b>, where said output signals may be processed to provide image data, also referred to herein as digital data. In some example embodiments, the sensor array <b>31</b> may generate output signals that are the aforementioned digital data and/or image data without additional processing. The digital data obtained from the sensor array <b>31</b> is recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> in a real time manner (S<b>23</b>). As described above, digital data can be recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> as parallel data without converting the data from parallel to serial. After the imaging is completed (S<b>24</b>), the rotational kinetic energy of the rotating part <b>23</b> causes a counter electromotive force in the induction coil(s) to be recovered as an electric energy, and the rotational movement is decelerated while charging the capacitor or the rechargeable battery <b>27</b> (S<b>25</b>). Finally, the gantry stops at a predetermined position (S<b>26</b>) such that the rotating part interface and the host interface are face to face with each other and configured to be electrically connected with each other, the data recorded in the image memory <b>35</b> is read from the rotating part interface through the host interface (S<b>27</b>), and the image is reconstructed by the operation and control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b>. The data read from the rotating part interface <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> via the host interface <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> may be communicated to the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., via cable <b>40</b>-<b>3</b>). The control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> may perform an image reconstructing process on said data. After processing, the resulting (e.g., shooting) image is caused by the control unit <b>40</b>-<b>1</b> to be displayed on the display monitor <b>40</b>-<b>2</b>. In parallel, the rechargeable battery <b>27</b> is charged (S<b>28</b>), and then a series of sequences is completed to enter the standby state (S<b>29</b>). As will be described later and not shown in the flowchart, it may be also preferable to add a step in which the used rechargeable battery <b>27</b> is disconnected and an already charged rechargeable battery is mounted instead when the gantry stops at a predetermined position and returns to the next imaging step (first step of the flowchart).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is a cross-sectional view seen from the X-axis direction showing the gantry portion of the CT system <b>700</b> according to at least one example embodiment. The X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m</i>, which is a component incorporated in the rotating part <b>23</b>, should be replaced corresponding to the frequency of use due to the deterioration of the target member, and consumption of the electron beam generating cold cathode materials or carbon nano materials in this example. Similarly, the sensor array <b>31</b><i>m </i>may also need to be replaced due to the radiation damage to the semiconductor components used or the humidity dependency of the laminated X-ray scintillator material. Therefore, in at least one example embodiment, the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>and the sensor array <b>31</b><i>m </i>employs cartridge form, which is detachable from the rotation part <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the rotating part <b>23</b> is provided with a cartridge receiving spaces <b>25</b><i>f </i>and <b>31</b><i>f </i>(both indicated by broken line portions) into which the cartridge types X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>and the sensor array <b>31</b><i>m </i>are inserted.

The cartridge form is not limited to the X-ray generator <b>25</b><i>m </i>and the sensor array <b>31</b><i>m</i>, but as described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, for example), the rechargeable battery <b>27</b>, or an image memory <b>35</b> according to the increase in recording capacity may have such a cartridge form.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is a plan view showing the rotating part <b>23</b> of the CT system <b>800</b> as seen from the Z-axis direction, according to at least one example embodiment.

The sensor array <b>31</b> or the sensor array <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> may be arranged at positions shifted in the Z-axis direction. Further, the X-ray generator <b>25</b> and the X-ray generator <b>25</b>-<b>2</b> may emit X-rays at the same time or with a different timing. Furthermore, different X-ray tube voltages (or wavelengths) can be applied to the X-ray generator <b>25</b> and the X-ray generator <b>25</b>-<b>2</b> to perform multispectral analysis.

It should be also noted that extremely useful functions and effects such as versatility of imaging and inspection like the multi-spectral image analysis or these hybridizations are realized.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> is a side view of a CT system <b>900</b> as seen from the X-axis direction according to another example embodiment.
