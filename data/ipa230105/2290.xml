The world population is expected to be 9.1 billion people by 2050, to meet the requirement total food consumption will have to rise by 50-70% (Keeney, 1997; Jaggard et al., 2010). Fertilizers have an axial role in enhancing the food production in world especially after the introduction of high yielding crop varieties. Investigations show that, a fertilizer contributes to the tune of 35-40% of the productivity of any crop (Pallabi and Dash, 2014).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Among these, nanotechnology based bio fertilizer's has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural systems and numerous other areas. Nanoparticles are atomic or molecular aggregates with at least one dimension between 1 and 100 nm, which can drastically modify their physicochemical properties compared to the bulk material. Owing to its high surface area to volume size ratio, exhibit significantly novel and improved physical, chemical, and biological properties, phenomena, and functions (Lengke et al, 2007).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention deals with the production and process of natural organic nano-nutrients with Lactate and gluconate technology and its role in sustainability of agriculture. The present study involves biosynthesis of nano-nutrients which are used as nano-fertilizer for sustainable agriculture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The patent application no: CN 201810822140.5 discloses the preparation of fertilizer using the different raw materials as a source and microorganisms to ferment and produce the bio fertilizer. The preparation steps includes the processing of straw material and treated with the different microorganisms at 25-37&#xb0; C. for 3-5 days for formation of bio fertilizer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The patent application no: CN 102017000145701 discloses the bio fertilizer formation through the combination of biological as well as manure components of sheep manure, sweet potato stem, borax, fermented rice chaff and other extracts and components for the soya bean crop. This patent application mainly deals with the increase in the soil absorption capacity of the plant through the roots by the process of microbial based bio fertilizer which was directly involved in the roots and soil of the soya bean. The process of bio fertilizer that acts as a mychorrizal and establish the connection between the plant roots and soil to make the soya bean plant more growth and high chlorophyll content.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The U.S. Pat. No. 311,785 (Application number: 149/DEL/2012) discloses the process of making metal nanoparticles which is through the chemical origin, i.e. using the precursor metal salts. Even though the patent discusses about the nanoparticle formation, but it has higher concentrations of chemical constituents. The nanoparticles are having less bioavailability of nutrients as compared to the organic nano-nutrients. The soil may also be affected when using the inorganic nanoparticles when compared to the organic nano-nutrients.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The patent application number 7/DEL/2013 (U.S. Pat. No. 326,809) discloses the preparation of phosphorous fertilizer by using the nanoparticles. The patent discusses the formation of phosphorous fertilizer using Zn nanoparticles as inducers for phosphorus mobilizing enzymes in rhizosphere. This is an indirect method of preparing the phosphorous fertilizer by using the fungal biomass. This is only biotransformation performed wherein the soil phosphorous was absorbed through the roots by the action of fungal biomass and Zn nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The patent application WO/2017/101691 discloses the preparation of electro neutral metal nanoparticles by using the electro neutral ions. This application mainly deals with the tissue culture of the plants while making the medium incorporate the nanoparticles in ppm levels to the medium. The process described is for the tissue culture plants and is not applicable for all the crops.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The patent application No: CN201610415691.0 discloses the preparation of nano fertilizer synergist from the shrimp shell and extraction of chitin protein from the shrimp waste.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The patent application No: CN201810096140.1 discloses the preparation of bio-organic fertilizer from the following components: corn stalk powder, soybean meal, distillers' grains, rotten chicken manure, fermented coconut shell and camphor bark compost, potassium fulvate, nano-activated diatomite, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, trace elements and multiple species inoculant. This invention mainly focuses on the soil remediation by using the bio-organic fertilizer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The patent application No: CN 200710118531.0 (Patent no. CN100534961) discloses the preparation of bio-fertilizer rather than nano-fertilizer. The components of nanometer biological fertilizer and proportions thereof are that: 5-10 percent microbial inoculum, 10-20 percent extract of yeast fermentation liquid, 40-55 percent natural macromolecule organic compound, 15-25 percent urea, 2-4 percent urease inhibitor and 5-15 percent nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium compound fertilizer. The invention accelerates the degradation of macromolecular natural organic compounds into nano-scale organic fertilizers by adding fungicides, and decomposes organic pollutants. At the same time, urea is slowly degraded by adding urease inhibitors, which effectively improves the ability of crops to absorb nutrients and reduce fertilizers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">None of the cited references above disclose or teach what the present invention discloses or teach. The present invention deals with the process of producing organic nano-nutrients by using the Lactate/Gluconate/Proteinate technology with the binding of Zn, Mg, Fe and phosphorous nutrients.

Biological materials when reduced to the Nano scale show some properties which are different from what they exhibit on a macro scale, enabling unique applications. The present invention deals with the application of plant micronutrients as a nano-formulation through the smart delivery systems of lactates and gluconates for soil and foliar applications.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention deals with the formation of Natural Organic Nano-Fertilizers with the chelated nano-nutrients to balance plant nutrition; improve water holding capacity, soil health improvement, sustainable productivity and quality improvement. The present invention includes the synthesis of nanoparticles at lowest possible size leading to effective and enhanced absorption of nutrients into the cells which leads to crop improvement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one of the embodiment of the present invention, the process of production of Natural Organic Nano-Fertilizers with the chelated nano-nutrients is carried out in three steps. The step one includes the cultivation of the respective organism for the formation of composites which releases the bioactive components in the solution. The step two includes the formation of Lactate/Gluconate/Proteinate Salt solution and step three is the formation of nano-nutrients with the cultivation of bioactive solution with the lactate/Gluconate (Zn, Mg and Fe)/Proteinate (Phosphorous) salt solution for the formation of nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include that the size of the nanoparticles of the chelated nano-nutrients is below 20 nm which facilitates the diffusion of nutrients along with bioactive components inside the cell and activate the cellular enzymes which lead to increase in the soil nutrient uptake by the plant.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the synthesis of nano-nutrients involves growing of the microorganism on selected nutrient source under necessary growth conditions. After the complete growth the biomass is separated. The filtrate is used for isolation of extracellular specific proteins and these are used for nanoparticle synthesis. The selection of microorganism and optimum parameter are specific for synthesis for desired type of nano-nutrients.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Microbial extracellular secreting enzymes are produced which reduce the metal salt of macro or micro scale into nano scale diameter through catalytic effect. Extracellular secretion of enzymes offers the advantage to obtain pure, mono dispense nanoparticles, which are free from cellular components, associated with downstream processing. Bio sorption and bio reduction were carried out by negative electro kinetic potential of microorganisms enables them to attract the cations and act as trigger of the procedure for biosynthesis of nanoparticles (Fu et al, 2000). These nanoparticles get into plant cells through either stomatal or vascular system which may enhance plant cell metabolic activities that lead to higher crop production. (Eichert et al, 2008) suggest that the stomatal pathway is highly capacitive because of its large size exclusion limit and its high transport velocity. Such biologically synthesized, very tiny functional nanoparticles are economically chief, relatively stable, easy downstream processing and environmentally safe as they are encapsulated by fungal protein which is water soluble.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: The process flow diagram for the Nano-nutrient formation through Lactate salts.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: The process flow diagram for the Nano-nutrient formation through Gluconate salts.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>: The process flow diagram for the Nano-nutrient formation through Phosphorous proteinates.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>: Transmission electron microscopy images of Zn, Mg and Fe Nanoparticles from the Lactate salts and Phosphorous nanoparticles from proteinates.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>: The efficiency studies of Zn, Mg and P nano-nutrients along with bio-fertilizer and control spinach plants (<i>Spinacia oleracea </i>L).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>: The efficiency studies of Zn nano-nutrient along with bio-fertilizer and control Tomato plants (<i>Solanum lycopersicum </i>L.).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention deals with the formation of Natural Organic Nano-Fertilizers with the chelated nano-nutrients to balance plant nutrition; improve water holding capacity, soil health improvement, sustainable productivity and quality improvement.
