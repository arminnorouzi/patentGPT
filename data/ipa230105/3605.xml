The fluid can corrode portions of the tank that come into contact with the fluid. External surfaces of the tank can corrode due to water or other fluids under the floor of the tank, or water that leaked into the tank through, for example, a roof seal and sank below the hydrocarbon fluid due to its higher density. Corrosive elements in the hydrocarbon fluid can also contribute to corrosion. This corrosion can eventually cause the tank to leak. However, it can be challenging to determine the integrity of the tank to prevent leaks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is directed to systems, methods and apparatus of inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid. Due to the technical challenges of inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid, tanks inspections may be performed on empty tanks that are out-of-service. However, out-of-service inspection entails many hazardous steps. For example, the tank is first emptied of its liquid content. A large opening is then cut in the side of the tank to allow people and tools to enter. The residual sediments on the floor are collected, removed from the tank and safely disposed of. The atmosphere inside the tank is degassed and rendered safe. Human operators then enter the confined space under harsh and hazardous conditions to perform tedious plate-by-plate floor inspection. Once the inspection is complete, plates are welded to close the opening on the side of the tank, and the tank refilled with flammable fluid. These additional steps taken to inspect a tank can be time consuming, resource intensive, or hazardous.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems, methods and apparatus of this technical solution provide an autonomous vehicle that can inspect a tank containing a flammable fluid. The autonomous vehicle of this technical solution can perform an in-service tank inspection. An in-service tank inspection can refer to inspecting the tank while the flammable fluid is still contained in the tank. In some cases, an in-service tank inspection can refer to a closed tank inspection, such as inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid while the lid of the tank is closed or sealed. To perform an in-service tank inspection, the autonomous vehicle of this technical solution can be tetherless and include a propeller, battery, and control unit that can automatically perform a tank inspection process. By automatically performing an in-service tank inspection with the tank lid closed, the autonomous vehicle can save time, reduce resource utilization and increase safety by inspecting the tank without having to empty the tank, which can allow for more frequent tank inspections. The system can more accurately predict the quality, integrity or state of the tank by performing more frequent tank inspection, or collecting inspection data at different intervals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one aspect is directed to a vehicle to inspect a tank containing a flammable fluid. The vehicle can include a propeller, a battery, a control unit, an inspection device, and a ranging device. The battery can provide power to the propeller, the control unit, the inspection device, and the ranging device. The control unit can generate a map of the tank based on data received from the ranging device. The ranging device can include an acoustic sensor or electromagnetic radiation sensor capable of providing a measurement of the distance between the robot and the environment (e.g., tank shell and obstacles such as pipes or roof support columns). The control unit can determine a first position of the vehicle on the map of the tank. The propeller, which can be electrically connected to the battery, can move the vehicle through the flammable fluid in the tank. The inspection device, which can be electrically connected to the battery, can determine a quality metric of a portion of the tank.

The system can include an autonomous vehicle having a propeller, battery and control unit. The vehicle, using the control unit, can be self-contained and autonomously inspect the tank. For example, a winch can lower the vehicle into the tank using a cable. While the vehicle is being lowered through the vapor layer over the flammable fluid, the vehicle can remain in a powered off state. The vehicle can include a mechanical pressure switch that detects when the vehicle has been submerged to a predetermined depth into the fluid, and then powers on the vehicle responsive to being submerged to the desired depth. The winch can lower the vehicle to the tank floor, at which point the winch or vehicle can detect that the vehicle is in contact with the tank floor and disengage the cable from the vehicle. Upon being lowered into the flammable fluid in the tank, the vehicle can be disconnected from systems or components external to the tank. The control unit of the vehicle can command the propeller to move the vehicle through the flammable fluid in the tank. While moving throughout the tank, the control unit, using a ranging device, can generate a map of the tank. The control unit can inspect the tank using an inspection device, and store the collected data. The control unit can associate the data from the inspection device with a position or location on the generated map of the tank. By analyzing the collected data, the system can determine the integrity of the tank, such as the thickness of the tank floor, or the level of corrosion of the tank floor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, systems, methods and apparatus of this technical solution can perform a tank inspection without emptying or draining a flammable fluid from the tank prior to inspecting the tank, thereby improving the efficiency and safety of the tank inspection process, saving time, and utilizing fewer resources.

The autoignition temperature can indicate a temperature point at which a substance can be ignited in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition. The flash point can indicate the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after an ignition source is removed. For example, gasoline can include an autoignition temperature of 280 Celsius and a flash point of 43 Celsius.

The magnetic field can penetrate through the one or more layers or constructions of the tank floor and stabilize in the layer of the tank floor.

The pulsed eddy currents probe can be used to monitor the decay in eddy current, the decay can determine the thickness of the tank floor. The electrical current magnitude in a given loop can be proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the resistivity of a material.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some implementations, the inspection device <b>122</b> can generate array eddy currents along an array of coils to determine the quality metric <b>136</b> at a portion of the tank corresponding to a second position of the vehicle <b>101</b> on the tank map <b>130</b>.

The second quality metric <b>136</b> can be similar to, or different from, the first quality metric <b>136</b>. The ultrasonic phased array system can include ultrasonic transducers, which can be pulsed independently using computer-calculated timing. Pulsing the ultrasonic transducers can result in steering a beam generated by the ultrasonic transducers to scan the portions of the tank. In some implementations, the inspection device <b>122</b> can include two different technologies to generate the quality metric <b>136</b> at the portion of the tank. For example, the inspection device <b>122</b> can determine a thickness of the tank floor using eddy currents information and a thickness of the tank floor using the ultrasonic phased array information. This allows the vehicle <b>101</b> to take advantage of the complementarity of the two technologies. For example, eddy current technology can provide better results compared to ultrasonic technology in the presence of residual sediment after the brush cleans the floor, or in the case the tank floor inside the tank (e.g., topside) is corroded corrosion. Ultrasonic can provide better results as compared to eddy current technology when the floor has been sufficiently cleaned by the brush and is primarily affected by pitting. In some cases, one technology may consume more battery power than another technology, so the vehicle <b>101</b> can select a lower power technology in the event the battery level is low in order to prolong the inspection. Thus, the inspection device can include at least two different types of sensors, and select, based on a condition associated with the portion of the tank corresponding to the first position of the vehicle on the map, one of the at least two different types of sensors to inspect the portion of the tank.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The latch mechanism <b>124</b> can include a latch detection sensor or a latch lock.

The winch can be preconfigured to lower the vehicle into the tank at a predetermined rate or default rate.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">For example, a tank or other administrator can determine the distance from a floating roof to the tank floor with reasonable accuracy using a gauge, predetermined construction drawings, or a tape measure (e.g., the cable used to launch and recover the vehicle can include markings every 10 feet, for example). The tank administrator can provide this information to the system.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">At step <b>504</b>, the winch can remove the cable from the tank subsequent to deploying the vehicle. The winch can remove the cable from the tank after the winch has submerged the vehicle into the flammable fluid or lowered the vehicle to the tank floor. The winch can determine to remove the cable from the tank based, or responsive to, an indication. The winch can receive an indication from a sensor that indicates the vehicle has contacted the tank floor, or that the latch has disconnected the cable from the vehicle. The winch can receive an indication from a sensor that the vehicle has become at least partially submerged in the flammable fluid, or otherwise come into contact with the flammable fluid or the tank floor. The winch can remove the cable based on a time interval. For example, the winch can determine to remove or raise the cable from the tank based on expiration of a countdown timer that is set based on a predetermined vehicle deployment process. In another example, the winch can determine to remove the cable based on detecting that a tension in the cable has fallen below a threshold, which can indicate that the vehicle has contacted the tank floor and is being supported by the tank floor instead of the cable.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The sensor of the winch can determine the vehicle was lowered into the flammable fluid based on the difference on the force measured by the sensor. For example, the vehicle may weigh 100 kg. The sensor can detect a 1000 N force as the vehicle is being lowered into the tank, but prior to the vehicle contacting the fluid. The sensor can detect the force based on a tension associated with the cable connecting the vehicle to the winch. When the vehicle comes into contact with the flammable fluid, the sensor can detect a reduction in the force. For example, the sensor can detect a force of 750N when the vehicle comes into contact with the flammable fluid. As the vehicle becomes increasingly submerged in the fluid, the sensor can detect a further reduction in the force until the vehicle is completely submerged in the fluid. However, since the vehicle may have negative buoyancy, the sensor may still detect some non-zero force, although the detected force may be significantly less than the originally detected weight of the vehicle. The sensor can detect a constant force, or substantially constant force (e.g., less than 5% variation) between the vehicle becomes fully submerged in the fluid and just before the vehicle contacts the tank floor. When the vehicle contacts the tank floor, the sensor can detect a further reduction in force. For example, the sensor can detect a near zero force&#x2014;or a force only due to the weight of the cable&#x2014;when the vehicle comes into contact with the tank floor because the tank floor can support the weight of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Thus, the winch can determine, based on a difference between forces measured by the sensor, to reel up the cable based on the vehicle at least partially submerged in the flammable fluid or the vehicle reaching the tank floor. The winch can further determine to remove the cable from the tank based on a timer. The timer can be predetermined based on a historical data indicating a time for the vehicle to be lowered into the tank and disconnect the cable from the latch.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">At step <b>506</b>, the vehicle can execute the diagnostic program. The vehicle can obtain the diagnostic program from memory or storage. The vehicle can select a diagnostic program based on a criteria or factor associated with the tank in which the vehicle is lowered. The vehicle can execute the diagnostic program to determine or identify a diagnosis or diagnostic result. The vehicle can use the diagnostic program, or results thereof, to determine whether to initiate a tank inspection process. For example, if the results of the diagnostic program indicate that there are no system errors, or that the conditions associated with performing a successful tank inspection process have been met, the vehicle can begin the tank inspection. The results of the diagnostic program can indicate an operation condition or status of one or more components of the ATIS or vehicle. The diagnostic program can detect the state of the cable, which can indicate the connection of the cable to the vehicle. The operation condition can include exit condition, wait condition, low power state, cooling state, or high performance state.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">At step <b>508</b>, the vehicle can determine to initiate an exit process based on the diagnostic program result. The diagnostic program result can indicate an exit condition based on at least an amount of power available in the battery, the condition of the vehicle or the one or more components of the ATIS (e.g. temperature, performance, etc.), or an absence of indication of uninspected one or more portions of the tank. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the exit process. Instead, the vehicle can determine to initiate the tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the exit process, but to execute step <b>520</b> based on the diagnostic program result responsive to the storing the quality metric as in step <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">At step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can determine whether to initiate a tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. If the vehicle determines not to initiate the tank inspection process at step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can proceed to step <b>512</b>. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can disable the propeller to prevent moving the vehicle based on not initiating the tank inspection process, as in step <b>512</b>. In another implementation, the diagnostic program can be run before the vehicle latch system detaches the vehicle from the cable. By doing so, recovery is facilitated if errors are found during execution of the diagnostic program.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">For example, the vehicle can disable the propeller to prevent moving the vehicle. The propeller can be disabled by the control unit using the propeller control program based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can then execute the diagnostic program responsive to disabling the propeller. The vehicle can execute the diagnostic program in a manner similar to step <b>506</b>. The diagnostic program result can indicate at least one operation condition including a waiting condition or a cooling state. The cooling state can be based on the temperature of the vehicle or the one or more components of the ATIS. The waiting condition can be based on the diagnostic program requiring one or more additional results, for example, results from testing the components of the ATIS.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">If, however, the vehicle determines to initiate the tank inspection process at step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can proceed to step <b>514</b>. At step <b>514</b>, the vehicle can initiate the tank inspection process by generating and providing one or more commands, such as a command to move the vehicle through the flammable fluid. The vehicle can move through the flammable fluid by a propeller. The vehicle can execute, by the control unit, the diagnostic program prior to causing the propeller to move the vehicle. The vehicle can use the propeller to move to a plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can use the ranging device concurrent to traversing the plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can configure the propeller to turn in a plurality of directions to move the vehicle in one or more directions.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">At step <b>516</b>, the vehicle can generate a map of the tank. The generation of the tank map <b>130</b> can be based on the vehicle traversing the plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can further generate a map without traversing the plurality of portions of the tank using the ranging device, such as an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, electromagnetic radiation sensor (laser) or a radar sensor. The map of the tank can be stored in the tank map within the vehicle resource repository. In some implementations, the control unit <b>104</b> of the vehicle can detect an exit condition based on the generated tank map, for example, the vehicle can be provided, based on the available power of the battery corresponding to the size of the tank, with the exit condition by the diagnostic program.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">At step <b>518</b>, the vehicle can determine a first position of the vehicle on the tank map <b>130</b>. The first position can be determined based on information provided by the ranging device, for example, the ranging device can be configured by the mapping unit <b>108</b> to identify or update the position of the vehicle. The first position can indicate the position of the lid with respect to the tank, the lid used for lowering the vehicle into the tank. The first position <b>302</b> can be the first uninspected portion of the tank. The vehicle can determine, by the control unit based on one or more results of the diagnostic program, to initiate the tank inspection process. In some implementations, the tank inspection process can command the vehicle to determine a quality metric for the first position.

The vehicle can be configured by the control unit, based on the diagnostic program <b>138</b>, to disable the propeller to prevent the propeller from moving the vehicle from the second position.

The speed of the propeller can be set or adjusted by the control unit based on the result of the diagnostic program <b>138</b>, the result can be an operation condition, such as, an exit condition, a wait condition, a low power state, a cooling state, or a high performance state, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The speed of the propeller can be set or adjusted based on a current position of the vehicle on the tank map. For example, the control unit can increase the speed of the propeller to move from the first position, decrease the speed of the propeller prior to reaching the second position, and disable the propeller based on the vehicle reaching the second position. The control unit can configure the propeller to move the vehicle in a different direction (e.g. reverse or sideways) based on the vehicle straying from the second position.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">At step <b>522</b>, the vehicle can determine a quality metric for at least one portion of the tank corresponding to the second position on the tank map via the inspection device. The inspection device can include a magnetic sensor, a magnetic sensor array, an ultrasonic array system, an ultrasonic phased array system, or a sweeping device. The sweeping device can include a brush for sweeping one or more substance off at least one portion of the tank. The quality metric can indicate a thickness of the portion of the tank at the second position within the tank. The vehicle can determine, based on the quality metric of the portion of the tank, to determine an additional quality metric for the portion of the tank, the additional quality metric can be determined using at least one different component of the inspection device. For example, the vehicle can determine a quality metric corresponding to the second position using the magnetic sensor of the inspection device, determine the quality of the information from the inspection device, and determine an additional quality metric corresponding to the second position using the ultrasonic array system based on obtaining a low quality information of the quality metric.

The command can include, for example, enabling or disabling the inspection device, moving the inspection device to a different portion of the tank corresponding to the first position, or changing the inspection device type. The inspection device type can change, for example, from one or more magnetic conductors to ultrasonic array or phased array system or vice versa. The ranging device can receive a command, based on the tank inspection process prior to the inspection device receiving the inspection command, to generate the tank map based on a plurality of acoustic waves reflected off one or more portions of the tank.

The change of magnetic field can include magnitude, intensity, direction, duration, decay time, or frequency to increase or decrease the magnitude or intensity of electric current based on the inspection process. The inspection device can generate at least one pulsed eddy current for measuring thickness or detecting corrosion. The pulsed eddy currents can contain a continuum of frequencies, which can be used to measure electromagnetic response to various frequencies can using a single step. The magnetic field, created by an electric current from the inspection device, can penetrate through the one or more layers or constructions of the tank and stabilize in the layer of the tank.

A pulsed eddy current array can refer to a nondestructive testing technology that can provide the ability to drive multiple eddy currents coils, which can be placed side by side in the inspection device.
