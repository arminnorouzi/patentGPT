Although the application will be described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the application to the described embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover changes, modifications and equivalents within the spirit and scope of this application and defined by the appended claims. It should be noted that the methods and steps described herein may be implemented by any functional block or functional arrangement, and any functional block or functional arrangement may be implemented as a physical entity or a logical entity, or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the integrated circuit is operating, due to the influence of aging, temperature and power supply voltage, the time delay of internal paths of the integrated circuit may fluctuate, which may cause the time delay of some critical paths in the integrated circuit to exceed a clock cycle, resulting in errors in the operation of the integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, it is necessary to accurately measure the time delay of some critical paths in integrated circuits.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In traditional technologies, a time-to-digital conversion circuit may be used to measure a critical path time delay to judge a state of an integrated circuit, such as whether it is in a state of excessive aging, insufficient power supply voltage, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The time-to-digital conversion circuit is also widely used to measure a time interval between two signals in the fields of ultrasonic flowmeter, high-energy physics and nuclear physics, various handheld/airborne or fixed working high-accuracy laser rangefinders, a laser radar, a laser scanner, etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Usually, the critical path time delay to be measured by the time-to-digital conversion circuit or the time interval between the two signals is several ns or even hundreds ps. During the measurement, the critical path time delay or the time interval between the two signals are firstly converted as one pulse signal, and width of the pulse signal is the critical path time delay or the time interval between the two signals. The time-to-digital conversion circuit generally uses a number of to-be-measured signals passing through a logic gate circuit to carry out the measurement, whose accuracy depends on the time delay of a single logic gate circuit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, in the prior art, the designed structure is complex, and the accuracy depends on the time delay of the buffer, which leads to the problem of insufficient accuracy. At the same time, the time delay of the buffer may change due to the influence of aging, resulting in inaccurate measurement. It takes a long time to measure the path time delay, so normal working of the critical path is affected. Part of the design adopts an analog circuit, which is complicated to design and difficult to realize in the advanced manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the scheme of the application, the measurement accuracy of the pulse width is further improved through an adjustment scheme of the path time delay, and the accuracy can reach 25% of the time delay of a single buffer; further, by converting the measurement structure into a ring oscillator, the influence of errors caused by aging, wiring and other factors on the measurement accuracy of the application are reduced; the application can complete the measurement of the critical path time delay in only 4 clock cycles at the fastest, causing little influence on the critical path; and moreover, the application may be implemented with a pure digital circuit, which is convenient and easy to integrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an overall block diagram of a time-to-digital conversion circuit <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the time-to-digital conversion circuit <b>100</b> designed in this application mainly comprises three parts: a pulse signal conversion apparatus <b>101</b>, a pulse signal width measuring apparatus <b>102</b> and a control device <b>103</b>. The pulse conversion apparatus <b>101</b> mainly converts a to-be-measured object (for example, a critical path time delay or a to-be-measured time interval between two signals) into one pulse signal, and width of the pulse signal is a value of the to-be-measured object (i.e., the time interval). The pulse signal width measuring apparatus is used to measure the width of the pulse signal output by the pulse signal conversion apparatus <b>101</b>. The control device is used to control operation of the pulse signal conversion apparatus <b>101</b> and the pulse signal width measurement apparatus.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a diagram of a circuit and a waveform for converting the critical path time delay into the pulse signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A same signal passing through two paths (one path has the critical path time delay, the other path has no time delay) is used and then input into a XOR gate to obtain the pulse signal with the critical path time delay as the width of its high level.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Specifically, generally, a starting point of the path is, for example, an output signal of one flip-flop, and the output of the flip-flop obtained after passing through the critical path and the output of the flip-flop after directly passing through a wire (i.e., which is still the input signal to the critical path) are input into one XOR gate with two ports at the same time. Since the critical path has a time delay, there is a time delay difference between the two signals arriving at the XOR gate. According to the characteristics of the XOR gate, when the two input signals are different (for example, the output obtained after the high-level output of the flip-flop passes through the critical path is still at low-level (because the high-level output has not passed the critical path at this time), and the direct output obtained by the output of the flip-flop directly passing through the wire is at high-level), the output of the XOR gate is at high-level; otherwise, when both input signals are high-level (i.e., the output obtained by the high level output of the flip-flop passing through the critical path is at high-level, and the direct output of the flip-flop is still at high-level), or low-level (for example, no signal is input), the output of the XOR gate is at low-level.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a diagram of the waveform for converting the critical path time delay into the pulse signal. By configuring the flip-flop at the starting point of the critical path, the input of the critical path is one rising edge signal, and the output of the critical path is one rising edge signal which is delayed by the critical path time delay. After the two signals pass through the XOR gate, one pulse signal with the width of the high level as the critical path time delay can be output. That is, the pulse signal is the output of the XOR gate obtain by taking the signal obtained by the signal at the starting point of the critical path of the integrated circuit passing through the critical path and the signal at the starting point as two inputs of the XOR gate.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Here, using the XOR gate to obtain the above-mentioned specific output is only an example, and other circuits that can obtain the above-mentioned specific output after receiving the above-mentioned two inputs are also included in this disclosure, and will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to the above-mentioned method of measuring the critical path time delay to obtain the pulse signal with the width of of its high level as the critical path time delay, the above-mentioned method can also be used for the measurement of the time delay difference between the rising edges of two to-be-measured signals, by measuring the width of the converted pulse signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a diagram of a circuit and a waveform for converting the time delay difference of the two rising signals into a pulse signal.

Meanwhile, if the first AND gate <b>4012</b> used for signal propagation control is to output a high-level signal, it is required that coincidence duration of the high levels of the two input signals should exceed one minimum threshold duration, which leads to possible errors in the measurement using the above method, wherein the error includes the above minimum threshold duration.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to eliminate the error caused by the wiring and the first AND gate <b>4012</b> used for signal propagation control, it is possible to measure the clock signal with a known width before the actual measurement, and a difference between the measurement result and the known width of the clock signal is the above error.

Then, the pulse signal width measuring apparatus is converted into the ring oscillator by controlling the multiplexer by the control device, and the counter and timer are used to accurately measure the width of the to-be-measured clock pulse signal, which is then compared with the known pulse width value of the clock signal to obtain the measurement error of this structure.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The signal of the to-be-measured critical path or the signal of the two to-be-measured time intervals is converted into the to-be-measured pulse signal by using a pulse conversion apparatus, and is input to the pulse signal width measuring apparatus for measurement, and the actual high-accuracy and error-removed measurement result is obtained by removing the error from the measurement result.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Each embodiment of the application adopts the path time delay adjustment circuit, which greatly improves the measurement accuracy; the measurement structure is converted into the ring oscillator for more accurate measurement, which reduces the influence of process deviation, aging, wiring and other factors on the accuracy of the measurement structure; the signal latch circuit is used to generate the clock signal of the flip-flop to avoid the metastable phenomenon of the flip-flop; the measurement accuracy is high, and the measurement random error is less than 1 ps under the process of 12 nm; compared with the method of using the digital-to-analog conversion circuit, resistor and capacitor, this structure uses a pure digital structure (such as the multiplexer, logic circuit and latch structure, etc.), which can be realized by using devices in a standard apparatus library, and the pure digital structure can be directly synthesized, which is very friendly to the design process of integrated circuit; this structure is anti-aging, and even if the time delay of the circuit increases due to aging, the measurement accuracy is less affected; this structure only needs a small area overhead, which has little influence on the design of the original integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary computer system suitable for implementing embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The computer system may comprise a processor (H<b>1</b>); a memory (H<b>2</b>) coupled to the processor (H<b>1</b>) and storing therein computer executable instructions for implementing the steps of each method of the embodiments of the present application when executed by the processor.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The processor (H<b>1</b>) may comprise, but is not limited to, one or more processors or microprocessors, for example.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The memory (H<b>2</b>) may comprise, but is not limited to, a Random Access Memory (RAM), a Read Only Memory (ROM), a flash memory, an EPROM memory, an EEPROM memory, a register, a computer storage medium (such as a hard disk, a floppy disk, a solid state disc, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a Blu-ray disc, etc.).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Besides, the computer system may also comprise a data bus (H<b>3</b>), an input/output (I/O) bus (H<b>4</b>), a display (H<b>5</b>), and an input/output device (H<b>6</b>) (e.g., keyboard, mouse, speaker, etc.) and so on.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The processor (H<b>1</b>) can communicate with external devices (H<b>5</b>, H<b>6</b>, etc.) via a wired or wireless network (not shown) through the I/O bus (H<b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The memory (H<b>2</b>) may also store at least one computer executable instruction for implementing the steps of various functions and/or methods in the embodiments described in this technology when executed by the processor (H<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one embodiment, the at least one computer-executable instruction may also be compiled into or constitute a software product, wherein one or more computer-executable instructions, when executed by the processor, implement the steps of various functions and/or methods in the embodiments described in this technology.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a non-transitory computer readable storage medium according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the computer-readable storage medium <b>1220</b> stores instructions, such as computer-readable instructions <b>1210</b>.
