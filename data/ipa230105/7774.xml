Under most current GDDR implementations there is no way to replace or upgrade the memory. For example, in the case of the memory soldered down to a printed circuit board (PCB) such as on a graphics or accelerator card, the graphics memory cannot be replaced in the event of a memory issue (e.g., failure) or to increase the amount of memory. Rather, this would require replacing the entire card including the GPU, which can be expensive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another approach is to use GDDR memory on an SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module). This enables graphics memory to be replaced, but has limited bandwidth and reliability.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views unless otherwise specified:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a diagram showing a cross-section view of an assembly including a CMT GDDR module coupled to a graphics card via a CMT connector, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a diagram showing a cross-section view illustrating further details of the CMT GDDR module, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a CMT connector, according to one embodiment</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a close-up view of the top of the spring contact structure used for the CMT pins;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a spring contact used for the CMT pins, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a graphics card including a GPU coupled to a pair of CMT GDDR modules via respective CMT connectors;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing a cross-section view of an assembly comprising stacked CMT GDDR modules with on module CMT connectors, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a cross-section view showing further details of an CMT GDDR module with an on module CMT connector illustrating signal paths connected to pins in the on module CMT connector;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>is a cross-section view showing further details of an CMT GDDR module with an on module CMT connector illustrating signal paths connecting pins of pads on GDDR memory devices to pads arrayed on the underside of the CMT GDDR module;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>is a cross-section view of a CMT GDDR module that may be used at the top of the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing a cross-section view of an alternative configuration of the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, where the top CMT GDDR module does not include an on module CMT connector, according to one embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of methods and apparatus for GDDR memory expander using compression mount technology (CMT) connectors are described herein.

For example, in one embodiment, a pin <b>422</b> includes a tube that extends below the connector body with a spring contact <b>424</b> inserted into a top portion of the tube. In another embodiment, pins <b>422</b> are a single piece with an integrated spring contact (or otherwise have a spring-type characteristic to enable the top of the pins to be compressed).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">There are two arrays of CMT contact pads <b>460</b> and <b>462</b> formed on the underside of substrate <b>452</b>. CMT contact pads in array <b>462</b> are connected to pins <b>422</b> via signal paths <b>426</b> formed in substrate <b>452</b>. For simplicity, these paths are shown as two-dimensional (2D) paths. In practice, some of the paths may employ 3D routing. As will be recognized by those skilled in the PCB arts, 3D routing may employ a combination of internal vias that are connected via 2D path segments in different layers of substrate <b>452</b> (e.g., different layers of a PCB).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>shows 2D signal paths <b>464</b> that are coupled between pins or pads on GDDR devices <b>414</b> and CMT contact pads in array <b>460</b>. As above, in practice signal paths <b>464</b> may employ 3D routing. It will also be recognized that the number of signal paths illustrated in the Figures herein are less than what would be used in an actual implementation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an alternative embodiment of an assembly <b>500</b>, wherein CMT GDDR module <b>408</b> with on module CMT connector <b>402</b> has been replaced by a CMT GDDR module <b>408</b><i>a </i>that does not include an on module CMT connector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>, the configuration and structure of CMT GDDR module <b>408</b><i>a </i>is similar to CMT GDDR module <b>408</b>, except CMT GDDR module <b>408</b><i>a </i>does not include signal paths <b>426</b> nor vias that would be connected to pins <b>422</b> via solder balls <b>458</b>. Also, for a CMT GDDR module occupying the top of the stacked structure, GDDR memory devices <b>414</b> may be arranged different relative to their configuration for a CMT GDDR module in the middle of the stack and/or include additional GDDR memory devices <b>414</b>. In embodiments where the top CMT GDDR module includes additional GDDR memory devices, the number of signal paths and CMT contact pads in both the top CMT GDDR module and the other components beneath is (including on module CMT connectors and CMT GDDR modules) would increase appropriately.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be recognized that under some embodiments, all pins in a CMT connector and associated CMT contact pads may not be used for carrying any signals or otherwise couple supply voltages or ground. This will enable use of off-the-shelf CMT connectors that may be available from different manufacturers, such as but not limited to Amphenol&#xae;. Of course, custom CMT connectors may also be used.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Generally, in addition to CPUs, the teaching and principles disclosed herein may be applied to Other Processing Units (collectively termed XPUs) including one or more of Graphic Processor Units (GPUs) or General Purpose GPUs (GP-GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Data Processing Units (DPUs), Infrastructure Processing Units (IPUs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) processors or AI inference units and/or other accelerators, FPGAs and/or other programmable logic (used for compute purposes), etc. While some of the diagrams herein show the use of GPUs, this is merely exemplary and non-limiting.
