Asthma is generally manifested by (i) bronchoconstriction, (ii) excessive mucus production, and/or (iii) inflammation and swelling of airways that cause widespread but variable airflow obstructions. Asthma can be a chronic disorder often characterized by persistent airway inflammation, but asthma can be further characterized by acute episodes of additional airway narrowing via contraction of hyper-responsive airway smooth muscle tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional pharmacological approaches for managing asthma include: (i) administering anti-inflammatories and long-acting bronchodilators for long-term control, and/or (ii) administering short-acting bronchodilators for management of acute episodes. Both of these pharmacological approaches generally require repeated use of the prescribed drugs at regular intervals throughout long periods of time. However, high doses of corticosteroid anti-inflammatory drugs can have serious side effects that require careful management, and some patients are resistant to steroid treatment even at high doses. As such, effective patient compliance with pharmacologic management and avoiding stimulus that triggers asthma are common barriers to successfully managing asthma.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Asthmatx, Inc. has developed new asthma treatments that involve applying energy to alter properties of the smooth muscle tissue or other tissue (e.g., nerves, mucus glands, epithelium, blood vessels, etc.) of airways in a lung of a patient. Several embodiments of methods and apparatus related to such treatments are disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,411,852, 6,634,363, and 7,027,869; and U.S. Published Application No. US2005/0010270, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many embodiments of the foregoing asthma treatments that apply energy to tissue of the airways use catheters that can be passed (e.g., navigated) through the tortuous pathways defined by the lung airways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, illustrates a bronchial tree <b>90</b> in which the various bronchioles <b>92</b> decrease in size and have many branches <b>96</b> as they extend from the right and left bronchi <b>94</b>. Accordingly, the treatment devices should be configured to treat airways of varying sizes as well as function properly when repeatedly deployed after navigating through the tortuous anatomy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a typical application, a first medical practitioner (e.g., a bronchoscopist) navigates a distal portion of a bronchoscope through the tortuous pathways of the lung until the distal tip of the bronchoscope is at a desired region of an airway. A second medical practitioner (e.g., a nurse or medical assistant) in addition to the first practitioner assists in advancing a catheter of a treatment device through a working lumen of the bronchoscope until a distal portion of the catheter projects out from the distal end of the bronchoscope. After positioning the distal portion of the catheter at a desired first airway site, the first or second practitioner uses one hand to hold the catheter in place relative to the bronchoscope while the second practitioner moves the thumb of one or the other free hand to move a slide-type actuator in a distal) direction to drive an electrode array distally out of the catheter. The second practitioner continues to move the slide-type actuator in the distal direction to drive a plurality of electrodes outwardly until the electrodes contact the sidewall of the airway at a first contact site. The first or second medical practitioner then operates a switch that activates an energy source to deliver energy to the first contact site for a treatment period.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">After terminating the energy delivery, (i) the second practitioner slides the actuator in a proximal direction to contract the electrodes, (ii) the first or second practitioner repositions the catheter axially along the bronchoscope and the airway to a second contact site, and (iii) with the catheter held in place, the second practitioner slides the actuator distally to re-expand the electrodes until they contact the sidewall of the airway at the second contact site. The first or second practitioner then activates the energy supply to deliver energy to the second contact site for another treatment period. This process is repeated several times at 3-30 mm increments throughout several regions of the variable sized airways in a lung of a patient. As such, this process requires good coordination and communication between the first and second practitioners to treat a patient, but even then such communication takes time. A typical treatment protocol for treating the full lung of a patient can accordingly require three 30-60 minute sessions, which often results in practitioner fatigue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The tortuous configuration of the lung airways also presents other challenges to efficiently delivering energy to the airway tissue. For example, the treatment device should be sufficiently flexible to follow the working lumen of a bronchoscope and help facilitate accurate steering of the bronchoscope, and the treatment device should enable accurate, reliable deployment of the electrodes at the distal end of the catheter. Friction losses along the catheter, however, can restrict expansion/contraction of the electrodes because only a portion of the force from the actuator is transmitted to the electrode array. This can inhibit the electrodes from appropriately (e.g., fully) contacting the sidewall of the airway, which may reduce the efficacy of the treatment. Additionally, friction along the catheter increases the load on the thumb of the second practitioner as the slide-type actuator is repeatedly moved, which may cause fatigue and also may make it difficult to sense when the electrodes engage the variable sized airways.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following drawings should be read with reference to the detailed description.

Although many of the embodiments are described below with respect to delivering radio frequency energy to airways in a lung of a patient to treat asthma, other embodiments that deliver other energy modalities to lung airways or other types of passageways for treating other indications may be within the scope of the invention. For example, other types of energy modalities can include thermal (resistive and/or infrared), microwave, laser, ultrasonic (e.g., HIFU), cryo-ablation, radiation, and/or other energy modalities. Moreover, several other embodiments of the invention can have different configurations, components, or procedures than those described in this section. A person of ordinary skill in the art, therefore, will accordingly understand that the invention may have other embodiments with additional elements, or the invention may have other embodiments without several of the features shown and described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>.

The embodiment of the energy delivery device <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> includes an elongated body <b>130</b> with a distal portion <b>132</b> and a proximal portion <b>134</b>, an energy delivery unit <b>140</b> at the distal portion <b>132</b>, and a handle <b>150</b> at the proximal portion <b>134</b>. The length of the elongated body <b>130</b> should be sufficient to access the target tissue in airways of the lung or other passageways targeted for treatment. For example, the length of the elongated body <b>130</b> can be from approximately 0.5-8 feet to allow passage though a bronchoscope and reach targeted airways deep within the lungs. The elongated body <b>130</b> can also be configured to treat airways as small as 3 mm in diameter, but the elongated body <b>130</b> is not limited to treating airways of any particular size such that airways smaller or larger than 3 mm may be treated. Typically, the delivery unit <b>140</b> expands/contracts to variable sizes to treat airways between 3-10 mm.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Several embodiments of the elongated body <b>130</b> are flexible catheters configured to slide through the working lumen of an access device (e.g., bronchoscope). The elongated body <b>130</b> can also include a plurality of markers <b>136</b> at the distal section <b>132</b> to position the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> relative to an access device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and a proximal marker(s) <b>127</b> so as to assist in expedient positioning of the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> out of the distal end of the access device. Specific embodiments of elongated bodies with markers suitable for use in the system <b>100</b> are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, and in U.S. patent application Ser.

The electrodes <b>142</b> can move inwardly (arrows I) by releasing the wire <b>146</b> such that a spring or other resilient element in the handle <b>150</b>, and/or the spring force of the electrodes <b>142</b>, drives the wire <b>146</b> distally. The outward/inward movement of the electrodes <b>142</b> is useful when the device is operated intralumenally or in airways in the lungs because the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> can be advanced through a working lumen <b>181</b> of an access device <b>180</b> while the electrodes <b>142</b> are in a low-profile configuration, and then the electrodes <b>142</b> can repeatedly be moved outwardly according to the varying sizes of the passageways. In this illustration, the pull wire <b>146</b> may also comprise a conductive wire between the electrodes <b>142</b> and the energy supply <b>111</b>.

A thermocouple <b>137</b> having thermocouple leads <b>139</b> is attached and in electrical communication to the active portion <b>145</b> of the electrode <b>142</b> at separate joints <b>141</b>. The circuit may be triggered (e.g., open circuit) if either joint becomes detached so that the thermocouple <b>137</b> stops reading temperature.

The same operator can also operate the switch <b>116</b> of the power/control unit <b>110</b> such that the entire procedure can be performed by a single person.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the handle <b>150</b> has a first portion <b>151</b> and a second portion <b>152</b> rotatably coupled to the first portion <b>151</b> by a joint <b>153</b>. The first portion <b>151</b> and/or the second portion <b>152</b> are one example of an actuator for manipulating the electrodes <b>142</b>. The first and second portions <b>151</b>-<b>152</b> can be configured to form a grip <b>154</b> and a head <b>156</b> located at an upper portion of the grip <b>154</b>. The head <b>156</b>, for example, can project outwardly from the grip such that a portion of the grip <b>154</b> is narrower than the head <b>156</b>. In the specific embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the first portion <b>151</b> has a first curved surface <b>161</b> with a first neck portion <b>163</b> and a first collar portion <b>165</b>, and the second portion <b>152</b> has a second curved surface <b>162</b> with a second neck portion <b>164</b> and a second collar portion <b>166</b>. The first and second curved surfaces <b>161</b>-<b>162</b> can be configured such that they are arranged to define a hyperbolic-like shaped grip when viewed from a side elevation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The portion of the handle <b>150</b> at the first and second neck portions <b>163</b>-<b>164</b> provides a neck around which the thumb and forefinger of an operator can extend, and the first and second collar portions <b>165</b>-<b>166</b> are configured to be supported by the thumb and forefinger of the operator. The handle <b>150</b> can also include a torsion spring (not shown) at the joint <b>153</b>, or another suitable resilient element, to drive the lower ends of the first and second portions <b>151</b>-<b>152</b> apart from each other. In addition, the spring torsion may be selected to provide a difference in sensation between handle actuation in air as opposed to a counter force of the airway wall (e.g., a less robust spring). In operation, a single user moves the lower ends of the first and second portions <b>151</b>-<b>152</b> together (arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) while simultaneously controlling the position of the elongated body <b>130</b> in the airway of the patient with a single hand as explained in more detail below. After applying energy to the tissue for a treatment period, the operator relaxes his/her grip and the torsion spring drives the lower ends of the first and second portions <b>151</b>-<b>152</b> apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating further details of an embodiment of the handle <b>150</b> with a section of the first portion <b>151</b> removed.

As described above, dimensions of the gripping necks <b>163</b>-<b>164</b> are provided such that the gripping neck <b>154</b> volume frees up two or three fingers (e.g., thumb and forefinger) of the single operator's hand to manipulate (e.g., advance, repeatedly position, hold in place relative to the bronchoscope seal) the elongated body <b>130</b> at the desired target sites within passageways of the patient. The first and second neck portions <b>163</b>-<b>164</b> may have a combined width (denoted by arrows <b>149</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) in a range from about 0.95 inches to about 1.3 inches. The first (or second) neck portion depth <b>163</b> a (denoted by arrows <b>148</b>) may be in a range from about 0.75 inches to about 1.0 inch. The grip portions are narrower than the head <b>156</b>, which is dimensioned (denoted by arrows <b>155</b>) in a range from about 1.3 inches to about 1.75 inches, so as to allow the head <b>156</b> to be easily cradled by the operator's thumb and forefinger. In this view, an opening <b>157</b> in the first portion <b>151</b> can be seen for connection of the handle <b>150</b> to the conductive line <b>117</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>3</b>C</figref> also illustrate an example of operating the system <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>A</figref> together, the handle <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is in a first position in which the electrodes <b>142</b> are in a low-profile configuration. In this configuration, an operator advances the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> and the elongated body <b>130</b> through the working lumen <b>181</b> of the access device <b>180</b> until the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> projects beyond a distal end <b>182</b> of the access device <b>180</b>. Visualization of this may be facilitated by an imaging lumen <b>128</b> and/or light optical fiber lumens <b>129</b> of the access device <b>180</b> (or optical chip(s) or fiber(s) mounted at the distal end of the access device). As described in U.S. Published Application No. 2007/0106292, the operator can control the position of the energy delivery unit <b>140</b> relative to the access device <b>180</b> using the markers <b>136</b> on the elongated body <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the operator squeezes the handle <b>150</b> (arrow R) to move the second portion <b>152</b> about the joint <b>153</b>, which causes the flange <b>170</b> to rotate the lever <b>172</b> in a manner that pulls the wire <b>146</b> proximally. The proximal movement of the wire <b>146</b> pulls the distal retainer <b>144</b> b proximally and accordingly moves the electrodes <b>142</b> outwardly (arrows O in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The operator can control the elongated body <b>130</b> and rotate the second portion <b>152</b> relative to the first portion <b>151</b> with a single hand while simultaneously holding the access device <b>180</b> in the other hand and/or the same hand. The operator then actuates the switch <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) that activates the energy generator <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) to deliver energy via the electrodes <b>142</b> to the tissue of the airway until the controller <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) or the operator deactivates the energy generator. The operator then releases the second portion <b>152</b> of the handle to release the tension on the wire <b>146</b> so that the electrodes <b>142</b> move inwardly (arrows I). The operator can then move the elongated body <b>130</b> axially while holding the access device <b>180</b> to reposition the energy delivery unit by an increment indicated by the markers <b>136</b> and repeat the procedure at another site of the airway.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an isometric view illustrating an embodiment of how an operator can hold and control both the elongated body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>150</b> with a single hand to concurrently move the electrodes <b>142</b> outwardly and/or inwardly. More specifically, the hand <b>400</b> of the operator can hold the grip <b>154</b> such that the thumb <b>401</b> and the forefinger <b>402</b> (i.e., first finger) extend around the neck portion of the grip <b>154</b>. The outward projection of the head <b>156</b> of the handle <b>150</b> can be configured to rest on a portion of the thumb <b>401</b> and forefinger <b>402</b> to further control the handle <b>150</b>. Further, a reinforcing sheath <b>158</b> along the elongated body <b>130</b> combined with the reversible handle <b>150</b> may direct the most proximal portion <b>134</b> away from the hand <b>400</b> of the operator so as to enhance single hand control at the bronchoscope seal and single operator control of both the treatment and access devices. In this application, the operator can concurrently grip the elongated body <b>130</b> with the distal phalanxes of the thumb <b>401</b> and forefinger <b>402</b> in a manner that enables the operator to hold the elongated body <b>130</b> at a precise location. The operator can also squeeze/release the handle <b>150</b> with at least one of a second-fourth (e.g., second, third, or fourth) finger of the hand <b>400</b> to move the electrodes outwardly/inwardly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method <b>500</b> for treating tissue in an internal passageway of a patient in accordance with one embodiment.

The method <b>500</b> further includes advancing an elongated body of a treatment device, such as an embodiment of the energy delivery devices described above, along the access device (block <b>520</b>). The elongated body is advanced along the access device until an energy delivery unit at a distal portion of the elongated body projects from the access device and is positioned at a desired treatment site. The method <b>500</b> further includes expanding the energy delivery unit such that electrodes or other energy delivery elements contact a sidewall of the airway while the elongated body is held in place (block <b>530</b>), and activating an energy supply coupled to the treatment device such that energy is delivered to the sidewall of the airway (block <b>540</b>).

The method <b>600</b> also includes moving an actuator of the treatment device while holding the energy delivery unit in place using the second hand of the operator (block <b>630</b>) such that at least a portion of the energy delivery unit contacts a sidewall of the airway and delivers energy to the airway while the operator's first hand holds the access device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>700</b> for treating an internal airway in a lung of a patient in accordance with another embodiment. The method <b>700</b> includes controlling a bronchoscope with a first hand of a single operator to position a distal end of a bronchoscope in a lung airway of the patient (block <b>710</b>). The method <b>700</b> further includes moving a treatment device with a second hand of the single person to slide a flexible catheter through a working lumen of the bronchoscope (block <b>720</b>). The single person, for example, moves the treatment device until the electrode assembly of the treatment device projects beyond the distal end of the bronchoscope at a first treatment site in the lung airway. The method <b>700</b> further includes squeezing an actuator of the treatment device with a second hand of the single person while holding the catheter and the bronchoscope with at least one of the first and second hands of the single person (block <b>730</b>). The actuator causes electrodes of the electrode assembly to move outwardly to contact the airway. The method <b>700</b> can further include applying energy to the target site via the electrodes while the single person holds the bronchoscope and the treatment device (block <b>740</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Several embodiments of the system <b>100</b> provide an ergonomic and efficient treatment device. The handle <b>150</b>, for example, reduces thumb-fatigue associated with other devices because the handle <b>150</b> is actuated with a squeezing motion using larger muscles instead of a sliding motion using primarily muscles associated with the thumb. The system <b>100</b> can also be operated by a single person such that it eliminates delays that can occur in systems that require both a first practitioner and a second practitioner to operate the access device and the treatment device. Several embodiments of the system <b>100</b> may accordingly treat more patients in a fixed time period, treat patients with reduced treatment time or sessions, and/or treat more passageways within a patient in a single session. Further, a single operator procedure ensures greater accuracy of treatment device placements, and hence treatment patterns.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrate a specific embodiment of the elongated body <b>130</b>.

The coil <b>810</b> can be a flexible winding of a suitable metal or polymer that can be pushed/pulled in a longitudinal direction, transmit torsional forces, and prevent kinking or collapse of the lumen <b>812</b>. The casing <b>820</b> can be a coating or thicker cover that is also flexible and configured to have an outer diameter &#x201c;OD&#x201d; in a range from about 0.75 mm to about 1.6 mm to enable suction and fluid irrigation through a 2 mm working lumen of the access device without catheter removal. The casing <b>820</b> can be made from pebax, nylon, grilimide, or other polymeric materials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The lumen <b>812</b> of the coil <b>810</b> provides a large space &#x201c;S&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>) through which the wire <b>146</b> and one or more thermocouple leads <b>830</b> can extend. The large space S between the wire <b>146</b> and the coil <b>810</b> reduces friction between the wire <b>146</b> and the elongated body <b>130</b> such that the wire <b>146</b> can readily move longitudinally within the coil <b>810</b>. This allows the wire <b>146</b> to move proximally/distally to move the electrodes <b>142</b> outwardly/inwardly along a significant portion of the stroke/trigger length of the actuator of the handle, which may be in a range from about 5 mm to about 40 mm. As a result, the electrodes may be more easily deployed compared to catheters with higher friction between the wire <b>146</b> and the elongated body <b>130</b>. The tactile feedback to the operator is also enhanced with less friction, the trigger handle design, and/or torsional spring such that it is easier for an operator to determine when the electrodes <b>142</b> sufficiently contact an airway. The outer diameter OD of the casing <b>820</b> can also be relatively small because the elongated body <b>130</b> does not include a slideable sheath around an extrusion. Consequently, the elongated body <b>130</b> occupies less space in the working lumen of a bronchoscope such that fluids can be extracted/injected into the passageway through the working lumen. For example, a solution or gas can be injected into an airway through the working lumen of a bronchoscope with the elongated body in the working lumen, and alternatively mucus and other matter can be suctioned from the airways via the working lumen of the bronchoscope with the elongated body in the working lumen.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the inventions.
