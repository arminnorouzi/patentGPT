Overview</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Light and electromagnetic waves can be used in a number of ways to help amplify and interact with a number of substances. These interactions may impart unexpected results in the medium through which the light may pass, including human tissues and digestible liquids (e.g., water). To date, there have not been any consistent, convenient, and/or portable options for practitioners incorporating such light waves (including lasers) and/or electromagnetic waves into their practice for treating human conditions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Conventionally, utilizing such light waves (including lasers) and/or electromagnetic waves has required large scale systems, which may vary from practitioner to practitioner, and may cause different treatment results from patient to patient.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">If, however, practitioners could provide an efficient, effective, and novel solution for consistent, convenient, and/or portable options for practitioners incorporating such light waves (including lasers) and/or electromagnetic waves into their practice for treating human conditions, then the overall variability associated with these treatments would be reduced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, features of the present disclosure can help to address these and other issues to provide an improvement to select technical fields. More specifically, features of the present disclosure help address issues within and provide improvements for select technical fields, which include for example, handheld devices that include passing a light source through an enclosed chamber containing one or more substances and surrounded by an electromagnetic coil, such that an output of the light source is substantially aligned to pass through the enclosed chamber in one or more directions and an electromagnetic field is created in a substantially same direction of the output of the light source through the enclosed chamber. These features will now be described in the claims below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems, and devices that allow practitioners to effectively use light waves (including lasers) and/or electromagnetic waves into their practice for a number of reasons, including treating human physical and mental health conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">More specifically, example embodiments relate to methods, systems, and devices for improving the consistency, ease, and performance treatments using light waves (including lasers) and/or electromagnetic waves.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A handheld device for providing a spectrochrome output may include an enclosed chamber containing one or more substances. In some example embodiments, these substances may include one or more substances that are in a solid, gaseous, or liquid phase, or some combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the enclosed chamber may contain one or more noble gases, including one or more of the following gases: (i) helium; (ii) neon; (iii) argon; (iv) krypton; (v) xenon; and (vi) radon. In other examples, the enclosed chamber may contain one or more of the following non-noble gases: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, potentially in combination with other substances (including the noble gases listed above). In a further aspect, the enclosed chamber may also contain one or more solid and/or liquid materials (including solid and/or liquid versions of the substances listed above), among other possibilities.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further aspect, the handheld device for providing a spectrochrome output may also include a light source. This light source may include one or more of several different types of light from a variety of sources. For example, in some embodiments, the light source may be a laser. In a further aspect, the laser may operate at one or more wavelengths and create a visible output of one or more colors, including one or more of the following: (i) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 520 to 560 nanometers and a visible output of green light; (ii) a laser with a wavelength of approximately 380 to 450 nanometers and a visible output of violet light; (iii) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 450 to 495 nanometers and a visible output of blue light; (iv) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 495 to 520 nanometers and a visible output of cyan light; (v) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 560 to 590 nanometers and a visible output of yellow light; (vi) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 590 to 620 nanometers and a visible output of orange light; and (vii) a laser with a wavelength between approximately 620 to 740 nanometers and a visible output of red light. Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other examples, the light source may include light generated by one or more other light sources, including one or more of the following: (i) a fluorescent light source; (ii) light-emitting diode light source; (iii) halogen light source; (iv) a filament light source; and (v) reflector and/or refractor directing light from external light sources (e.g., the sun).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect, the handheld device for providing a spectrochrome output may also include an electromagnetic coil. This electromagnetic coil may be made of and/or include one or more of several different materials and arranged in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the electromagnetic coil may be made of one or more of the following: (i) copper wire; (ii) silver wire; (iii) gold wire; (iv) aluminum wire; (v) iron wire, and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further aspect, the electromagnetic coil may be arranged in a variety of ways, including wrapping the electromagnetic coil around the enclosed chamber or a receiving portion of the handheld device that holds the enclosed chamber, either of which may be configured in a manner that may create a field substantially in the center of the coil and the enclosed chamber. For example, the electromagnetic coil may be a continuous strand of wire wrapped uniformly around the enclosed chamber a receiving portion of the handheld device that holds the enclosed chamber such that the electromagnetic field created by the electromagnetic coil is focused on an area in the enclosed chamber. To do so, the handheld device may also contain one or more magnets. In some examples, these magnets may include one or more of the following: (i) neodymium magnets (including neodymium iron boron (&#x201c;NdFeB&#x201d;) magnets); (ii) ceramic magnets; (iii) ferrite magnets; (iv) samarium cobalt (&#x201c;SmCo&#x201d;) magnets; and (v) alnico magnets. Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further aspect, in other examples, the electromagnetic coil may be a continuous strand of wire wrapped uniformly around the enclosed chamber such that a magnetic field created by the electromagnetic coil is focused on an area in the enclosed chamber. In some examples, an electrical current may be applied to the electromagnetic coil to create a magnetic field. To create this field, one or more electrical currents may be applied to the electromagnetic coil using one or more sources (e.g., one or more batteries). Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further aspect, the handheld device for providing a spectrochrome output may also include a housing that may be made of one or more materials and be configured to promote one or more functionalities of the handheld device. In some examples, this housing may be made of and/or include one or more of several different materials, including plastics, rubbers, metals, glass, and/or combinations thereof, as well as other materials. Furthermore, this housing may be arranged in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the housing may be configured to secure the enclosed chamber that holds the enclosed chamber (e.g., via a receiving portion of the housing), perhaps in one or more directions in relation to other components of the handheld device. For example, the housing may be configured to secure the light source such that an output of the light source is substantially aligned to pass through the enclosed chamber in one or more directions. In other examples, the housing may be configured to secure the electromagnetic coil and the one or more magnets around the enclosed chamber such that an magnetic field is created in a substantially same direction of the output of the light source through the enclosed chamber.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further aspect, the housing may have one or more recesses to align the electromagnetic coil and the one or more magnets around the enclosed chamber such that the magnetic field is created in a substantially same axial direction of the output of the light source through the enclosed chamber. In other examples, the housing may have one or more recesses to hold one or more other more specific components of the handheld device (e.g., one or more recesses to hold particular types of neodymium magnets).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further aspect, the housing may be configured to receive the light source and/or after receiving the light source, activate the light source by turning the light source in a clockwise and/or counterclockwise manner in relation to the housing (e.g., using one or more specifically configured receiving portions of the housing and/or keys).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further aspect, the components described herein may work together to create one or more unexpected results. For example, the electromagnetic coil (e.g., the wiring and magnets) interacts with the electromagnetic aspects of the light emitted from the light source. For example, the magnetic aspect interacts with the light as it passes through the electromagnetic coils and the electric aspect interacts with the light as it passes by the magnets. In a further aspect, the magnets may have opposite poles pointing towards each other so they are trying to attract each other. In yet a further aspect, the light emitted by the light source (e.g., the laser) may act as a carrier wave for the one or more materials contained in the enclosed chamber (e.g., the stable noble gas argon contained in the enclosed chamber).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further aspect, the type of light emitted from the light source may influence the light that emits from the handheld device after passing through the enclosed chamber. For example, if visibly green light is utilized, the output may be perceived as a neutralizing color and, when used on a patient's body (e.g., tissue, organs, bones, teeth, gums, etc.), if the electromagnetic charge is too high or too low then it can stimulate or depress areas which might be out of balance. Put another way, if the patient feels emotionally charged then it can help neutralize those emotions (e.g., to help address mental and emotional trauma). Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the light ultimately emitted from the handheld device may be used to charge a glass of drinking water, bath water, and/or any type of water with which a patient may interact. Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a spectrochrome housing <b>100</b>.

Further, in some embodiments, an interior wall of the engaging mechanism <b>104</b> can change in thickness, such that the engaging mechanism <b>104</b> can be used to activate the light source through a manual manipulation, for example, a counterclockwise and/or counterclockwise rotation of the housing <b>100</b> in relation to the light source that may be inserted into the housing (e.g., via the first receiving portion <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the first recess <b>106</b> can be surrounded with an electromagnetic coil.
