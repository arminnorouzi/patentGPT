Loss events may include residential fires, theft, vandalism and/or other events that cause partial or complete loss of the personal possessions of the policyholder. Policy coverage is associated with the amount of risk or liability that is covered by the insurance provider for the policyholder's possessions during these loss events. Insurance providers set policy premiums based at least in part upon a number of factors including the amount of coverage that the policy provides (e.g., policy coverage or insurance coverage). In other words, the policy coverage is related to the amount of funds an insurance provider may have to pay a policyholder for damaged or lost possessions. As such, a policy coverage amount should aim to cover the amount it would cost to replace or repair each of the policyholder's personal possessions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When users register for insurance policies, the users may be needed to provide an inventory list including items that the users wish to have covered under the insurance policy. The inventory list may also include values associated with the items of the inventory list. However, creating and maintaining these lists may be very time consuming for users. Accordingly, the lists may not be accurate or detailed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Insurance premiums, coverage rates, and insurance claims may depend on the inventory list of the personal possession of the user. It would be advantageous for both users and the insurance providers to generate and update a complete and accurate list of personal possessions. The inventory of personal possessions may aid the insurance provider in determining policy rates and additionally aid the policyholder in determining the amount of coverage they will need. Further, during a policy claim, the inventory list may be used to determine reimbursement amounts for each possession.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present embodiment may relate to systems and methods systems and methods for generating a predicted one or more values of personal property items associated with a candidate user enrolling in an insurance policy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a computing system for generating a predicted one or more values of personal property items associated with a candidate user enrolling in an insurance policy may be provided.

One skilled in the art will readily recognize associated with the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the systems and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing associated with the principles of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present embodiments may relate to, inter alia, systems and methods for generating a predicted one or more values of personal property items associated with a candidate user enrolling in an insurance policy. In one exemplary embodiment, the systems and methods may be associated with and/or performed by a possession valuing (&#x201c;PV&#x201d;) computing device (also referred to herein as a PV server, a PV computing system, and a PV computer system), and the PV computing device may be associated with an insurance provider.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The systems and methods described herein may generate a possession value model for predicting one or more values of one or more items (e.g., personal possessions) associated with a user based at least in part upon personal data and property data of the user. The predicted one or more values of items may be used for insurance purposes (e.g., renter's insurance, rental insurance, homeowner's insurance, and/or property insurance that provide insurance coverage of personal property). The systems and methods described herein may use the predicted one or more values to determine a maximum reimbursement amount associated with an insurance policy of a user. Further, in response to receiving a claim associated with the user, the systems and methods described herein may estimate a value of lost or spared items included in the claim. The systems and methods described herein may adjust the maximum reimbursement amount based at least in part upon the estimated value and determine an actual reimbursement amount for the user.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Examples of Value of Personal Possessions</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the exemplary embodiment, the PV computing system may include a PV computer server or device and may be commutatively linked to one or more databases (e.g., a historical policyholder database). The historical policyholder database may include a plurality of historical policyholder records associated with a plurality of policyholders. Each of the plurality of historical policyholder records may include (i) historical policy data associated with the policyholders including one or more values associated with one or more items owned by the policyholders (e.g., values of electronic devices, personal transportation items, like bikes and scooters, computers/laptops, furniture, jewelry, clothing, etc.) and historical insurance claims, (ii) personal data (e.g., age, sex, occupation, education level, marital status, family size, etc.) associated with the policyholders, and (iii) property data (e.g., residence square footage, residence location, residency information, etc.) associated with the plurality of policyholders.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The one or more values associated with one or more items owned by the policyholders, for example, may be the values of personal possessions supplied by the policyholders when the policyholders first obtained insurance coverage for the personal possessions. The values may also be assigned to the personal possessions by the PV computing system (e.g., the PV computing system may perform a search, like an internet search, for the value associated with each personal possession of the policyholders).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Examples of Possession Model Generation</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the exemplary embodiment, the PV system may retrieve, associated with the historical policyholder database, at least a subset of the plurality of historical policyholder records that include personal data, property data, and values of the personal possessions of the policyholders associated with the plurality of historical policyholder records. This subset of historical policyholder records may be used to generate a possession model that relates the personal data and the property data to the values of personal possessions of the policyholders. For example, the PV system may predict a value associated with the personal property of 35-year-old men who make an average of $80,000 per year and live in a residence between 1,500 and 2,200 square feet.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The values of the personal property of the policyholders may be associated with a cost to repair or replace the personal possessions. The possession model may further include a confidence estimate associated with the values of the personal possessions (e.g., a percentage of confidence that the value of the personal possession falls within a range of values). The confidence estimate may be a fixed value (e.g., as set by an insurance provider) for each user, or the confidence value may change associated with user to user. For example, the range of values may be associated with the PV system having 95% confidence that the value of the predicted personal possessions fall within the range of values. For example, the PV system may find that 35-year-old men who make an average of $80,000 per year and live in a residence between 1,500 and 2,200 square feet are associated with personal property with a value between $30,000 and $45,000 in 95% of instances.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The possession value model may be generated based at least in part upon any suitable technique (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, etc.), as further described herein. Further, the possession value model may be continually updated by the PV system as the PV system retrieves more historical policyholder data and feedback associated with users (e.g., associated with the accuracy of the possession value model).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Examples of Predicting Values of Personal Possessions for a User</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Users (e.g., candidate users) may wish to register and/or enroll in a possession valuing (PV) service associated with the PV system when, for example, the users enroll in an insurance policy. For example, a user may want to obtain comprehensive insurance coverage for the personal possessions of the user without having to go through the timely process of creating an inventory and associated value of each item that the user owns. In some embodiments, the PV system (and therefore the PV service) may be associated with an insurance provider associated with the insurance policy. The PM system may prompt the users to enter personal data (e.g., age, sex, income level, employment status, marital status, etc.) and property data (e.g., residence location, residency information including whether the users live in an apartment, a condo, a house, etc., and square footage data) associated with the users when the users enroll and/or register with the PV service.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The PV system may utilize the possession value model to predict a value of personal possessions that are owned by a user based at least in part upon the personal data and property data associated with the user. In other words, the PV system may utilize the set of personal data and property data as an input to the possession value model to predict a value of personal possessions associated with the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, a user may provide the PV system with personal data indicating that the user is a 21-year-old female attending a university and property data indicating that the user lives in a two bedroom apartment that is 600 square feet in New York City. The PV system may input the personal data and the property data of the user into the possession value model of the PV system, and the PV system may predict, with 95% confidence, that the user is associated with personal possession items with a value of between $7,000 and $15,000.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Examples of Determining Maximum Reimbursement Amounts and User Interaction</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the possession value model generates the predicted one or more values of personal possession items associated with the user, the PV system may prompt the user to confirm the accuracy of the value. For example, the PV system may display the predicted one or more values on a computing device (e.g., mobile device and/or computer) of the user. In some embodiments, the PV system may also display a generic listing of items associated with the predicted one or more values (e.g., electronics, personal mobility devices, clothing, jewelry, furniture, etc.). The user may confirm that the predicted one or more values is correct (e.g., based at least in part upon &#x201c;one-click&#x201d;) and/or adjust the value through the user device. The PV system may continue adjusting the value as prompted by the user input until the user confirms that the predicted one or more values is correct.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The PV system may generate a maximum reimbursement amount for an insurance policy of a user based at least in part upon the predicted one or more values of the personal possession items of the user. The maximum reimbursement amount may relate to an amount the user would receive associated with the insurance provider associated with the insurance policy in a &#x201c;total loss&#x201d; event (e.g., if all of personal possession items were lost in a claim event). In some embodiments, the PV system may allow the user to choose to be covered for a percentage of the maximum reimbursement amount for lower insurance premiums for the insurance policy. For example, a user may wish to pay a smaller insurance premium if the user does not think that the personal possession items of the user have a high risk of being damaged and/or stolen, and therefore the user may choose, for example, to be covered for 70% of the maximum reimbursement amount. Accordingly, the PV system may reduce a predetermined insurance premium of the insurance policy covering the full maximum reimbursement by 70%.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the user has confirmed the predicted one or more values and/or adjusted the maximum reimbursement amount for which the user wishes to be covered, the PV system may store the predicted one or more values, the maximum reimbursement amount, and the associated user or user identifier in a database associated with the PV system. In the exemplary embodiment, the PV system may be in communication with and/or part of an insurance provider device (e.g., associated with the insurance provider associated with the insurance policy of the user). Accordingly, the PV system may finalize the enrollment of the user in the insurance policy after the user accepts the terms and conditions of the insurance policy (e.g., such that once the user confirms the predicted one or more values and maximum reimbursement amount, the insurance policy of the user is immediately effective). In other embodiments, the PV system may transmit the insurance policy, predicted one or more values, and maximum reimbursement amount to the insurance provider device such that the insurance provider may finalize the enrollment of the user in the insurance policy and receive any additional information associated with the user (e.g., payment information).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000">Examples of Determining Actual Reimbursement after a Claim Event</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In response to a claim event (e.g., a natural disaster, fire, burglary, theft, etc.), the user may submit a claim to the insurance provider associated with the insurance policy of the user (e.g., through the PV system) to request reimbursement for items associated with the user (e.g., personal possession items) that are covered by the insurance policy of the user. The claim may include a list of items that were lost (e.g., a list of lost items) and/or a list of items that were spared (e.g., a list of spared items). For example, if the claim event (e.g., a fire or a flood) was almost a total loss event, and the user only had a few spared items, the user may include a list of spared items in the claim. Further, if the claim event (e.g., burglary or theft) only resulted in a few damaged/stolen items, the user may include a list of lost items in the claim. In some embodiments, the claim may include images and/or video such that the PV system may determine the list of lost items and/or the list of spared items. Further, the claim may include a police report or other evidence that the claim event took place.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">The PV system may estimate a value associated with the list of lost items and/or the list of spared items. The PV system may estimate the value associated with the list of lost items and/or the list of spared items in substantially the same way that the PV system predicts the one or more values associated with one or more items owned by the user. That is, the PV system may estimate the value of the list of lost items and/or the list of spared items by adding an estimated value of each item together. For example, the PV system may estimate the value of the list of lost/spared items by comparing the list of lost/spared items to the predicted one or more values of items to determine how expansive the list of lost/spared items is and estimating the value of the list of lost/spared items based at least in part upon the comparison. That is, if the list of spared items is very short and includes, for example, some clothing and a mobile device of the user, the PV system may determine that most of the items owned by the user are lost. Accordingly, the PV system may estimate that a value associated with the list of lost items is 90% of the predicted one or more values of the items owned by the user. Further, for example, the PV system may retrieve the value associated with each item of the lost/spared list (e.g., through an internet search or associated with a third party database that stores one or more values associated with one or more items) and add the values of each item to determine an estimated value associated with the lost/spared items.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">The PV system may adjust the maximum reimbursement amount based at least in part upon the estimated value associated with the list of lost items and/or the list of spared items. For example, if a list of spared items is included in the claim by the user, the PV system may reduce the maximum reimbursement by the estimated value of the spared items. Further, for example, if a list of lost items is included in the claim by the user, the PV system may compare the estimated value of the lost items to the predicted one or more values of items to estimate a value of the spared items. For example, if two televisions of the user (and nothing else) was taken during a burglary, the PV system may estimate that a value of the spared items is 85% of the predicted one or more values of the items. The PV system may then reduce the maximum reimbursement amount by the estimated value of the spared items (e.g., 85% of the predicted one or more values of the items).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The PV system may use the adjusted reimbursement maximum amount to determine an actual reimbursement amount for the user. In some embodiments, the actual reimbursement amount may be the adjusted reimbursement maximum amount. For example, the PV system may predict that the one or more values associated with one or more items owned by the user is $10,000, and the PV system may determine that the maximum reimbursement amount for the candidate user is $8,000. The user, in response to a claim event, may send a claim to the PV system including a list of spared items including three pairs of clothes, a laptop, and a mobile device of the user. The PV system may estimate the value of the spared items to be $2,500, and the PV system may adjust the reimbursement maximum amount (e.g., by subtracting the estimated value of the spared items associated with the maximum reimbursement amount) to be $5,500. Accordingly, the PV system may determine that an actual reimbursement amount for the user is $5,500. In other embodiments, the insurance policy of the user may include a deductible that the user must pay before the actual reimbursement amount is distributed. For example, if the user has a deductible of $500, the PV system may determine that an actual reimbursement amount for the user is $5,000 (e.g., by subtracting the deductible associated with the adjusted maximum reimbursement amount).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">The PV system may further provide the adjusted reimbursement amount to the user. In some embodiments, the PV system may provide the adjusted reimbursement amount to the user on behalf of the insurance provider associated with the user and the insurance policy of the user. In other embodiments, the insurance provider may directly provide the user with the actual reimbursement amount. The adjusted reimbursement amount may be in the form of a check, a direct deposit, cash, a digital wallet credit, and/or a prepaid card.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">At least one technical problems addressed by this system may include: (i) difficulty of users to generate an accurate value of personal possession items, (ii) arduous processes associated with insurance claims, (iii) inability of insurance providers to ensure accuracy of values of personal possessions of users.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The methods and systems described herein may be implemented based at least in part upon computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof, where the technical effect may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (i) generating a predictive possession value model based at least in part upon a plurality of historical policyholder records associated with a plurality of policyholders, wherein the plurality of historical policyholder records include (a) historical policy data including one or more values associated with one or more items owned by each policyholder of the plurality of policyholders, (b) personal data associated with each policyholder of the plurality of policyholders, and (c) property data associated with each policyholder of the plurality of policyholders, (ii) receiving personal data and property data associated with the candidate user, (iii) predicting, based at least in part upon the generated predictive possession model, a one or more values associated with one or more items owned by the candidate user based at least in part upon the received personal data and property data, (iv) determining a maximum reimbursement amount for the candidate user based at least in part upon the predicted one or more values, (v) receiving a claim associated with the candidate user in response to a claim event, wherein the claim includes one of a list of lost items and a list of spared items, (vi) estimating a value associated with the claim, (vii) adjusting the maximum reimbursement amount based at least in part upon the estimated value associated with the claim, and/or (viii) determining an actual reimbursement amount for the candidate user based at least in part upon the adjusted maximum reimbursement.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">At least one technical solution addressed by this system may include: (i) enabling users to generate an accurate value of personal possession items based solely upon personal data and property data of the users, (ii) streamlining insurance claim processes, and (iii) allowing insurance providers to ensure that values of personal possessions of users are accurate.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Exemplary Computer Networks</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an exemplary possession valuing (PV) computer system <b>100</b> that may be used in predicting a value of personal property items associated with a candidate user (e.g., associated with user device <b>108</b>) enrolling in an insurance policy.
