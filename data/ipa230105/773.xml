num="0001">The present invention relates generally to methods for enhancing the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of low solubility molecules, and in particular to enhancing the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of Class II or Class IV molecules. The invention also relates to compositions comprising low solubility molecules, the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of which has been enhanced.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many new molecules emerging from pharmaceutical research laboratories suffer from low solubility (Class II and Class IV compounds), for example in aqueous solvents. These include both small molecules and larger peptides. This is a growing trend that is likely to continue in coming years, and it is estimated that over 90% of new chemical entities (NCEs) can be classified as Class II or Class IV compounds (Patel et al 2011<i>, Int J Pharmaceut Biolog Arch </i>2:621-629).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to their low solubility in water these drugs are extremely hard to formulate in ways that are suitable for human administration.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pharmaceutical industry has utilised a wide range of technologies to attempt to enhance solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Examples of enhancement technologies include micronisation, nanomilling, use of oils and surfactants, amorphous dispersions (e.g. spray drying and hot melt extrusion) and co-crystals. However, most of this work has been focused on oral formulation and delivery and would not be suitable for parenteral administration, e.g. intravenous administration.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing technologies for enhancing solubility and/or the rate of dissolution include the use of cyclodextrins and/or surfactants. However, these have the potential for side effects and so are not desirable for use in some parenteral routes of administration, particularly intravenous administration. For example, the poorly-soluble cancer drug Paclitaxel has been formulated in Cremophor EL&#xae; (a polyethoxylated castor oil, also known as Kolliphor&#xae; EL) for intravenous administration but a well-known side effect of this is anaphylaxis (Gelderblom et at 2001<i>, Eur J Cancer </i>37(13):1590-1598). Other poorly-soluble drugs have been formulated with Solutol (polyethylene glycol (15)-hydroxystearate; also known as Kolliphor&#xae; HS 15) but these have been shown to cause side effects in dogs and humans (Stokes et al 2013<i>, Int J Toxicol </i>32(3):189-197).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The problem of formulating low solubility drugs for parenteral administration, e.g. intravenous administration, is more difficult than that of formulating low solubility drugs for enteral administration, e.g. oral administration, because the pharmaceutical standards required for oral compositions are lower than those for intravenous compositions. Reasons for this include: (1) oral compositions require absorption of their components in order for them to enter the blood stream unlike the direct delivery of the entirety of intravenous compositions in their intact state; (2) oral compositions usually transit through the stomach etc. and are therefore exposed to low pH and digestive enzymes before most absorption takes place; and (3) the blood stream has a higher concentration of antibodies and immune system components than the gastrointestinal tract and therefore is more vulnerable to the introduction of immunogenic components of formulations. Therefore, subjects can usually tolerate a lower quality of composition via the enteral route than via the parenteral route.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The methods of the present invention, the spray-dried compositions produced by the methods of the present invention, and the related spray-dried compositions of the present invention, utilise albumin, such as recombinant human albumin, to make a spray-dried composition containing a low solubility molecule, e.g. an API.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Surprisingly, the spray-dried compositions produced by the methods of the present invention, and the related spray-dried compositions of the present invention, may by virtue of the albumin component be highly soluble in one or more aqueous solvents e.g. water, and have an increased rate of dissolution in one or more aqueous solvents e.g. water, without requiring additional solubility enhancing agents such as surfactants. Therefore, among other advantages, the present invention solves the problem of improving the solubility of insoluble or low solubility molecules, such as APIs, in water and other aqueous solvents.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the spray-dried compositions described herein may be suitable for parenteral administration, such as intravenous administration. The albumin present in the spray-dried compositions described herein (including those produced by the methods described herein) may be substantially free (or within tolerance limits) of aggregation, denaturation and/or cross-linking, and thereby avoid the problems of immunogenicity. The spray-dried compositions described herein (including those produced by the methods described herein) may also be of low toxicity. Together, these characteristics can make the spray-dried compositions described herein suitable for parenteral administration, such as intravenous administration. It is expected that the delivery and/or bioavailability (for any non-intravenous administration) of the low solubility molecule will also be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Spray drying also has several differences/advantages over freeze drying, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">(i) the ability with spray drying to go from liquid to dry powder in a single, quick step, which is important for creating a uniform dry powder, whereas in freeze drying a frozen solution is formed, which can lead to partitioning;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">(ii) the ability with spray drying to work with non-aqueous solvents, which is either much more difficult or impossible with freeze drying, depending on the solvent;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">(iii) spray drying has no freezing step, and therefore the method avoids ice formation which can otherwise damage some proteins;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">(iv) spray drying is much cheaper than freeze drying (cost advantage); and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0015">(v) spray drying can produce large quantities of powder in a time scale of minutes rather than a time scale of days for freeze drying (scale advantage).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">The present approach, as illustrated in the examples, is advantageous in utilising the following properties of albumin, spray drying and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0017">the ability for albumin to be dissolved in mixtures of water and a water-miscible solvent such as ethanol to create a single-phase solution of a low solubility molecule, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin such as trehalose for spray drying;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0018">the rapid evaporative properties of spray drying may create a stable, molecular dispersion consisting of an amorphous mix of a low solubility molecule, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin such as trehalose;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0019">the ability of albumin to bind or hydrogen bond with low solubility molecules such as poorly soluble drugs to create stable nanocomplexes when the spray-dried powder is dissolved in water or other aqueous solvents, which nanocomplexes may enhance the solubility of the low solubility molecule, e.g. in aqueous solvents, and may also enhance the bioavailability of the drug when administered parenterally;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0020">the ability of albumin to survive spray drying intact, by using a stable formulation and suitable spray drying conditions;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0021">the suitability of albumin for parenteral delivery due to its biocompatibility, having no side effects compared to cyclodextrins or surfactants;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0022">an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin such as trehalose may stabilise albumin in the dry state thus preventing polymerisation, and may also aid in increasing the solubility of the low solubility molecule when the spray-dried powder is dissolved in aqueous solvents e.g. water.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0023">A first aspect of the invention provides a method of enhancing the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of a Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, the method comprising spray-drying a mixture comprising the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, a water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0024">It will be appreciated that the order for combining the components of the mixture prior to spray-drying may be varied. Without limiting to particular embodiments, some example embodiments for different orders of combining the components are provided immediately below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0025">In one embodiment, the method comprises (a) dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in a water-miscible solvent to form a solution, (b) mixing the solution of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule and water-miscible solvent with albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, and (c) spray-drying the mixture. It will be understood that step (b) may comprise sub-steps wherein either the albumin or the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is added first, with optional mixing, followed by the addition of the other one of the albumin or the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, followed by mixing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0026">In another embodiment, the method comprises (a) mixing albumin with a water-miscible solvent, (b) dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in the mixture of albumin and water-miscible solvent to form a solution, (c) adding an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin to the mixture of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent and albumin, and (d) spray-drying the mixture.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0027">The term &#x2018;solubility&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of the capacity of a solid chemical substance, called a solute, to dissolve in a liquid solvent. A solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. A solvent is a substance that dissolves a solute, resulting in a solution.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0028">Specifically, solubility as defined by IUPAC is the analytical composition of a saturated solution expressed as a proportion of a designated solute in a designated solvent. The solubility of a solute generally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature, pressure and the pH of the solution. The extent of the solubility of a solute in a specific solvent is typically measured as the saturation concentration, where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute. Typically, this is at a state of equilibrium between the solution and the excess solute (Chavda eta, 2010<i>, Sys Rev Pharm, </i>1(1):62-69). Therefore, solubility may represent the endpoint in the process of dissolution of a solute, i.e. the maximum amount of the solute that may be dissolved in a solvent (total dissolution capacity), regardless of how fast this occurs. The solubility value of a given solute in a given liquid solvent may therefore be defined as mass (or moles) of solute per volume (or moles) of solvent, e.g. g/L or mg/mL, measured at ambient pressure and temperature. For example, measurement of solubility in water is typically performed at 25&#xb0; C., pH 7, at ambient pressure. Solubilisation may occur under dynamic equilibrium, which includes the meaning that solubilisation results from the simultaneous and opposing processes of dissolution and phase joining (e.g. precipitation of solids). The solubility equilibrium may occur when the two processes proceed at a constant rate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0029">The terms &#x2018;dissolution&#x2019;, &#x2018;dissolving&#x2019; and &#x2018;dissolve&#x2019; as described herein typically refer to the process by which a solid chemical substance becomes a solute (dissolved component) in a liquid solvent, forming a solution of the solid in the original liquid solvent. In the case of a crystalline solid dissolving in a liquid, the crystalline structure is generally disintegrated such that the separate atoms, ions, or molecules are released. It is understood that full dissolution of a solute in a solvent results in full disintegration of any original structure of the solid (e.g. a crystalline structure). It will also be appreciated that the terms &#x2018;dissolution&#x2019;, &#x2018;dissolving&#x2019; and &#x2018;dissolve&#x2019; apply equally when the solid chemical substance consists of a single type of molecule as when the solid chemical substance is a composition or mixture of molecules.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0030">Generally, the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule is fully dissolved in solution before spray drying. However, it will be appreciated that partial dissolution may be tolerated. For example, the low solubility molecule may be held in a nanodispersed state (nanodispersion) within the solvent. In such a nanodispersion, the drug may not be fully in solution, but may exist as nanosized insoluble material that is stabilised in this form by albumin. Such stabilisation by albumin prevents aggregation of the insoluble material into larger structures. Following spray-drying of such a nanodispersion, the low solubility molecule can much more easily dissolve due to its larger surface area to volume ratio (compared to the ratio before being in a nanodispersion).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0031">The term &#x2018;rate of dissolution&#x2019; as described herein typically refers to the rate at which dissolution occurs. For example, the rate of dissolution may be expressed using the Noyes-Whitney equation:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>d</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>m</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>d</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>T</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>A</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mfrac>    <mi>D</mi>    <mi>d</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>C</mi>      <mi>s</mi>     </msub>     <mo>-</mo>     <msub>      <mi>C</mi>      <mi>b</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">where dm/dt=solute dissolution rate (kg/s); m=mass of dissolved material (kg); t=time (s); A=surface area of the solute particle (m<sup>2</sup>); D=diffusion coefficient (m/s), which is related in part to the viscosity of the solvent; d=thickness of the concentration gradient (m); C<sub>s</sub>=particle surface (saturation) concentration (kg or moles/L); C<sub>b</sub>=concentration in the bulk solvent/solution (kg or moles/L). In another example, the rate of dissolution may include the time taken for dissolution of the maximum amount of solute in the solution according to the solubility of the solute in the solvent at a particular temperature and pressure to occur.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">Further description of the terms &#x2018;solubility&#x2019;, &#x2018;dissolution&#x2019; and &#x2018;rate of dissolution&#x2019; can be found in Chapter 3 (pages 31-50) of <i>Remington Education: Physical Pharmacy</i>, Blaine T. Smith, Pharmaceutical Press, 2016, (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">The term &#x2018;enhancing the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of a (Class II or Class IV) low solubility molecule&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning that the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of the molecule is increased after the steps of the method have been carried out on the molecule. Preferably, the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of the low solubility molecule in an aqueous solvent is enhanced or increased after any one of the methods of the invention is carried out. For example, the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of the low solubility molecule in water may be increased.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">For example, the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of the molecule may be increased by at least 10% compared to the solubility and/or the rate of dissolution of the molecule prior to the method being carried out, such as by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 150% or 200%, and preferably by at least 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1000%, 1500%, 2000%, 2500%, 3000%, 4000%, 5000%, 6000%, 7000%, 8000% or 9000%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">Solubility can be determined by any suitable method known in the art. For example, solubility in a designated solvent (e.g. water, phosphate buffer, or a water-miscible solvent) can be determined by dissolving or dispersing the substance in that designated solvent, and measuring the amount of the substance that is in solution, for example by chromatography e.g. high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using standard methods known in the art. Other methods for solubility determination include: generating a pH-solubility profile of test drug in aqueous media with a pH range of 1 to 7.5 using the shake-flask or titration method; analysis by a validated stability-indicating assay; or passing a solution of a drug through a microfilter (e.g. 0.2 micron pore size) and determining the quantity of the solubilised drug by measuring absorbance with a spectrophotometer; or associative neural network tools such as ALOGPS 2.1 (Tetko &#x26; Tanchuk, 2002<i>, J Chem Inf Comput Sci, </i>42:1138-1145; tool available at http://www.vcclab.org/lablalogps/); or determining a partition coefficient using 1-octanol and aqueous solvent (e.g. water), using shake-flask method. Phosphate buffer as described herein includes 1.0 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 at 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">It will be appreciated that where performance of any one of the methods of the invention enhances the solubility of a Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, this includes by increasing the amount of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule that can be dissolved at a given temperature and pressure, compared to the amount where the methods of the invention have not been performed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">The rate of dissolution can also be determined by any suitable method known in the art, including measuring dissolution (how much of the solute has dissolved) as a product of time, e.g. after 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes. In addition to the methods described above for determination of solubility, suitable methods for measuring dissolution include: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) apparatus I (basket) at 100 revolutions per minute (RPM), or USP apparatus II (paddle) at 50 RPM using 900 mL or less (e.g. 500 mL) of any or all of the following dissolution media: 0.1 N HCl or simulated gastric fluid USP without enzymes; pH 4.5 aqueous buffer solution; and pH 6.8 aqueous buffer solution or simulated intestinal fluid USP without enzymes. In particular, the rate of dissolution may be calculated using the Noyes-Whitney equation given above, the individual parameters of which may be determined by any suitable method known in the art.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">It will be appreciated that where performance of any one of the methods of the invention enhances the rate of dissolution of a Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, this includes by increasing the rate of dissolution of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule at a given temperature and pressure, compared to the rate of dissolution where the methods of the invention have not been performed. Typically, the rate of dissolution of a Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule would be increased by means of (1) a reduction in the time taken for a given amount of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule to dissolve at a given temperature and pressure, compared to the time taken where the methods of the invention have not been performed, and/or by means of (2) an increase in the amount of Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule that has dissolved in a given time at a given temperature and pressure, compared to the amount where the methods of the invention have not been performed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">The term &#x2018;Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of a Class II or Class IV molecule according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme (BCS). The Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme (BCS) was first proposed by Amidon et al (<i>Pharm Res. </i>1995, 12(3):413-420), following their recognition that drug dissolution and gastrointestinal permeability are the fundamental parameters controlling rate and extent of drug absorption. Biopharmaceutics drugs are assigned to one of four classes in the BCS, defined as: Class I, high solubility, high permeability; Class II, low solubility, high permeability; Class III, high solubility, low permeability; Class IV, low solubility, low permeability. Therefore, Class I and Class III drugs have high solubility and Class II and Class IV drugs have low solubility. Thus, it will be appreciated that the technology of the invention is useful for enhancing the solubility and/or dissolution of both &#x2018;low solubility, high permeability molecules&#x2019; and &#x2018;low solubility, low permeability molecules&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">Guidance on the BCS by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can be found in &#x201c;Waiver of In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System&#x2014;Guidance for Industry&#x201d; (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), December 2017 (Final version), Biopharmaceutics, available at https//www.fda.gov/media/70963/download, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Typically, where solubility is measured empirically, the solubility of a molecule is categorised as being low or high solubility following at least three replicate determinations of solubility in each pH condition tested. A molecule such as a drug substance may be considered to have low solubility (Class II or Class IV) when it does not satisfy the above criterion to be highly soluble. However, measurement of solubility for the purposes of categorising a molecule as being low or high solubility typically takes into consideration whether degradation of the molecule is observed as a function of the buffer composition and/or pH. In such a situation, the method chosen for measuring the concentration of the molecule in order to determine solubility preferably distinguishes the molecule from its degradation products. Additionally in such a situation, the final categorisation of high or low solubility typically factors in any effect on the measurement of solubility that is caused by the degradation products. In this way, a more accurate assessment of the true solubility is possible.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">In the context of measurement of solubility, the term aqueous buffered solution as described herein includes a solution comprising water and one or more standard buffers so that it contains a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, and is substantially free from proteins, polymers, and macromolecules. For example, standard buffer solutions described in the United States Pharmacopeia, or other suitable aqueous buffer solutions known in the art, may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">The term permeability as described herein in relation to determination of classification of Class IV low solubility molecules includes the degree of absorption by the intestines, and therefore may relate to bioavailability. A molecule such as a drug substance may be considered highly permeable (Class I or Class II) when the extent of absorption in humans is determined to be 85% or more, e.g. 90% or more, of an administered dose, for example based on mass-balance or in comparison to an intravenous reference dose. A molecule such as a drug substance may be considered to have low permeability (Class III or Class IV) when it does not satisfy the above criterion to be highly permeable.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">It will be appreciated that permeability can be determined using any suitable method known in the art. For example, methods for permeability determination include determining the extent of absorption in humans by mass-balance pharmacokinetic studies and/or absolute bioavailability studies. Additional methods for permeability determination are intestinal permeability methods including in vivo intestinal perfusion studies in humans, in vivo or in situ intestinal perfusion studies in animals, in vitro permeation experiments with excised human or animal intestinal tissue, and in vitro permeation experiments across epithelial cell monolayers, e.g. Caco-2 cells or TC-7 cells. Mass-balance studies may use unlabelled, stable isotopes or radiolabelled drug substances to determine the extent of drug absorption. In case of conflicting information from different types of studies, human data generally supersede in vitro or animal data. In vivo or in situ animal models and in vitro methods, such as those using cultured monolayers of animal or human epithelial cells, may be considered appropriate for assessing the permeability of passively transported molecules.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The observed low permeability of some drug substances in humans could be caused by efflux of drugs via membrane efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein. When the efflux transporters are absent in such models, or their degree of expression is low compared to that in humans, there may be a greater likelihood of misclassification of permeability class for a molecule subject to efflux compared to a molecule transported passively. Therefore, expression of known transporters in selected study systems should typically be characterised, e.g. using bidirectional transport studies using selected model drugs or chemicals at concentrations that do not saturate the efflux system (e.g. digoxin, vinblastine, rhodamine 123). It may be possible to assume an apparent passive transport mechanism when one of the following conditions is satisfied:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0047">1. a linear (pharmacokinetic) relationship between the dose (e.g. a relevant clinical dose range) and measures of bioavailability (e.g. area under the concentration-type curve) is demonstrated in humans;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0048">2. lack of dependence of the measured in vivo or in situ permeability is demonstrated in an animal model on initial molecule concentration (e.g. 0.01, 0.1 and 1 times the highest strength dissolved in 250 ml) in the perfusion fluid;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0049">3. lack of dependence of the measured in vitro permeability on initial molecule concentration (e.g. 0.01, 0.1 and 1 times the highest strength dissolved in 250 ml) is demonstrated, or on transport direction (e.g. no statistically significant difference in the rate of transport between the apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical direction for the molecule concentrations selected) using a suitable in vitro cell culture method that has been shown to express known efflux transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0038" num="0050">The term bioavailability as described herein includes the measurement of the rate and extent to which a drug reaches the site of action. It includes the meaning of the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation (one of the principal pharmacokinetic properties of drugs). Absolute bioavailability includes the comparison of the amount of the active drug in systemic circulation following non-intravenous administration (i.e. after oral, ocular, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, or sublingual administration), with the amount of the same drug following intravenous administration and is typically taken as a ratio of areas under the curves of a plasma drug concentration vs time plot after both intravenous and non-intravenous administration. By definition, when a medication is administered intravenously, its bioavailability is 100%.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0051">It will be appreciated that the BCS classification has already been determined for many compounds and is available in standard chemical databases.

It will also be appreciated that a low solubility molecule that is only partially soluble in a designated water-miscible solvent(s) may still be suitable for use in the methods of the invention because the existence of a partial solution allows the low solubility molecule to be mixed into the albumin prior to spray drying. A larger volume of the water-miscible solvent may also be required in order to dissolve the desired amount of the low solubility molecule.

It will be appreciated that an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin (a protein which has evolved to eschew aggregation as a result of being the principal component of blood plasma) will also be likely to prevent non-self aggregation of albumin with other proteins. It will also be appreciated that the presence of an agent that prevents self-aggregation may still permit some of the albumin present to be present in an aggregated form.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0153">The term &#x2018;prevents&#x2019; as described herein includes the reduction, partially or substantially all, of a designated phenomenon by a particular product or process compared to the situation where the product was not present or the process was not applied. Albumin has a tendency to self-aggregate under dry conditions and in aqueous solution. Thus, the term &#x2018;prevents self-aggregation of albumin&#x2019; as described herein, includes the reduction, partially or substantially all, of the self-aggregation of albumin compared to the background level where a designated or putative preventive agent is not present. It will be appreciated that the self-aggregation of albumin can be measured by any suitable method known in the art, for example gel electrophoresis or chromatography, e.g. high-performance liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0154">For example, the self-aggregation of albumin may be reduced by at least 10% compared to background level, such as by at least 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65% or 70%, and preferably by at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5%.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0155">The agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin may be a sugar, preferably, a non-reducing sugar and/or a sugar with a high glass transition point.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0156">The term &#x2018;sugar&#x2019; as described herein includes monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (up to 10 sugar units) and polysaccharides (&#x3e;10 sugar units). Monosaccharides may have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n </sub>and can be classified by the number of carbon atoms they contain: triose (3), tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), etc. Generally, they are the fundamental units of carbohydrates and cannot normally be further hydrolyzed to simpler compounds. Monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose) and galactose. Disaccharides may consist of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond. Disaccharides include sucrose (glucose-&#x3b1;-1,2-fructose), lactose (galactose-&#x3b2;-1,4-glucose), maltose (glucose-&#x3b1;-1,4-glucose), trehalose (glucose-&#x3b1;-1,1-glucose), cellobiose (glucose-&#x3b2;-1,4-glucose) and isomaltose (glucose-&#x3b1;-1,6-glucose). Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, such as cellulose and starch, may also be made up of many monosaccharides. However, it will be appreciated that a sugar molecule for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention must be soluble in aqueous solvents. Both <smallcaps>D</smallcaps>- and <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-isomers of sugars are suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Modified sugars and sugar derivatives, e.g. amino sugars (a 2-amino-2-deoxysugar, a sugar molecule in which a hydroxyl group has been replaced with an amine group; such as glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, galactosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine), sugar acids (monosaccharides with a carboxyl group; such as gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, glucuronic acid, tartaric acid), sugar alcohols (typically those with the general formula HOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH; such as glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, inositol, maltitol), deoxy sugars (sugars with a hydroxyl group replaced with a hydrogen atom; such as deoxyribose, fucose, fuculose, rhamnose), and sugar phosphate esters (such as glucose-1-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate), may also be suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Further discussion of sugars, modified sugars and sugar derivatives can be found in Chapter 7, pages 203-246 of Garrett &#x26; Grisham, <i>Biochemistry, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>edition, Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005, ISBN 0-534-41020-0, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0157">The term &#x2018;reducing sugar&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of a sugar that is capable of acting as a reducing agent because it has a free aldehyde group or ketone group. The common dietary monosaccharides galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars, as are some disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The monosaccharides may be divided into two groups: the aldoses, which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Generally, ketoses must first tautomerize to aldoses before they can act as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars may react with amino acids in the Maillard reaction, a series of reactions that occurs while cooking food at high temperatures (the reactions typically proceed rapidly from around 140 to 165&#xb0; C.) and gives browned food its distinctive flavour. A similar process may also take place when one or more proteins and one or more reducing sugars are present in a spray-dried composition, and therefore it is preferable that the sugar for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention as an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is a non-reducing sugar.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0158">The term &#x2018;non-reducing sugar&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of a sugar that does not act as a &#x2018;reducing sugar&#x2019;. Non-reducing disaccharides like sucrose and trehalose have glycosidic bonds between their anomeric carbons and thus cannot normally convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group; they are stuck in the cyclic form. Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose that serves as the main form of carbohydrate storage in animals. Although glycogen is a reducing sugar, it has only one reducing end because each branch ends in a non-reducing sugar residue.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0159">As described herein, an amorphous state includes one where a solid has no crystalline structure. It is understood that a solid with an amorphous state may have enhanced solubility and/or dissolution compared to the same substance having a crystalline structure. Some amorphous solids may exhibit a glass transition and so can be called a glass.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0160">The term &#x2018;glass transition&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of the glass-liquid transition, which is the reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within semi-crystalline materials) from a hard and relatively brittle &#x2018;glassy&#x2019; state into a viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0161">The term &#x2018;glass transition point&#x2019;, also known as the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>), as described herein includes the meaning of the mean temperature at which glass transition of an amorphous material (a glass) takes place. It is understood that the T<sub>g </sub>is always lower than the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Generally, the higher the glass transition point, the more stable the formulation. It is preferable for formulations to be stored 20&#xb0; C. below their T<sub>g</sub>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0162">The term &#x2018;high glass transition point&#x2019; as described herein includes temperatures greater than 80&#xb0; C. An example of a sugar with a high glass transition point is trehalose, as the T<sub>g </sub>of pure dry trehalose is understood to be 106&#xb0; C. (Roe &#x26; Labuza, <i>Int J Food Prop, </i>2005, 8(3):559-574). In contrast, the T<sub>g </sub>of pure dry sucrose is understood to be 60&#xb0; C. (Roe &#x26; Labuza, <i>Int J Food Prop, </i>2005, 8(3):559-574). Preferably, the glass transition point for an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is greater than 40&#xb0; C. Most preferably, the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin has a high glass transition point, i.e. greater than 80&#xb0; C. Where an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is used that has a glass transition point that is lower than 40&#xb0; C., it is preferable to store the solutions and spray-dried powders of the invention at sub-ambient temperatures, e.g. in a refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0163">Preferably, the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is selected from one or more of trehalose, sucrose and dextrose, most-preferably trehalose. Trehalose, also known as mycose or tremalose, is a natural alpha-linked disaccharide formed by an &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;-1,1-glucoside bond between two &#x3b1;-glucose units. Because trehalose is formed by the bonding of two reducing aldehyde groups, it normally has no capacity to participate in the Maillard reaction and is therefore a non-reducing sugar. The &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;-1,1-glucoside bond makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore trehalose may be stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;-1,1-glucoside bond also keeps trehalose in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins in the process of glycation. Trehalose is implicated in anhydrobiosis, the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. Trehalose may be nutritionally equivalent to glucose, because it may be rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which may be present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores. As is evident at least from the examples, the inventors have found trehalose to have particularly useful properties as an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin. Trehalose is particularly useful in this regard when the albumin is recombinant human albumin.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0164">Sucrose is a disaccharide formed by a &#x3b2;-1,2-glucoside bond between glucose and fructose, and is a reducing sugar. Sucrose is common table sugar. Sucrose may be stable so that spontaneous hydrolysis happens only very slowly, over several years. Hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose can be accelerated with acids.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0165">Dextrose, also known as glucose or <smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-glucose, is a hexose sugar, a monosaccharide, and a reducing sugar. Dextrose can be produced via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0166">The agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin may be a polymer, such as a synthetic polymer or a natural polymer. The term &#x2018;polymer&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of a macromolecule composed of many repeating subunits. It will be appreciated that the term &#x2018;polymer&#x2019; also includes branched chain polymers and polymers that have been chemically modified. Possible polymers include sugar polymers and polysaccharides, e.g. starch. Preferably, the polymer for use as an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin is suitable for parenteral delivery, e.g. intravenous administration.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0167">The term&#x2018;mixing&#x2019; as described herein means combining two or more components together, and may additionally comprise stirring, shaking, sonicating and/or whisking. However, when one of the components is albumin, the term &#x2018;mixing&#x2019; preferably does not comprise shaking, sonicating and/or whisking.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0168">In the methods described herein, it will be appreciated that there is a wide range of suitable ratios of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule to albumin. The ratio of low solubility molecule to albumin may be greater than 1:50, 1:40, 1:30, 1:25, 1:20, 1:15, 1:10, 1:8, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2.5, 1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, 3:1, and 4:1 (w/w). The ratio of low solubility molecule to albumin may be less than 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2.5:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, and 1:40 (w/w). Preferably, the ratio of low solubility molecule to albumin is greater than approximately 1:50 (w/w), or less than 5:1 (w/w), or between 1:50 and 5:1 (w/w).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0169">In the methods described herein, the solution prior to spray-drying preferably comprises water to maintain the albumin in solution. The mixture of the Class II or Class IV molecule, water, water-miscible solvent (e.g. ethanol), albumin and agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin may contain at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% water prior to spray-drying. In a preferred embodiment, the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule is dissolved in a mixture of water and a water-miscible solvent (e.g. ethanol) prior to spray-drying. The albumin may be in aqueous solution prior to the methods described herein, i.e. in solution with a solvent comprising water. An albumin solution that exists prior to the methods described herein may comprise water and one or more water-miscible solvents, e.g. ethanol.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0170">It will be appreciated that, in embodiments where the method comprises more than one step prior to spray-drying, there may be a difference in the solvent(s) and/or ratio of solvent(s) between two or more of the steps, and/or between the steps of any such multi-step method and any method with only a single-step prior to spray-drying. For example, in a multi-step method prior to spray-drying, step (a) may comprise dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in a water-miscible solvent(s) to form a solution, step (b) may comprise mixing the solution of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule and water-miscible solvent with albumin that is present in an aqueous solution, and step (c) may comprise adding an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin to the mixture resulting from step (b); in this example, the solvent or mixture of solvents in each of steps (a), (b) and (c) prior to spray-drying is different, but in another example, the same mixture may be achieved by combining all components together in one step (which will therefore have the same solvent mixture as the solution at the end of step (c) of the multi-step method prior to spray-drying).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0171">In the methods described herein, the solution prior to spray-drying is preferably a single-phase solution of the low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent(s), albumin and the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, and is most preferably a single-phase solution of the low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent(s), water, albumin and the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin. The term &#x2018;single-phase solution&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning that the solution is homogeneous, for example it has no visible particles and is not a suspension. The term &#x2018;single-phase solution&#x2019; as described herein also includes that all of the solvents are miscible together. As such, in a single-phase solution the solvents do not partition (separate), unlike the mixture of some organic solvents (e.g. dichloromethane) with water, where a physical separation takes place after mixing. Among other reasons, having a single-phase solution permits the low solubility molecule to be in close proximity with the albumin on spray drying.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0172">In some embodiments of the methods described herein, the mixture comprising the low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, also comprises a solubility-enhancing agent prior to spray drying. In other embodiments of the methods described herein, the mixture comprising the low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, does not also comprise a solubility-enhancing agent prior to spray-drying.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0173">The term &#x2018;solubility-enhancing agent&#x2019; as described herein includes the meaning of an agent other than albumin that, separately or in addition to the albumin, enhances the solubility of the low solubility molecule in aqueous solution (i.e. in a solution that comprises water). It will be appreciated that one or more solubility-enhancing agents may be used in the mixture of the method according to the first aspect of the invention prior to spray drying.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0174">Solubility-enhancing agents as described herein include cyclodextrins, dispersants and surfactants.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0175">The term &#x2018;cyclodextrins&#x2019;, or cycloamyloses, as described herein may relate to a family of compounds made up of sugar molecules bound together in a ring (i.e. cyclic oligosaccharides). Cyclodextrins may be produced from starch by means of enzymatic conversion. Cyclodextrins may be composed of 5 or more &#x3b1;-D-glucopyranoside units linked by &#x3b1;-1,4-glycosidic bonds, as in amylose (a fragment of starch). The 5-membered macrocycle is understood not to occur naturally. The largest well-characterized cyclodextrin contains 32 1,4-anhydroglucopyranose units, and at least 150-membered cyclic oligosaccharides are also known as part of a poorly characterised mixture. Typical cyclodextrins contain 6-8 glucose monomers in a ring: &#x3b1; (alpha)-cyclodextrin is a 6-membered sugar ring molecule, and is a soluble dietary fibre; &#x3b2; (beta)-cyclodextrin is a 7-membered sugar ring molecule; &#x3b3; (gamma)-cyclodextrin is a 8-membered sugar ring molecule. &#x3b1;-cyclodextrin and &#x3b3;-cyclodextrin are currently used in the food industry. Cyclodextrins may form complexes with hydrophobic compounds because cyclodextrins are typically hydrophobic inside and hydrophilic outside. Formation of complexes between cyclodextrins and hydrophobic compounds may enhance the solubility of such hydrophobic compounds (Morrison et al, <i>Mol Pharmaceutics, </i>2013, 10(2):756-762). Cyclodextrins can also enhance drug permeability through mucosal tissues (Morrison et al, <i>Mol Pharmaceutics, </i>2013, 10(2):756-762).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0176">The term &#x2018;dispersants&#x2019; includes the meaning of either a non-surface active polymer or a surface-active substance added to a suspension, usually a colloid, to improve the separation of particles and to prevent settling or clumping. The term colloid includes a homogeneous non-crystalline substance consisting of large molecules or ultramicroscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a second substance. Colloids include gels, sols, and emulsions; typically the particles do not settle and cannot be separated out by ordinary filtering or centrifuging like those in a suspension. Therefore, a dispersant may aid in making a suspension homogeneous, i.e. amorphous. Dispersants may consist of one or more surfactants.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0177">The term &#x2018;surfactants&#x2019; as described herein includes compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. Surfactants as described herein include polysorbate 80 and polysorbate 20.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0178">In the methods described herein, the solution(s) and/or mixture(s) may be sterilised before or after any step(s) prior to spray drying. For example, where the method comprises multiple steps before spray-drying and one of those steps comprises dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in a water-miscible solvent to form a solution, said solution may be sterilised before the subsequent step(s) at least comprising addition of the albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin. As a further example, where the method comprises a single step before spray-drying (i.e. mixing all of the components together to form the solution or mixture that will be spray-dried), the solution or mixture resulting from that step may be sterilised before spray-drying. The term &#x2018;sterilise&#x2019; as described herein includes removing unwanted material, particularly bacteria. One suitable method of sterilisation for use in the methods described herein is sterile filtration, such as using a 0.2 &#x3bc;m (micron) sterile filter. Sterile filtration can be performed on any solution produced prior to spray-drying. It will be appreciated that other sterilisation methods, such as those that are well known in the art, may be suitable for use in the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0179">It will be appreciated that, particularly in embodiments where the method comprises multiple steps before spray drying, it may be advantageous to add additional water-miscible solvent to the solution or mixture that already comprises a water-miscible solvent(s), prior to spray drying; either (1) the same identity of water-miscible solvent as is present in the solution or mixture and/or was used in an earlier step of the method, or (2) a different identity of water-miscible solvent. Preferably, the water-miscible solvent that is additionally added before spray drying is ethanol.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0180">For example, in an embodiment where the method comprises (a) dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in a water-miscible solvent to form a solution, (b) mixing the solution of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule and water-miscible solvent with albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, and (c) spray-drying the mixture; additional water-miscible solvent (either the same identity as the water-miscible solvent in step (a) or a different water-miscible solvent than in step (a)) may be added between steps (b) and (c) of the method.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0181">A step of all of the methods described herein is to spray-dry the mixture (preferably as a solution) of at least the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent (e.g. ethanol), albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin (which mixture may also include any optional component as described above). The result of the methods described herein is therefore that spray-drying the mixture produces a spray-dried composition. Preferably, this spray-dried composition is amorphous.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0182">The term &#x2018;spray-drying&#x2019; as described herein refers to a method of producing a dry powder from a liquid or slurry (hereafter &#x2018;feed solution&#x2019;) by rapidly drying with a hot gas, and the term &#x2018;spray-dried composition&#x2019; as described herein refers to a dry composition produced by spray-drying. The apparatus used for spray-drying is called a &#x2018;spray dryer&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0183">In summary, a spray dryer may take a liquid stream (feed solution) and separate the solute(s) or suspension(s) as a solid and the solvent(s) into a vapour. The solid is usually collected in a drum or cyclone. The feed solution is typically sprayed through a nozzle into a hot gas stream and vaporised. Typically, solids form as solvent quickly leaves the droplets. A nozzle is usually used to make the droplets as small as possible, maximizing heat transfer and the rate of vaporisation. Droplet sizes can range from 10 to 500 &#x3bc;m (micron) depending on the nozzle. There are at least two main types of nozzles: high pressure single fluid nozzle (50 to 300 bars) and two-fluid nozzles where one nozzle delivers the feed solution and the second nozzle delivers a compressed gas for atomisation of the feed solution. With a two-fluid nozzle, the gas stream impinges on the feed solution stream, thus atomising it. Although the hot gas used in spray-drying is usually air (e.g. at 1 to 7 bars pressure), if the feed solution comprises a flammable solvent such as ethanol or the product is oxygen-sensitive then nitrogen can be used instead.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0184">Spray-drying is the preferred method of drying for many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and pharmaceuticals because spray-drying may dry a product very quickly compared to other methods of drying, and typically produces a powder from a solution or slurry in a single step. Spray-drying also typically produces a consistent particle size distribution. Its use of evaporative cooling typically keeps the droplet at low ambient temperatures during the drying process</p><p id="p-0146" num="0185">Generally, all spray dryers use some type of atomizer or spray nozzle to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. It is understood that the most common ones of these are rotary disk and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Atomizer wheels may provide broader particle size distribution, but both methods may allow for consistent distribution of particle size. Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles can be used. Depending on the process needs, drop sizes from 10 to 500 &#x3bc;m can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The dry powder resulting from spray-drying is often free-flowing. The dry powder resulting from spray-drying with a small-scale spray dryer is typically 1-10 &#x3bc;m (micron) diameter.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0186">Preferred spray dryers are &#x2018;single effect spray dryers&#x2019;, which may have a single source of drying air at the top of the chamber. In most cases the air is blown in the same direction as the sprayed liquid (co-current). Typically, a fine powder is produced. Other spray dryers include &#x2018;multiple effect spray dryers&#x2019; which, instead of drying the liquid in one stage, may perform drying through two steps, typically the first drying step at the top (as per single effect) and the second drying step with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. However, the humid environment of the bed may cause smaller particles to clump and partially dissolve, and so it will be appreciated that multiple effect spray dryers are not preferred.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0187">The hot drying gas can be passed in as a co-current (same direction as sprayed liquid atomizer) or counter-current (where the hot air flows against the flow from the atomizer). With co-current flow, particles typically spend less time in the system and the particle separator (typically a cyclone device). With counter-current flow, particles typically spend more time in the system, which is usually paired with a fluidized bed system. Co-current flow generally allows the system to operate more efficiently, and so is preferred.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0188">In the methods described herein, spray-drying the mixture can be performed using any spray dryer (spray-drying machine). Examples of suitable spray dryers include those made by Buchi (e.g. Buchi B-290), ProCepT, Niro and Anhydro.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0189">Alternatively, nano spray dryers that produce particles in the range of 300 nm to 5 &#x3bc;m (micron) with a narrow size distribution may be used, which require a minimal sample amount of only 1 mL.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0190">It will be appreciated that different spray-drying parameters may be used, for example according to which low solubility molecule is present in the mixture. Preferably the atomisation pressure is between about 0.5 bar to about 8 bar. Preferably the outlet (drying) temperature is between approximately 40&#xb0; C. and approximately 120&#xb0; C. Preferably the outlet (drying) temperature should be kept substantially constant. Depending on the spray dryer used, the inlet temperature used may be dependent on the chosen outlet (drying) temperature. Most preferably the spray-drying is performed using an inlet temperature of approximately 100&#xb0; C., an outlet temperature of approximately 65&#xb0; C., a liquid feed rate of about 2 ml/min and an atomisation pressure of about 3 bar.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0191">A second aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing a spray-dried composition comprising (i) a Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, (ii) albumin, and (iii) an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin. The method according to the second aspect of the invention comprises spray-drying a mixture comprising the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule, a water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0192">It will be appreciated that the order for combining the components of the mixture prior to spray-drying may be varied, as described above according to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0193">For example, in some embodiments, the method comprises (a) dissolving the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule in a water-miscible solvent to form a solution, (b) mixing the solution of the Class II or Class IV low solubility molecule and water-miscible solvent with albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, and (c) spray-drying the mixture.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0194">Preferably the spray-dried compositions described herein are suitable for parenteral delivery, for example subcutaneous delivery, intramuscular delivery, ocular delivery, pulmonary delivery and/or nasal delivery. The term &#x2018;parenteral&#x2019; described herein includes a reference to a route of delivery that is not by the enteral route, i.e. that parenteral delivery is not via the gastrointestinal tract. Enteral delivery includes oral administration and administration via gastric tube. The term &#x2018;suitable for parenteral delivery&#x2019; as described herein includes having low immunogenicity and low toxicity, so that such a spray-dried composition meets accepted pharmaceutical standards when dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, optionally with any additional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents or additives. It will be appreciated that such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents or additives are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0195">The spray-dried compositions described herein may comprise one or more solubility-enhancing agents as described above. Alternatively, the spray-dried compositions described herein do not comprise one or more solubility-enhancing agents as described above.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0196">The low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent, albumin and agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin according to the first and second aspects of the invention may be as those described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0197">In the methods according to the first and second aspects of the invention, the ratio of low solubility molecule to albumin may be as described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0198">In the methods according to the first and second aspects of the invention, the solution prior to spray drying is preferably a single-phase solution of the low solubility molecule, water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, as described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention. In a more preferred embodiment, the solution prior to spray drying is a single-phase solution of the low solubility molecule, water, water-miscible solvent, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin, as described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0199">In the methods according to the first and second aspects of the invention, the solution(s) and/or mixture(s) may be sterilised before or after any step(s) prior to spray drying, as described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention.

This aqueous solution may comprise a surfactant, e.g. polysorbate 80. Preferably, the aqueous solution is one that is suitable for parenteral delivery, for example subcutaneous delivery, intramuscular delivery, ocular delivery, pulmonary delivery and/or nasal delivery. The aqueous solution may also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents or additives, examples of which are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0201">Particles produced during spray drying according to the methods described herein are usually microparticles (typically, but not limited to, 1-10 &#x3bc;m (micron) diameter) in dry form containing a low solubility molecule, albumin and an agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin. When the dry microparticles dissolve in water, typically the agent that prevents self-aggregation of albumin will dissolve and the low solubility molecule and albumin will form nanoparticles dispersed in the water.

As such, the albumin will have reduced immunogenicity compared to denatured, crosslinked, aggregated or hydrolysed albumin. It will be appreciated that spray-dried compositions described herein wherein the albumin is not denatured or crosslinked may be suitable for parenteral delivery. The extent of the denaturation and/or crosslinking of albumin can be determined by size exclusion chromatography.

The dry powder formulation was produced by spray drying all of the ingredients from a single water/ethanol solution, to produce a stable spray dried dispersion (SDD).</p><p id="p-0216" num="0255">The rationale behind this study was to investigate whether the SDD produced would have improved aqueous dispersion/solubility properties compared to the unformulated rimiducid, which is a BCS class IV compound exhibiting poor solubility/bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0256">Initial investigations focused on developing a spray drying feed solution in which both the drug and rHA remained in soluble form for long enough to be spray dried without loss of drug/rHA and without damaging either molecule.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0257">Once this was achieved, trehalose was added to the formulation, in order to stabilise the rHA, and a spray drying method was developed to produce the rimiducid:rHA SDD. The eventual aim of these studies was to create a SDD that could be re-dispersed in an aqueous infusion buffer at a rimiducid concentration of at least 0.3 mg/ml.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0258">In addition to these development studies it was also necessary to develop suitable analytical techniques that could determine whether the SDD batches produced exhibited improved solubility properties. Analytical methods were developed to measure the AP1903 loading in the formulation and to quantify the stability and degree of the drug solubilisation over time.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0259">The preparation of the feed solution was found to be key to product performance. Balancing of the solubility of the different components was essential for successful complex formation and creation of a product which dissolved well and was stable over time.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0260">Closer examination of the re-dispersed SDD revealed that rimiducid and rHA formed both soluble complexes and nanoparticles when the spray dried powder went back into aqueous solution.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0261">Results also suggest that the rimiducid:rHA complex was not tightly bound, and that the nanoparticles formed could be transient in nature, such that rimiducid and rHA are constantly fluxing in and out of the larger nanoparticulate complex. However, over a 24 hour period the nanoparticulate suspension did not change in overall size, showing that it was suitable for intravenous administration.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0262">A stability study was undertaken that showed that the spray dried rimiducid:rHA:trehalose SDD was stable over 7 days, when stored at 37&#xb0; C./ambient RH.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0263">Materials for Examples 1-6</p><p id="p-0225" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Materials used for batch production and analysis</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Item</entry><entry>Supplier</entry><entry>Lot/Batch No.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Recombinant Albumin (rHA)</entry><entry>Albumedix</entry><entry>1907</entry></row><row><entry>AP1903</entry><entry>Bellicum</entry><entry>RC012090</entry></row><row><entry>Trehalose</entry><entry>Hyashibara</entry><entry>5F261</entry></row><row><entry>Ethanol</entry><entry>Fisher Scientific</entry><entry>1722802</entry></row><row><entry>Water</entry><entry>Fisher Scientific</entry><entry>1724937, 1726806,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>1731809</entry></row><row><entry>Sodium Chloride</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich</entry><entry>SLBS5149</entry></row><row><entry>Dextrose</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich</entry><entry>SLBQ9668V</entry></row><row><entry>TFA</entry><entry>Fisher</entry><entry>1719859</entry></row><row><entry>Acetonitrile</entry><entry>Fisher</entry><entry>1721955</entry></row><row><entry>Methanol</entry><entry>Fisher</entry><entry>1724488</entry></row><row><entry>Sodium phosphate mono</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich</entry><entry>BCBT4829</entry></row><row><entry>basic di hydrate</entry></row><row><entry>Sodium phosphate di basic</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich</entry><entry>BCBT7935</entry></row><row><entry>di hydrate</entry></row><row><entry>Sodium sulfate</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich</entry><entry>SLBR3463V</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Example 1&#x2014;Preliminary Investigations</heading><p id="p-0226" num="0264">Initial formulation testing was undertaken to set up a method for the preparation of feed solutions, to test the spray drying parameters, to set up the required analytical methods for loading and dissolution and to identify a suitable starting formulation for further development.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0265">Methods</p><p id="p-0228" num="0266">Feed Solution Preparation</p><p id="p-0229" num="0267">AP1903 was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 40 mg/mL.

Samples were acidified by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which denatured the rHA. The rHA and AP1903 were then separated using solid phase extraction. In a typical extraction 10-20 mg of formulation was added to 1 mL of HPLC grade water and mixed to form a solution. 4 mL of 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile was then added to this solution and mixed. Once the solution had gone clear, 1 mL was taken and passed through an Agilent Captiva ND cartridge. The filtrate was then analysed by HPLC using an Agilent 1100 employing an ACE 5 C18-PFP (50&#xd7;2.1 mm i.d., 5 &#x3bc;m) column, a gradient of 0.005% TFA in H<sub>2</sub>O and methanol with a flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at 280 nm (0 mins&#x2014;30:70, 2.5 min&#x2014;0:100, 2.6 min&#x2014;30:70, respectively).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0272">A600 Measurements</p><p id="p-0235" num="0273">The absorption of the samples at 600 nm was measured using a Shimadzu uv-vis spectrophotometer.

The Z-average size, and PDI were measured.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0276">Results</p><p id="p-0239" num="0277">Drug solubility testing was undertaken to ascertain the highest concentration of drug solution that could be used for the preparation of the feed solution. Considering available data on solubility of AP1903, ethanol and methanol were selected for testing as they were compatible with rHA and can be spray dried easily. Both were tested and found to perform similarly, with &#x2dc;40 mg of AP1903 dissolving into 1 mLl of solvent. Based on these results, ethanol was selected for further testing as any consequences of residual solvents in the products are lower.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0278">In order to prepare a homogeneous feed solution for spray drying, the AP1903 and rHA needed to be combined together into a single-phase solution. The composition of solvents in this feed solution needed to be chosen so both the AP1903 and rHA were soluble; therefore, sufficient ethanol was required to dissolve the AP1903 but not so much that the rHA was denatured. It was also noted that when adding ethanol to aqueous solutions, the possibility of locally high concentrations of ethanol could occur. Care was taken to avoid this, with constant effective mixing during addition of ethanol to rHA solutions.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0279">For the initial testing a solution preparation method was found which ensured that the rHA was never exposed to an ethanol concentration greater than 40 v/v %. This limit was chosen to protect the rHA from denaturation. To achieve this, and minimise shocking the rHA with the addition of ethanol, AP1903 was initially dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 40 mg/ml, a volume of this solution containing the desired mass of AP1903 was then added to a 1:1 v/v water/ethanol mixture. This solution was then added to the dilute rHA solution. In most cases the AP1903 precipitated out during the preparation, and further ethanol was titrated back in until a visually clear solution was formed. Trehalose was then added to the solution to stabilise and protect the rHA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0280">Batches were produced using this method covering a range of API loadings from 5.9-20.0 wt %, corresponding to AP1903: rHA molar ratios of 5:1-19:1. Volumes used during the solution preparation were adjusted to ensure the final ethanol content remained below 40 v/v % (Table 2).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0281">Batches were spray dried according to the parameters set out in Table 2. For all batches, the feed solutions were prepared successfully as clear solutions.

Sufficient spray dried material was weighed out to give a 0.24 mg/mL AP1903 concentration following dissolution, and the required volume of saline was added to the powder. Visual assessment of the solutions showed that the higher loaded batches did not dissolve well, and formed flaky, inhomogeneous suspensions. In contrast, the lowest loaded batch 004D produced a more homogeneous solution, which had a hazy appearance indicating the likely presence of nanoparticles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0246" num="0283">It was noted that use of saline might not be optimum; therefore, 004D was tested further in DI water at a range of concentrations, giving 0.06, 0.15 and 0.30 mg/mL AP1903. It was found that the formulation dissolved more readily into DI water than saline, and that at all concentrations a clear solution was formed. The haziness noted previously was present, and was concentration dependent, being barely visible at 0.06 mg/mL and clearly apparent at 0.30 mg/mL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0247" num="0284">The loading of AP1903 was measured in the spray dried powder using a solid phase extraction method, following denaturation of the rHA under acidic conditions. A loading of 93.6&#xb1;1.4% of the expected nominal loading was found, indicating that the formulation contained very close to the expected amount of AP1903.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0285">In order to investigate the presence of nanoparticles in the solutions further, initial Zetasizer&#xae; measurements were taken on the solutions prepared in water, together with the rHA and AP1903 alone. These indicated that the combination of the AP1903 and rHA was indeed forming nanoparticles, and these were different from those found in either of the starting materials (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0286">Following these results, the formulation 004D was tested further, and additional material was prepared, as formulation 008. Alongside this, the effects of AP1903 loading was investigated, with lower and higher loaded batches, 009A and B respectively. All of these batches spray dried well, and it was noted that in the case of 008, no further addition of ethanol was required to achieve a clear feed solution during preparation, as the AP1903 remained in solution throughout the addition to aqueous rHA solution.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0287">Following spray drying the loading of AP1903 was again measured in the spray dried powders from batches 009A and B using the same method.

A more opaque solution was taken as an indicator of poorer dissolution, as this would appear as more turbid, with a higher A600 value. The solutions were dissolved at a concentration of 10 mg/mL formulation, which corresponded to 0.18, 0.46 and 1.90 mg/mL AP1903 for formulations 008, 009A and 009B respectively. It was found from plotting A600 vs time over 24 hours that higher concentration of AP1903 (009B) gave a high A600 value, which was corroborated as being highly opaque by visual assessment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The A600 results from 008 and 009A were comparable, with the 009A formulation giving a solution which appeared more stable over time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0252" num="0289">Conclusions</p><p id="p-0253" num="0290">Based upon the data above, the formulation prepared as batches 004D/008 was identified as the best performing formulation, based on its dissolution properties and achievable AP1903 loading.

A dilute solution of rHA was prepared and the AP1903 solution was added dropwise with stirring. During this addition, the solution went from clear to opaque due to precipitation of the AP1903.

This would further suggest that this material was not bound to the rHA during the feed solution preparation stage. Considering the feed solution, it is the ethanol present in this solution which keeps the AP1903 solubilised such that it can bind to the rHA during processing. It would therefore follow that there was a maximum concentration of AP1903 in ethanol in the feed solution beyond which all the AP1903 would not remain dissolved, and would precipitate out. Plotting measured loading against this concentration suggested the threshold lay around 3 mg AP1903 per mL ethanol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0326" num="0355">The dissolution of the formulations was measured in DI water, and the A600 values were again found to correlate with the volume of ethanol added, with lower volumes giving better performance with lower A600 values and better stability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0327" num="0356">Conclusions</p><p id="p-0328" num="0357">Taking all the results in information gathered on the lead formulation together, a more complete understanding of the system could be obtained. At the highest level, a spray dried material was being prepared which consisted of the ethanol soluble AP1903 binding to water soluble rHA. Considering the binding in more depth, there were a finite number of AP1903 molecules that can bind to a molecule of rHA, and once all the rHA molecules have been saturated, no further AP1903 can be bound. What then happened to any excess AP1903 present depended on the amount of ethanol present in the feed solution. If a relatively high volume of ethanol was present, the AP1903 remained in solution and was spray dried as free drug. A 100% recovery of API was then achieved when the loading in the spray dried formulation was measured. But the A600 values for the reconstituted solution were high, and solution stability was poor, as the free drug was not solubilised. However, if the volume of ethanol in the feed solution was relatively low, the excess AP1903 precipitated out, and was not spray dried. The spray dried product then contained only AP1903 that was bound to rHA. This resulted in lower A600 values for the reconstituted solution, and good solution stability. But there was poor recovery of drug when the loading was measured. Examples of both of these scenarios can be seen in the previous examples.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0358">This analysis suggested that to get the best performing product, free insoluble AP1903 arising as a result of spray drying excess AP1903 dissolved in ethanol, should be avoided. This was not present in any of the batches which performed well, but which were made with low ethanol volumes, and gave low loading due to AP1903 losses though precipitation. This would suggest the 8:1 molar ratio of AP1903:rHA was too high and only approximately 40% of the AP1903 was being bound to the rHA. Using this to back-calculate a molar ratio for complete binding suggests a molar ratio of 3:1 might be more appropriate to achieve a product that performs well with a 100% AP1903 recovery.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0359">In order to test this a further batch (023) was made in an identical manner to those described in section 5.2, but with the AP1903:rHA molar ratio reduced to 3:1.

Absorbance at 600 nm was used to measure turbidity, and hence solubility of the formulation, and absorbance was shown to be low and stable over 24 hours. AP1903 and rHA were found to form nanoparticles in solution, and these were measured. The results suggest that the AP1903 complex is not tightly bound, and that the nanoparticles formed may transient in nature, such that AP1903 and rHA are constantly fluxing in and out of complex.

The dry powder formulation was produced by spray drying all of the ingredients from a single water/ethanol solution, or water/DMSO solution, to produce a stable spray dried dispersion (SDD). The dry powder formulations were shown to improve the solubility of the API in water, compared to that of the unformulated API, by formation of a nanoparticulate complex.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0461">The rationale behind this study was to investigate whether the SDDs produced would have improved aqueous dispersion/solubility properties compared to the unformulated APIs, selected from BCS class II and IV compounds exhibiting poor solubility/bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0462">Examples 1-6 exemplified the development of a method for producing a spray dried dispersion (SSD) of Rimiducid, recombinant human albumin and trehalose.

The Lopinavir formulation required addition of 1% Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) to successfully disperse within the D5W solution.

All but one formulation (Lopinavir) reconstituted easily into D5W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>). It was difficult to achieve wetting of the Lopinavir formulation, with a large number of particles seen floating on the surface. To improve the wetting of the particles a surfactant was added to the D5W solution, 1% (v/v) Tween 80 (polysorbate 80). The presence of the surfactant resulted in a homogeneous suspension, which was analysed along with the other reconstituted formulations by HPLC, A600 measurements, Zetasizer&#xae; and SEC. On reinvestigation, it was found that this formulation was mistakenly prepared at an API:rHA molar ratio of 7:1 rather than the intended 3:1, which may explain this difficulty with reconstitution.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0525">Enhanced API Solubility Measurements</p><p id="p-0486" num="0526">The concentration of each API present in the D5W solution was determined using the API loading HPLC method described above (Example 7, Methods, API Loading). The nominal concentration for all formulations was 0.3 mg/mL API. For all but one of the SD formulations the calculated concentrations were lower than the expected 0.3 mg/mL (Table 23). The phenytoin formulation had a higher than nominal concentration, but this is to be expected as the formulation has a slightly higher API loading (138% of nominal). Table 23 also shows the percentage increase in solubility of the formulated API compared to the unformulated API in D5W solution. All formulations show in excess of a 1000-fold increase in solubility compared to the unformulated API. This is a significant increase in API solubility, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method in improving the aqueous solubility of poorly soluble APIs. The SD formulation of Lopinavir was analysed twice, once for the dissolution that failed to fully wet, and once for the formulation dispersed in D5W/1% Tween 80 (polysorbate 80). The initial solution shows an increase of 629% compared to the unformulated API. However, when the dissolution medium contains Tween 80 (polysorbate 80), this increases to 1267%.

Triplicate repeat measurements show reproducibility for all formulations, with the exception of the Ritonavir formulation which seems to deviate from the mean by a significant amount, towards the end of the analysis. Although all formulations seem to follow a similar trend of slowly increasing in A600 over the course of 24 hours, the extent of this increase seems to be individual to each formulation. The Bifonazole formulation shows the largest increase in absorbance over the course of 24 hours with the Lopinavir formulation (in D5W 1% Tween 80 (polysorbate 80)) showing almost no increase in absorbance over 24 hours.

The Lopinavir and Phenytoin suspensions appeared to be largely stable over 24 hours. The particle size distributions for both the Bifonazole and Phenytoin suspensions showed that over the entire 24 hours period, some larger particles had formed, which may have also been indicated by A600 results as an initial increase in turbidity followed by a plateau. The Lopinavir suspension shows stable and small nanoparticles over 24 hours correlating well with the small increase in A600 over the same timescale. The stability of the particle size distributions over 24 hours was not established for the Ritonavir and Ezetimibe suspensions as the intercept from the Zetasizer&#xae; exceeded one, reducing the validity of the data obtained. Overall there is good agreement between the A600 and Zetasizer&#xae; data. Formulations that show a greater increase in turbidity also show the growth of larger particles over the 24 hours, while those with a small and almost negligible change in turbidity show a stable particle distribution over 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0531">SEC-HPLC</p><p id="p-0493" num="0532">The reconstituted formulations were analysed by SEC-HPLC to investigate the integrity of the rHA.

Two traces for Lopinavir are shown, one corresponding to the initial attempt to reconstitute the SD formulation and the other to the successful attempt containing 1% Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) in the D5W solution. The difference between the two is quite striking, the presence of the surfactant has solubilised the higher molecular weight rHA structures. This is interesting as the API remains soluble despite their presence, so much so that this formulation has the lowest increase in turbidity over 24 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0494" num="0533">The Bifonazole and the Ezetimibe formulations show the largest increase in turbidity over 24 hours and show a larger percentage of rHA dimer in the formulation, 23% vs. 8% for the formulations of Phenytoin and Lopinavir.

The solubility of Ezetimibe in DSMO was assessed by dissolving approx. 20 mg of API in 1 mL of solvent. The API dissolved readily with gentle agitation.

The final five remaining APIs, Bifonazole, Ezetimibe, Lopinavir, Phenytoin and Ritonavir were spray dried with recombinant human albumin and trehalose, as in Examples 1-6 using Rimiducid. The formulations were analysed and all showed a considerable enhancement of API aqueous solubility, through formation of a stable nanosuspension, further supporting this method as a platform for improving poorly soluble APIs. The use of an alternative solvent DMSO, was shown to have similar results, improving the solubility of formulated Ezetimibe compared to the starting API. The stability of the albumin in the presence of DMSO was raised as a possible drawback to this solvent since the percentage of rHA dimer in the formulation increased.
