In such instances, the built-in redundancy of the multi-string battery structure and the battery management system allows disconnecting the potentially troubling battery string without affirmatively determining whether disconnecting the battery string is required.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It can be advantageous to implement a battery management system for an electric vehicle as disclosed herein. With conventional thinking, the parallel system looks like it will cost n times the cost of a conventional system, where is n is the number of parallel strings. However, in most safety critical Lithium battery system, redundancy is typically needed anyway, to improve false positive or negative trips. Also, the battery pack split into multiple battery strings allows use of lower current contactors, reducing cost while increasing modularity. In traditional systems with lithium batteries, if a voltage sensor fails, most battery management systems are forced to open switches or contactors of the whole pack because of a risk of overcharge which can lead to a fire or explosion. Because of this, traditional systems include a redundant voltage measurement. The voltage measurement could be another board such as an additional module monitoring board, or a Hardware Overvoltage device on the cell level.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With a multi-string system, in case of a broken voltage sensor or current sensor or temperature sensor, one string can be independently taken out of the pack and the battery pack still delivers power with the remaining strings. With a battery management system implemented as disclosed herein, added voltage redundancy may not be necessary for reliability because the level of redundancy is already built into the multi-string management system. If a voltage sensor fails, a cautious approach may be taken, removing the string, and the vehicle will still have power for the application from the remaining strings.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">By avoiding redundant temperature, voltage and current sensors in a multi-string battery pack, costs can be kept low while reliability and safety can be increased. The control unit can be programmed to be safer than traditional systems, with the ability to independently open and close contactors compared to traditional battery management systems, because other strings provide redundant backup.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The multi-string battery structure and battery management system disclosed herein can also be advantageous in providing continuous power to the electric vehicle as the distributed currents in the multi-string structure and the battery management system allow increased continuous power capability of the battery pack. In some instances continuous current draw of over 1 kA can be implemented using the disclosed system. Furthermore, because the multiple battery strings distribute the total output current over multiple branches, the disclosed battery structure and battery management system allows the system to be implemented with components such as fuses, current sensors, and contactors that are cost- and size-effective as the current in one battery string is lower than is present in a non-multi-string system, and thus the individual components in a string need not carry or measure as high a current. For example, with six separate strings each handling 300 A maximum output can produce a total maximum output of 1.8 kA. Although this multi-string system may use six sets of contactors, fuses, and current measurement devices, the total cost of six sets of these devices each suitable for 300 A operation can be lower total cost as well as higher accuracy operation than a single set suitable for 1.8 kA operation. Also, the built in redundancy, among other features, of the system disclosed herein allows high reliability as faulty strings can be disconnected and removed from operation while the remaining strings can continue to provide power to the electric vehicle. The multi-string battery structure and the battery management system also allow modularity, adaptability, and scalability depending on the size and type of the vehicle and the level of power needed for the vehicle's intended use. The battery management system disclose herein provides the benefits of having multiple battery strings while effectively and efficiently managing a great number of contactors and fuses.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary electric vehicle <b>100</b>.

Current carrier <b>580</b> may be in electrical connection with battery cells <b>710</b> and may conduct current between the battery cells through, e.g., a positive contact <b>1010</b>, a negative contact <b>1020</b>, and a fuse <b>1030</b>. For example, positive contact <b>1010</b> may be in electrical contact with cathode terminal <b>980</b> and negative contact <b>1020</b> may be in electrical contact with anode terminal <b>970</b>. Current carrier <b>580</b> may be electrically coupled to electrical interface <b>830</b>, which may transport signals from current carrier <b>580</b>, for example from a signal plane of current carrier <b>580</b>. Electrical interface <b>830</b> may include an electrical connector (not shown). Current carrier <b>580</b> may also provide electrical connectivity to outside of battery module <b>210</b>, for example, through main power connector <b>550</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a second diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary current carrier <b>580</b>.

According to some embodiments, current carrier <b>580</b> may also include a telemetry board connector <b>1110</b>, medium holes <b>1120</b>, and small holes <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Telemetry board connector <b>1110</b> may communicatively couple a telemetry board (not shown) with current carrier <b>580</b> and communications and low power connector <b>540</b>. For example, the telemetry board may include electronics for data acquisition and/or control, and sensors, such as for battery module telemetry.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Medium holes <b>1120</b> and small holes <b>1130</b> may be used to affix current carrier <b>580</b> to plate <b>570</b>. For example, current carrier <b>580</b> may be hot staked to a plate <b>570</b> through small holes <b>1130</b> or medium holes <b>1120</b>, or small holes <b>1130</b> or medium holes <b>1120</b> may be coupled to staking features <b>590</b>. Alternatively or in addition, coolant may be circulated through medium holes <b>1120</b> and/or small holes <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Current carrier <b>580</b> may include a printed circuit board and a flexible printed circuit. For example, the printed circuit board may variously include at least one of copper, FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), and CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester).

As noted, current carrier <b>580</b> may be electrically connected to a plurality of battery cells <b>710</b>, and may connect battery cells <b>710</b> in series or in parallel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a detailed diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary current carrier <b>580</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts exemplary positive contact <b>1010</b>, negative contact <b>1020</b>, and fuse <b>1030</b>. Current carrier <b>580</b> may include a plurality of each of positive contacts <b>1010</b>, negative contacts <b>1020</b>, and fuses <b>1030</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Positive contact <b>1010</b> and negative contact <b>1020</b> may be separate. The position and shape of positive contact <b>1010</b> and negative contact <b>1020</b> may vary based on the shape of battery cell <b>710</b>. In some embodiments, positive contact <b>1010</b> may be welded (e.g., laser welded) to a cathode terminal <b>980</b> of battery cell <b>710</b>, and negative contact <b>1020</b> may be welded (e.g., laser welded) to an anode terminal <b>970</b> of battery cell <b>710</b>. In some embodiments, the welded connection may have on the order of 5 milli-Ohms of resistance or less. In contrast, electrically coupling the elements using ultrasonic bonding of aluminum bond wires may have on the order of 10 milli-Ohms resistance. Welding may also have lower resistance for greater power efficiency and may take less time to perform than ultrasonic wire bonding.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Current carrier <b>580</b> may be configured such that a positive contact <b>1010</b> and a negative contact <b>1020</b> may be connected to the respective cathode and anode terminals of respective battery cells <b>710</b>, for example, when the first end <b>910</b> of each battery cells <b>710</b> is oriented in the same direction. Therefore, two battery cells <b>710</b> may be connected in series with each other when negative contact <b>1020</b> connected to the anode of the first battery cell is electrically connected with the positive contact <b>1020</b> connected to the cathode of the second battery. Likewise, two battery cells <b>710</b> may be connected in parallel with each other when negative contacts <b>1020</b> connected with the cells are electrically connected with each other.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Accordingly, by designing the electrical connectivity of positive contacts <b>1010</b> and negative contacts <b>1020</b> on current carrier <b>580</b>, battery cells <b>710</b> may be connected in series or in parallel. For example, a group of battery cells <b>710</b> may be connected in parallel via a plurality of electrically connected positive contacts <b>1010</b> of current carrier <b>580</b>, and the respective plurality of electrically connected negative contacts <b>1020</b> of current carrier <b>580</b>. According to some embodiments, a first group and a second group of batteries <b>710</b> may be connected in series if negative contacts <b>1020</b> of the first group are electrically connected with positive contacts <b>1010</b> of the second group.

In some embodiments, fuse <b>1030</b> may be formed (e.g., laser etched) in a metal layer to dimensions corresponding to a type of low-resistance resistor, and may act as a sacrificial device to provide overcurrent protection. For example, in the event of thermal runaway of one of battery cell <b>710</b> (e.g., due to an internal short circuit), the fuse may &#x201c;blow,&#x201d; and may break the electrical connection to the battery cell <b>710</b> and electrically isolate the battery cell <b>710</b> from current carrier <b>580</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary current carrier <b>580</b>. Current carrier <b>580</b> may include main power connector <b>550</b>, low power connector <b>540</b>, and/or telemetry board connector <b>1110</b>. Current carrier <b>580</b> may include a first layer <b>1410</b>, a base layer <b>1420</b>, which may provide dielectric isolation, and a second layer <b>1430</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, one or more isolation layers <b>1440</b> may also be included in current carrier <b>580</b>. Current carrier <b>580</b> may further include a signal plane, which in some embodiments may include signal traces and may be used to provide battery module telemetry (e.g., battery cell voltage, current, state of charge, and/or temperature from optional sensors on current carrier <b>580</b>) to outside of battery module <b>210</b>. Alternatively, the signal plane may be integrated into one or more layers of current carrier <b>580</b> or may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">First layer <b>1410</b> and second layer <b>1430</b> may be disposed on a respective first side and second side of base layer <b>1420</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>C</figref>, first layer <b>1410</b> may include multiple sections. Similarly, second layer <b>1430</b> may include multiple sections. Each section may include a group of contacts electrically connected with the anodes/cathodes of the respective battery cells <b>710</b> in a cell group. Each section may have the same number of contacts or may have a different number of contacts. The contacts within each section may be positive contacts <b>1010</b> or negative contacts <b>1020</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">First layer <b>1410</b> and second layer <b>1430</b> may include sections of any shape or dimensions, depending on the desired positioning of battery cells <b>710</b>, the desired shape and size of battery module <b>210</b>, and the desired electrical connection between and among battery cells <b>710</b>. First layer <b>1410</b> and second layer <b>1430</b> may be composed of metal or other conductive materials known in the art. Both first layer <b>1410</b> and second layer <b>1430</b> may also have more or fewer sections than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>C</figref>. Second layer <b>1430</b> may have the same number of sections as first layer <b>1410</b> or may have a different number of sections.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">When used in half module <b>510</b>, current carrier <b>580</b> may electrically connect the plurality of battery cells <b>710</b> in half module <b>510</b>. The plurality of battery cells <b>710</b> in half module <b>510</b> may be divided into groups and may be oriented such that the first end <b>910</b> of each battery cell <b>710</b> is oriented in the same direction. For example, according to some embodiments, the plurality of battery cells <b>710</b> may be divided into eight cell groups CG<sub>0 </sub>to CG<sub>7</sub>. According to some embodiments, the number of battery cells <b>710</b> in each cell group may be the same. It is also contemplated that the number of battery cells <b>710</b> in a cell group may be different than the number of battery cells <b>710</b> in another cell group. The anode terminal <b>970</b> of each of battery cell <b>710</b> within a first cell group may be electrically connected to a negative contact <b>1020</b> on first layer <b>1410</b> of current carrier <b>580</b>. The cathode terminal <b>980</b> of each battery cell <b>710</b> within the first cell group may be electrically connected to a positive contact <b>1010</b> on second layer <b>1430</b>. The contacts that are electrically connected together form an equipotential surface (referred to as a &#x201c;node&#x201d;). Battery cells <b>710</b> within each cell group are thus connected between two nodes.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, a first cell group CG<sub>0 </sub>may be electrically coupled between node No on second layer <b>1430</b> and node N<sub>1 </sub>on first layer <b>1410</b>. Thus, battery cells <b>710</b> in the cell group CG<sub>0 </sub>are electrically connected in parallel.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A second cell group CG<sub>1 </sub>may be electrically coupled between node N<sub>1 </sub>on first layer <b>1410</b> and node N<sup>2 </sup>on second layer <b>1430</b>. Thus, battery cells <b>710</b> in the second cell group CG<sub>1 </sub>are also electrically connected in parallel. Battery cells <b>710</b> of the first cell group CG<sub>0 </sub>and battery cells <b>710</b> of the second cell group CG<sub>1 </sub>are electrically connected in series.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Similarly, a third cell group CG<sub>2 </sub>may be electrically coupled between node N<sup>2 </sup>on second layer <b>1430</b> and node N<sup>3 </sup>on first layer <b>1410</b>. Thus, battery cells <b>710</b> within the third cell group CG<sub>2 </sub>may be electrically connected in parallel. Battery cells <b>710</b> of the third cell group CG<sub>2 </sub>and the second cell group CG<sub>1 </sub>are electrically connected in series.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The remaining cell groups CG<sub>3 </sub>to CG<sub>7 </sub>may be similarly connected. As a result, battery cells <b>710</b> within each of the eight cell groups may be electrically connected in parallel and the respective cell groups may be electrically connected in series. This exemplary circuitry is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The exemplary circuit configuration described above may increase the number of battery cells within a compact package. For example, all battery cells <b>710</b> within half module <b>510</b> may be oriented in the same direction, and still connected via this exemplary three-dimensional circuit design. With the disclosed current carrier <b>580</b>, the series and parallel connections may be realized by alternating positive and negative contact groups between the multiple nodes within layers <b>1410</b> and <b>1430</b> of current carrier <b>580</b>, rather than physically reorienting battery cells <b>710</b>. This exemplary configuration may also result in simplified manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-B</figref>, modular battery pack systems will be described. As discussed above, a battery pack <b>140</b> may include one or more battery strings <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, battery strings <b>212</b> may be configured to be removed, inserted, and/or replaced individually. Modular battery strings <b>212</b> as described herein may provide several advantages for electric vehicle operation. For example, a battery string <b>212</b> that is malfunctioning or otherwise in need of repair or service may be removed by a technician or owner. The removed string <b>212</b> may be replaced with a functional string <b>212</b>, or the vehicle may be operated with one fewer string until the removed string <b>212</b> is repaired or replaced. Modular battery strings <b>212</b> may also be utilized for convenient battery swapping (e.g., replacing a discharged or partially discharged battery string <b>212</b> for a mostly charged or fully charged replacement string <b>212</b>) to reduce time spent recharging.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The battery pack <b>140</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-B</figref> includes six strings <b>140</b>, which may be mounted in a rack or enclosure <b>200</b>. The enclosure <b>200</b> may include one or more lower support elements such as a tray <b>260</b> positioned to support the strings <b>212</b> from below. The enclosure <b>200</b> may further include one or more upper support elements <b>265</b> positioned so as to prevent the strings <b>212</b> from moving upward during operation of the vehicle. Upper support elements <b>265</b> and/or tray <b>260</b> may include positioning members (not shown), such as protrusions or depressions, configured to maintain strings <b>212</b> in place and/or inhibit movement of the strings by connecting with complementary structures of strings <b>212</b>. For example, the positioning members may include bolts or similar structures, with complementary structures including fasteners that may accommodate and/or secure the bolts. In some embodiments, the enclosure <b>200</b> may include one or more thermal barriers <b>215</b> including any suitable thermally insulating material, each thermal barrier <b>215</b> disposed between two of the strings <b>212</b> so as to prevent an overheating string <b>212</b> from causing neighboring strings <b>212</b> to overheat.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The strings <b>212</b> may be connected in parallel, in series, or in a combination of parallel and series connections. Each string <b>212</b> may have a positive high voltage connector (not shown) and a negative high voltage connector (not shown) for charging and for delivery of electricity to systems of the vehicle. In some embodiments, a current carrier (not shown), such as a bus bar or flexible conduit, may be located within or adjacent to one or more lower support elements such as tray <b>260</b> or upper support elements <b>265</b>. For example, current carriers disposed within tray <b>260</b> may allow connections with the high voltage connectors to be made through or near a positioning member (not shown) and assisted by gravity.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Additional electrical contact with the battery strings <b>212</b> may be made through an auxiliary connector <b>270</b>. The auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may permit connection between internal components (not shown) of the battery strings <b>270</b> and data or low-voltage power systems of the vehicle. For example, the auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may include a CAN connector for connection between monitoring and/or control circuitry (not shown) within the battery string <b>212</b> and a CAN bus or other wiring connector <b>275</b> of the vehicle. The auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may also include a low-voltage power supply, such as from a low voltage battery, DC-to-DC converter, or other vehicle power supply, to provide electrical power to components within the batter string <b>212</b>, such as monitoring and control circuitry (e.g., string control units, battery module monitoring boards, etc.) and/or circuit disconnection elements (e.g., magnetic contactors, fusible elements, etc.). In some embodiments, the auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may include a single connector configured to transmit both power and data to and/or from internal components of the battery string <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The battery pack <b>140</b> may further include a cooling system, such as a liquid cooling system, to control the operating temperature of components within the battery strings <b>212</b>. The cooling system may include one or more conduits (e.g., coolant supply conduit <b>280</b> and coolant return conduit <b>282</b>) configured to carry liquid coolant to and from the battery strings. Conduits <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> may connect to the battery strings <b>212</b> at inlets <b>284</b> and outlets <b>286</b>, which may include sealable valves, dry breaks, or other breakable liquid connections. In some embodiments, the conduits <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> may be manually connectable, such that a user can connect a supply conduit <b>280</b> to the coolant inlet <b>284</b> and connect a return conduit <b>282</b> to the coolant outlet <b>286</b> after placing a battery string <b>212</b> into an available space within the battery pack <b>140</b>. The cooling system may further include elements such as a heat exchanger, pump, reservoir, or other components (not shown) in fluid communication with the conduits, to store, circulate, and cool the liquid coolant.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Individual strings <b>212</b> of the battery pack <b>140</b> may be removable, insertable, and/or replaceable. For example, in a battery pack <b>140</b> including six strings <b>212</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, it may be desired to remove one or more strings <b>212</b>, such as for repair, replacement, service, inspection, external charging, battery swapping, or for any other purpose. The string <b>212</b> to be removed may first be disconnected by disengaging connections such as a vehicle wiring connector <b>275</b>, coolant conduits <b>280</b> and <b>282</b>, and high-voltage connectors (not shown). The string <b>212</b> may then be removed, such as by vertical movement, lateral movement, or a combination of vertical and lateral movement (e.g., lifting one or both ends of the string <b>212</b> and sliding the string <b>212</b> out of the enclosure <b>200</b>). In some embodiments, disconnection of one or more connections may be accomplished by the action of removing the battery string <b>212</b> and not by a separate disconnection step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> depicts a battery pack <b>140</b> during the removal process described herein.

For example, the battery string <b>212</b> may be slid into the opening in the enclosure <b>200</b> to the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>. The vehicle wiring connector <b>275</b>, coolant conduits <b>280</b> and <b>282</b>, and high-voltage connections (not shown) may be connected to provide desired functionality of the battery string <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-B</figref> depict exterior views of a modular battery string <b>212</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> depicts an upper perspective view of a battery string <b>212</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> depicts a lower perspective view. In some embodiments, a battery string <b>212</b> may be enclosed within a protective housing <b>214</b>. Housing <b>214</b> may include materials such as metals, plastics, or other materials configured to support and/or protect battery modules (not shown) within the battery string <b>212</b>. The battery string <b>212</b> may further include several external connections. For example, the battery string <b>212</b> may include an auxiliary connector <b>270</b> configured to accommodate a connection to a vehicle wiring connector <b>275</b>, such as a CAN bus or other data network, a low-voltage connection to power monitoring and control circuitry (not shown) within the string <b>212</b>, or the like. The battery string <b>212</b> may also include a coolant inlet <b>284</b> and a coolant outlet <b>286</b>, which may include sealing components such as dry breaks so as to prevent coolant within the string <b>212</b> from leaking when the string <b>212</b> is disconnected from a cooling system. Positive high-voltage connector <b>288</b> and negative high-voltage connector <b>290</b> may be located on an exterior surface of the string <b>212</b>, such as on the bottom.

The modules <b>210</b> may be electrically connected to the positive high-voltage connector <b>288</b> and the negative high-voltage connector <b>290</b> to deliver electrical power to vehicle systems. The modules <b>210</b> may be separable from the vehicle power circuit by one or more circuit interruption elements, such as contactors <b>310</b> and/or one or more fusible elements <b>312</b>. A fusible element <b>312</b> may be included as a redundant circuit disconnection device, for example, configured to open the circuit if a contactor <b>310</b> fails. In some embodiments, a fusible element <b>312</b> may be a passive fuse, thermal cutoff, or the like. The fusible element <b>312</b> may also be a selectively blowable fuse configured to blow based on an electrical or thermal input produced in response to a detected contactor failure or other malfunction.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In various embodiments, one or more contactors <b>310</b> may be used to control current flow through the battery modules <b>210</b>. Although one contactor <b>310</b> may typically be sufficient to open the circuit through the battery modules <b>210</b> and prevent current flow, two contactors <b>310</b> may be used for additional control and/or redundancy (e.g., in case of a contactor welding event or other malfunction). Contactors <b>310</b> may be located within the battery string <b>212</b> and/or outside the battery string <b>212</b>, such as within the circuitry connecting the battery string <b>212</b> to the main high-voltage electrical circuit of the vehicle.

For example, the contactors <b>310</b> may be normally open contactors operable only when the string is installed within the vehicle (e.g., powered by the SCU <b>300</b>, which may be powered when connected to low-voltage vehicle power at the auxiliary connector <b>270</b>), such that an inadvertent connection between the high-voltage connectors <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> will not cause current to flow from the battery modules <b>210</b> when the battery string <b>212</b> is not installed within a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The battery modules <b>210</b> and other structures within the string <b>212</b> may be monitored and/or controlled by one or more module monitoring boards (MMBs) <b>305</b> and a string control unit (SCU) <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, each battery module <b>210</b> may have an associated MMB <b>305</b>. An MMB <b>305</b> connected to a battery module <b>210</b> may monitor any characteristic or status of the module <b>210</b>. For example, the MMB <b>305</b> may monitor any one or a combination of battery module <b>210</b> temperature, coolant temperature, one or more individual battery cell temperatures, current flow into or out of the battery module <b>210</b>, current flow at a location within the battery module <b>210</b>, an open circuit voltage of the battery module <b>210</b>, a voltage between two points within the battery module <b>210</b>, a charge state of the battery module <b>210</b>, a detected status such as a fault or alarm generated by a sensor within the battery module <b>210</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The MMBs <b>305</b> may be connected to the SCU <b>300</b> by a wired or wireless connection. In some embodiments, each MMB <b>305</b> may be connected directly to the SCU <b>300</b>, or the MMBs <b>305</b> may be connected in a chain, with one or a subset of MMBs <b>305</b> connected directly to the SCU <b>300</b>. The connections between the MMBs <b>305</b> and the SCU <b>300</b> may allow any of the data collected at the MMBs <b>305</b> to be transmitted from the MMB <b>305</b> to the SCU <b>300</b>, such as for analysis, monitoring, or the like. The SCU <b>300</b> may include one or more processors, memory units, input/output devices, or other components for storing, analyzing, and/or transmitting data. In some embodiments, a wired connection between the SCU <b>300</b> and one or more MMB s <b>305</b> may allow the MMB s <b>305</b> to draw electrical power for operation from the SCU <b>300</b>. At the SCU <b>300</b>, global monitoring and/or control functions may be performed for the battery string <b>212</b>. For example, the SCU <b>300</b> may monitor any characteristic or status of the battery string <b>212</b>, or of any one or combination of the battery modules <b>210</b> within the string <b>212</b>, such as a temperature, current, voltage, charge state, detected status such as a fault or alarm, or the like. The SCU <b>300</b> may control the operation of the battery string <b>212</b>, such as by causing one or more circuit interruption elements (e.g., contactors <b>310</b>) to close or open so as to allow current to flow or stop current flow between the battery modules <b>210</b> and the high voltage connectors <b>288</b> and <b>290</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The SCU <b>300</b> may be connected to an auxiliary connector <b>270</b> of the battery string <b>212</b> to receive power, receive data, and/or transmit data to other vehicle systems. For example, the auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may include a CAN bus connector, other data connector, a power connector, or the like. The SCU <b>300</b> may communicate any characteristic or status, or other information determined based on a characteristic or status of at least a portion of the string <b>212</b>, to other systems of the vehicle through a vehicle wiring connector (not shown) connected to the battery string <b>212</b> at the auxiliary connector <b>270</b>. In some embodiments, the auxiliary connector <b>270</b> may be further configured to draw current from a vehicle wiring connector (not shown) and deliver electrical power to the SCU <b>300</b>, such as for operation of electrical components of the SCU <b>300</b> and/or MMBs <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The battery string <b>212</b> may include one or more internal conduits <b>281</b>, <b>283</b> for liquid coolant. As described above, coolant may enter the battery string <b>212</b> from an external conduit (not shown) at an inlet <b>284</b> and leave the battery string <b>212</b> at an outlet <b>286</b>. Upon entering the battery string at the inlet <b>284</b>, coolant may travel through an internal coolant intake conduit <b>281</b> to enter one of the battery modules <b>210</b>. After traveling through a battery module <b>210</b>, where the coolant may absorb heat from one or more components of the battery module <b>210</b> (e.g., electrochemical battery cells, internal electronic components, or the like), the coolant may travel through an internal coolant outlet conduit <b>283</b> to the coolant outlet <b>286</b>, where it may return to the external cooling system. As described above, coolant leaving at the outlet <b>286</b> may be propelled by one or more pumps (not shown) to a heat exchanger, reservoir, and/or other components of the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein.
