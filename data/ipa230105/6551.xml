A semiconductor switching element drive circuit includes a logic circuit that inverts a level of an output signal based on a divided voltage of an output voltage of a semiconductor switching element, and a switching circuit. The switching circuit switches a gate drive condition of the semiconductor switching element during a turn-off operation from a first gate drive condition to a second gate drive condition in which a

power supply V<b>1</b>. The diode D<b>1</b> has a function of freewheeling the load current when the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off. The load L<b>1</b> is supplied with power by the power supply V<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first related circuit includes a control unit <b>1</b>, switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, and gate resistors R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The switch S<b>1</b> and the gate resistor R<b>1</b> are connected in series between the power supply V<b>0</b> (15 V as an example) and the gate of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>. The switch S<b>2</b> and the gate resistor R<b>2</b> are connected in series between a potential (ground potential in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) lower than the power supply and the gate of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>. The switch S<b>1</b> and the switch S<b>2</b> may be, for example, semiconductor switching elements or the like, or may be elements other than these.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control unit <b>1</b> controls on and off of the switch S<b>1</b> and the switch S<b>2</b> based on the gate driving signal. When the switch S<b>1</b> is turned on and the switch S<b>2</b> is turned off by the control unit <b>1</b>, the gate of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is electrically connected to the power supply and the gate resistor R<b>1</b>, and the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on. When the switch S<b>2</b> is turned on and the switch S<b>1</b> is turned off by the control unit <b>1</b>, the gate of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is electrically connected to the ground potential and the gate resistor R<b>2</b>, and the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The gate resistor R<b>1</b> and the gate resistor R<b>2</b> are used as means for setting a gate drive condition for adjusting the switching characteristics during the turn-on operation and the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> to respective appropriate characteristics. For example, the switching speed during the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> decreases as the gate resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b> increases, and increases as the gate resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b> decreases.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing a waveform example at the time of turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> by the driving of the first related circuit. The t<sub>1 </sub>is a time point at which the gate driving signal is turned off and the gate voltage (V<sub>GE</sub>) starts to decrease. The t<sub>2 </sub>is a time point at which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) being the collector voltage starts to gently increase, and the gate voltage (V<sub>GE</sub>) stops falling to be a constant voltage (Miller period voltage). The t<sub>3 </sub>is a time point at which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) starts to increase rapidly. The t<sub>4 </sub>is a time point at which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) reaches the power supply voltage and the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) starts to decrease. The t<sub>5 </sub>is a time point at which the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) becomes zero. The t<sub>6 </sub>is a time point at which the gate voltage (V<sub>GE</sub>) becomes zero.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, during the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>, the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) increases to the power supply voltage in a period t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>4</sub>, and the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) decreases in a period t<sub>4 </sub>to t<sub>5</sub>. During a period t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>5 </sub>including these periods, a switching loss based on the output voltage&#xd7;the output current occurs. On the other hand, in a period t<sub>4 </sub>to t<sub>5 </sub>in which the output current decreases, a surge voltage due to a parasitic inductance of an output current path such as the load L<b>1</b> occurs in the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Since the switching loss causes heat generation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> and the like, it is preferable that the switching loss is low. The surge voltage is preferably low because the sum of the surge voltage and the power supply voltage needs to be suppressed to be equal to or less than the withstand voltage of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, when the resistance value of the turn-off gate resistor R<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is lowered, the switching speed during the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> increases, the period t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>5 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are shortened, and the switching loss is reduced. However, since the change rate (&#x394;I<sub>C</sub>/&#x394;t) of the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> in a period t<sub>4 </sub>to t<sub>5 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> increases, the surge voltage (=L&#xd7;&#x394;I<sub>C</sub>/&#x394;t) generated by the parasitic inductance L of the output current path increases.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Conversely, when the resistance value of the turn-off gate resistor R<b>2</b> is increased, the surge voltage decreases, but the switching loss increases. As described above, the switching loss and the surge voltage are in a trade-off relationship.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the length of the period t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, that is, the length of the period td (off) from the start of the turn-off operation to the start of the decrease in the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) is also affected by the gate drive condition and eventually the resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b>. Specifically, when the resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b> is lowered, the period td (off) is shortened, and when the resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b> is raised, the period td (off) is lengthened. Therefore, the period td (off) has a trade-off relationship with the surge voltage similarly to the switching loss.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, it will be described that it is preferable that the period td (off) is shorter. In the bridge configuration including the semiconductor switching elements connected in series, in order to prevent a short circuit in which the upper and lower semiconductor switching elements are simultaneously turned on, after a certain period of time (t<sub>dead</sub>) since the start of turn-off operation of one of the semiconductor switching elements, the turn-on operation of the other is started. When the period td (off) becomes longer, the period (t<sub>dead</sub>) also needs to be made longer accordingly. However, when the period (t<sub>dead</sub>) becomes longer, the effective output voltage decreases when the H-bridge, the three-phase inverter, or the like is configured. In order to suppress the decrease in the effective output voltage, it is preferable that the period td (off) is short.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a second related circuit. Hereinafter, among the components related to the second related circuit, the components identical or similar to the above-described components will be denoted by the identical or similar reference numerals, and different components will be mainly described. As described below, according to the second related circuit, it is possible to achieve reduction in the surge voltage having a trade-off relationship with the switching loss and the period td (off) while achieving reduction in the switching loss and shortening of the period td (off).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second related circuit is similar to a circuit in which the switch S<b>3</b>, the gate resistor R<b>3</b>, the voltage-dividing resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b>, and the analog comparator CM are added to the first related circuit described above. Similarly to the switch S<b>2</b> and the gate resistor R<b>2</b>, the switch S<b>3</b> and the gate resistor R<b>3</b> are connected in series between a potential (ground potential in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) lower than the power supply and the gate of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>. Here, the description will be given assuming that the resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>3</b> is larger than the resistance value of the gate resistor R<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The voltage-dividing resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b> generate a divided voltage of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>. The analog comparator CM outputs a comparison signal indicating whether the divided voltage exceeds a predetermined threshold value to the control unit <b>1</b>. According to this configuration, substantially, the comparison signal indicating whether or not the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> exceeds the threshold value is output to the control unit <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The control unit <b>1</b> controls on and off of the switches S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> based on the gate driving signal and the comparison signal from the analog comparator CM. In particular, when receiving the comparison signal indicating that the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) exceeds the threshold value during the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>1</b> switches the switches S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> so that the resistance value of the gate resistor of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> increases. That is, the control unit <b>1</b> switches the gate resistor from the gate resistor R<b>2</b> to the gate resistor R<b>3</b> having a resistance value larger than that of the gate resistor R<b>2</b> during the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>, thereby switching to the gate drive condition in which the switching speed decreases.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">An appropriate switching time point at which the gate drive condition is switched is t<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Before t<sub>4 </sub>during the turn-off operation, the control unit <b>1</b> decreases the gate resistance value to increase the switching speed, so that the period td (off) can be shortened and the switching loss in the period t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>4 </sub>in which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) increases can be reduced. On the other hand, after t<sub>4 </sub>during the turn-off operation, the control unit <b>1</b> increases the gate resistance value to reduce the switching speed, so that the surge voltage can be reduced during the period t<sub>4 </sub>to t<sub>5</sub>. According to the second related circuit configured as described above, it is possible to achieve reduction in the surge voltage having a trade-off relationship with the switching loss and the period td (off) while achieving reduction in the switching loss and shortening of the period td (off).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the switching time point of the gate drive condition is greatly delayed from t<sub>4 </sub>at which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) reaches the power supply voltage and the output current (I<sub>C</sub>) starts to decrease, the surge voltage increases. On the other hand, when the switching time point of the gate drive condition is greatly advanced from t<sub>4</sub>, the switching loss increases in the period t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>4 </sub>in which the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) increases. Therefore, it is important to bring the switching time point of the gate drive condition close to t<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing an actual measured waveform indicating the influence of the switching time point of the gate drive condition. In the first diagram from the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the switching time point T<sub>SW </sub>of the gate drive condition is about 50 ns earlier than t<sub>4</sub>, and in the second diagram from the top, the switching time point T<sub>SW </sub>of the gate drive condition is substantially the same as t<sub>4</sub>. In the third diagram from the top, the switching time point T<sub>SW </sub>of the gate drive condition is about 50 ns later than t<sub>4</sub>, and in the fourth diagram from the top, the switching time point T<sub>SW </sub>of the gate drive condition is about 100 ns later than t<sub>4</sub>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the switching time point T<sub>SW </sub>of the gate drive condition is preferably switched to within &#xb1;50 ns from t<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Here, in the second related circuit, the threshold value of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) is determined in consideration of the total delay time of the control circuit (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;gate drive condition switching circuit&#x201d;) including the analog comparator CM and the like for switching the gate drive condition. Here, in general, the propagation delay time from when the input signal of the analog comparator exceeds the threshold value until the output signal of the analog comparator is inverted is several hundred ns to several &#x3bc;s, and the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit is longer than the propagation delay time.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, in the following (1) to (3), the reason why the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit and eventually the propagation delay time of the analog comparator CM should be shortened will be described.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">(1) When the gate resistance value is reduced in order to reduce the switching loss during the rise time (t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>), the rise time (t<sub>3 </sub>to t<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) is shortened. In such a case, the shorter the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit, the higher the threshold value voltage of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> can be set, and variations in operation timing due to external noise can be reduced. Therefore, the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit and eventually the propagation delay time of the analog comparator CM should be shortened.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">(2) When the rise time of the output voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) fluctuates due to the characteristic variations of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>, the deviation between the gate drive condition switching time point and the appropriate switching time point t<sub>4 </sub>increases. However, the shorter the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit, the less the influence of the characteristic variations of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> can be made. Therefore, in order to enhance the stability and accuracy of the operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b>, the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit and eventually the propagation delay time of the analog comparator should be shortened.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">(3) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing an actual measured waveform at the time of the turn-off operation of the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> in the first related circuit that does not switch the gate drive condition. It should be noted that the semiconductor switching element Q<b>1</b> is an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, since the gate drive condition is fixed, the turn-off switching speed is adjusted to be small so that the surge voltage occurring at the time of falling of the collector current (I<sub>C</sub>) falls within the element withstand voltage or less. For this adjustment, the period until the collector voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) rises from 10% of the power supply voltage to the power supply voltage is 180 ns, which is equal to or slightly shorter than the propagation delay time of a general analog comparator.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, in the second related circuit that switches the gate drive condition, the rise time of the collector voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) can be set to about 90 ns being &#xbd; of the rise time of the first related circuit. However, in order to shorten the rise time of the collector voltage (V<sub>CE</sub>) to this extent, it is necessary to make the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit shorter than this (for example, about 50 ns).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, since the propagation delay time of a general analog comparator included in the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit is several hundred ns, the total delay time of the gate drive condition switching circuit cannot be sufficiently shortened. As a result, there has been a problem that the switching time point of the gate drive condition cannot be brought close to the appropriate switching time point t<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be noted that although this problem can be solved by using an expensive discrete high-speed comparator, there arises another problem that the cost and the mounting area of the semiconductor switching element drive circuit increase. On the other hand, as described below, according to the semiconductor switching element drive circuit of the present disclosure, the above problem can be solved.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">&#x3c;First Embodiment&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of the semiconductor switching element drive circuit according to the present first embodiment.
