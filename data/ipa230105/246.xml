With such an arrangement, the support block <b>42</b> cannot be pulled out in an opening direction of the notch <b>421</b> during a slide, thereby preventing the support block <b>42</b> from being lost and improving the reliability of the lift desk.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0064">Further, an end of the support block <b>42</b> is in contact with the slide rail <b>41</b>, and a round corner is provided at a side of the end facing away from the notch <b>421</b>, where a centerline of the round corner is consistent with the direction in which the slide groove <b>411</b> extends. When used, the support block <b>42</b> is inclined by a certain angle to allow the notch <b>421</b> to be fitted with the limiting ridge <b>412</b>, and then the support block <b>42</b> is inclined in a reverse direction so that the support block <b>42</b> can be placed in the slide groove <b>411</b>. In an embodiment, the support block <b>42</b> is inclined by 45 degrees to allow the notch <b>421</b> to be fitted with the limiting ridge <b>412</b>, then the support block <b>42</b> is reversely rotated around the limiting ridge <b>412</b> by 45 degrees so that the support block <b>42</b> can be placed in the slide groove <b>411</b>. Such an arrangement facilitates the mounting of the support block <b>42</b> and can prevent the support block <b>42</b> from being pulled out in the opening direction of the notch <b>421</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0065">In the present embodiment, optionally, the number of the support block <b>42</b> is at least two. Specifically, two support blocks <b>42</b> are provided. This arrangement makes both the two support blocks <b>42</b> smaller in volume, saves a cost and can support supported objects <b>100</b> with different sizes by adjusting a distance between the two support blocks <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0066">Further, the support block <b>42</b> is provided with an inclined plane at an end of the support block <b>42</b> away from the slide rail <b>41</b>. The inclined plane is configured to abut against the supported object <b>100</b>. The arrangement of the inclined plane increases a contact area between the support block <b>42</b> and the supported object <b>100</b>, improving the stability of support.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0067">Optionally, the lift desk further includes a non-slip pad <b>422</b>. The non-slip pad <b>422</b> is disposed on the incline plane. Optionally, the non-slip pad <b>422</b> is stuck to the incline plane. The arrangement can prevent the supported object <b>100</b> from slipping, further improving the safety of use.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0068">Concerning the lift mechanism <b>5</b>, in the present embodiment, specifically, the lift mechanism <b>5</b> includes a linkage assembly <b>51</b> and a drive member <b>52</b>. The linkage assembly <b>51</b> is disposed between the support base <b>1</b> and the first desk board <b>2</b>. The drive member <b>52</b> is configured to drive the linkage assembly <b>51</b> to rotate so as to adjust a distance between the first desk board <b>2</b> and the support base <b>1</b>. With such an arrangement, the rotation of the linkage assembly <b>51</b> is transformed into the lifting motion of the first desk board <b>2</b>, making the first desk board <b>2</b> lifted and lowered more stably.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0069">Concerning the structure of the linkage assembly <b>51</b>, in the present embodiment, specifically, the linkage assembly <b>51</b> includes two drive rods <b>511</b> and two driven rods <b>512</b>. The two drive rods <b>511</b> are parallel to and spaced apart from each other. One end of the drive rod <b>511</b> is rotatably connected to the first desk board <b>2</b> and the other end of the drive rod <b>511</b> is rotatably connected to the support base <b>1</b>. The two drive rods <b>511</b> are disposed on two opposite sides of the first desk board <b>2</b> and two opposite sides of the support base <b>1</b>, respectively. The two drive rods <b>511</b> are connected to an output end of the drive member <b>52</b> by a synchronizing member, where the synchronizing member is fixed between the two drive rods <b>511</b>.
