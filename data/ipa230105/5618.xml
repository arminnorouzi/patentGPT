No. 11,450,435, and entitled &#x201c;Spinal Stenosis Detection and Generation of Spinal Decompression Plan,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present technology is related generally to spinal stenosis treatment and, more particularly, to spinal stenosis detection and generation of a spinal decompression plan based on image data.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lumbar spinal stenosis, or compression of the spinal cord, is one of the largest contributors to spinal procedures in patients over 65. Spinal decompression procedures for relieving a spinal compression are delicate, time consuming, and high-risk tasks. Diagnosis of spinal stenosis is typically accomplished using a combination of patient imaging, patient verbal inputs, and physical examination of the patient. Once diagnosed, spinal stenosis may be treated with non-invasive means such as massages, chiropractic treatments, and/or acupuncture, and/or with invasive procedures including laminectomy, laminotomy, discectomy, and so forth. Due to the risk of removing bone or otherwise operating in a section of the spine where the nerves and bone are compressed together, accuracy is critical and significant concentration by the operating surgeon(s) is required. The physical work required during the procedure can also be intensive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional methods for planning and performing a spinal decompression procedure rely on a surgeon's prior experience, knowledge, and judgment. Such conventional methods are time consuming, complex, and may not be recorded for future reference or use. Surgical decompression plans often remain in the surgeon's head.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure advantageously provide objective approaches to detecting and planning a spinal decompression procedure, which reduce dependence on the treating physician's prior experience, knowledge, and judgment. Embodiments of the present disclosure may also beneficially reduce the time and costs involved in, increase the safety of, and improve the outcomes of spinal decompression procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides exemplary methods and systems for generating an optimized decompression plan by determining, from image data, at least one compression on a spinal cord and providing at least one marking of a corresponding anatomical element proximate to a location of the at least one compression.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for detecting spinal stenosis according to one embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: receiving image data corresponding to a spine region of a patient; identifying a spinal cord in the image data; determining at least one compression of the spinal cord; and marking an anatomical element proximate to a location of the determined at least one compression to yield at least one marking.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method may further comprise classifying a type for each of the at least one compression. The method may further comprise generating a decompression plan based on the at least one marking. Generating the decompression plan may comprise: calculating an amount of bone to remove based on the at least one marking. Generating the decompression plan may comprise calculating a score for each of a plurality of potential decompression plans. Generating the decompression plan may comprise generating a visualization of a predicted appearance of the spine region after the decompression plan has been performed. At least one of the steps of identifying the spinal cord in the image data, determining the at least one compression of the spinal cord, marking the anatomical element, classifying the type, and calculating the amount of bone to remove may use at least one of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. At least one of identifying the spinal cord in the image data, determining the at least one compression in the spinal cord, and marking the anatomical element may use feature-based identification.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Determining the at least one compression of the spinal cord may include comparing a first characteristic in the image data with a second characteristic in the image data to determine the at least one compression. Determining the at least one compression of the spinal cord may include comparing a characteristic in the image data with a predetermined threshold and determining that the characteristic meets the predetermined threshold. Generating the decompression plan may include selecting at least one of a full laminectomy, a partial laminectomy, a full laminotomy, a partial laminotomy, a full foraminotomy, and a partial foraminotomy. Generating the decompression plan may be based at least in part on historical decompression surgery data comprising information regarding a historical patient having a historical characteristic similar to a characteristic of the patient.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another method for detecting spinal stenosis according to one embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: receiving image data corresponding to a spine region; identifying, in the image data, a spinal cord and at least one nerve exit proximal to the spinal cord; identifying a first side of the spinal cord and a second side of the spinal cord; determining, at each of a plurality of locations along the spinal cord in the superior-inferior (S-I) direction, a width between the first side and the second side of the spinal cord; calculating a change in the determined width for each adjacent pair of the plurality of locations; identifying a compression of the spinal cord when the calculated change in the determined width meets a threshold change; and classifying a type and a location for each of the at least one compression.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may further comprise generating a cross-section of the spinal cord along a plane extending in the S-I direction. The method may further comprise generating a plurality of graphs, each corresponding to one of the plurality of locations, based on a measurement orthogonal to the cross-section of the spinal cord, wherein each of the plurality of graphs depicts a first peak and a second peak, the first peak having a height corresponding to a maximum magnitude of a first gradient corresponding to the first side, the second peak having a height corresponding to a maximum magnitude of a second gradient corresponding to the second side, and a distance between the first peak and the second peak corresponding to the width.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Determining the change in the determined width may be based on comparison of the graphs corresponding to an adjacent pair of the plurality of locations. The method may further comprise annotating the image data based on a classification of the at least one compression. The method may further comprise marking, in the image data, an anatomical element proximate to a location of the determined at least one compression to yield at least one marking. The method may further comprise generating a decompression plan based on at least one of the classification for each of the at least one compression and the at least one marking.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A system for detecting spinal stenosis according to one embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: an imaging device imaging a spine region to yield image data; a processor; and a memory storing instructions for execution by the processor that, when executed, cause the processor to: receive the image data; identify a spinal cord in the image data; determine at least one compression in the spinal cord; mark, in the image data, an anatomical element proximate to a location of the determined at least one compression to yield at least one marking; and generate a decompression plan based on the at least one marking.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The memory may further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: classify a type for each of the at least one compression. The memory may further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: calculate an area for bone removal on the spinal cord based on the at least one marking for the decompression plan. The memory may further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: select at least one of a full laminectomy, a partial laminectomy, a full laminotomy, a partial laminotomy, a full foraminotomy, and a partial foraminotomy for the decompression plan.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The details of one or more aspects of the disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

The image data <b>100</b> may be obtained from, for example, an MRI scan, a CT scan, or another 3D image. The spine region <b>102</b> includes a spinal cord <b>104</b>, a plurality of vertebrae <b>110</b>, and at least one nerve exit <b>108</b> extending from the spinal cord <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At least one compression <b>106</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b>, otherwise known as spinal stenosis, is visible in the image data <b>100</b>. Spinal cord compressions may be caused by arthritis, bulging discs, a thickening of the ligaments in the back, injury, or other causes, and often result in patient pain. The at least one compression <b>106</b> may be alleviated by, for example, performing a decompression procedure to remove bone or disc material causing the compression.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each of these features in the spine region <b>102</b>, including the spinal cord <b>104</b>, the compression <b>106</b>, the at least one nerve exit <b>108</b>, and the plurality of vertebrae <b>110</b>, may be identified using the image data <b>100</b>. Identification of the spinal cord <b>104</b>, the at least one nerve exit <b>108</b>, and the plurality of vertebrae <b>110</b> may be accomplished using feature-based identification. By way of example, feature-based identification may comprise pre-processing the image data <b>100</b> by applying one or more filters or other algorithms thereto. The pre-processing may comprise cleaning and/or aligning the image data <b>100</b>, and/or conducting intensity mapping of the image data <b>100</b>. The feature-based identification may further comprise applying one or more feature detection algorithms to the image data <b>100</b>. These algorithms may be used to identify edges, corners or points of interest, blobs or regions of interest, ridges, and/or other defining elements in the image data <b>100</b>. Identification of these elements may comprise comparing an intensity or other characteristic of one pixel in the image data <b>100</b> to the intensity or other corresponding characteristic of one or more adjacent pixels in the image data <b>100</b>. Pixels having a local maximum or minimum value for intensity or another characteristic may thus be identified, and a determination can be made as to whether such pixels representing a defining element. Other methods of detecting defining elements in an image may also be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the defining elements of the image data <b>100</b> are identified, one or more algorithms may be used to associate or classify a given defining element or group of defining elements with an anatomical feature. Such algorithms may compare the defining element or group of defining elements to one or more predetermined defining elements of a known anatomical feature, and may correlate the defining element or group of defining elements with the known anatomical feature when the comparison determines or calculates a degree of similarity that surpasses a predetermined threshold. In this manner, the vertebrae, spinal cord, nerve exits, and/or other anatomical features may be identified in the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To detect the at least one compression <b>106</b>, a cross-section of the spinal cord <b>104</b> (identified as described above), such as the cross-sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A</figref>, may be generated. Gradient analysis may then be used to identify the edges of the spinal cord <b>104</b>. Once the edges of the spinal cord <b>104</b> have been identified, a distance between the edges may be measured at a plurality of locations along the length of the spinal cord <b>104</b> to yield a set of local spinal cord widths. The spinal cord width as measured at any given location may then be compared to the spinal cord width as measured at one or more adjacent locations. A rapid and/or unusual change in spinal cord width at a given spinal location or subset of spinal locations indicates the presence of a compression <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the compression <b>106</b> may be identified by identifying one or more spinal cord widths along the length of the spinal cord <b>104</b> that are below an average spinal cord width of the spinal cord <b>104</b> by a predetermined amount, and/or that are lower than a predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various aspects of a decompression procedure may be determined based on the image data <b>100</b>, as will be discussed below, once spinal stenosis has been detected in the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a conceptual flow diagram illustrates a method <b>300</b> for detection of spinal stenosis in image data <b>100</b>. The method <b>300</b> may be carried, for example, by a processor executing instructions stored in a memory operatively connected to the processor and configured to cause the processor to carry out the steps <b>302</b> through <b>310</b> of the method <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the method <b>300</b>, image data <b>100</b> corresponding to a spine region <b>102</b> of a patient may be received in step <b>302</b>, and any needed pre-processing of the image data <b>100</b> may be conducted. Such pre-processing may be the same as or similar to the pre-processing described above.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The image data <b>100</b> may be received, for example, by a processor executing instructions configured to cause the processor to receive the image data <b>100</b>. The image data <b>100</b> may be provided by a user or may be obtained in real-time, e.g. directly from a device performing an MRI scan or a CT scan, or otherwise scanning a 3D image of a spinal region of a patient. The image data <b>100</b> may be received from a tangible electronic storage medium. The image data <b>100</b> may be received via a wired or wireless connection. The image data <b>100</b> may be received from the Internet, another wide area network, a local area network, or any other network. The image data <b>100</b> may be required to have at least a minimum required resolution, or to otherwise meet minimum standards and/or parameters, to ensure that the remaining steps of the method <b>300</b> can be completed using the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>304</b>, a spinal cord <b>104</b> and/or other anatomical elements may be identified in the image data <b>100</b>. Such identification may be performed automatically using, for example, feature-based identification as described above. In some embodiments, the vertebrae locations may be determined based on the unique form of the spine in a 3D volume, e.g., by detecting a unique pattern that repeats itself along a prolonged line with anatomical distinct features, e.g. size, form, volume, etc. Once the vertebrae locations are determined, a spinal cord location may be determined. Such determination of the spinal cord location may be based on the unique features of continuity and general location (including common pathologies) within the spine vertebrae. Nerve exit locations may be determined in the same way. In some examples, individual bony anatomy and intervertebral discs may be detected in the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence may be used to identify the spinal cord <b>104</b> and/or other anatomical elements in the image data <b>100</b>. For example, a machine learning engine may be trained using historical data and/or training images of a plurality of spine regions in which relevant features have already been identified (e.g., manually). The machine learning engine may utilize the historical data and/or training images to identify patterns, correlations, and/or other relationships that may be used to identify features of interest. Upon receipt of the image data <b>100</b>, the machine learning engine may apply one or more algorithms reflecting the identified patterns, correlations, and/or other relationships to the image data <b>100</b> to yield identified features of interest (including a spinal cord <b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a processor or other computing device or system may compare the image data <b>100</b> to an atlas of spinal anatomy, and identify one or more anatomical elements in the image data <b>100</b> based on the results of the comparison.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>306</b>, at least one compression <b>106</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> may be determined or identified. In some examples, determining the at least one compression <b>106</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> may include comparing a first characteristic in the image data <b>100</b> with a second characteristic in the image data <b>100</b>. For example, a width of the spinal cord at a first location may be compared with a width of the spinal cord at a second location adjacent or near the first location. In yet another example, a gradient or other characteristic corresponding to a side of the spinal cord at a first location may be compared with a gradient or other characteristic corresponding to the same side of the spinal cord at a second location near the first location. The comparison may be or comprise a comparison of the magnitude of the gradients being compared, and/or of the relative position of the gradients being compared. In other examples, determining the at least one compression <b>106</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> may include comparing a first characteristic in the image data <b>100</b> with a predetermined threshold. In some examples, the predetermined threshold may be based on a historical characteristic of at least one historical patient, or of a population. In other examples, the predetermined threshold may be set by a user, e.g., a physician or surgeon. In still other examples, the predetermined threshold may be calculated based on the image data <b>100</b>. For example, a width of the spinal cord at a given location may be compared to an average width of the spinal cord across all measured locations of the spinal cord. In still other examples, a compression <b>106</b> may be determined by mapping the image data <b>100</b> regarding the spinal cord <b>104</b> to a large-scale anatomical atlas, by comparing the results of measurements of the previously identified anatomical elements, and using one or more thresholds to determine whether a compression <b>106</b> exists. Machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence may be used to determine the at least one compression <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An anatomical element proximate to a location of the determined at least one compression <b>106</b> may be marked to yield at least one marking in step <b>308</b>. The at least one anatomical element may be, for example, a vertebra <b>110</b>, a portion of a vertebra <b>110</b>, such as a lamina or a foraminal wall, or a disc <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the at least one marking comprises a visual indicator, and may visually indicate to a surgeon a location or characteristic of the at least one compression <b>106</b>, or a location or characteristic of a feature causing the at least one compression <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, the at least one marking may not comprise a visual indicator, but rather may be intended only to ensure that a processor or other computing device tracks the location of the at least one compression <b>106</b> (and/or of an anatomical element causing or otherwise related to the at least one compression <b>106</b>) and generates an appropriate decompression plan. Whether visual or not, the at least one marking can also include additional information about the at least one compression <b>106</b>, such as, but not limited to, type, size, volume, severity or the like. Machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence may be used to automatically mark the anatomical element.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>310</b>, a decompression plan may be generated based at least in part on the at least one marking. In some embodiments, generation of the decompression plan includes creating a baseline of potential solutions for decompression of the identified compression. The decompression plan may include determining whether a laminectomy, laminotomy, foraminotomy, or other standard procedure will relieve the compression, and may further comprise information about standard cut types and/or designated cuts needed or recommended for carrying out an identified procedure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, generation of the decompression plan may comprise virtually and automatically conducting, with a processor, one or more of a discectomy, a laminotomy, a laminectomy, a foraminotomy, or another procedure, and evaluating, for each procedure, whether the procedure enables the spinal cord <b>104</b> to return to a decompressed state. In some embodiments, a score may be calculated for each potential decompression plan that is conducted virtually and automatically, and the resulting set of scores may be used to identify a preferred or recommended decompression plan. The score may be based on, for example, one or more of a likelihood of correcting the compression, a likelihood of inadvertently causing collateral damage during the decompression, an ease of carrying out the decompression, and/or an amount of bone and/or soft tissue removed by the compression (both in the approach to the compression and in the decompression itself).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also as part of the generation of the decompression plan in some embodiments, a visualization of the identified compression, the aforementioned procedures, and/or a predicted appearance of the spine region (or a portion thereof) after the decompression plan has been performed may be generated. The visualization may be or comprise one or more images and/or one or more videos. The visualization may show a predicted change in the spine region (or a portion thereof, e.g., the portion in which the identified compression is located) as the decompression plan is being carried out, and/or may show a predicted change in the spine region (or a portion thereof, e.g., the portion in which the identified compression is located) after the decompression plan has been performed. The processor may cause the visualization to be displayed on a display (e.g., a monitor, a screen, etc.). The visualization may be evaluated automatically by the processor, or manually by a surgeon or other user for likelihood of success.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Once a procedure is determined to likely be successful (or at least relatively more successful than another procedure) based on the evaluation of the virtual procedure and/or evaluation of the visualization of the virtual procedure, the procedure in question may be selected and recommended to the surgeon or other user. Alternatively, each of a plurality of procedures may first be evaluated, after which one of the plurality of procedures yielding the highest likelihood or probability of success may be selected and recommended to a surgeon or other user. The recommendation may comprise instructions for carrying out the procedure in a suggested or recommended manner in addition to the identification of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Generation of the decompression plan may alternatively comprise the use of machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence to determine, based on inputs such as the type and location of an identified compression, a suggested decompression solution for the current patient. The decompression solution may be, for example, the solution that has the highest chance of yielding a desirable outcome, or the least chance of yielding an undesirable outcome. The machine learning system, algorithm, or engine may utilize historical data regarding compressions, historical decompression cuts used to relieve such compressions, and/or historical post-procedure outcomes in making the determination. A recommendation or suggestion based on the determination may comprise a type of procedure as well as instructions for carrying out the procedure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Generation of the decompression plan may include calculating an amount of bone and/or disc to remove based at least in part on the at least one marking. The decompression plan may identify which portion(s) of one or more vertebrae to remove, which disc(s) to remove (if any), and/or which instruments to use to remove the bone portion(s) and/or disc(s). The calculation may take into account an allowance for bone growth that will not result in a new compression.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Calculation of the amount of bone and/or disc to remove may be automated, which advantageously reduces time needed to generate the decompression plan and further removes guesswork associated with a surgeon's judgment of bone/disc removal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The decompression plan may also include information or directions for a surgeon and/or surgical robot to identify the bone and/or disc for removal, and may be optimized for the removal of bone or disc material to be performed by a surgeon (whether manually or with the assistance of surgical robotics) or by a robotic surgeon. The decompression plan may also specify or suggest entry points on a surface of a body and/or trajectories for accessing the surgical site with the instruments. Further, calculation of the amount of bone to remove may comprise calculating a minimum number of cuts required to perform the removal. Generation of the decompression plan may include selecting at least one of a full laminectomy, a partial laminectomy, a full laminotomy, a partial laminotomy, a full foraminotomy, and/or a partial foraminotomy.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The decompression plan may comprise a visual element so that a surgeon or other treating physician can easily see the generated plan. For example, the decompression plan may include a graph and/or image(s) illustrating the compression location, entry point location(s), portion(s) of the bone and/or disc to remove, and/or the at least one marking. The decompression plan may be editable so that a surgeon or other treating physician can make changes to the plan.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The decompression plan may include restrictions on devices or surgical robots to block the devices or surgical robots from leaving a planned section and/or from removing too much of the bone portion(s) and/or disc(s). The decompression plan may also be stored in a computer-readable memory for future reference or use.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The method <b>300</b> may be utilized to generate a decompression plan to correct a compression of a spinal nerve exit <b>108</b>, as well as a compression in a spinal cord <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a conceptual flow diagram illustrates a method <b>400</b> for detecting spinal stenosis, which will be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, and <b>6</b>B</figref>. As previously described, image data <b>100</b> corresponding to a spine region <b>102</b> of a patient may be received, for example, by a processor executing instructions configured to cause the processor to receive the image data <b>100</b> in step <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step <b>404</b>, a spinal cord <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, at least one nerve exit <b>108</b>, and/or other anatomical elements may be identified in the image data <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, a cross-section of the spinal cord <b>104</b> along a plane extending in the superior-inferior (S-I) direction (which direction is shown by arrow <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, may be generated from the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A first side <b>502</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> and a second side <b>504</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> may be identified in step <b>406</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the first side <b>502</b> and the second side <b>504</b> are distinguishable from the spinal cord <b>104</b> and surrounding anatomical elements. In some examples, the first side <b>502</b> and the second side <b>504</b> may each correspond to at least one first gradient in the image data <b>100</b> and at least one second gradient in the image data <b>100</b>, respectively. Such identifications of the spinal cord, the at least one nerve exit, the first side, the second side, and/or other anatomical elements may be performed automatically using feature-based identification, or using machine learning, deep learning, and/or artificial intelligence, as previously described above, or in any other manner.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>408</b>, a width <b>508</b> (shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>6</b>B</figref>), between the first side <b>502</b> and the second side <b>504</b> may be determined at a plurality of locations along the spinal cord <b>104</b> in the S-I direction. In some examples, the width <b>508</b> in each of the plurality of locations may be determined using each of a plurality of gradient graphs <b>600</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. The plurality of graphs <b>600</b> each show a change in intensity of the image data <b>100</b> along a line orthogonal to the spinal cord <b>104</b> at one of the plurality of locations. Thus, each of the plurality of graphs <b>600</b> corresponds to one of the plurality of locations along the spinal cord <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the plurality of graphs <b>600</b> may show a change in intensity of the image data <b>100</b> along a line orthogonal to the cross-section of a nerve exit <b>108</b> at each of a plurality of locations. The plurality of graphs <b>600</b> may be generated, for example, based on gradients in the grey-level contrast (which shows the contrast between nerves and bony anatomy) of the image data <b>100</b>.

A distance between the first peak <b>602</b> and the second peak <b>604</b> therefore corresponds or is assumed to correspond to the width <b>508</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b>. The slopes of the gradients <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, and <b>616</b> of the graphs <b>600</b> represent the rate of change in the intensity of the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step <b>410</b>, a change in the determined width <b>508</b> for each adjacent pair of the plurality of locations may be calculated.

In some embodiments, a change in width across more than two graphs <b>600</b> (each of the graphs <b>600</b> representing a location adjacent to at least one other of the more than two graphs <b>600</b>) may be calculated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">At least one compression <b>106</b> of the spinal cord <b>104</b> may be identified in step <b>412</b> when the calculated change in the determined width <b>508</b> at or near a given location meets a threshold change. The threshold change may be predetermined or dynamically calculated. The threshold change may be based on, for example, a comparison of historical spinal image data of patients without spinal stenosis and historical image data of patients with spinal stenosis. Such data may be provided as training data to a machine learning, deep learning, and/or artificial intelligence system or engine, which may be used to identify an absolute or relative amount of change in the width of a spinal cord that corresponds to stenosis. Thus, a decrease in spinal cord width of, for example, 0.7 mm or 5% within a particular section of the spinal cord may be normal among patients without stenosis, while a decrease in spinal cord width of, for example, 0.91 mm or 7% within a particular section of the spinal cord may be abnormal or altogether absent among patients without stenosis, yet common in patients with stenosis. Because the maximum, minimum, and average widths of a spinal cord vary from person to person, a relative threshold change value (e.g., a percentage change in width) may be more useful than an absolute threshold change value (e.g., a change in width measured in mm or inches). However, both absolute and relative threshold changes are included within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The compression <b>106</b> may also be identified using only information about the spinal cord <b>104</b> obtained from the image data <b>100</b>. Such information may include, for example, one or more inconsistencies and/or non-minimal changes in the measured distance <b>508</b> within pairs or sets of the plurality of graphs <b>600</b> corresponding to adjacent pairs or groups of adjacent pairs of the plurality of locations. A compression <b>106</b> may also be identified based on changes in the magnitude of the peaks <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> within pairs or sets of graphs <b>600</b> corresponding to adjacent pairs or groups of adjacent pairs of the plurality of locations in the image data <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>414</b>, the at least one compression <b>106</b> is classified by type and location. The classification may also involve identifying bony anatomy sections (such as vertebrae and/or different parts of vertebrae, e.g., the lamina, spinous process, facets, pedicles, or the like) and/or discs adjacent to the compression area. Such classification and/or identification may be performed automatically using feature-based identification, as described above. In other embodiments, machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence may be used to automatically classify the at least one compression <b>106</b> and/or identify nearby bony anatomy/disc sections. In some examples, neural networks may apply algorithms based on historical or predetermined anatomical annotations and/or historical decompression surgery results to classify the at least one compression <b>106</b> and/or identify nearby bony anatomy/disc sections.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, the image data <b>100</b> may be annotated based on the classification of the at least one compression <b>106</b>. For example, the bony anatomy (whether vertebrae, parts of vertebrae, or both) and/or discs adjacent to the compression area may be annotated. The annotation may include the classification and information about the compression and/or the bony anatomy/disc (e.g., type, size, volume, area, or the like). In other examples, an anatomical element proximate to a location of the determined at least one compression <b>106</b> may be marked to yield at least one marking. As previously described, the at least one marking may comprise a visual indicator or may include information for a processor or other computing device to process before, during, or after generation or execution of the decompression plan. The at least one marking may include the information provided by the annotation. In some embodiments, such classification and/or at least one marking may be used to calculate the amount of bone to remove during the decompression procedure. In other examples, the classification may be used to determine whether to perform a laminectomy, a partial laminectomy, a full laminotomy, a partial laminotomy, a full foraminotomy, or a partial foraminotomy to provide relief to the compression. IN still other examples, the classification may be used to provide instructions for performing a laminectomy, a partial laminectomy, a full laminotomy, a partial laminotomy, a full foraminotomy, or a partial foraminotomy to provide relief to the compression. Such annotations and/or at least one marking may be useful to surgeons and/or may be used in generation of the decompression plan, as previously described above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a method <b>700</b> of preparing a decompression plan may comprise, in step <b>702</b>, training a machine learning engine using classified compressions in manually annotated MRIs or other images. Thus, the machine learning engine may correlate documented clinical outcomes of procedures (e.g., whether a procedure has relieved the correct compression) and related information (e.g., information about patient characteristics, stenosis characteristics, type of procedure performed, a manner in which the procedure was performed, and so forth), combined with the annotations in the MM or other image (reflecting, e.g., information about the spinal cord <b>104</b> and/or other anatomical elements in the image) with annotated compression classifications. Alternatively, the machine learning engine may identify or determine one or more thresholds to use for classifying compressions and/or evaluating which procedures are most likely to be successful in correcting a compression based on information about the compression.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The step <b>702</b> need only be completed once, although it may be repeated as desired to further improve the machine learning engine (e.g., by providing additional training data to the machine learning engine). In embodiments that do not use a machine learning engine to determine an anatomical decompression solution, the step <b>702</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The method <b>700</b> may comprises, in step <b>704</b>, classifying a type (based, e.g., on the cause of the compression, such as a bulging disc or a displaced vertebra) and location (e.g., where along the spine) of a compression <b>106</b> identified in an MM or other image.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The method <b>700</b> also comprises, in step <b>706</b>, detecting one or more pieces or portions of bony anatomy and/or discs that interact with and/or cause the classified compression <b>106</b>. The detecting may be based on a previously made marking (e.g., a marking made in a manner described above), or the detecting may comprise marking the bony anatomy and/or disc(s) adjacent to or within a certain distance of the compression <b>106</b>, in the same or a similar manner as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The method <b>700</b> may further comprise, in step <b>708</b>, determining an anatomical decompression solution. The anatomical decompression solution may be determined using, for example, the trained machine learning engine, to which may be input information about the compression <b>106</b> presently in need of correction. In other embodiments, the anatomical decompression solution may be determined by virtually and automatically conducting, with a processor, one or more of a discectomy, a laminotomy, a laminectomy, a foraminotomy, or another decompression procedure, and evaluating, for each procedure, whether the procedure enables the spinal cord <b>104</b> to return to a decompressed state. Once a procedure is determined to likely be successful (or at least relatively more successful than another procedure), the procedure in question may be selected and recommended to a surgeon or other user. Alternatively, each of a plurality of procedures may first be evaluated, after which one of the plurality of procedures yielding the highest likelihood or probability of success may be selected and recommended to a surgeon or other user.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The decompression solution may be or include a general approach (e.g., a laminectomy, laminotomy, foraminotomy, discectomy) as well as more specific information, such as on which vertebra(e) or disc(s) to perform the procedure, and how much bone to remove (in the case, e.g., of a laminotomy or foraminotomy).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The method <b>700</b> may further comprise, in step <b>710</b>, automatically planning a minimal number of cuts needed to perform the determined decompression solution. As with the determining an automatic decompression solution described above, the automatically planning a minimal number of cuts needed to perform the determined decompression solution may be completed using, for example, a trained machine learning engine, and may be based at least in part on historical procedure information, historical outcome information, and/or information about or corresponding to the compression <b>106</b> presently in need of correction. Alternatively, the automatically planning the minimal number of cuts needed to perform the determined decompression solution may be completed based on one or more automatic and virtual simulations of the recommended procedure (which may, for example, evaluate projected outcomes based on different numbers of cuts, or may simply determine how many cuts are required for the procedure in question).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The method <b>700</b> may further comprise, in step <b>712</b>, delivering a decompression plan. The decompression plan may comprise, for example, the determined anatomical decompression solution, and/or a plan for the minimal cuts needed to perform the determined anatomical decompression solution. The plan may be delivered via a screen or other user interface, and/or may be delivered as a file transmitted electronically (whether via a physical removable storage medium, or via a wired or wireless connection, a local or wide area network, or otherwise). The plan may also be stored for future use and reference. In some embodiments, the plan may be annotated after completion of the planned procedure to include the results of the procedure and/or notes about the performance of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>800</b> according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure is shown.
