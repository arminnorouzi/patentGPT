When the operation mode of the seat device <b>10</b> set via the operation panel <b>70</b> is the manual mode, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is activated as a sleep induction mode is turned on according to an operation on the operation panel <b>70</b> by the occupant. In a case where the seat device <b>10</b> consists of the driver's seat, in any operation mode, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> can start only when the automobile is driven autonomously. In other words, in a case where the seat device <b>10</b> consists of the driver's seat, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is prohibited from starting when the automobile is not driven autonomously.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">When turned on, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> controls the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> such that the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> press the back of the seated person at a set cycle (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;control target cycle&#x201d;) corresponding to a breathing cycle of the seated person at a sleeping time. This control induces the breathing suitable for sleep induction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> sots a default value of the control target cycle to a normal breathing cycle of a human at the sleeping time or at the time of the sleep induction. The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> may modify the control target cycle upon learning the breathing cycle of the seated person detected by the breathing detecting device <b>72</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to properly induce sleep by inducing the breathing.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> determines whether the breathing of the seated person is the abdominal breathing or the thoracic breathing based on the information from the breathing detecting device <b>72</b> and the camera <b>78</b>. The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> may perform control such that only one of the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> operates so as to induce the breathing corresponding to a determination result thereof.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Deep breathing according to the abdominal breathing makes the parasympathetic nerve dominant, and thus relaxes the mind and body. As the abdomen swells and deflates, the blood and lymph can smoothly circulate throughout the body, so that sleep is effectively induced. The thoracic breathing makes the sympathetic nerve dominant, and thus tensions the body and wakes up the seated person. Accordingly, the waist pressing device <b>42</b> may induce the abdominal breathing when sleep is induced, while the back pressing device <b>40</b> may induce the thoracic breathing when the sleep ends (when the seated person wakes up). Accordingly, when sleep is induced, it is possible to induce the breathing suitable for inducing sleep. On the other hand, when sleep ends, it is possible to induce the breathing suitable for waking up the seated person.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> performs control such that the operation strength of the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> is lowered as the sleeping level calculated by the sleeping level calculating unit <b>104</b> gets higher.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> induce the breathing based on the above control, it is possible to better induce sleep and lead the seated person to sleep well.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the breathing of the seated person is unstable, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> controls the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> so as to induce the breathing that eliminates unstableness in the breathing. As the breathing is induced by this control, it is possible to eliminate the unstableness in the breathing of the seated person.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is kept on for a sleep time or nap time se by the seated person via the operation panel <b>70</b>. The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is automatically turned off after the sleep time or nap time elapses. Alternatively, the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is manually turned off according to an operation on the operation panel <b>70</b> by the seated person. The sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> may be linked with a smartwatch or a sleep meter at home to learn a recommended mode based on a sleeping state or health state of the seated person at night, so that the sleep time or nap time can be set individually.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The sleeping level calculating unit <b>104</b> calculates the sleeping level of the seated person based on the information from the breathing detecting device <b>72</b>, the heartbeat detecting device <b>74</b>, the body pressure detecting device <b>46</b>, the camera <b>78</b>, and the like. Accordingly, it is possible to determine REM sleep and non-REM sleep relating to the depth of sleep.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">When the sleep-inducing control unit <b>102</b> is turned on, the seat temperature control unit <b>108</b>, the environment control unit <b>10</b>, the massage control unit <b>112</b>, the posture control unit <b>114</b>, and the reclining control unit <b>116</b> are turned on in a sleep-inducing mode so as to better induce sleep and lead the seated person to sleep well by the synergistic effect of these units and sleep-inducing breathing induction.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the sleep-inducing mode, that is, when the seated person is likely to sleep, the seat temperature control unit <b>108</b> slowly warms the seat surface so as to induce sleep of the seated person. When the sleeping level calculating unit <b>104</b> or the like determines that the seated person has fallen asleep, the seat temperature control unit <b>108</b> controls the seat temperature adjusting device <b>52</b> such that the seat temperature gets lower than the time before sleep. Hereinafter, the adjustment of the seat temperature by this control will be referred to as &#x201c;sleep-inducing seat temperature adjustment&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, it is possible to cause the effect of leading the seated person to sleep well according to the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> and the sleep-inducing seat temperature adjustment.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The environment control unit <b>110</b> refers to the cabin temperature/humidity detected by the T/H detecting device <b>76</b>, thereby controlling the T/H adjusting device <b>90</b> such that the cabin temperature and cabin humidity suitable for sleep are maintained in the sleep-inducing mode. For example, the environment control unit <b>110</b> controls the T/H adjusting device <b>90</b> such that the cabin temperature rises and the cabin humidity falls when the cabin is cooled, and the cabin temperature falls and the cabin humidity rises when the cabin is warmed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the environment control unit <b>110</b> controls the sound device <b>92</b> such that the sound device <b>92</b> makes a sound with a rhythm suitable for the sleep induction and synchronized with the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b>, music with a rhythm that induces sleep, or quiet music suitable for inducing sleep.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the environment control unit <b>110</b> controls the lighting device <b>94</b> and the window shade device <b>96</b> such that an inside of the cabin becomes dark and invisible from the outside.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the environment control unit <b>110</b> controls the warm air device <b>58</b> such that the warm air flows at the feet of the seated person.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">By the above control, a cabin environment (sleep-inducing environment) in which the seated person can easily sleep is organized. Accordingly, it is possible to cause the effect of leading the seated person to sleep by the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> and the setting of the sleep-inducing environment.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The environment control unit <b>110</b> can also perform control to change the brightness of the lighting device <b>94</b> and the sound of the sound device <b>92</b> according to the breathing rhythm of the seated person. This control makes it easier for the sealed person to be aware of his/her breathing, and thus it is possible to cause the effect of yoga or meditation.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the massage control unit <b>112</b> controls the seat shape adjusting device <b>44</b>, the neck massaging device <b>48</b> and the calf massaging device <b>50</b> to give a massage (sleep-inducing massage) suitable for the sleep induction and synchronized with the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to cause the effect of leading the seated person to sleep well by the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> and the sleep-inducing massage.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the posture control unit <b>114</b> controls the seat shape adjusting device <b>44</b> based on the body pressure distribution or the like detected by each body pressure detecting device <b>46</b> so as to correct the body pressure distribution, prevent bedsores, and prompt the seated person to roll over. In other words, the posture control unit <b>114</b> controls the seat shape adjusting device <b>44</b> such that a difference in the body pressure in each portion of the seat cushion <b>30</b> and the seat back <b>34</b> is reduced or the surfaces of the seat cushion <b>30</b> and the seat back <b>34</b> are deformed so as to prompt the seated person to change a posture.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Accordingly, it is possible to cause the effect of leading the seated person to sleep well by performing the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b>, preventing bedsores, and prompting the seated person to roll over.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a case where the seated person sleeps while the automobile is traveling, the posture control unit <b>114</b> performs control such that the seat shape adjusting device <b>44</b> causes the seat cushion <b>30</b> and the seat back <b>34</b> to hold the seated person tight or hardens the seat cushion <b>30</b> and the seat back <b>34</b> according to the travel acceleration. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the body of the seated person at the sleeping time from moving significantly due to the travel acceleration, and thus cause the effect of keeping stable sleep.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the sleep-inducing mode (when the seated person is likely to sleep), the reclining control unit <b>116</b> controls the reclining device <b>32</b> and the ottoman <b>38</b> so as to make the seat device <b>10</b> completely flat or nearly flat. Thus, the seated person can take a posture in which sleep is likely to be induced, so that the seated person can sleep well. Accordingly, it is possible to cause the effect of better inducing sleep and cause the seated person to sleep well by the above posture and the sleep-inducing breathing induction by the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Due to the above functions and effects, the seated person is less likely to become uncomfortable at the sleeping time, and can sleep comfortably for a long time.

At the time of long sleep, the sleeping level calculating unit <b>104</b> may prompt the seated person to wake up when the sleeping level is low (when REM sleep is caused). The seated person may be prompted to wake up as the seat shape adjusting device <b>44</b> operates rapidly or vibrates, the reclining device <b>32</b> erects the seat back <b>34</b>, the sound device <b>92</b> outputs a sound suitable for waking up the seated person, or the lighting device <b>94</b> lights the cabin suitably for waking up the seated occupant.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Deep breathing according to the abdominal breathing makes the parasympathetic nerve dominant, and thus relaxes the mind and body. As the abdomen swells and deflates, the blood and lymph can smoothly circulate throughout the body, so that sleep is effectively induced. The thoracic breathing makes the sympathetic nerve dominant, and thus tensions the body and wakes up the seated person. Accordingly, the waist pressing device <b>42</b> may induce the abdominal breathing when sleep is induced, while the back pressing device <b>40</b> may induce the thoracic breathing when the sleep ends (when the seated person wakes up).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The display device <b>98</b>, the smartphone of the seated person, or the tablet terminal of the seated person may display whether the breathing of the seated person is induced properly.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The breathing induction control unit <b>106</b> is activated by the operation on the operation panel <b>70</b> by the seated person, and controls the back pressing device <b>40</b> and the waist pressing device <b>42</b> such that the breathing (the abdominal breathing or the thoracic breathing) of the seated person determined by the breathing detecting device <b>72</b> is induced.
