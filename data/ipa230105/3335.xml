In particular, it would be useful while making adjustments to the instrument or on a subject for whom the instrument is operating, to be able to see the information on the monitor from more than one side of the instrument. This is particularly advantageous for performing ophthalmic or optometric measurements on a subject, where, for instance, the practitioner may like to sit by the side of the patient to check if he/she is sitting correctly at the machine with the chin and forehead in the correct position, whilst viewing information on the monitor. Depending on the geometry of the room, sometimes one side would be preferable and sometimes the opposite side. Alternatively, the practitioner may prefer to sit opposite the patient, in front of the machine. Prior art instruments having multiple monitors, such as one on each side, are known, such that the viewing screen may be viewed from several sides. An obvious drawback of such instruments is the cost of several monitors. Another potential solution is to rotate or swivel a single monitor around the corners of the instrument in order that it be viewable from multiple directions. The disadvantage of this option is that, to easily clear the corners of the instrument, the monitor needs to be attached to an arm of length that would leave the monitor positioned at a distance from the sides of the instrument. The distance between the monitor and the equipment may predispose the monitor to accidental impact, resulting in damage to the monitor, the person, or the instrument.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There therefore exists a need for a solution which overcomes at least some of the disadvantages of prior art systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosures of any publications mentioned in this specification, or in continuation or derivative applications thereof, are hereby incorporated by reference, each in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides new exemplary systems for an instrument having a single monitor screen, switchably positionable at multiple side faces of the instrument, without protruding from the instrument significantly more than the thickness of the monitor. The system utilizes a rotation mechanism that enables a monitor to be rotated between at least some of the several side faces of the instrument, to negotiate the corners of the instrument, and to be parked at stable positions with respect to the face sides of the geometrically shaped instrument to which the monitor is attached. This is achieved by causing the monitor to follow the outer profile of a specially shaped cam fixedly mounted on the instrument in a plane generally perpendicular to the planes of the faces of the instrument, the profile being such that the monitor is moved further away from the instrument as it passes the corners of the instrument, and is moved closer to the instrument as it passes the faces of the instrument. The monitor is attached to an arm assembly, having a pivot bearing, enabling the arm assembly to rotate around the instrument. The arm assembly is made up of two parts&#x2014;an inner part in which the pivot bearing is mounted, and an outer part which slides relative to the inner part, and to which the monitor is mounted. A spring mechanism attached between the inner and outer parts of the arm assembly, exerts an inwardly directed tensional force on the outer part of the arm assembly, attempting to pull it inwards towards the pivot joint. The inward motion of the outer part of the arm assembly is controlled by a cam following pin attached to the outer part of the arm assembly, and which follows the profile of the cam. The inwardly directed force ensures that the pin remains in contact with the cam profile and follows it as the arm assembly is rotated. As the arm assembly is rotated, the pin in the arm assembly follows the outer profile of the cam, and moves the monitor outwards to round the corners of the instrument. The pin follows the cam profile towards the pivot as the monitor passes positions parallel to the faces of the instrument, pulling the monitor back inwards towards the instrument face.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The cam profile is shaped such that, when the cam follower reaches a new equilibrium point on the cam, i.e., a position of minimum potential energy of the spring mechanism, the monitor simultaneously comes to rest at a position parallel to another side of the instrument. In this manner, the monitor may be easily positioned on two or three sides of the instrument in resting positions that bring the monitor close to the instrument.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One exemplary implementation involves a mechanism for rotating a monitor around an instrument, the mechanism comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">(i) a cam fixedly mounted on the instrument in a plane generally parallel to the plane of rotation of the monitor, the outer profile of the cam having at least one lobe directed towards a corner of the instrument,</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">(ii) an extendible arm assembly comprising an outer section attached to the monitor, and an inner section attached to at least one of the cam or the instrument by means of a rotary bearing, the outer section of the extendible assembly arm being slidingly attached to the inner section of the extendible assembly arm by means of a spring mechanism, positioned to apply a tensional force to the monitor in the direction towards the rotary bearing, and</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0010">(iii) a cam follower attached to the outer section of the extendible arm assembly, such that as the extendible arm assembly is rotated, the cam follower traces the outer profile of the cam, thereby causing the outer section of the extendible arm also to trace the outer profile of the cam.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">In such a mechanism, the cam follower may be a pin, adapted to slide along the outer profile of the cam. In either of the above cases, the outer profile of the cam may further comprise at least one hollow positioned closer to the rotary bearing than the regions on either side of the hollow, the hollow being positioned such that when the extendible arm assembly is at an angle that passes through the hollow, the monitor is positioned along a side of the instrument, and in close proximity to the side of the instrument. In this disclosure, the term hollow may be understood as a gradual indentation of the outer profile of the cam relative to the surrounding parts of the profile either side of the indentation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">In any of the above mentioned mechanisms, the distance of the outer edge of the cam lobe from the rotary bearing may be such that when the extendible arm assembly is at an angle that passes through the corner of the instrument, the monitor is positioned beyond the corner of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">Furthermore, the lobe may be such that a line between the rotary bearing and the furthest point from the rotary bearing to the outer edge of the cam lobe, passes through or close to the corner of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The extendible arm assembly may comprise two plates connected such that one slides along the other, or it may comprise two cylindrical elements connected such that one slides within the other.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Embodiments of the present disclosure will be understood and appreciated more fully from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref> show prior art solutions for viewing the monitor of an instrument from different angles;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an isometric view of an exemplary implementation of the monitor arrangement as described in the current disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref> depict the elements of an exemplary implementation of the monitor positioner in plan-view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and from the side elevation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>); and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref> illustrate two positions of a monitor and its attaching arm, as the monitor moves around the corner of an instrument by means of a cam mechanism.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, showing a top view of a configuration of an instrument <b>10</b> having monitors <b>11</b> attached to several of its faces, such that it can be viewed from those several faces. Having several monitors, each attached to one side of the instrument, provides the necessary ability to view the output of the instrument from multiple angles. This solution has the obvious disadvantages of cost. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates another prior art solution, in which a monitor <b>11</b> is rotated around an instrument <b>10</b> by means of a connecting arm <b>12</b> extending between the monitor and the instrument, and which rotates around a single fixed point <b>13</b> positioned near the center of the instrument, equidistant from opposite sides of the instrument. In this orientation, the monitor <b>11</b> must be situated at a sufficient distance from the instrument in order to pass the corners of the instrument during rotation, as illustrated by the dashed circle. Such a configuration would result in the monitor requiring significant more space than a single monitor attached directly to the front of the instrument. Having the monitor hanging at a distance from the instrument face also carries additional risk of damage to the monitor or to a person navigating around the instrument. Both the use of precious office space and the potential for damage are disadvantages of this solution.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, illustrating an isometric schematic overall view of an implementation of the present disclosure, having a single monitor <b>21</b> positioned on the surface of one side of the instrument <b>20</b>, the monitor being attached to the instrument by a connecting bar or arm <b>27</b>. The instrument <b>20</b> may be positioned in a fixed position on a stable surface such as the floor, a table, or a desktop <b>24</b>. The arm <b>27</b> is fastened at one end to the top of the instrument by means of a pivot bearing, such that it is free to rotate. The other end of the arm <b>27</b> is attached to the monitor <b>21</b>. As will be illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, using the novel features of the present disclosure, the monitor <b>21</b> is able to be rotated to position <b>21</b>&#x2032;, where it will be flush on another face of the instrument, yet without having collided with the corner of the instrument as it is rotated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, which show a mechanism of an exemplary implementation of the instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, enabling the monitor <b>31</b> to swivel around the instrument in a manner which enables the monitor to clear the corner of the instrument, and yet keeps the monitor flush with the face when the rotation of the monitor positions it opposite a face. The system enables rotation of the monitor to either or both sides of the original position. The rotation mechanism may allow the arm to rotate over <b>360</b> degrees, allowing the monitor to be viewed from any side of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, illustrating a monitor <b>31</b> that can be swiveled around a rotary bearing <b>36</b> by an arm <b>37</b>. The system also comprises a cam <b>32</b> mounted on the instrument, whose profile is followed by a cam follower <b>33</b> defining the distance of the monitor from the rotary bearing. The cam <b>32</b> may be fixedly attached to the top or the bottom of the instrument <b>30</b>. In the examples illustrated in this disclosure, the monitor rotating mechanism is shown mounted on the top of the instrument, though it is to be understood that this is only one option, and that it could also be mounted on the bottom, or even on both top and bottom. The monitor is attached by means of an extendible arm <b>37</b> to a rotary bearing <b>36</b> mounted on the top of the instrument, such that the monitor can swing around the instrument on the end of the arm <b>37</b>. The arm is extendible such that as the monitor approaches the protruding corner of the instrument, the arm extends such that the monitor does not hit the corner of the instrument. The outer extendible part of the arm <b>34</b>, is attached to the inner part of the arm by means of spring elements <b>35</b>, which generate a tensional force between the two parts of the arm, such that they tend to shorten the length of arm, if not prevented from doing so by an external element. Such an external element is the cam follower <b>33</b> mounted on the outer extendible part of the arm <b>37</b>, which, as the arm and monitor are rotated, runs along the surface profile of a cam <b>32</b>, mounted fixedly on the instrument. The cam profile is shaped such that when the monitor is located at the front of the instrument, the cam follower is in a depression of the cam profile, which is the closest point of the cam profile, in that sector of the cam, to the bearing <b>36</b>, the distance from the cam follower <b>33</b> to the bearing in conjunction with the lengths of the two parts of the arm being such that the monitor <b>31</b> sits essentially on the face of the instrument. This is a position of minimal potential energy of the spring system, which operates to pull the monitor towards the bearing. Moving on either side away from the cam depression, the cam profile has a lobe extending out towards the corner of the instrument, the distance from the bearing axis to the furthermost point of the lobe being such that the cam follower <b>33</b> pushes the outer section of the extendable arm as it reaches the corner, sufficiently that the monitor just traverses the corner. The cam profile is shaped such that after the monitor has traversed the corner, the cam follower is again allowed to move closer to the bearing until it reaches a second depression <b>38</b> in the cam profile which is positioned at a distance from the bearing axis such that the monitor sits on or close to the side face of the instrument. For symmetrically shaped instruments, the cam generally has bilateral symmetry such that a similar profile is found on the opposite side of the instrument with the second depression <b>39</b> causing the monitor to sit on the opposite face. If the instrument is not rectilinear, the aligned positions of depression <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, may be located at other than <b>90</b>&#xb0; from the front depression <b>33</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, three potential positions of the cam follower are shown. In addition to the position in which cam follower <b>33</b> is positioned, movement to either the right or left will result in the cam follower following an outwardly arced trajectory so that the monitor avoids the corners of the instrument, and coming to rest in either of two positions represented by dotted circles <b>38</b> or <b>39</b>. It is to be understood that the present illustration is one exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. In some implementations, alternate shape configurations of the cam <b>32</b> may be used, such that the monitor has further stable positions and viewing angles.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, showing a side view of the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. This view illustrates how the various components are connected and attached. The rotary bearing <b>36</b> is fixably attached to the instrument <b>30</b>, and the arm <b>37</b> rotates around the bearing. In this embodiment the extendable arm <b>37</b> is shown having another flat element <b>34</b>, which slides along a slot along the length of that part of the extendible arm which is radially static relative to the rotary bearing. This arrangement for providing the radially sliding motion is only one suggested implementation, and any other suitable arrangement is also feasible, such as a pair of tubes, one sliding inside the other (not shown in the drawings). The springs <b>35</b> should be selected such that they have sufficient tension to hold the monitor securely in place, but are able to be extended in order to move the monitor outwards away from the rotary bearing, without undue effort. The pins that attach the bar <b>34</b> to the arm <b>37</b> allow lateral movement or sliding of the bar and the monitor relative to the arm, as shown by the dotted arrow, as the cam follower <b>33</b> moves laterally around the cam <b>32</b>, moving the monitor with it.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, illustrating the cam mechanism in operation as the monitor <b>31</b> is rotated around the pivot bearing <b>36</b> on the top of the instrument <b>30</b>. The outer section of the arm <b>34</b> holding the monitor <b>31</b> is attached to the inner section of the arm <b>37</b> by means of a set of springs <b>35</b> or other slidable mechanism. As the arm rotates away from its position with the monitor closest to the instrument, the cam follower rides the cam profile pushing the outer section of the arm <b>34</b> and hence also the monitor <b>31</b> further from the pivot <b>36</b>, stretching the springs <b>35</b> as the monitor rotates in order to keep the cam follower in contact with the cam profile. The trajectory of the monitors movement is controlled by the shape of the cam <b>32</b>, and by the movement of the cam follower <b>33</b> along the edge of the cam <b>32</b>. Because the cam follower <b>33</b> is fixedly attached to the bar <b>34</b>, the motion of the bar <b>34</b>, and thus of the monitor <b>31</b>, is constrained by the path of the cam follower <b>33</b> along the groove of the cam <b>32</b>. The motion of the arm <b>37</b> is limited to rotation around the rotary bearing <b>36</b>. The lateral motion of the monitor away from the instrument is enabled because of stretching of the springs <b>35</b>, that allows the outer arm section <b>34</b> to slide relative to the arm <b>37</b>. As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, when the cam follower reaches the indentation on the cam, the monitor <b>31</b> is arranged to come to rest parallel to an adjacent side of the instrument <b>30</b> from its original position. Rotation of the monitor in the opposite direction will result in the monitor being positioned on the opposite face of the instrument to the position in <b>4</b>B. Depending on the desired positions of the monitor, in other embodiments the cam may be fashioned in any number of useful shapes that fit the shape of the instrument and accomplish the desired movement of the monitor or other attached element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Whereas embodiments of the present disclosure have focused on the movable attachment of a vertical monitor to a desktop instrument, it is understood that embodiments of the disclosed cam follower and cam mechanism could be applied to any number of other situations.
