APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086397, filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 1, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a technology for dealing with a fault in a fuel cell system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A fuel cell system may generate electric energy by using a fuel cell stack. For example, when hydrogen is used as a fuel of the fuel cell stack, it may be a measure of solving global environmental problems, and thus researches and developments on fuel cell systems have been continuously made. A fuel cell system may include a fuel cell stack that generates electrical energy, a fuel supply device that supplies a fuel (hydrogen) to the fuel cell stack, an air supply device that supplies oxygen in air, which is an oxidizer that is necessary for an electric chemical reaction, to the fuel cell stack, and a thermal management system (TMS) that removes reaction heat of the fuel cell stack to the outside, controls an operation temperature of the fuel cell stack, and performs a water management function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The thermal management system is a kind of a cooling device that circulates an anti-freezing liquid that functions as cooling water in a fuel cell system and maintain the fuel cell stack at a proper temperature (for example, 60 to 70&#xb0; C.), and may include a TMS line, in which the cooling water circulates, a reservoir in which the cooling water is stored, a pump that circulates the cooling water, and an ion filter that removes ions included in the cooling water, and a radiator that discharges the heat of the cooling water to the outside. Furthermore, the thermal management system may include a heater that heats the cooling water, and an air conditioning system (for example, a heater for heating) that cools and heats an interior of a device (e.g., a vehicle) including the fuel cell system by using the cooling water. The thermal management system may maintain a proper temperature of a power electronic component of the vehicle as well as the fuel cell stack.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The fuel cell system may include a valve to adjust a flow path of the cooling water, and may include a return spring as an internal component of the valve. Because the valve including the return spring is fully opened in a direction of a radiator regardless of an operation of the actuator to compulsorily adjust the flow path, the fuel cell system may secure a cooling degree in a situation in which a function of the valve is problematic.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art while advantages achieved by the prior art are maintained intact.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recently, for small sizes and light weights of the valves, a measure of using a valve, from which the return spring is removed, in a fuel cell system has been discussed. When a function of a valve without any return spring has a defect, a fuel cell system may not secure a necessary cooling degree, and when a cooling degree of the fuel cell system is not secured, a durability of a vehicle, a construction machine, or a flying object including the fuel cell system may be problematic, and moreover, safety of passengers may be threatened.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The technical problems to be solved by the present inventive concept are not limited to the aforementioned problems, and any other technical problems not mentioned herein will be clearly understood from the following description by those skilled in the art to which the present disclosure pertains.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a fuel cell system includes a fuel cell stack, a first cooling line having first cooling water that passes via the fuel cell stack and circulates therein, a first radiator disposed on the first cooling line and that cools the first cooling water, an air conditioning system disposed on a first connection line that forms a heating loop with the first cooling line, a first cooling fan that blows exterior air to the first radiator, a first pump disposed on the first cooling line and that pumps the first cooling water, a valve that switches a flow path of the first cooling water to the fuel cell stack or the first radiator, and a controller connected to the first cooling fan, the first pump, and the valve, and the controller is configured to detect a failure of the valve, control an RPM of the first pump and an RPM of the first cooling fan to a maximum level, and control an RPM of a blower of the air conditioning system to a maximum level.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method for operating a fuel cell system including a fuel cell stack includes detecting a failure of a valve that switches a flow path of first cooling water to a fuel cell stack or a first radiator depending on an opening degree of the valve, controlling an RPM of a first pump that pumps the first cooling water and an RPM of a first cooling fan that blows exterior air to the first radiator to maximum values, and controlling an RPM of a blower of an air conditioning system that foams a heating loop with the first cooling line, in which the first cooling water flows.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a fuel cell system according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate a fuel cell system, in which first cooling water flows, according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a fuel cell system according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a fuel cell system according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate a first pipeline and a second pipeline according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of a fuel cell system according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a structure of an air conditioning system according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an operation flowchart when a failure of a valve is detected, according to various embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another operation flowchart when a failure of a valve is detected, according to various embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With regard to description of drawings, the same or similar components may be marked by the same or similar reference numerals.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

As an example, when the measured temperature of the first cooling water that circulates along the first cooling line <b>110</b> is lower than a preset target temperature, the flow rate of the introduced first cooling water may be controlled to be lower than a preset flow rate. In this way, because the flow rate of the first cooling water introduced into the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> is controlled to be low when the measured temperature of the first cooling water is low, a thermal impact or deterioration of performance due to a deviation between the temperature of the first cooling water staying in the interior of the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> and the temperature of the first cooling water introduced into the fuel cell stack <b>10</b> may be advantageously minimized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A second cooling line <b>120</b> passes via a power electronic part <b>200</b>, and the second cooling water may circulate along the second cooling line <b>120</b>.
