More specifically, an insulated container having a retaining member that holds bottles of different shapes and sizes, while also maintaining the temperature of bottle and eliminating condensation thereon, is described.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Maintaining the temperature of bottled beverages, such as wine and champagne, is vital to enjoying the complete characteristics each beverage has to offer. Various types of coolers are used to chill or impart cooler temperatures to such bottled beverages. For instance, ice is often placed in such coolers and the bottled beverages are placed in the coolers, such that that they are in contact with the ice and become cooler based on the contact. A disadvantage with such coolers is that once the ice melts, the remaining water may become warm and unable to maintain a colder temperature for the bottled beverage. Another disadvantage is that once the bottled beverage is removed from the cooler, large amounts of liquid may remain on the external surface of the bottled beverages, which may make the bottles slippery and cause the bottles to fall out of the user's hands. This may be dangerous to the user and others nearby, particular when the bottles are made of glass.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other variations of coolers may be in the form of individual bottle holders within which the bottle beverages are positioned. Such bottle holders may include inner and outer shells, and an insulating material arranged between the inner and outer shells. Such insulating material may include, for instance, refrigerant/coolant, gel, and other types of freezable liquid. In order to secure the inner and outer shells together and prevent leakage of the liquid, gaskets or rubber materials are used. The inner shell may include several rubberized materials or spacers joined to the inner surface of the bottle holder to secure the bottle in place and adjust to bottles that have different diameters. In addition, the inner surfaces may include a stepped portion to receive bottles that are wider and shorter, or bottles that are narrower. The bottle holders may include a cap or stopper for covering the bottle holder. When a bottled beverage is housed in the bottle holders, the bottled beverage may be completely enclosed within the bottle holder, requiring the user to remove the cap/lid, and in some instances, the bottled beverage in order to retrieve the beverage (or pour from the bottle), which may be cumbersome. These typical bottle holders include numerous components, and numerous shapes, which may be expensive and difficult to manufacture and assemble.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the disadvantages associated with presently available bottle holders, there is a need for an insulating vessel that houses bottled beverages within the vessel, and is able to maintain the temperature of bottles that are warm and the temperature of bottles that are cold. There is a further need for a vessel that is able to accommodate bottles of different shapes and sizes, while also allowing users to pick up the vessel and pour the contents of the bottle without having to remove the bottle from the vessel. Additionally, there is a need for an insulating vessel that prevents the formation of condensation on the surface of a bottled beverage housed therein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, the disclosure is directed to a retaining member for a vacuum-insulated vessel, comprising a body portion and a deformable member.

The various described features are not necessarily drawn to scale, but are drawn to emphasize specific features relevant to some embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments. Each example is provided by way of explanation, and is not meant as a limitation and does not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an aspect, a vacuum-insulated vessel having a retaining member and a double-walled structure/insulated container is described. The vacuum-insulated vessel maintains the temperature of a bottle/bottled beverage housed therein, whether the initial temperature of the bottle is hot, warm or cold. The vacuum-insulated vessel also eliminates the formation of condensation on the external surface of the bottle. The vacuum-insulated vessel is able to receive and retain bottles of various sizes and/or shapes, while also allowing the user to pour the contents of the bottles without having to remove the bottles from the vessel. The vacuum-insulated vessel may be particularly useful for alcoholic beverages (or other chilled beverages), such as white or red wine, champagne, beer, and the like, which are often best enjoyed at specific temperature ranges, and come in various shapes and sizes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A retaining member is also generally described herein. The retaining member includes a frustoconical body having an upper portion and a lower portion, and a cylindrical skirt extending from the lower portion. As used herein, the term &#x201c;frustoconical&#x201d; may mean that the body has the general shape of a cone with a fractured tip (or open tip) forming an upper edge that is parallel to a lower edge of the cone. The lower portion of the frustoconical body is larger than the upper portion of the frustoconical body. The cylindrical skirt includes a plurality of external threads formed on its external surface. The threads may be one of continuous threads or interrupted threads. As used herein, &#x201c;continuous threads&#x201d; may mean a non-interrupted threaded closure having a spiral design (e.g., extending around the skirt like a helix), while &#x201c;interrupted threads&#x201d; may mean a non-continuous/segmented threaded pattern having gaps/discontinuities between each adjacent thread. In an embodiment, the retaining member includes a deformable member extending along an inner surface of the frustoconical body. The retaining member is configured for use with an insulated vessel/container for housing bottles of different shapes and sizes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For purposes of illustrating features of the embodiments, examples will now be introduced and referenced throughout the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these examples are illustrative and not limiting, and are provided purely for explanatory purposes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Turning now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary retaining member <b>30</b>. The retaining member <b>30</b> includes a generally frustoconical body <b>32</b> and a cylindrical skirt <b>40</b>. The body <b>32</b> and skirt <b>40</b> may be formed integrally with one another (e.g., as a single or unitary part or component), or may be formed separately from one another and joined to one another. In an embodiment, the frustoconical body <b>32</b> and the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> each comprise a substantially clear plastic material. The plastic materials utilized may include materials that are free from potentially health hazardous materials such as, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), and the like. According to an aspect, the frustoconical body <b>32</b> and the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> are formed from polymers or polymeric materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate (e.g., Tritan&#x2122;), acrylic, and the like, or any combination thereof. The frustoconical body <b>32</b> and the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> may be formed from a material suitable for food and/or drink contact. In some embodiments, the retaining member <b>30</b> is vacuum-insulated, by virtue of being formed with double walls and having air evacuated from the spaces between the double walls. This helps to eliminate conduction and/or convection across the surfaces of the retaining member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The frustoconical body <b>32</b> has an upper portion <b>34</b> (i.e., a first end), and a lower portion <b>36</b> (i.e., a second end). In an embodiment, an opening/aperture <b>38</b> (i.e., a void space) extends between the upper and lower portions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, so that the frustoconical body <b>32</b> is a hollow frustoconical body <b>32</b> having a pair of open ends <b>38</b>&#x2032;, <b>38</b>&#x2033; opposite one another. The lower portion <b>36</b> has an outer diameter OD<sub>3</sub>, which is larger than a respective outer diameter OD<sub>2 </sub>of the upper portion <b>34</b>. The outer diameters OD<sub>2</sub>, OD<sub>3 </sub>of the lower and upper portions <b>36</b>, <b>34</b> may be sized to increase or decrease an outward taper of the frustoconical body <b>32</b> from the upper portion <b>34</b> to the lower portion <b>36</b>, which may help facilitate the ability for the frustoconical body <b>32</b> to be received by the necks and/or shoulders of bottles <b>70</b> having different sizes and shapes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The frustoconical body <b>32</b> has an inner surface <b>31</b> and an outer surface <b>33</b>. As seen for instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a deformable member <b>60</b> (e.g., a gasket or seal) may be positioned along the inner surface <b>31</b>. The deformable member <b>60</b> may extend around the inner surface <b>31</b> along the upper portion <b>34</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. In an embodiment, the deformable member <b>60</b> may be a single layer of material that extends from the upper portion <b>34</b> to the lower portion <b>36</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>, so that it is adjacent to and extends along the entire inner surface <b>31</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. The deformable member <b>60</b> may be formed from any material that may be repeatably compressed and/or is able to maintain compression for an extended period of time. Such materials include rubber, plastic, foam, and the like. The deformable member may be formed from an opaque material. According to an aspect, the deformable member is a material having a uniform consistent thickness along its length.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref> illustrate a further embodiment of a deformable member (a multilayered deformable member) <b>160</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> is disposed within the opening <b>38</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>, with at least a portion of the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> extending along the inner surface <b>32</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> illustrate the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> having a circumferential edge portion <b>161</b>. The circumferential edge portion <b>161</b> may be sized to fit snugly within the opening <b>38</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b> at its upper portion <b>34</b>. According to an aspect, the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b> may be secured to the frustoconical body <b>32</b> by any fastening mechanism, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b> may include a groove that extends around its external surface and the upper portion <b>34</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b> may include a protrusion that engages with the groove, thus retaining the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> in place.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As seen for instance, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> includes a first layer <b>162</b> that extends away from the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b>. The first layer <b>162</b> extends along the inner surface <b>31</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>, and has the same general shape of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. According to an aspect, the first layer <b>162</b> is attached to, adhered to or otherwise connected to the inner surface <b>31</b>. As described hereinabove with respect to the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b>, the first layer <b>162</b> may be secured to the inner surface <b>31</b> by any securing/fastening mechanism. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to glues, fasteners, and the like. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the multilayered deformable member <b>160</b> includes a plurality of concentric layers <b>164</b> positioned inwardly from the first layer <b>162</b>. The first layer and each of the additional concentric layers are arranged in a spaced apart configuration with respect to each other. The concentric layers <b>164</b> downwardly extend from either the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b> or from the first layer <b>162</b>. Each concentric layer <b>164</b> has a resilient free end <b>163</b> having a peripheral edge <b>165</b>. A plurality of longitudinally opening notches <b>167</b> is formed in the peripheral edges <b>165</b> of the concentric layers <b>164</b>, which help to provide added flexibility and movement to the concentric layers <b>164</b>. The longitudinally opening notches <b>167</b> may be of any length, and may extend over a majority of the surface of the concentric layer <b>164</b> in which they are formed. According to an aspect, the notches <b>167</b> extend at a distance of up to about 75% the length of the concentric layer <b>164</b>. Alternatively, the notches <b>167</b> extend at a distance of up to about 50% the length of the concentric layer <b>164</b>. The notches <b>167</b> may be formed by removal of material from portions of the peripheral edges <b>165</b> of the concentric layers <b>164</b>, and may have any general shape, such as tubular, rectangular, and the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the concentric layers <b>164</b> may include a first concentric layer <b>166</b> and a second concentric layer <b>168</b>. The first concentric layer <b>166</b> is laterally and longitudinally spaced apart from the second concentric layer <b>168</b>. According to an aspect, the first concentric layer <b>166</b> downwardly extends from the circumferential edge portion <b>161</b>, while the second concentric layer <b>168</b> downwardly extends from an intermediate position of the first layer <b>162</b> (i.e., a position between the upper and lower portions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>). The first concentric layer <b>166</b> is inwardly positioned from the first layer <b>162</b>, and the second concentric layer <b>168</b> is circumferentially positioned around the first concentric layer <b>166</b>, such that it is positioned generally between the first concentric layer <b>166</b> and the first layer <b>162</b>. Each of the first and second concentric layers <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> have a respective length L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), which may be sized so that they do not extend beyond the lower portion <b>36</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. In at least one embodiment, the respective lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> of the first and second concentric layers <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> are the same, so that their peripheral edge portions are vertically spaced apart from each other. Alternatively, the respective lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> of the first and second concentric layers <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> are different from each other. For example, the length L<b>1</b> of the first concentric layer <b>166</b> may be greater than the length L<b>2</b> of the second concentric layer <b>168</b>, and their peripheral edges <b>165</b> are equidistantly spaced apart from the skirt <b>40</b> of the retaining member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> of the retaining member <b>30</b> extends from the lower portion <b>36</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. According to an aspect, the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> is integrally formed with the frustoconical body <b>32</b>. In other words, the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> may extend from the frustoconical body <b>32</b>, such that it is adjacent or connected to the lower portion <b>36</b>. The cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> may frictionally engage with an internal surface of an insulated container <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> includes a plurality of external threads <b>42</b> formed on its external surface <b>44</b>. The external threads <b>42</b> may be interrupted/non-continuous threads (see, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>) or continuous/spiral threads (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>). In an embodiment, the external threads <b>42</b> are configured to mate/engage with corresponding internal threads <b>28</b> formed on an internal surface <b>29</b> of an insulated container <b>20</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> includes an outer diameter OD<sub>1 </sub>that is slightly less that an inner diameter ID of the insulated container <b>20</b>, so that the external threads <b>42</b> and the internal threads <b>28</b> engage with each other to adjustably secure the retaining member <b>30</b> to the insulated container <b>20</b>. The external threads <b>42</b> help to provide sealing and resealing of the insulated container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the disclosure are further directed to a vacuum-insulated vessel <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the vacuum-insulated vessel <b>10</b> includes a double-walled structure <b>20</b>. The double-walled structure <b>20</b> is vacuum-insulated so that interstitial spaces between each wall of the double-walled structure <b>20</b> are devoid of air. This provides a significant reduction of the transference of heat by conduction or convection, and increases the length of time that the temperature of the contents of a bottle placed in the vacuum-insulated vessel <b>10</b> may remain hot, warm or cold. The double-walled structure <b>20</b> may include plastic and/or metallic materials suitable for food and/or water contact. According to an aspect, the double-walled structure <b>20</b> may be formed from a metal, such as, stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an aspect, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the double-walled structure <b>20</b> includes a closed end <b>22</b>, an open end <b>24</b>, and a cylindrical body <b>26</b> that extends between the closed and open ends <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The open end <b>24</b> is configured to receive bottles <b>70</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) within an internal space <b>25</b> of the double-walled structure <b>20</b>, while the closed end <b>22</b> provides a surface for seating the bottle <b>70</b> thereon within the internal space <b>25</b>. The double-walled structure <b>20</b> may include a plurality of indentations <b>50</b> formed in its external surface <b>27</b>. In an embodiment, the indentations <b>50</b> extend from the closed end <b>22</b> of the double-walled structure <b>20</b> to an intermediate position between the closed end <b>22</b> and the open end <b>24</b>. The indentations <b>50</b> may be flattened areas/depressions formed in the cylindrical body <b>26</b>. In an embodiment, the indentations <b>50</b> are configured as rectangle-shaped flattened areas, the longer sides of the rectangle-shaped flattened areas extending from the closed end <b>22</b> towards the open end <b>24</b>. The indentations <b>50</b> extend inwardly towards an internal space/chamber <b>25</b> of the double-walled structure <b>20</b> and may function as grip areas/surfaces for placement of the user's fingers to help provide a more secure/stable grip for a user of the vacuum-insulated vessel <b>10</b>. The indentations <b>50</b> may also enhance the user's comfort when holding the double-walled structure <b>20</b>, inserting a bottle within the internal space <b>25</b> of double-walled structure <b>20</b>, rotatably securing a retaining member <b>30</b> on the open end <b>24</b> of double-walled structure <b>20</b>, and pouring/dispensing liquid from a bottle <b>70</b> secured in the vacuum-insulated vessel <b>10</b>. As seen, for instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the indentations <b>50</b> may span more than 50% of a length L<b>3</b> of the body <b>26</b>. In an embodiment, the indentations <b>50</b> are bilateral indentations <b>50</b>&#x2032; (i.e., a pair of indentations) (as seen in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>), formed on opposite portions of the external surface <b>27</b>. It is to be understood, however, the number of indentations <b>50</b> provided on the external surface <b>27</b> may be modified. For instance, a single indentation <b>50</b> may be formed in the double-walled structure <b>20</b>.

In an embodiment, the cylindrical skirt <b>40</b> has a greater number of the external threads <b>42</b> (or rows of external threads <b>42</b>) than the internal threads <b>28</b> of the double-walled structure <b>20</b>.

This also provides for the adjustment of the distance D<b>2</b> between the lower portion <b>36</b> of the frustoconical body <b>32</b> and the open end <b>24</b> of the double-walled structure <b>20</b>.
