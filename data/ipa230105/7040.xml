It is a serious issue for both consumers and providers of cloud-based services. One common type of network security threat is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack which is initiated by an attacker against a computer or a network of systems to deliberately restrict or prevent accessibility of resources to authorized users. Individual networks may be affected by DoS attacks or the infrastructure of a distributed computing environment hosted by the network's internet service provider (ISP) or cloud service provider (CSP) can be targeted, resulting in a loss of service. A particularly concerning type of DoS attack is a volumetric DoS attack that occurs when an attacker floods a network server with a high volume of communication traffic. The volume of traffic can be so large that the attacked entity is no longer able to process legitimate traffic in a timely manner. The monitoring of systems and/or services to detect malicious attacks especially in distributed computing environments is very essential. DoS detection and mitigation approaches have been developed that monitor network traffic and detect DoS attacks in such environments. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to effectively detect and reduce the impact of these types of attacks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates generally to detecting and mitigating DoS attacks in distributed networking environments. More specifically, but not by way of limitation, this disclosure describes techniques for monitoring and analyzing network traffic data in a distributed networking environment using a set of pre-defined threshold criteria. This disclosure additionally describes techniques for automatically invoking various mitigation techniques that take actions on malicious traffic based at least in part on the analysis and the pre-defined threshold criteria. The actions allow only valid traffic to be forwarded back to the network and route the malicious traffic to a quarantined environment, isolating it from production.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, a method for detecting and mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in a cloud services provider (CSP) network is disclosed. The method includes for a first entity deployed in a first region of the CSP network, monitoring, by a computer system (e.g., a DoS detection and monitoring system), a flow of network traffic data originating from the first entity and destined to a second entity remote from the first entity. In certain examples, the CSP network is configured to provision a set of infrastructure resources for deployment by at least the first entity in the first region of the CSP network. The method further includes determining, by the computer system, that the flow of network traffic data originating from the first entity exceeds a threshold value based on the monitoring. In certain examples, the threshold value identifies at least one network traffic data value related to the flow of network traffic data indicative of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in the CSP network. The method then includes responsive to the determining, identifying, by the computer system, an action to be taken to mitigate the DoS attack in the CSP network and performing, by the computer system, the action to mitigate the DoS attack in the CSP network.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain embodiments, the monitoring includes analyzing a plurality of network traffic data values related to the flow of network traffic data from a cluster of internal routing devices within the CSP network and determining that the network traffic data value related to the flow of the network traffic data exceeds a first threshold value based on the analysis. In certain examples, the network traffic data value comprises at least one of a packet generation frequency or a packet size related to packets in the flow of network traffic data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain examples, the method further comprises transmitting a first alert to a user of the CSP network based at least in part on determining that the network traffic data value related to the flow of network traffic data exceeds the first threshold value. In certain examples, the first alert is transmitted as an email message to a user of the CSP network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, monitoring the flow of network traffic data originating from the first entity comprises analyzing the plurality of network traffic data values related to the flow of network traffic data from the cluster of internal routing devices within the CSP network and based on the analysis, determining that the network traffic data value related to the flow of network traffic data exceeds a second threshold value. In certain examples, the second threshold value is greater than the first threshold value.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain examples, the method further comprises triggering an internal mitigation plan to mitigate the DoS attack based on determining that the network traffic data value related to the flow of network traffic data exceeds the second threshold value. In certain examples, the internal mitigation plan identifies a set of one or more actions to mitigate the DoS attack.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, a first action in the set of one or more actions causes an instruction to be transmitted by the computer system to a cluster of internal routing devices within the CSP network to limit a rate of the flow of network traffic data from the first entity to the second entity. A second action comprises transmitting, by the computer system, an instruction to the cluster of internal routing devices to tag a prefix of the Internet Protocol address of the first entity to block the flow of network traffic data transmitted from the first entity to the second entity. A third action comprises an instruction transmitted by the computer system to the cluster of internal routing devices to divert the flow of network traffic data transmitted from the first entity to a Remote triggered Blackhole (RTBH).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the second entity is deployed in a second region of CSP network. The CSP network is configured to provision a set of infrastructure resources for deployment by the second entity in the second region. In certain embodiments, the second entity is an external entity deployed in a network external to the CSP network. In certain embodiments, the DoS attack comprises at least one of a volumetric DoS attack or a volumetric Distributed DoS attack in the CSP network.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Features, embodiments, and advantages of the present disclosure are better understood when the following Detailed Description is read with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a high level diagram of a distributed computing environment of a cloud services provider (CSP) network that includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; Denial of Service (DoS) attack within the CSP network, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a high level diagram of a distributed environment showing a CSP network that includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;outbound&#x201d; DoS attack within the CSP network, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a high level diagram of a distributed environment showing a CSP network that includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; DoS attack within the CSP network, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example of a process for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; Denial of Service (DoS) attack within a CSP network, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an example of a process for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; Denial of Service (DoS) attack within a CSP network, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating one pattern for implementing a cloud infrastructure as a service system, according to at least one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating another pattern for implementing a cloud infrastructure as a service system, according to at least one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating another pattern for implementing a cloud infrastructure as a service system, according to at least one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating another pattern for implementing a cloud infrastructure as a service system, according to at least one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example computer system, according to at least one embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of certain embodiments. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a cloud-based environment, users or customers can avail of services provided by a cloud services provider (CSP) on demand (e.g., via a subscription model) using systems and infrastructure (cloud infrastructure) provided by the CSP. For instance, the CSP can provide infrastructure that can be used by customers to build their own customizable networks and deploy customer resources. The customer's resources and networks are thus hosted in a distributed computing environment by infrastructure provided by the CSP. Detecting, preventing and/or minimizing DoS attacks in such distributed computing environments can be a challenging process. Typically the detection of attacks is performed manually by a user (e.g., an administrator of the CSP network) who identifies the services and/or systems that have become unavailable and/or the entity that caused the attack within the distributed environment. For instance, the administrator may identify services and/or systems having technical problems while performing routine maintenance of the CSP network as a symptom of a DoS attack. Symptoms of a DoS attack may also detected when there is unusually slow network performance, unavailability of a system/service in the network and so on. In certain instances, the administrator may also manually analyze network flow data statistics for different sampled flows of network traffic data from devices (e.g., routers) within the computing environment to detect symptoms of DoS attacks. Oftentimes, this requires several hours of troubleshooting by the administrator before an accurate diagnosis can be made and an appropriate action be taken.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The DoS Detection and Mitigation system described in the present disclosure provides several technical advancements over existing DoS detection and mitigation capabilities available in distributed computing environments. The DoS Detection and Mitigation system described herein automatically detects and mitigates an impacting DoS attack before it can cause link saturation and/or impact the infrastructure of a distributed computing environment. The DoS Detection and Mitigation system is very flexible and dynamic in nature. It includes capabilities for analyzing network flow data statistics for different sampled flows of network traffic data within the distributed computing environment and using a set of pre-defined threshold criteria can automatically invoke various mitigation techniques. The mitigation techniques take various actions on malicious traffic by allowing only valid traffic to be forwarded back to the network and route the malicious traffic to a quarantined environment, isolating it from production.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, the disclosed DoS Detection and Mitigation system includes capabilities for automatically detecting and mitigating &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; DoS attacks that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows into the distributed computing environment of a CSP network from an external network (e.g., the Internet). In certain embodiments, the system additionally includes capabilities for monitoring internal traffic patterns within the distributed computing environment by monitoring and analyzing network traffic data originating from entities within the network. Unlike existing detection and mitigation approaches which primarily focus on securing external traffic entering their networks, the disclosed system includes capabilities for monitoring and analyzing internal traffic patterns that have infiltrated the network for detection of anomalies and insider threats. For example, the disclosed system includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating &#x201c;outbound&#x201d; DoS attacks by analyzing network traffic data originating from an entity within the network to a public network (e.g., the Internet) outside the network. In certain embodiments, the disclosed system includes capabilities for automatically detecting and mitigating &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; DoS attacks by analyzing network traffic data originating from a first entity located in a first data center of the network to a second entity located in a second data center of the network.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a high level diagram of a distributed computing environment <b>100</b> of a cloud services provider (CSP) network <b>102</b> that includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating an inbound Denial of Service (DoS) attack within the CSP network <b>102</b>, according to certain embodiments. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the devices, subsystems and services that make up the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b> include an edge routing device <b>104</b>, a cluster of internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N, a DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> and an internal mitigation service <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the CSP network <b>102</b> comprises infrastructure that can be used by customers of the CSP network <b>102</b> to build their own customizable networks (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>) and deploy customer resources. The customer's resources and networks are thus hosted in a distributed environment by the infrastructure provided by the CSP network <b>102</b>. The customer can use these provisioned resources to build private networks and deploy resources on these networks. In certain examples, the customer networks <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> that are hosted in the cloud by the CSP network <b>102</b> are referred to herein as virtual cloud networks (VCNs). Additional details of how customers can set up one or more virtual cloud networks (VCNs) using the CSP infrastructure resources allocated for the customer is discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain embodiments, the resources of the CSP network <b>102</b> may be distributed across one or more data centers that may be geographically spread across one or more regions. For instance, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the infrastructure provided by the CSP network <b>102</b> may be physically hosted in a data center in a first region (e.g., North America). The systems depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be implemented using software (e.g., code, instructions, program) executed by one or more processing units (e.g., processors, cores) of a computing system, hardware, or combinations thereof. The software may be stored on a non-transitory storage medium (e.g., on a memory device). The CSP network <b>102</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely an example and is not intended to unduly limit the scope of claimed embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many possible variations, alternatives, and modifications. For example, in some implementations, the CSP network <b>102</b> can be implemented using more or fewer systems, customer networks, or devices than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may combine two or more systems, or may have a different configuration or arrangement of systems.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain embodiments, the CSP network <b>102</b> provides improved capabilities for efficiently detecting and mitigating various types of DoS attacks within the CSP network <b>102</b>. Types of DoS attacks detected by the CSP network <b>102</b> include, but are not limited to, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks where multiple systems simultaneously attack a single system so that authorized clients are not able to get to the resources in the network, volumetric DoS attacks where resources in the network is consumed by increasing the number of requests or packet sizes to exhaust server processing and overload network resources, such as bandwidth in the targeted network, volumetric DDoS attacks where the attack originates from a network of systems designed to send a high amount of traffic, or packets, to a targeted network in an effort to overwhelm its bandwidth capabilities and/or to saturate its resources and so on.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> includes capabilities to detect an &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack within the CSP network <b>102</b>. The detection is performed by monitoring a flow of &#x201c;incoming&#x201d; network traffic data <b>122</b> as it enters the edge of the CSP network <b>102</b> from an external/public network (e.g., the Internet) <b>118</b>. In an embodiment, the flow of incoming network traffic data <b>122</b> is received by an edge routing device <b>104</b> within the CSP network <b>102</b>. The edge routing device <b>104</b> may be a specialized router that acts as a gateway at the edge or boundary of the CSP network <b>102</b>. The edge routing device <b>104</b> includes capabilities for sending and receiving data directly to the CSP network <b>102</b> from the public network <b>118</b> or vice versa. The edge routing device <b>104</b> thus acts as a connection point between the CSP Network <b>102</b> and the public network <b>118</b> and ensures connectivity between the CSP network and the public network.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain examples, the edge routing device <b>104</b> may be configured with capabilities to sample a subset of the flow of inbound network traffic data <b>122</b> destined to a particular destination IP address (e.g., customer network <b>116</b>) as it enters the CSP network <b>102</b>. The rate at which the flow of network traffic data is sampled may be pre-configured by an administrator of the CSP network <b>102</b> while setting up the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. By way of example, the edge routing device <b>104</b> may be configured to sample only one network packet for every 1000 network packets that it receives as part of the flow of network traffic data. As used herein a &#x201c;flow of network traffic data&#x201d; may refer to a unidirectional stream of packets that arrive at the edge routing device <b>104</b> having the same source and destination IP addresses. In a certain implementation, the sampling may be performed by a network traffic analyzer within the edge routing device <b>104</b>. By way of example, the network traffic analyzer may be implemented using the NetFlow&#xae; analyzer by Cisco Systems. The network traffic analyzer may be configured to accumulate network flow data statistics (e.g., the point of origin, destination, bandwidth, and network paths) for different flows of network traffic data samples. The accumulated network flow data statistics may subsequently be exported to a flow collection device within the edge routing device <b>104</b> for further processing by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain embodiments, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to detect an &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack on a customer network (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or <b>116</b>) based at least in part on analyzing the network flow data statistics from the edge routing device <b>104</b>. The DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may utilize any standard gateway protocol (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)) to communicate with the edge routing device <b>104</b> for the exchange of routing and reachability information to perform its analysis. In certain examples, the analysis may involve, obtaining by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>, network traffic data statistics (values) related to a sampled flow of network traffic data such as the total duration of the sampled flow, the total number of packets in the sampled flow, the average packet size in the sampled flow, the inter arrival time of the packets in the sampled flow, the packet generation frequency and so on.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Based at least in part on the analysis, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to automatically detect and mitigate an impacting &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack on a customer network (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or <b>116</b>) within the CSP network <b>102</b>. In certain examples, the detection and mitigation is performed in two phases. In a first phase, based at least in part on the analysis of a sampled flow of network traffic data (e.g., <b>122</b>) from the edge routing device <b>104</b>, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may trigger a &#x201c;first level alert.&#x201d; The &#x201c;first level alert&#x201d; (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d;) may be sent as a pre-emptive measure to a user (e.g., an administrator) of the CSP network <b>102</b> of an impacting volumetric DoS attack that may be building up that could affect a customer network or in-region infrastructure within the CSP network <b>102</b>. In certain examples, the &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; may be triggered by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> when the packet generation frequency and/or packet size observed from the packets in a sampled flow of network traffic data meets or exceeds a first threshold value but is less than a second threshold value. The threshold values (i.e., the first and second threshold values) may be pre-configured values set by a user (e.g., an administrator) of the CSP network <b>102</b> at the time of setting up the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. The threshold values identify network traffic data values (related to the flow of network traffic data) indicative of an impacting volumetric DoS attack within the CSP network. In certain examples, the first threshold value may be a value that is within a certain percentage (e.g., within plus or minus 25%) of the upper limit of the normal packet size in a flow of network traffic data. By way of example, packets may be captured at a 1:1000 sampling rate and inspected for irregular packet sizes that may be larger or smaller than the standard 1500 byte size. In this case, the first threshold value may be met when the packet size is larger than 1875 bytes or smaller than 1125 bytes. This threshold value may be applicable to both TCP and UDP packets. Threshold values may also vary based on protocol and the inspection being applied. As an example, a 10 Gbps link could trigger an initial threshold warning (&#x201c;first level alert) at 2 Gbps from any specific host generating network traffic or packet frequencies of 500 Kbps. In certain examples, a &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; may also be triggered by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> based on inspecting the payload of the packets with a known attack signature (or by creating a new signature) to block malicious network traffic. In certain examples, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to transmit the &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; as a message to the administrator (or to a team of users) within the CSP network <b>102</b> via one or more messaging applications.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a second phase, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to trigger a &#x201c;high level alert&#x201d; based at least in part on the analysis of the sampled flow of network traffic data from the edge routing device <b>104</b>. For instance, the &#x201c;high level alert&#x201d; may be triggered by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> when the packet size and/or the packet generation frequency in the sampled flow of network traffic reaches or exceeds a second threshold value. By way of example, the second threshold value may be set to a value that is within a certain percentage (e.g., within plus or minus 50%) of the upper limit of the normal packet size. Using the example above, a 10 Gbps link could trigger a &#x201c;high level alert&#x201d; at 4 Gbps from any specific host that is generating network traffic or packet frequencies of 1 Mbps. When the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> triggers a &#x201c;high level alert,&#x201d; it automatically activates an internal mitigation plan to mitigate the attack before the attack can cause link saturation or impact the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. In certain examples, the internal mitigation plan may identify a set of one or more actions for mitigating the attack. Each action may implement a specific mitigation technique on the malicious traffic by allowing only valid traffic to be forwarded back to the network while routing malicious traffic to a quarantined environment and isolating it from production.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For instance, if the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> determines that the attack is moderate, it may automatically invoke a first action in the internal mitigation plan. A moderate attack may be determined, for example, if at least one network data traffic value (e.g., the packet size and/or packet frequency) has exceeded the second threshold value and the network bandwidth (i.e., measured by the maximum amount of data that can transferred from one point to another within the CSP network <b>102</b> in a specific amount of time) increases to a certain value within a specific amount of time. By way of example, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may determine that the attack is moderate if the network bandwidth increases from 250 bits per second to 1000 kbits per second within a few seconds and the packet size for the flow of traffic has exceeded the second threshold value. In certain examples, an impact of an attack is defined based on traffic pattern variations. Network traffic data collected via the flow collection device may provide a baseline for normal traffic behavior over time. When traffic differs from the norm, it determines the severity of unusual activity based on set thresholds of breach levels. These levels may also be set based on acceptable traffic for each region.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain examples, the first action in the internal mitigation plan may, for instance, involve transmitting, by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>, a command/instruction to the edge routing device <b>104</b> to re-route the affected prefix (i.e., IP address identifying the customer network under attack) to an internal mitigation service <b>110</b>. For instance, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to inject a /32 route (indicative of the first 32 bits of the IP address) to the edge routing device <b>104</b> which gets reflected throughout the routing tables and route-reflectors of the edge routing device. The edge routing device <b>104</b> may then be configured to channel the specific IP address to the internal mitigation service <b>110</b>. By way of example, the internal mitigation service <b>110</b> may utilize a platform (e.g., based on the Arbor Networks Peakflow product) that is configured with the ability to divert the malicious traffic (i.e., the /32 IP being attacked) while allowing only valid traffic to be forwarded back to the CSP network <b>102</b> thereby allowing the rest of the customers within the CSP network <b>102</b> to continue to operate without any service disruption.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> determines that the impending attack is relatively large (e.g., the attack has potentially infrastructure impacting effects or may cause link saturation) or if the attack cannot effectively be mitigated by the internal mitigation subsystem <b>110</b>, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may automatically invoke a second action in the internal mitigation plan. The second action may involve, for instance, transmitting, by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>, an instruction to the edge routing device <b>104</b> to divert/re-route the malicious traffic to an upstream (external) mitigation service <b>120</b> that includes capabilities for monitoring the flow of network traffic directly through the edge routing device <b>104</b>. The instructions may involve exchanging routing and reachability information with the edge routing device <b>104</b>, performing constant routing change lookups for the IP address under attack through route-view services provided by BGP, tagging the affected prefix with a BGP Community (e.g., a number value that the edge routing device uses like a tag) that will send a command to the edge routing device <b>104</b> to automatically re-route the more specific IP address being attacked to the external mitigation service <b>120</b> prior to it re-entering the CSP network, performing route verification/leak checks and so on. In certain examples, the external mitigation service <b>120</b> may be provided by a third-party flow-based monitoring service (e.g., Akamai's Prolexic Flow-Based Monitoring) that provides services for mitigating DoS attacks by directly monitoring the flow of network traffic through the edge routing device <b>104</b> before it enters the CSP network <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the attack is determined to be critical, requires immediate action and/or cannot be handled either by the internal mitigation service <b>110</b> or the external mitigation service <b>120</b>, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may invoke a third action in the internal mitigation plan. This action may involve transmitting an instruction to the edge routing device to divert the traffic identifying the IP address under duress to a Remote triggered Blackhole (RTBH). RTBH is a filtering technique that may be used to effectively mitigate volumetric DoS attacks by filtering undesirable traffic even before it enters a protected network. Once an attack has been detected, RTBH filtering can be used to drop all attack traffic at the edge of the CSP network <b>102</b>, based on either destination or source IP addresses.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, by using a set of pre-defined threshold criteria, the disclosed DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to automatically invoke various mitigation techniques to take actions on malicious traffic by allowing only valid traffic to be forwarded back to the network and routing the malicious traffic to a quarantined environment, isolating it from production. In a traditional distributed environment without specific DoS detection techniques in place, DoS detection and mitigation is conventionally performed manually. As previously described, for instance, the detection is usually performed by a user (e.g., an administrator) within the CSP network <b>102</b> who has to manually identify the services and/or systems that have become unavailable and/or identify the entity (i.e., origin) that caused the attack. This may take several hours of troubleshooting by the administrator before a correct diagnosis can be made. For instance, the administrator may manually analyze network flow data statistics for different sampled flows of network traffic data from the edge routing device <b>104</b> before making an accurate diagnosis. Upon detecting an attack, the administrator then issues a command to a third party service (e.g., the internal mitigation service <b>110</b>) to divert the malicious traffic to a quarantined environment and isolating it from production.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> described in the present disclosure provides several technical advancements over existing DoS detection and mitigation capabilities available in distributed computing environments. The DoS Detection and Mitigation system described herein automatically detects and mitigates an impacting DoS attack before it can cause link saturation and/or impact the infrastructure of a distributed computing environment. The disclosed technique additionally eliminates the need for a user (e.g., an administrator) of the CSP network <b>102</b> to manually analyze network flow data statistics for different sampled flows of network traffic data and/or to communicate with a third party service to make decisions about the appropriate action to take when an attack is detected.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain embodiments such as the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> included capabilities for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack within the CSP network <b>102</b> by analyzing an &#x201c;incoming&#x201d; flow of network traffic data received from an external network (e.g., the Internet) <b>118</b> and directed to a particular destination address (e.g., a customer network, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or <b>116</b>) within the CSP network <b>102</b>. However, in certain situations, the computing instance that is generating the malicious network traffic may originate from within the CSP network <b>102</b> itself. For example, the malicious traffic may originate from an entity such as a customer network (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or <b>116</b>) within the CSP network <b>102</b>. Such an entity may overwhelm the CSP network <b>102</b> by generating a flood of &#x201c;outgoing&#x201d; network traffic data making the CSP network <b>102</b> and/or some of its services unavailable.

For example, in some implementations, the CSP network <b>102</b> can be implemented using more or fewer systems, devices, and/or customer networks than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may combine two or more systems, or may have a different configuration or arrangement of systems.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the infrastructure provided by the CSP network <b>102</b> was physically hosted in a single data center in a region (e.g., North America). In alternate embodiments, the resources of the CSP network <b>102</b> may be spread across one or more data centers that may be geographically spread across one or more regions. For instance, the infrastructure provided by the CSP network <b>102</b> may be physically hosted in two data centers in two different regions, North America and Europe. In certain embodiments, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating volumetric DoS attacks within the CSP network that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows in an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; direction within the CSP network. As used herein, &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; network traffic data refers to traffic that flows between one or more entities within a data center of the CSP network or between entities in two different data centers of the CSP network. For instance, &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; network traffic data may refer to traffic that flows from a first entity (e.g., a first customer network) in a first data center of the CSP network located in a first region to a second entity (e.g., a second customer network) in a second data center of the CSP network located in a second region.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus, in addition to detecting and mitigating DoS attacks that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows in the &#x201c;north-south&#x201d; direction or in the &#x201c;south-north&#x201d; direction within the CSP network described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> which typically indicates the flow of network traffic data from a public network to a data center of the CSP network and vice versa, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating DoS attacks that occur as a result of &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; network traffic data between entities located in different data centers of the CSP network.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> described in the present disclosure provides several technical advancements over conventional networking environments that at best include capabilities for detecting and mitigating &#x201c;inbound&#x201d; DoS attacks that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows in the &#x201c;north-south&#x201d; direction. By including capabilities to detect and mitigate &#x201c;outbound&#x201d; DoS attacks that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows in the &#x201c;south-north&#x201d; direction as well &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; DoS attacks that occur as a result of network traffic data that flows in the &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; direction, internal traffic patterns within the distributed computing environment that have infiltrated the network can be monitored for detection of anomalies and insider threats. Visibility into east-west traffic is critical for organizations to determine the best security practices for their networks and data centers. While many organizations tend to focus on securing external traffic that enters their networks, it is increasingly important for organizations to monitor internal traffic patterns for malware that has infiltrated the network and insider threats. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> describes the capabilities of the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> for detecting and mitigating DoS attacks that occur as a result of &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; network traffic data between entities located in different data centers of the CSP network.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a high level diagram of a distributed environment <b>300</b> showing a CSP network <b>102</b> that includes capabilities for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; DoS attack within the CSP network, according to certain embodiments. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first entity (e.g., customer network <b>116</b>) deployed in a first data center in a first region <b>302</b> of the CSP network transmits a flow of network traffic data <b>312</b> to a second entity (e.g., customer network <b>310</b>) deployed in a second data center in a second region <b>304</b> of the CSP network. The &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; flow of network traffic data <b>312</b> natively flows from the customer network <b>116</b> to a cluster of internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N located in the CSP network in the first region <b>302</b> that are configured to intercept and sample the flow <b>312</b> prior to transmitting the network traffic data to an endpoint (e.g., a cluster of internal routing devices <b>308</b>A-<b>308</b>N) located in a second region <b>304</b> of the CSP network. In certain examples, the cluster of internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N in the first region <b>302</b> may be configured with capabilities to monitor a subset (or a sample) of the flow <b>312</b> as it leaves the first region <b>302</b> of the CSP network. In a certain implementation, the cluster of internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N may include a network traffic analyzer (similar to the network traffic analyzer described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) that includes capabilities for sampling and accumulating network flow data statistics for &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; flows of network traffic data. The accumulated network flow data statistics may subsequently be exported to a flow collection device within the internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N for further processing by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain embodiments, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to detect an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack originating from a customer network (e.g., <b>116</b>) located in a first region <b>302</b> of the CSP network by analyzing network flow data statistics for the sampled flow <b>312</b> from the internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N. The DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may utilize any standard gateway protocol (e.g., BGP) to communicate with the internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N for the exchange of routing and reachability information to perform its analysis. As previously described in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the analysis may involve, obtaining by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>, network flow data statistics related to the sampled flow <b>312</b> such as the total duration of the sampled flow, the total number of packets in the sampled flow, the average packet size in the sampled flow, the inter arrival time of the packets in the sampled flow, the packet generation frequency and so on.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Based at least in part on the analysis, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to automatically detect and mitigate an &#x201c;east west&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack originating from the customer network <b>116</b> in the first region <b>302</b> to a different customer network <b>310</b> in a second region <b>304</b> of the CSP network. In certain examples, the detection and mitigation may be performed in a manner similar to the technique described for detecting and mitigating an &#x201c;outbound volumetric DoS&#x201d; attack described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For instance, in a first phase, based at least in part on the analysis of a sampled &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; flow of network traffic data from the first customer network (e.g., <b>116</b>) to the second customer network (e.g., <b>310</b>), the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may trigger a &#x201c;low level alert.&#x201d; The &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; may be indicative of a pre-emptive measure of any potential &#x201c;outbound&#x201d; DoS attack that may be building up that could affect the in-region infrastructure within the CSP network in the first region <b>302</b>. For instance, a &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; may be triggered by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> when the packet generation frequency and/or packet size observed from a sampled flow of network traffic data from a customer network (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or <b>116</b>) meets or exceeds a first threshold value but is less than a second threshold value. The threshold values may be pre-configured by an administrator of the CSP network <b>102</b> while setting up the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. The &#x201c;low level alert&#x201d; may be transmitted as a message to the administrator of the CSP network <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a second phase, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may be configured to trigger a &#x201c;high level alert&#x201d; based at least in part on the analysis of the sampled flow of network traffic data from the cluster of internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N. For instance, the &#x201c;high level alert&#x201d; may be triggered by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> when the packet size and/or the packet generation frequency (packets per second or bytes per second) reaches or exceeds a second threshold value. The second threshold value may be pre-configured by an administrator of the CSP network <b>102</b> while setting up the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. When the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> triggers a &#x201c;high level alert,&#x201d; it automatically activates an internal mitigation plan to mitigate the &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; DoS attack before the attack can cause link saturation or impact the infrastructure of the CSP network <b>102</b>. The internal mitigation plan may identify a set of one or more actions for mitigating the attack. For instance, in this embodiment, a first action to mitigate an &#x201c;east-west&#x201d; volumetric DoS attack may involve, transmitting, by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> a command/instruction to the internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N to limit the rate of flow of network traffic data from the first customer network <b>116</b> to be within a pre-set rate limit threshold. A second action may involve, transmitting, by the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b>, a command to the internal routing devices <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>N to tag the affected prefix with a BGP community to take action only on the prefix generating the attack (for e.g., by blocking the flow of network traffic data transmitted from the first entity) while allowing the rest of the customers in that production environment to continue to operate without any service disruption.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the attack is determined to be critical, requires immediate action and/or cannot be handled either by the internal routing devices, the DoS Detection and Mitigation system <b>108</b> may invoke a third action in the internal mitigation plan. This action may involve transmitting an instruction to the cluster of internal routing devices to completely block/divert the traffic by identifying the IP address under duress and diverting the traffic to a Remote triggered Blackhole (RTBH).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The systems depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be implemented using software (e.g., code, instructions, program) executed by one or more processing units (e.g., processors, cores) of a computing system, hardware, or combinations thereof.

IaaS can be configured to provide virtualized computing resources over a public network (e.g., the Internet). In an IaaS model, a cloud computing provider can host the infrastructure components (e.g., servers, storage devices, network nodes (e.g., hardware), deployment software, platform virtualization (e.g., a hypervisor layer), or the like). In some cases, an IaaS provider may also supply a variety of services to accompany those infrastructure components (e.g., billing, monitoring, logging, security, load balancing and clustering, etc.). Thus, as these services may be policy-driven, IaaS users may be able to implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some instances, IaaS customers may access resources and services through a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack. For example, the user can log in to the IaaS platform to create virtual machines (VMs), install operating systems (OSs) on each VM, deploy middleware such as databases, create storage buckets for workloads and backups, and even install enterprise software into that VM. Customers can then use the provider's services to perform various functions, including balancing network traffic, troubleshooting application issues, monitoring performance, managing disaster recovery, etc.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In most cases, a cloud computing model will require the participation of a cloud provider. The cloud provider may, but need not be, a third-party service that specializes in providing (e.g., offering, renting, selling) IaaS. An entity might also opt to deploy a private cloud, becoming its own provider of infrastructure services.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some examples, IaaS deployment is the process of putting a new application, or a new version of an application, onto a prepared application server or the like. It may also include the process of preparing the server (e.g., installing libraries, daemons, etc.). This is often managed by the cloud provider, below the hypervisor layer (e.g., the servers, storage, network hardware, and virtualization). Thus, the customer may be responsible for handling (OS), middleware, and/or application deployment (e.g., on self-service virtual machines (e.g., that can be spun up on demand) or the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some examples, IaaS provisioning may refer to acquiring computers or virtual hosts for use, and even installing needed libraries or services on them. In most cases, deployment does not include provisioning, and the provisioning may need to be performed first.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some cases, there are two different problems for IaaS provisioning. First, there is the initial challenge of provisioning the initial set of infrastructure before anything is running. Second, there is the challenge of evolving the existing infrastructure (e.g., adding new services, changing services, removing services, etc.) once everything has been provisioned. In some cases, these two challenges may be addressed by enabling the configuration of the infrastructure to be defined declaratively. In other words, the infrastructure (e.g., what components are needed and how they interact) can be defined by one or more configuration files. Thus, the overall topology of the infrastructure (e.g., what resources depend on which, and how they each work together) can be described declaratively. In some instances, once the topology is defined, a workflow can be generated that creates and/or manages the different components described in the configuration files.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, an infrastructure may have many interconnected elements. For example, there may be one or more virtual private clouds (VPCs) (e.g., a potentially on-demand pool of configurable and/or shared computing resources), also known as a core network. In some examples, there may also be one or more security group rules provisioned to define how the security of the network will be set up and one or more virtual machines (VMs). Other infrastructure elements may also be provisioned, such as a load balancer, a database, or the like. As more and more infrastructure elements are desired and/or added, the infrastructure may incrementally evolve.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some instances, continuous deployment techniques may be employed to enable deployment of infrastructure code across various virtual computing environments. Additionally, the described techniques can enable infrastructure management within these environments. In some examples, service teams can write code that is desired to be deployed to one or more, but often many, different production environments (e.g., across various different geographic locations, sometimes spanning the entire world). However, in some examples, the infrastructure on which the code will be deployed must first be set up. In some instances, the provisioning can be done manually, a provisioning tool may be utilized to provision the resources, and/or deployment tools may be utilized to deploy the code once the infrastructure is provisioned.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram <b>600</b> illustrating an example pattern of an IaaS architecture, according to at least one embodiment.
