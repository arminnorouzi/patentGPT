As shown, an ASRS system <b>100</b> may include a plurality of articles <b>102</b> (e.g., containers, units, boxes, products, etc.) that may be collectively stored in shelves, racks, or other storage locations. By way of example, the ASRS <b>100</b> may operate as an automated or semi-automated warehousing system in which articles may be stored, retrieved, moved, and/or the like in response to system instructions or user interactions. The ASRS <b>100</b> may leverage one or more shuttles, cranes, lifts, elevators, modules, loading systems, robotic arms, and/or the like such that, as described hereafter, the article retrieval device <b>200</b> of the present disclosure may cooperate with one or more of the aforementioned devices or systems to improve upon operation of the ASRS system <b>100</b>. For example, the article retrieval device <b>200</b> may include motorized wheels or an equivalent mechanism configured to cause movement of the article retrieval device <b>200</b> about the plurality of articles <b>102</b> in order to retrieve or pick an article.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By way of example, the ASRS system <b>100</b> may store a plurality of articles <b>102</b> in a system of racks (e.g., rack <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) such that the articles <b>102</b> may be retrieved when requested. In operation, however, articles <b>102</b> may be mispositioned (e.g., turned, moved, etc.) such that the actual location of these articles differs from the locations known to the system <b>100</b>. For example, when an article <b>102</b> is stored, article data associated with the article may be stored (e.g., by a computing device <b>300</b>, memory, or other related storage device) such that, when a command to retrieve the respective article <b>102</b> is received, the system <b>100</b> may properly retrieve the article <b>102</b> from the location at which it is stored. In this way, article data may include data entries indicative of the dimensions (e.g., length, width, height, cross-sectional area, shape, etc.) of the article <b>102</b> as well as the relative position of the article <b>102</b> within the system <b>100</b> (e.g., the article's relative position within the rack).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, however, the article <b>102</b> may be mispositioned during operation such that, in conventional systems, attempts to retrieve the article fail. Said differently, in instances in which an article <b>102</b> positioned within a rack or other storage system differs from the location known to the system <b>100</b>, attempts by conventional systems to retrieve or pick the article <b>102</b> may damage system components. Alternatively, attempts by conventional systems to pick a mispositioned article <b>102</b> may result in a faulted state in which operation of the system <b>100</b> halts until the article <b>102</b> is repositioned. Such faulted states result in reduced throughput of the system <b>100</b> and further inefficiencies associated with required repositioning of the article <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the article retrieval device <b>200</b> described hereafter is configured to determine articles <b>102</b> that are mispositioned and, in response, modify operation of the device <b>200</b> so as to properly retrieve or pick these articles. Although described hereafter with reference to an ASRS system <b>100</b>, the present disclosure contemplates that the devices described herein may be applicable to any other application in which an item, article, object, etc. is moved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, a top view of the article retrieval device <b>200</b> of the present disclosure is illustrated proximate a rack <b>104</b> of, for example, an ASRS system <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, the one or more loading arms <b>202</b> may be formed as single, integral members whose dimensions coincide with or otherwise match a corresponding dimension of the frame <b>203</b> such that a stacking or nesting feature is unnecessary. In any embodiment, the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may have any dimension (e.g., size and shape) based upon the intended application of the article retrieval device <b>200</b> and/or the corresponding dimensions of the article <b>102</b> to be retrieved.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example, the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may be configured to move from the retracted position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to an extended position in which a portion of the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> extends at least partially beyond an outer edge of the frame <b>203</b>.

As such, the extension of the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may, in some embodiments, be from the retracted position to a first position from the frame <b>203</b> based upon the received article data. For example, the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may extend to a first position proximate the article <b>102</b> so as to, as described hereafter, retrieve the article <b>102</b>. In some embodiments as illustrated herein, the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may define a first loading arm <b>208</b> and a second loading arm <b>210</b> that may, for example, be positioned parallel with respect to one another.

For example, in instances in which additional articles are simultaneously retrieved by the loading arms <b>202</b>, additional loading arms may similarly extend from the frame <b>203</b>. Furthermore, the present disclosure contemplates that the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> may be operably connected to one or more motors, rollers, or equivalent mechanisms for causing motion of the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> between the retracted and extended positions.

In doing so, the first loading arm <b>208</b> and the second loading arm <b>210</b> may extend past the article <b>102</b> such that, when deployed as described hereafter, the engagement structures <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may properly engage the article <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the at least one engagement structure <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may be configured such that, in the deployed position, the first engagement structure <b>212</b> and the second engagement structure <b>214</b> may be positioned perpendicular with respect to the first loading arm <b>208</b> and the second loading arm <b>210</b>, respectively. By way of continued example, once the pair of loading arms <b>202</b> are in an extended position, such as a first position proximate a first article for retrieval, the first engagement structure <b>212</b> may move relative the first loading arm <b>208</b>, and the second engagement structure <b>214</b> may move relative the second loading arm <b>210</b>. By way of example, the first engagement structure <b>212</b>, in some embodiments, may be pivotally attached to the first loading arm <b>208</b> such that movement from the stored position to the deployed position provides for rotational movement of the first engagement structure <b>212</b> relative the first loading arm <b>208</b>. Similarly, the second engagement structure <b>214</b>, may be pivotally attached to the second loading arm <b>210</b> such that movement from the stored position to the deployed position provides for rotational movement of the second engagement structure <b>214</b> relative the first loading arm <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although described and illustrated herein with reference to rotational movement of the engagement structures <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, the present disclosure contemplates that the movement of the engagement structure <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> between the stored and deployed positions may be effectuated via any mechanism or movement pattern as dictated by the application of the article retrieval device <b>200</b> and/or the article <b>102</b>.

Said differently, in order to cause movement (e.g., during retraction of the loading arms to the retracted position) of the article <b>102</b>, the first and second engagement structure <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> may define one or more fingers, extensions, flanged portions, etc. configured to contact the article <b>102</b>. The present disclosure contemplates that the first engagement structure <b>212</b> and the second engagement structure <b>214</b> may be dimensioned (e.g., sized and shaped) based upon the intended application of the article retrieval device <b>200</b>. Furthermore, although described and illustrated herein with a corresponding pair of engagement structures, the present disclosure contemplates that only a single engagement structure may similarly be used.

In order to prevent unintended contact with an article in these instances and others, the sensing device (e.g., sensing elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>) of the present disclosure may be used to determine if the article <b>102</b> to be retrieved is within the path of the engagement structures <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">By way of example, an article <b>102</b> may be supported by a rack <b>104</b> at an angled positioned (e.g., as opposed to in-line with the support structure of the rack, parallel with the longitudinal edge of the rack <b>104</b>, etc.).

In such an embodiment, the sensing device may be a photoelectric sensor or photo eye that, via the first sensing element <b>216</b> and the second sensing element <b>218</b>, is configured to generate sensor data. The sensing device may be, for example, a through-beam, retro-reflective, and/or diffuse-reflective photoelectric sensor that may detect the presence or absence of an article within the sensors via interruption of a beam of light transmitted by the sensing device. By way of a particular, non-limiting example, the first sensing element <b>216</b> may be an emitter element configured to generate light that is transmitted in the direction of the second sensing element <b>218</b> operating as a receiver element. In such an example, sensor data generated by the sensing device (e.g., sensing elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>) may indicate the presence of an object (e.g., the article <b>102</b>) in an instance in which the light extending between the sensing elements <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> is interrupted.

In other embodiments, the second position may refer to a determined incremental change in extension for the pair of loading arms (e.g., a defined change of 0.5 inches or the like).
