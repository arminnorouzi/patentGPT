No. 16/849,909 filed on 15 Apr. 2020, entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Providing Ostomy Faceplate in Close Proximity with Negative Pressure Wound Devices,&#x201d; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/871,670, filed on 08 Jul. 2019 and entitled &#x201c;Ostomy Appliance,&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ileostomies (stomas made from the last portion of the small intestine) are generally placed in the lower right quadrant of a patient's abdominal wall below the level of the umbilicus but above the level of the pubic hair. Colostomies (stomas made from part of the large intestine) are generally placed in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen, although they can be placed in other locations. However, the site selection of an ostomy is often restricted, as stomas should be sited within margins of the rectus abdominal muscle, which runs vertically and in front of the abdomen. Placing a stoma within the margins of this muscle may help prevent later complications, such as parastomal hernias.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to avoid any potential unwanted leakage, it can be important for an ostomy appliance, or faceplate, to tightly seal against a patient's or user's skin. Removable adhesive is generally used to provide a secure fit. However, some patients or users have creases, folds, or rolls in their skin that may impact the fit of the ostomy appliance or faceplate. For example, due to biological constraints discussed above, and ostomy may be placed close to where a patient's or user's abdominal fat creases or folds&#x2014;particularly when the patient or user is leaning forward.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such creases, rolls, and folds may cause repeated folding of the skin under the ostomy appliance or faceplate, potentially gradually reducing the seal of the appliance or faceplate against a patient's or user's skin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an ostomy appliance that can be used in as close as possible to a patient's or user's skin creases, folds, or rolls to provide a more secure connection to the skin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some aspects of the present invention, in accordance with some embodiments, may comprise ostomy appliance or faceplate with a non-circular flange for attachment of a bag or pouch. In general, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for providing ostomy faceplates configured to be positioned in close proximity to an incision, roll, crease, or fold. Embodiments of the present invention may include an ostomy appliance or faceplate with a non-circular flange for attachment of a bag or pouch.

Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the exemplary embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention. Descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness. Moreover, as used herein, the singular may be interpreted in the plural, and alternately, any term in the plural may be interpreted to be in the singular.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention sets forth an ostomy appliance and/or system that may include one or more of several features, including but not limited to the following: having a straight edge or substantially straight edge of a flange that may be aligned with a patient's or user's skin crease, roll, or fold.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with some embodiments (and as discussed in greater detail below), the design may comprise a straight edge or substantially straight edge as part of an ostomy faceplate or appliance. The straight or substantially straight end of the faceplate or appliance may include a tapered end, may comprise different adhesive than the overall appliance or faceplate, and/or may be made from or comprised of a different material.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present document uses the term &#x201c;flange,&#x201d; which is intended to refer to a physical component that assists in the connection between a faceplate or appliance and a bag or pouch. Note that while the present invention generally illustrates faceplates and appliances as being separate from the bag or pouch, one-piece appliance-and-pouch devices are also contemplated. In such combined devices, there is still a flange that provides connection between the bag and the faceplate or appliance&#x2014;though in combined devices the bag or pouch may not be removable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substantially &#x201c;D&#x201d; shaped ostomy appliance is illustrated. The appliance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a material <b>110</b> that is generally attached to, or adhered to, a patient, and may comprise a flexible and comfortable material, such as flexible wound dressing (for example, DUODERM&#xae;&#x2014;manufactured for ConvaTec). Flange <b>120</b> may comprise a more rigid (though still flexible and bendable) ring that may encircle an orifice <b>130</b>. During use, the orifice <b>130</b> may be aligned with a user's or patient's stoma. A bag or pouch may be attach to the flange <b>120</b> to receive effluent from the stoma.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that the present invention provides a means to locate an ostomy faceplate or appliance close to user's skin creases, rolls, or folds. The general shape of the outside portion of the appliance can be of any variety, as at least one goal of the invention is to get as close to the crease, roll, or fold by positioning the straight or substantially straight edge of the flange proximate to the crease, roll, or fold.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the outer material <b>210</b> may be in any shape. Indeed, it is known that nurses, patients, and users often cut or trim this outer material to a desirable shape or size. However, round flanges on ostomies in the prior art prevent location of the appliance directly proximate to a crease, roll, or fold.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an appliance or faceplate with a substantially D-shaped flange <b>220</b> mounted on a square or rectangular material <b>210</b>. Again, an orifice <b>230</b> is positioned inside the flange <b>220</b> to receive a stoma.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is intended to address a need in the art of different shaped ostomy appliances or faceplates to accommodate different body types and needs. For example, a user may have a centerline incision due to certain medical procedures (such as, but not limited to, emergency trauma surgery). The user may also have creases, rolls, or folds. To accommodate the centerline wound (and any negative pressure wound device that may be used to assist in closing and healing of the centerline incision) and a user's body type that may include creases, rolls, or folds, there may be more than one substantially straight edge to the flange on the ostomy appliance or faceplate. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a pie-piece shaped flange <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> may be mounted on a softer material <b>310</b>, <b>410</b> which may be of different shapes. The flange <b>320</b>, <b>420</b>, may again encircle an orifice <b>330</b>, <b>430</b> for receiving a stoma.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> present an ostomy appliance with a substantially square or rectangular shaped flange <b>520</b>, <b>620</b>, mounted on a softer material <b>510</b>, <b>610</b>. Note that it is contemplated by the present invention that the orifice for the stoma may not be centrally located, but may be positioned asymmetrically within the flange. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the orifice <b>630</b> is shown to be positioned in a corner of the flange <b>620</b>. A user may cut the orifice in the faceplate or appliance to position the orifice in a position necessary to receive a stoma, while aligning the straight or substantially straight edges of the flange with a user's creases, rolls, folds, incisions, wounds, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The overall shape of the flange can vary, provided that there is at least one straight or substantially straight edge. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an ostomy appliance with a first material <b>710</b>, a flange <b>720</b>, and an orifice <b>730</b>, in which the flange <b>720</b> has several straight and a curved edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a triangular shaped appliance, comprising a triangular shaped material <b>810</b> and a triangular shaped flange <b>820</b>, including an orifice <b>830</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that while the present invention continually discusses straight or substantially straight edges to the flange, it is understood that some creases, rolls, or folds, may be in the shape of an arc. For example, a fold due to an enlarged abdomen may appear linear, but three-dimensionally may have a curve to it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an oval-shaped ostomy appliance <b>910</b> with an oval-shaped flange <b>920</b>. Again, an orifice <b>930</b> is positioned within the flange <b>920</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a rectangular shaped ostomy appliance <b>1010</b> and flange <b>1020</b>, with substantially parallel, substantially straight edges connected by rounded corners. Again, orifice <b>1030</b> is positioned within the flange <b>1020</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> illustrate an ostomy appliance and flange that may have a more complex shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an ostomy appliance <b>1110</b>, <b>1210</b> with a flange <b>1120</b>, <b>1220</b> within which is an orifice <b>1130</b>, <b>1230</b>. The overall shape of the flange <b>1120</b>, <b>1220</b> is substantially &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped (though illustrated as an inverted &#x201c;T&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref> illustrate the point that a &#x201c;substantially straight edge&#x201d; may include angle (such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b></figref>) or curves (such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Each appliance includes a first material <b>1310</b>, <b>1410</b>, <b>1510</b>, <b>1610</b>, a flange <b>1320</b>, <b>1420</b>, <b>1520</b>, <b>1620</b>, and an orifice <b>1330</b>, <b>1430</b>, <b>1530</b>, <b>1630</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the substantially straight edge of the flange <b>1320</b> may comprise multiple angled lines. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the substantially straight edge of the flange <b>1420</b> may comprise an angle extending away from the inside of the flange <b>1420</b>, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> the substantially straight edge may comprise an angle extending toward the inside of the flange <b>1520</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates an appliance <b>1610</b> with a flange <b>1630</b> with a substantially straight edge comprising a series of curves or arcs.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other words, each embodiment of the ostomy appliance may comprise a flange that has an edge configured to be placed or disposed along an incision, roll, crease, or fold, thereby providing significant advantages over an ostomy appliance with a traditionally round flange.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be understood that the specific embodiments of the present invention shown and described herein are exemplary only. Numerous variations, changes, substitutions and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention.
