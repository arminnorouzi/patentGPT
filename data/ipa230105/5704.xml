Typically, the pump pulse is directed to a sample to interact with the sample and initiate a sample response. A probe pulse is then directed to the pumped sample and response to the probe pulse is measured. Temporal response can be obtained by varying the temporal delay of the probe pulse with respect to the pump pulse. The probe pulse can be an electron beam pulse produced in response to the pump laser, often by frequency doubling the pump pulse, and generating an electron beam pulse in response to the frequency doubled pump pulse. Pulse/probe pulses are repeated to permit increasing signal-to-noise ratio and varying the pulse/probe temporal delay permits reconstruction of sample temporal response. These pump/probe measurements can require lengthy acquisition times to provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the electron beam modulation and associated temporal delay complicate measurement setup.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain electron detectors can provide high temporal resolution but exhibit high noise so that signal to noise ratios are low. For example, single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) can produce an avalanche-based output signal in response to a single electron. Unfortunately, SPADs also produce output signals (dark counts) in the absence of electron beam input. These dark counts can be reduced by SPAD cooling but cannot be distinguished from real signal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, alternatives to conventional pump/probe measurement approaches are needed as well as alternative detector configurations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Charged particle (CP) detectors comprise a first single photon detector (SPD) array and a second SPD array, aligned with respect to the first SPD array along a CP beam axis. A coincidence detector is secured to one of the first SPD array and the second SPD array and operable to indicate detection events corresponding to detection of a charged-particle in corresponding SPD array elements of the first SPD array and the second SPD array within a predetermined time window. In some examples, the first SPD array and the second SPD array are defined on a first substrate and a second substrate, respectively, and the first substrate is fixed with respect to the second substrate. In further example, the first substrate and the second substrate are semiconductor substrates in which SPD array elements of the first SPD array and the second SPD array, respectively, are defined, and the first SPD and the second SPD are single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs). In typical examples, the coincidence detector includes a corresponding coincidence detector element for each pair of corresponding SPD array elements of the first SPD array and the second SPD array. In some cases, the first SPD array and the second SPD array include different numbers of SPD elements, wherein the coincidence detector is configured to indicate detection events in response to detection of a charged particle in at least one SPD element of the first SPD array and at least one SPD element of the second SPD array. The coincidence detector can be defined on a third substrate that is secured to at least one of the first substrate and the second substrate. In other examples, a frame is situated to align the first SPD array and the second SPD array and at least one spacer is situated to define a separation of the first SPD array and the second SPD array. The first SPD array and the second SPD array can be defined on a first and a second substrate, respectively, and the first substrate can be fixed with respect to the second substrate. A third substrate is coupled to the first SPD array and the second SPD array to receive detection events from the first SPD array and the second SPD array and produce a time stamp associated with each received detection event for a plurality of corresponding SPD array elements of the first SPD array and the second SPD array. In some examples, the third substrate is coupled to the first SPD array and the second SPD array to receive detection events from the first SPD array and the second SPD array and produce histograms of detection events for a plurality of corresponding SPD array elements of the first SPD array and the second SPD array. The first SPD and the SPD arrays can be single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods comprising, in an electron microscope, directing an electron beam to a sample and detecting events based on a modulation of the electron beam in response to corresponding pump beam pulses directed to the sample in a first single photon detector (SPD) array. The detected events are associated with time bins corresponding to elapsed times from application of the corresponding pump beam pulses. Typically, a histogram of numbers of the detected events is formed. In some embodiments, the electron beam is repetitively blanked for at least a portion of time intervals between corresponding pump beam pulses. The electron beam can be unblanked based on application of the pump pulses and in some examples, the electron beam is unblanked at a fixed time delay with respect to the pump beam pulses and the pump beam pulses and the electron beam blanking are applied at a fixed repetition frequency. The fixed repetition frequency can be between 100 Hz and 300 MHz and the electron beam can be repetitively blanked for an interval of at least 95% of a fixed period associated with the fixed repetition frequency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to representative embodiments, the first SPD array is a single photon avalanched detector (SPAD) array and, with a second SPAD array secured to the first SPAD array, it is determined if coincident events are detected corresponding to the events detected with the first SPAD array.

Time resolutions of 5-30 ps or better can be achievable, even with scintillator based detectors. The electron beam which serves as a probe beam can be left on as in conventional transmission electron microscopy or, alternatively, modulated at a slower timescale using an electrostatic blanker or other modulator, to reduce dose on the sample.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">SPAD arrays can operate in histogramming mode in which detection events are added to a histogram as acquired so that storage and transmission of raw, individual arrival times is not needed. Such &#x201c;in-pixel&#x201d; histograms are based on event times relative to a gate pulse or other synchronization pulse that can be provided by a dedicated clock circuit or based on a repetition rate of the pump pulses. The data rate required to get the image off-chip is greatly is reduced since only summary statistics (such as histograms) are communicated, not individual event times.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In measurements in which only a fraction of probe beam electrons are captured by a detector such as (weak) diffraction or (core-loss) EELS, the disclosed approaches can provide a substantial increase in throughput even compared to conventional pump-probe techniques at similar time resolutions, with much reduced complexity. Increased throughput can lead to reduced total measurement time, and better sample survival under the multitude of pump pulses.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The examples below generally include arrays of single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) based on semiconductors such as Si, Ge, InGaAs, or other materials. The disclosed arrangements are generally suited to detection of charged particles such as electrons that can be transmitted by one SPAD to another SPAD that is suitably aligned, but the disclosed approaches are suitable for other charged-particle beam beams. The disclosed approaches can also be used with, for example, measurements based on a short pump pulses and a continuous probe. The pump pulses can be optical or charged particle beam pulses, mechanical, temperature, or other excitations. In some examples below, one-dimensional SPAD arrays are shown for convenient illustration but two-dimensional SPAD arrays can also be provided in which SPAD elements arranged in N by M arrays, wherein N, M are positive integers, are stacked. In typical examples, each of the stacked SPADs has the same numbers (N by M) of SPAD elements, but different numbers can be used. In addition, the SPAD elements cam be semiconductor based devices but elements of other kinds can be used such as, for example, superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, photomultiplier tubes, microchannel plate photomultipliers, superconducting transition-edge sensors, and single photon quantum dot detectors. Detectors that operate in Geiger mode such as SPADs can be used with temporal histogramming as discussed below to record signal waveforms. Detectors that exhibit analog or other or non-Geiger responses can be used with histogramming as well, if suitably processed for histogramming. As used herein, single photon detector refers to a photon or charged particle detector that produces a Geiger-mode response to a single photon or charged particle. A Geiger mode response is substantially independent of a number of photons or charged particles detected. Such a response can be referred to as a binary response that varies from on to off.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">SPAD elements produce an avalanche response in response to a received charged particle. Such responses are referred to herein as events or detection events. Such events can be used to reconstruct a temporal waveform by forming a histogram of numbers of events as a function of time. SPADs can be defined on substrates such as semiconductor substrates or defined as discrete devices that are then arranged and secured on a substrate for support. In typical examples, silicon substrates are used but SPAD elements can be defined in other semiconductors such as germanium and InGaAs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples disclosed herein, time resolution is determined by the SPAD elements, and a probe (electron) pulse can be almost arbitrarily long. However, probe pulse duration is generally limited to reduce dose and pile-up distortion due to SPAD element dead time but probe electron pulse duration and timing are less critical than in conventional pump-probe measurements. In conventional pump-probe measurements, time resolution is determined by probe pulse duration and measurement throughput is low.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the examples, optical pump pulses are applied to a sample and modulation of an electron beam directed to the sample is detected with a SPAD array. Typically the electron beam is blocked or attenuated during at least some times intervals at which electron beam modulation by the sample in response to an optical pump pulse is not of interest, generally to reduce electron dose on a sample. As used herein, &#x201c;blanking&#x201d; or &#x201c;beam blanking&#x201d; refers to attenuating, blocking, or deflecting an electron beam in this way. Such blanking can be provided by modulation of an electron beam source or using one or more electron beam deflectors or other electron optic elements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the examples are generally directed to pump/probe measurements, the disclosed approaches can be used for temporal characterization of various electron beam modulation techniques, such as fast (electrostatic) beam blanking, RF chopped pulse trains, etc. and hence could be used to demonstrate and confirm the performance of such techniques. In this case, the SPAD is synchronized to a suitable output of the beam modulation technique rather than a pump source such as a pump laser.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a representative measurement system <b>100</b> includes a pump source <b>102</b>, typically an optical source that produces short pulses, such as pulses having durations less than 30 ns, 1 ns, 300 ps, 30 ps, 1 ps, or shorter. The optical source <b>102</b> can be a mode-locked laser that operates at a fixed repetition frequency or an optical source that generates pulses on demand at fixed, variable, or arbitrary rates and is situated to deliver an optical beam <b>103</b> to a sample <b>111</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pump source <b>102</b> can produce pulses in response to a clock signal generator <b>104</b> but in some examples, the pump source operates at a fixed frequency and this fixed frequency serves as a clock signal. A gate signal generator <b>106</b> is responsive to the clock signal and produces a gate signal that can be coupled to one or both of an electron beam source <b>108</b> and an electron beam deflector <b>130</b> to provide beam blanking or other electron beam modulation.. The electron beam source <b>108</b> produces an electron beam that propagates along a beam axis <b>109</b> that is directed to the sample <b>111</b> and can be blanked to reduce beam dose.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The gate signal generator <b>106</b> is also coupled to one or more SPAD arrays <b>112</b> that produce detection events based on modulation of the electron beam in response to the pump pulses. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, processing circuitry <b>114</b> that produces histograms of detected events in time bins corresponding to elapsed time from application of pump pulses associated with the detected events. The gate signal generator <b>106</b> can operate at a fixed, variable, or random delay with respect to the clock signal from the clock signal generator <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the SPAD array <b>112</b> is gated to be in an on-state using a gating pulse <b>140</b> to measure probe pulse modulation in response to an optical pump pulse <b>142</b>. The SPAD detector array <b>112</b> can produce output signals such as an output signal <b>146</b> that includes a detection event <b>147</b> at any element of the SPAD detector array <b>112</b>. The SPAD detector array <b>112</b> operates in Geiger mode so that the amplitude of the detection event <b>147</b> is substantially independent of signal amplitude but the times at which detection events are produced (referred to as &#x201c;arrival times&#x201d;) for a series of probe pulses can be used generate a histogram of arrival times. This histogram can be used to obtain a temporal response of the sample to the probe pulses. Relative signal timings can be set electronically by a the gate signal generator <b>106</b> and the probe electron beam is blanked with a blanking signal <b>144</b> to reduce sample dose. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, events are assigned to one of time bins <b>160</b>A-<b>160</b>P corresponding to detection times referenced to the timing of the associated pump pulse. The same time bins are used for all of the repetitive pump pulses, referenced to the timing of the associated pump pulse. More or fewer time bins can be used, and the time bins can have the same or different sizes. Pump pulses are repetitively applied so that the pulse sequences shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> repeat so that many events can be detected and assigned to the time bins <b>160</b>A-<b>160</b>P.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The beam deflector <b>130</b> can be controlled to deflect the electron beam until the pump pulse is applied. In this way, the SPAD array <b>112</b> and the sample <b>111</b> receive reduced electron beam dose as compared with use of an unmodulated electron beam. In addition, blanking the electron beam reduces pileup distortion that causes histograms produced with the SPAD array output signals to show response to the probe pulse with significantly reduced amplitude. For example, for an unblanked beam, a SPAD detector array element is likely to respond to electron beam portions unrelated to the response of the sample <b>110</b> to the pump pulse. Thus, a histogram of arrival times can be skewed to earlier histogram bins. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, after detection of an electron, a SPAD array element typically has a dead time that is typically between 30 ns and 1 &#x3bc;s so that response to the unblanked electron beam can increase deadtime and delay signal acquisition.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Pile-up distortion can be compensated or partially compensated digitally, by reducing electron current or changing the timing of the electron beam unblanking, i.e. after each pump pulse, unblanking the electron beam for only part of the time window of interest; then varying the unblanking interval between subsequent pump pulses.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Varying SPAD gate timing can also be used with histogram time bin definitions remaining relative to the pump pulse and not relative to the SPAD gate.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a pump beam and detector gating can operate asynchronously, and a probe electron beam can be unmodulated.

In some cases, a deflector <b>308</b> is situated to sweep the electron beam <b>306</b> after interaction with the sample <b>330</b> to different detector elements of a detector such as a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array <b>314</b>A. The deflector <b>305</b> can be controlled to deflect the electron beam <b>306</b> so that the sample <b>310</b> is unexposed except at suitable times. This electron beam blanking can be used to reduce dose on the sample <b>310</b> and dose received by the SPAD array <b>314</b>A, particularly during SPAD array recovery times. After interaction with the electron beam <b>306</b>, a portion of the electron beam <b>306</b> is received by the SPAD array <b>314</b>A. In other examples, other radiation responsive to the interaction such as secondary emission or X-radiation is detected alternatively or in addition to electron beam portions using one or more suitable detectors.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system <b>300</b> can be operated as follows. First, note that in conventional optical pump/probe systems using electron beam probes, a pulsed laser is used to produce a pump pulse that is directed to a sample and a portion of the pulsed laser output is used to generate an electron beam probe pulse that is directed to the sample with various delays between the pump and probe pulses. By varying the pump/probe delay, response of the sample to the pump can be measured with a slow detector. Using a sufficient number of pump/probe delays, the temporal response of the sample to the pump can be measured. By contrast, in systems such as the system <b>300</b>, a detector (e.g., SPAD array <b>314</b>A) is gated by a SPAD gate generator <b>311</b> to initiate data acquisition. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the SPAD array <b>314</b>A is gated to be in an on-state using a gating pulse <b>340</b> that also serves to gate the laser <b>316</b> to produce a laser pulse <b>342</b> that can serve as a pump pulse. The sample <b>310</b> can also be stimulated in different ways (i.e., without a laser pulse), although laser pulses are convenient for time-resolved measurements at short timescales. A portion of the pump pulse can be directed to the e-beam source <b>302</b> to produce a probe (electron beam) pulse <b>344</b>. The SPAD array <b>314</b>A can produce a plurality of output signals such as an output signal <b>346</b> that includes a detection event <b>347</b>. Because the SPAD array <b>314</b>A operates in Geiger mode, the amplitude of the output signal <b>346</b> is independent of signal amplitude but the times at which the detection event <b>347</b> is produced (referred to as &#x201c;arrival times&#x201d;) for a series of probe pulses can be used generate a histogram of arrival times. This histogram can be used to obtain a temporal response of the sample to the probe pulses. Relative signal timings can be set electronically by a controller <b>309</b> and/or a variable optical pulse delay <b>320</b> that permits varying probe pulse timing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a representative example and in other examples, generation of a probe pulse is not based on the optical pump pulse. For example, the beam deflector <b>305</b> can be controlled to deflect the electron beam <b>306</b> until the pump pulse is applied. In this way, the SPAD detector array <b>314</b>A receives reduced electron beam dose as compared with use of an unmodulated electron beam. In addition, blanking the electron beam <b>306</b> reduces electron pileup distortion that causes histograms produced with the SPAD array output signals to show response to the probe pulse with significantly reduced amplitude. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, after detection of an electron, a SPAD array element typically has a dead time that is typically between 30 ns and 1 &#x3bc;s so that response to the unblanked electron beam can increase deadtime and delay signal acquisition.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The controller <b>309</b> can produce time-correlation of SPAD detector array signals (time correlated single photon detection-TCSPD) and produce histograms for each element of SPAD detector array <b>314</b>A. In some cases, some such processing is provided with an adjacent or integrated signal processing substrate <b>314</b>B.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another approach, the electron beam source <b>302</b> can be responsive to optical pulses from a laser <b>316</b> so that the electron beam <b>306</b> is a pulsed electron beam or includes a pulsed component. In some examples, electron beam pulses are produced by photoemission and a laser beam output can be frequency doubled at a second harmonic generator <b>318</b> to improve photoemission efficiency based on a work function of an electron emitter. In addition, a variable delay generator <b>320</b> can be provided to control relative timing of electron pulses with respect to optical pulses (i.e., pump pulses) in a laser beam <b>322</b> that is directed to the sample <b>310</b> via a light optical system <b>324</b>. Electron beam blanking is generally not necessary as the electron beam can be pulsed. Electron beam and laser beam propagation to the sample <b>310</b> are situated within a vacuum enclosure <b>301</b>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 4. Stacked SPADs</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">SPADs can operate with high temporal resolution of 30 ps or better. In some examples, two SPAD-based detection wafers (referred to for convenience as a top and a middle layer) that include an array of SPAD elements (also referred to as pixels) are fixed to a third wafer (referred to for convenience as a bottom wafer) on which processing circuitry is defined. In some examples, processing circuitry is located elsewhere to avoid exposure to the electron beam. Because high energy electrons are not blocked by the upper detector, they can create free charge carriers in SPAD elements in both SPAD-based detection wafers. Therefore, a single electron can generate a detection event in corresponding SPAD elements in both SPAD-based detectors. A timing circuit can be used to time the detection event in each SPAD-based detector with accuracies of about 30 ps or less. By correlation based on the detection times, simultaneous detection events in the top and middle layers can be distinguished from noise events. The wafers can be coupled with copper-to-copper direct hybrid bonding and interconnected with Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) that permit 3D interconnection between layers.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 5. SPADs with Integrated Histogramming</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">SPADs and other single event detectors can produce large numbers of detection events that can be processed to determine temporal waveforms. This can require high speed data transfer and/or data storage of the detection events. In examples disclosed herein, SPAD arrays are operated in a so-called histogramming mode in which individual detection events are processed on-chip at each SPAD array or at each SPAD element to produce event histograms for each pixel. In this histograms, the bins correspond to electron arrival times relative to each gate or pump pulse. Pump-probe TEM measurements can be done in a stroboscopic mode in which a pump-probe sequence is repeated a large number of times to collect detection events for histogramming. Detection events can be acquired for predetermined time, to produce a sufficient number of detection events, or for other time intervals. Detection events are accumulated into per-element (per-pixel) histograms as the detection events are acquired to produce histograms of numbers of detection events in a plurality of time bins relative to a gating signal. After detection events are acquired and processed to produce histograms, the histograms can be transferred from the SPAD arrays so that total data transfer requirements are substantially reduced. Detection event data such as event times need not be transferred.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a SPAD array system <b>400</b> includes a first SPAD array <b>402</b> defined on a first substrate <b>403</b> and a second SPAD array <b>404</b> defined on a second substrate <b>405</b>.
