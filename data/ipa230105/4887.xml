Furthermore, due to the inherent limitations of manual auditing, sampling approaches are used instead of full-population testing. Sampling approaches attempt to select a representative sample, but there is no way to guarantee that important information is not missed in the data that is not selected for review. Accordingly, attempts have been made to automate parts of the auditing process. However, introduction of technologies into audit approaches have mostly focused on substantive testing or control testing or risk assessment. Furthermore, in existing audit systems that have introduced one or more technologies, the uncertainties introduced by the technology itself have been largely ignored or, at most, imprecisely and inaccurately accounted for by attempted human review. Further still, existing audit systems that have introduced one or more technologies have focused on narrow approaches for a single, specific financial statement line item (FSLI). Thus, there is a lack of a consistent framework for addressing 20+ FSLIs. Narrow solutions for each FSLI audit are difficult to generalize and nearly impossible scale effectively and economically. Additionally, insights offered by existing systems for financial data do not distinguish between transactions that have been fully contextualized as compared to those which have not.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, according to known techniques for vouching and tracing, which may be done pursuant to an audit process, vouching and tracing are done independently as two separate processes and using audit sampling. However, known systems and methods for information integrity do not handle fuzzy comparison, do not leverage of context of the evidence (e.g., master data, industry ontology, industry and client knowledge), do not leverage multiple evidence to establish data integrity, do not address the challenge that evidence might have been amended or updated, and do not address one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relationships.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems and methods that address one or more of the above-identified shortcomings of known systems for automated auditing. Specifically, there is a need for an end-to-end transformation of audit approaches based on technologies. There is a need for systems and methods for AI-augmented auditing platforms providing a composable assurance integrity framework, the ability to accurately and automatically account for uncertainties introduced by technologies, the ability to apply in a generalized manner to multiple FSLIs, and the ability to distinguish between transactions that have been fully contextualized as compared to those which have not. The systems and methods described herein may meet one or more of these needs. Disclosed herein are systems and methods configured to review a plurality of FSLIs and to determine, based on evidence data reviewed, whether any of the FSLIs include a material misstatement. The system may address one or more of the above-identified needs by providing a composable framework that can be adapted to each of a plurality of FSLIs, allowing the system to be flexible and adaptable in addressing a broad spectrum of variations in terms of industry, business practices, and fast-changing business environments. The composable framework provided by the systems described herein may provide a consistent methodology for tracing activities within financial operations of a business and for determining potential materiality of misrepresentation of financial statements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, there is a need for improved systems and methods that address one or more of the above-identified shortcomings in known methods for vouching and tracing. Disclosed herein are methods and systems for performing automated (or semi-automated) data processing operations for auditing processes, wherein vouching and tracing (e.g., for FSLI audit for multiple documents and ERP records) are conducted semi-automatically or fully automatically at the same time, wherein the specification and the actual matching of the corresponding fields in the ledger and the supporting source documents are performed automatically.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a first system is provided, the first system being for generating risk assessments based on a data representing a plurality of statements and data representing corroborating evidence, the first system comprising one or more processors configured to cause the first system to: receive a first data set representing a plurality of statements;

Furthermore, systems and methods described herein systems and methods for semi-automated or fully-automated simultaneous vouching and tracing for data integrity. In some embodiments, any one or more of the data integrity techniques discussed herein may be used as part of a composable assurance integrity system. Systems and methods described herein may establish representation faithfulness for financial data that are usable to determine whether there are any material misstatements, e.g., in FSLIs.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Composable Assurance Integrity</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Performing audits manually is both time-consuming, expensive, prone to introducing human error, and prone to introducing human biases. Furthermore, due to the inherent limitations of manual auditing, sampling approaches are used instead of full-population testing. Sampling approaches attempt to select a representative sample, but there is no way to guarantee that important information is not missed in the data that is not selected for review.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Accordingly, attempts have been made to automate parts of the auditing process. However, introduction of technologies into audit approaches have mostly focused on substantive testing or control testing or risk assessment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, in existing audit systems that have introduced one or more technologies, the uncertainties introduced by the technology itself have been largely ignored or, at most, imprecisely and inaccurately accounted for by attempted human review.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further still, existing audit systems that have introduced one or more technologies have focused on narrow approaches for a single, specific financial statement line item (FSLI). Thus, there is a lack of a consistent framework for addressing 20+ FSLIs. Narrow solutions for each FSLI audit are difficult to generalize and nearly impossible scale effectively and economically.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, insights offered by existing systems for financial data do not distinguish between transactions that have been fully contextualized as compared to those which have not.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems and methods that address one or more of the above-identified shortcomings. Specifically, there is a need for an end-to-end transformation of audit approaches based on technologies. There is a need for systems and methods for AI-augmented auditing platforms providing a composable assurance integrity framework, the ability to accurately and automatically account for uncertainties introduced by technologies, the ability to apply in a generalized manner to multiple FSLIs, and the ability to distinguish between transactions that have been fully contextualized as compared to those which have not. The systems and methods described herein may meet one or more of these needs.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, a system for providing an AI-augmented auditing platform is provided. The system includes one or more processors configured to receive input data (e.g., documents, financial statements, other evidence) for an audit, received from one or more data sources. The system is configured to automatically apply one or more data processing operations to the received data to render one or more assessments, scores, and/or adjudications based on the received data. (Any data processing operation referenced herein may include application of one or more models trained by machine-learning.) The system may generate output data indicating one or more results of the data processing operations, and the results may be stored, visualized or otherwise provided to one or more users, and/or used to trigger one or more automated actions by the system. In some embodiments, the system may be configured to review a plurality of FSLIs and to determine, based on evidence data reviewed, whether any of the FSLIs include a material misstatement.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The system may address one or more of the above-identified needs by providing a composable framework that can be adapted to each of a plurality of FSLIs, allowing the system to be flexible and adaptable in addressing a broad spectrum of variations in terms of industry, business practices, and fast-changing business environments. The composable framework provided by the systems described herein may provide a consistent methodology for tracing activities within financial operations of a business and for determining potential materiality of misrepresentation of financial statements. As described herein, the system may be configured to begin an analysis with start with a chart of an account, and may trace activities that were recorded to their origins; this allows the system to render determinations as to whether there are any abnormalities in the data. Furthermore, the system may be applicable to both sampling-based testing and full-population testing, due at least to the adaptability and efficiency afforded by the composable framework.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, output data generated by the system may comprise an indication as to whether one or more FSLIs or other assertions analyzed by the system) comprises a material misstatement, as judged at least in part on the basis of one or both of (a) evidence data processed by the system and (b) uncertainties introduced by one or more technologies (e.g., OCR) applied by the system during the assessment process. In some embodiments, the output data may include a classification of the FSLI&#x2014;e.g., &#x201c;does include a misstatement,&#x201d; &#x201c;does not include a misstatement,&#x201d; &#x201c;does include a material misstatement,&#x201d; or &#x201c;does include a material misstatement&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the output data may include a metric that quantifies or scores the system's assessment as to whether the FSLI includes a material misstatement. In some embodiments, a metric may score the extent of materiality of a misstatement. In some embodiments, a metric may score the system's confidence in the conclusion. In some embodiments, a metric may be based both on the determined level of materiality of a misstatement and on the system's confidence in the conclusion. In some embodiments, an individual output may be provided for each separate FSLI. In some embodiments, a combined or collective output may be provided for an transaction, account (e.g., including a plurality of transactions), or other overall audit scope as a whole.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the output data may be stored, visualized or otherwise provided to one or more users, and/or used to trigger one or more automated actions by the system. In some embodiments, the output data may be used to assess a risk profile for a transaction population. In some embodiments, the output data may be used as a basis for target sampling (e.g., to automatically determine an extent of sampling and/or a manner in which sampling is carried out).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the system may use a composable integrity framework to trace a plurality of transactions (or interactions or statements) end-to-end with corresponding evidentiary data received by the system in order to establish the risk of material misstatement for each transaction (or interaction or statement). In some embodiments, the system may apply one or more standards, thresholds, or criteria requirements to making one or more assessments, for example an assessment as to whether a transaction is successfully verified. In some embodiments, the system may be able to be configured in accordance with one or more user inputs (or other triggering events) in order to set or adjust a standard (e.g., an amount of evidence, a strength of evidence, a matching level, and/or a confidence level) required by the system in order to generate a certain output (e.g., an indication of successful verification).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the system may apply one or more data processing operations and/or AI models to assess process integrity. Assessing process integrity may comprise tracing changes within an account, for example by using a chart of accounts, in order to trace changes to their source and in order to identify activities that are associated with said changes.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the system may apply one or more data processing operations and/or AI models to assess data integrity. Assessing data integrity may comprise assessing the fidelity of information in a digital system with respect to the real world ground-truth that the data intends to represent.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the system may apply one or more data processing operations and/or AI models to assess policy integrity. Assessing policy integrity may comprise adjudicating the evidence data collected in accordance with the process integrity and data integrity processes explained herein, wherein the adjudication is made in accordance with an assurance knowledge substrate. In some embodiments, the assurance knowledge substrate includes the following components: (a) information regarding context of a business, including industry practice, historical behavior, etc., determined using endogenous and/or exogenous information, and (b) one or more accounting policies (e.g., GAAP or IFRS) and/or auditing standards.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the systems disclosed herein may leverage orchestration in order to enable the reuse and sharing of certain common modules across the process integrity, data integrity, and policy integrity processes for use with multiple different kinds of FSLIs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, one or more of the three integrity assessments (process, data, and policy) may be applied with respect to a full population of available data (as opposed to selecting a limited, e.g., random, sample of available data for representative testing). In some embodiments, for data that is obtained from enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or databases&#x2014;ERP data&#x2014;only the process integrity assessment may be applied (while data integrity and policy integrity may not be applied to said ERP data. In some embodiments, data integrity processing may be applied when evidence data can be obtained from one or more data sources, such as third-party data sources including banks, shipping carriers, etc.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to apply a model including an assurance insight layer, wherein the assurance insight layer develops insights with respect to spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, customer, product, and other attributes. The insights may be developed by this later at the population layer where the integrity has been analyzed for each transaction.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to apply a model including an assurance recommendation layer, wherein the assurance recommendation layer generates recommendations, based on audit insight and based on data regarding one or more prior engagements, to be provided to one or more users of the system, for example an audit engagement team or audit client. In some embodiments, the system may be configured such that one or more automated actions are automatically triggered in accordance with the recommendation generated by the recommendation layer (in some embodiments following user input approving the recommendation).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Features and characteristics of some embodiments of systems for providing AI-augmented auditing platforms including a composable assurance integrity framework are provided below with reference to the figures and Appendices herein.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Improved systems and methods such as those disclosed herein may include performing data-driven and AI-augmented audits using full-population testing.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> shows a system architecture diagram for a system <b>100</b> for providing a composable integrity framework, in accordance with some embodiments.

audit sampling approach is discussed when &#x201c;application of an audit procedure to less than 100 percent of the items within an account balance or class of transactions for the purpose of evaluating some characteristic of the balance or class.&#x201d; Sampling is also one of the reasons that the audit results can only achieve reasonable assurance as opposed to absolute assurance.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0225">Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance regarding material misstatements, but not an absolute one. Reasonable assurance includes the understanding that there is a remote likelihood that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To achieve reasonable assurance, the auditor needs to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level. This means that there is some uncertainty arising from the use of sampling, since it is possible that a material misstatement will be missed. On the other hand, absolute assurance provides a guarantee that the financial statements are free from material misstatements.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0226">Absolutes are not attainable due to factors such as the need for professional judgment, the use of testing, the inherent limitations of internal control, the reliance in accounting on estimates, and the fact that audit evidence is generally persuasive rather than conclusive.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0227">Some insight into what reasonable assurance means to the auditor may be gained by recognizing that it is the complement of audit risk: Audit Risk+Assurance Level=100%.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0228">Audit risk is defined in AU sec. 312, Audit Risk and Materiality in Conducting an Audit, as &#x201c;the risk that the auditor may unknowingly fail to appropriately modify his or her opinion on financial statements that are materially misstated.&#x201d; Because the auditor must limit overall audit risk to a low level, reasonable assurance must be at a high level. Stated in mathematical terms, if audit risk is 5 percent, then the level of assurance is 95 percent.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0229">In general, audit risk is the product of inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk:</p><p id="p-0153" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(Audit risk)=(Risk of Material Misstatement)*(Detection risk)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0154" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>where:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0155" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(Risk of Material Misstatement)=(Inherent risk of material misstatement)*(Control Risk)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0156" num="0230">Risk of material misstatement, or RMM, is composed of the inherent risk of material misstatement while the control risk is the controls of the audit client that will not prevent or detect the material misstatement.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0231">The example embodiment discussed below is demonstrated using audit of revenue and receivable. The revenue and receivable accounts capture the revenue generated through the order to cash process. The order to cash process includes the creation of sales order, preparation of shipping (if the order involves a shipment), invoicing of the customer, and receipt of the payment when the customer pays. This process is repeated for all the transactions that are recorded in the revenue account within the general ledger.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0232">During the order to cash process, various information systems may need to participate in the business process. The sales orders are captured in the order management system (which can be part of the ERP system), which will trigger the warehouse management to prepare the shipment according to the delivery date. When the product is shipped, the inventory management will record the reduction of the inventory. And the order management will invoice the customer (based on the delivery term). While invoicing the customer, this transaction will be posted in the revenue account (credit) and account receivable account (debit). And when the payment is received, it will be recorded in account receivable (credit) and cash account (debit) within general ledger.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0233">The audit of a revenue account may need to validate the value in the account by tracing the transaction through the system in conjunction with the corroborating evidence to ensure that each transaction has been posted correctly according to the accounting policy ASC 606 (IFRS 15). The sales order is vouched against the purchase order, the shipment is vouched against the Bill of Lading, and the payment is vouched against a variety of payment details such as bank statement, credit card processor settlement report, ACH daily report, etc.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Data Integrity</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0234">Data integrity intends to accomplish existence (or occurrence), completeness, and accuracy for the audit process. Data integrity includes vouching and tracing:</p><p id="p-0161" num="0235">Vouching refers to the inspection of documentary evidence supporting and substantiating a transaction. It is the practice of establishing the authenticity of the transactions recorded in the primary books of account. It includes verifying a transaction recorded in the books of account with the relevant documentary evidence and the authority on the basis of which the entry has been made; also confirming that the amount mentioned in the voucher has been posted to an appropriate account which would disclose the nature of the transaction on its inclusion in the final statements of account. In some embodiments, vouching does not include valuation.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0236">Tracing is the process of following a transaction in the accounting records back to the source document. This may involve locating an item in the general ledger, tracing it back to a subsidiary ledger (if necessary) to look for the unique identifying document number, and then going to the accounting files to locate the source document. Tracing is used to track down transactional errors, and also to verify that transactions were recorded properly.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0237">Tracing provides evidence for completeness. Vouching provides evidence for occurrence. Tracing from a document to the financial statement may indicate completeness but not occurrence, because there are pieces of that overall financial statement number that haven't been looked at. Vouching may indicate occurrence, but not completeness, as an original document may be missing (e.g., if it was not included in a financial statement to begin with).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0238">Modality of the documentary evidence, in some embodiments, is in the form of documents, whether it is a pdf file, a word file, an excel spreadsheet, or an email. Evidence provided by third parties, such as a bank, a shipping company, or customer of an entity may serve as better evidence than evidence produced directly by the audited entity. Evidence provided by a third party in a digital form such as data that can be directly acquired through an API or web portal may, in some embodiments, provide the strongest evidence. Evidence available in structured or semi-structured form without requiring further interpretation such as EDI may also provide accurate corroboration, when it is available. Documents in the form of excel, word, or email may require the use of natural language processing to comprehend, while scanned document may require additional OCR to extract the characters, words, entities, paragraphs and tables from the documents.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0239">In some embodiments, data integrity validation may be performed as follows for each of the following kinds of FSLI:<ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0240">Revenue and Receivables: evidence may include one or more of: purchase order, various forms of shipping confirmation (e.g., bill of lading, proof of delivery, packing slip, packing list, shipping confirmation from third-party such as Shippo.com), various forms of payment details (e.g., cash receipts, bank statements, eChecks, remittance advice, ACH report, information from third party such as plaid.com), transaction and settlement report for credit card, and/or various forms of contracts.

Identification of the ERP data entry with the extracted document entry may be determined by the PO Number, and fuzzy comparison may be performed on the given configurable input list of fields to compare.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0268">Bill of Lading Vouching:</p><p id="p-0177" num="0269">This module performs symmetric vouching and tracing between invoice data in the customer ERP system and bill of lading forms data extracted (for example using ABBYY Flexicapture) from the physical Bill of Lading&#x2014;including packing slip, packing list, and/or BoL form after post-processing has been performed. Identification of the ERP data entry with the extracted document entry is determined by the Sales order or Invoice number, and fuzzy comparison is performed on the given configurable input list of fields to compare.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0270">Third-Party Shipping Record Vouching:</p><p id="p-0179" num="0271">Using the multi-carrier shipment tracking API (e.g. Shippo), this module may validate the accepted date, delivered date, ship from address, and/or ship to address of a given shipment.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0272">Payment Vouching:</p><p id="p-0181" num="0273">The Cash Receipts Vouching Module compares the ERP journal payment entry with evidence of payment from various supporting documents such as bank statement, eChecks, Remittance Advice, daily ACH report, and/or credit card settlement report. One or more of two different algorithms may be used to attempt to match journal voucher data with bank statement data. The first algorithm is a &#x201c;Fuzzy Date+Amount&#x201d; algorithm. Under this first algorithm, journal vouchers and bank statements are matched by considering their date and amount; in the case of date, a certain window of days for matching (+/&#x2212;delta_days_windows) may be allowed, as there may be small discrepancies between date recorded on a bank statement versus on a journal entry. The second algorithm is a &#x201c;Knapsack Amount Matching&#x201d; algorithm. Under this second algorithm, in cases such as counter deposit or a lump-sum deposit, a single bank transaction can map to a number of journal vouchers. Knapsack matching allows consideration of groups of journal vouchers matching to a single bank statement transaction, and may return several possible groups of journal vouchers that sum to the bank statement transaction's amount. To pick the optimal from several possible groups, the system may select the group of journal vouchers that has the highest match score, wherein the match score may be based on fuzzy comparing customer name and mentioned invoices' amounts.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Process Integrity Modules</heading><p id="p-0182" num="0274">Sales Order to Invoice:</p><p id="p-0183" num="0275">This module checks correspondence between sales orders and invoices to ensure that the customer information (e.g., name, billing &#x26; shipping addresses, line items in terms of item number, descriptions, and/or unit price) is consistent. This module also helps to validate partially invoiced sales orders.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0276">Invoice to Customer Transaction:</p><p id="p-0185" num="0277">This module checks the correspondence between sales in the customer transaction table (filtered for sales) and the Sales Invoice Headers table. The system may check that each Invoice Number (e.g., primary key) from Customer Transactions are present in Sales Invoice Headers, and vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0278">Payment Journal to Customer Transaction:</p><p id="p-0187" num="0279">This module checks transactions from the PaymentJournal against the payments in Transactions. The system may perform checks at the TransactionID level. The system may fuzzy check on the amount, customer account number, date, and/or and currency. Moreover, the system may assign reason codes to any missing transaction in one of the tables, discrepancies between the columns, loss of information during the aggregation from InvoiceNumber to TransactionID level (for the Payment Journal), and/or the relationship between PaymentJournal. InvoiceNumber and PaymentJournal.TransactionID (one-to-one/many-to-one).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0280">Account Receivable Roll Forward:</p><p id="p-0189" num="0281">This module is designed to present a beginning balance and reconciles by reviewing the current period account receivable activities for accuracy to arrive at the ending balance. The module starts with the LedgerTransactionList table and performs COA number and financial period filtering to identify journal entries of interest. Afterwards, VoucherNumbers from the identified entries were used to perform left join on GeneralLedgerARPosted and GeneralLedgerARRemoved to fetch voucher header information and invoice level information. Note that the AR is posted when invoicing the customer and removed when the payment is received. For each entry, the type of account receivable activity, original invoice amount, recalculated invoice amount, and/or match metrics are identified and calculated.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0282">AR Removed Extended:</p><p id="p-0191" num="0283">This module may validate that AR-removed entries correspond to payment received voucher and can be linked to a corresponding invoice.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0284">Return of Inventory:</p><p id="p-0193" num="0285">This module ensures that items related to a credit memo were properly added back to inventory on the financial statements if they were supposed to be (e.g., by validating that they were not scrapped or sent back to the customer). The accounting event that occurs at the time of return includes a debit to inventory and a credit to COGS; whereas, a second entry includes a debit to Revenue and a credit to AR. As such, in some embodiments, for every event that an item was credited and not scrapped, there should be an event that adds the item back in the inventory subledger. The module attempts to determine if there is agreement between the item number, unit of measure, and/or quantity of each credit memo to the inventory ledger, while also ensuring that the date of both events occurs during the fiscal year. Each credit memo is assigned a unique identifier that is also present in the inventory ledger (e.g., voucher number), and this is used to identify the existence of the record in both tables. Each credit memo found in the inventory ledger is assigned a binary score of 1 or 0 based on whether or not the voucher assigned to the credit memo was found in the inventory ledger. The module then compares the aforementioned metrics based on fuzzy logic or exact match (quantity only). This step allows the system to determine if inventory was properly added back.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0286">Credit Memo to Customer Transactions:</p><p id="p-0195" num="0287">This module is designed to ensure that credit memos are also included in the customer transaction table. Each credit memo is identified by the invoice number that ends in &#x2018;CCN&#x2019; that is also present in the customer transaction filtered by type of transaction (Sales), and this is used to identify the existence of the record in both tables. Each record found in the invoice table (filtered for credit memos) and transaction tables are assigned a binary score of 1 or 0 based on whether or not they are found in both data sets. Similarly, checks are performed on the amount, customer, date, and/or currency to check the accuracy and validity of the data.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0288">Payment Journal to Customer Transactions:</p><p id="p-0197" num="0289">This module is configured to check transactions from the PaymentJournal against the payments in Transactions.

InvoiceNumber and PaymentJournal.TransactionID (one-to-one/many-to-one).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0290">Inventory Relief:</p><p id="p-0199" num="0291">This module is designed to verify that items being invoiced were properly relieved from inventory. The module attempts to match the item number, unit of measure, quantity, and/or date from invoice lines to the inventory ledger. Additionally, it flags items shipped but not invoiced, items invoiced in advance of relief, and/or invoice/shipping dates that cross fiscal periods. It should be noted that invoiced lines not considered to be an item, such as a service, may not be expected to be relieved because they may not, in some embodiments, be relevant to inventory. Items invoiced with a zero quantity may also not, in some embodiments, be expected to be relieved. Each invoiced line is assigned a common identifier that is also present in the inventory, and this may be used to identify the existence of the record in both tables. Each invoice found in the inventory ledger is assigned a binary score of 1 or 0 based on whether or not the voucher assigned to the invoice was found in the inventory ledger. The module then compares the aforementioned metrics based on fuzzy logic, while expecting an exact match. This step allows the system to determine if inventory was properly relieved. These checks allow the system to ensure that items being recognized as revenue were removed from inventory on the financial statements. The accounting event that occurs at the time of shipment includes a debit to COGS and a credit to Inventory; whereas, the accounting event that occurs at the time of revenue recognition includes a debit to AR and a credit to Revenue. As such, for every event that an item was invoiced, there should be an event that removes the item from the inventory subledger.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Policy Integrity Modules</heading><p id="p-0200" num="0292">Transfer of Control:</p><p id="p-0201" num="0293">This module uses the shipping term to determine whether the transfer control occurs at the shipping point, delivery point, or somewhere in between.

Information integrity including vouching and tracing are essential for FSLI audit in terms of satisfying two foundational assertions&#x2014;completeness and existence. Vouching is to validate the values of the entries in the ledger against their supporting documents (or underlying representation of the real world), while Tracing is to validate each of the documents (or the representation of the real world) and trace it to the entries in the ledger. Vouching is used to establish the &#x201c;existence&#x201d; assertion, while Tracing is used to establish the &#x201c;completeness&#x201d; assertion.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0303">According to known techniques, vouching and tracing are done independently as two separate processes when the audit is based on sampling. For example, sampling rate could be 1-5% of all available transactions during a typical audit. However, known systems and methods for information integrity do not handle fuzzy comparison, do not leverage of context of the evidence (e.g., master data, industry ontology, industry and client knowledge), do not leverage multiple evidence to establish data integrity, do not address the challenge that evidence might have been amended or updated, and do not address one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relationships. Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems and methods that address one or more of the above-identified shortcomings.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0304">Disclosed herein are methods and systems for performing automated (or semi-automated) data processing operations for auditing processes, wherein vouching and tracing (e.g., for FSLI audit for multiple documents and ERP records) are conducted semi-automatically or fully automatically at the same time, wherein the specification and the actual matching of the corresponding fields in the ledger and the supporting source documents are performed automatically.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0305">The systems and methods disclosed herein may provide improvements over known approaches in a variety of ways. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein may perform vouching and tracing simultaneously, as opposed to performing them as two separate processes and/or at two separate times. The systems and methods may classify a collection of documents and identify available evidence for going through the representation faithfulness testing. The systems and methods may simultaneously leverage multiple pieces of evidence (e.g., process more than one piece of evidence in accordance with a single application of a data processing operation) that weigh on a single assertion (perhaps contradictorily).</p><p id="p-0214" num="0306">Furthermore, the systems and methods disclosed herein may leverage a progressive framework to organize the available evidence to ensure fast direct matching while allowing maximal opportunity for matching evidence with higher ambiguity. The systems and methods may progressively organize ERP/ledger data and the collections of unstructured documents based on primary identifiers. Given the potential ambiguity in terms of extracting the identifiers from documents, these documents could be potentially in multiple groups.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0307">Furthermore, the systems and methods disclosed herein may leverage a fuzzy comparison framework to allow potential minor deviations. The systems and methods may simultaneously compare and match the entries from the ledger and unstructured documents. The systems and methods may use fuzzy comparison for numbers and strings from the ledger and unstructured documents.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0308">Furthermore, the systems and methods disclosed herein may leverage contextual information&#x2014;both endogenous and exogenous information and knowledge including master data&#x2014;to ensure that the data is fully comprehended in context.

Note that some of the data such as inventory, shipping, and/or payment may be applicable to multiple FSLIs. The subset selection may be based on a combination of best practice, prior knowledge of the specific industry, and/or and specific client considerations. The window for conducting representation faithfulness validation may start earlier and may end later than an accounting period based on the cutoff criteria, best practice, and/or industry- and client-specific knowledge. Information regarding subset selection may be indicated by user input and/or automatically determined by the system.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0313">The system may establish a set of (potentially multi-modal) evidence (including its provenance/lineage) that may be required to validate the representation faithfulness for the selected subset of data. In some embodiments, evidence may be in structured or semi-structured form, such as EDI message for PO, bank statements, and/or shipping information. Available evidence and its provenance may be recommended based on best practices, for example as indicated by one or more user inputs received by the system.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0314">In some embodiments, a finance system may capture the final state of an agreement or a transaction. Tracing through the entire history started from the original agreement followed by subsequent (e.g., multiple) amendments may be required to fully substantiate the current state of the financial system.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0315">Multiple multi-modal evidence may be required for substantiating a single entry in a finance system. As an example, a sales order in the financial system might require substantiating the unit price from sales contract and quantity from EDI message. As another example, email correspondence may be used to amend original purchase orders or contracts.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0316">The system may collect of evidence (e.g., each evidence may include one or more fields) associated with entries in the financial system (e.g., with one or more fields) at the transaction level, where the association may be defined by a similarity metric between evidence and the data in the financial system. In some embodiments, collection and/or selection of evidence may be based on automatic processing by the system that may be performed on the basis of the identification, by the system, as to what pieces of evidence are needed to validate the financial data that has been selected for validation. In some embodiments, a user man specify which evidence should be collected.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0317">One or more pieces of evidence may be represented by one or more feature vectors. One or more entries from the financial system may be represented by one or more feature vectors. Feature vectors may be generated and stored by the system based on applying one or more data processing and/or information extraction operations to the collected evidence and collected financial system entries.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0318">In some embodiments, the system may represent one or more pieces of evidence, as a feature vector. The system may generate and store feature vectors based on documents or other data representing evidence that is received by the system. The system may be configured to generate one or more feature vectors to represent a subset of data within a financial system (such as an ERP system) within a specified time period (e.g., an accounting period) where validation of representation faithfulness through vouching and tracing between data the financial systems and various evidence is to be performed. The system may be configured to generate one or more feature vectors to represent one or more of a set of (potentially multi-modal) evidence (including its provenance/lineage) that may be used to validate the representation faithfulness.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0319">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to encode contextual information into one or more feature vectors, thereby capturing context awareness. For example, feature vectors may be generated, at least in part, based on metadata, file names, and/or other contextual information when obtaining documents from a document repository or other data source. Feature vectors may also be generated, at least in part, based on computing from the content extracted from the evidence such as purchase order number, invoice number, payment journal ID, amount, and/or customer name. Feature vectors may also be generated, at least in part, based on computing from additional contextual information, whether endogenous and/or exogenous. Feature vector for a field level evidence may be (or include, or be based on) the value of the field itself.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0320">In some embodiments, the system may compute a similarity metric that quantifies/scores the similarity between evidence (e.g., ingested documents) and the data in the financial system (e.g., FSLIs) to determine the association between a record in the financial system and the evidence. This may establish the potential one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and/or many-to-many relationships among evidence and data from the financial systems. Computing of similarity metrics may be based on a feature vector representing one or more of the pieces of evidence and/or based on a feature vector representing one or more pieces of data in the financial system. In some embodiments, the system may use one or more weights in the similarity metric calculation. Said weights may be prescribed by a user and/or may be trained using a machine learning model, e.g., with continuous learning based on the observed performance of the similarity metric. Computing the similarity metric between feature vector(s) representing the evidence and the data from financial systems may be conducted based on dynamic programming.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0321">In some embodiments, the system may generate output data that indicates a level, quantification, classification, and/or extent of representation faithfulness, wherein the output may be generated based on the similarity metric. In some embodiments, the output may be based on selecting a subset of similarity metrics that indicate the highest level of similarity. In some embodiments, the output may be based on performing classification and/or clustering based on computed similarity metrics.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0322">In some embodiments, the output may be generated in accordance with the following. The system may establish representation faithfulness based on ontological representation of the entries in the financial system to the individual fields within the entries. A measure of representation faithfulness may be based, at least in part, on confidence (based, e.g., on the similarity metric computed) that similarity exists between the evidence and data in the financial system. Sufficiency of the representation faithfulness at each level of an entry may be established either through explicit specification or implicit models. The association between evidence and transactions/entries in the financial systems may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many. Representation faithfulness can be determined based on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0323">In some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may be configured in accordance with the following dimensions for consideration in evidence matching:<ul id="ul0040" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0040-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0041" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0041-0001" num="0324">Data modality        <ul id="ul0042" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0042-0001" num="0325">Excel</li>            <li id="ul0042-0002" num="0326">Web forms</li>            <li id="ul0042-0003" num="0327">ERP</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0002" num="0328">Evidence Modality        <ul id="ul0043" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0043-0001" num="0329">OCR+Document Understanding            <ul id="ul0044" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0044-0001" num="0330">Scanned pdf,</li>                <li id="ul0044-0002" num="0331">Signature, Handwriting</li>            </ul>            </li>            <li id="ul0043-0002" num="0332">Document Understanding            <ul id="ul0045" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0045-0001" num="0333">Email</li>                <li id="ul0045-0002" num="0334">Word, Excel</li>                <li id="ul0045-0003" num="0335">EDI</li>                <li id="ul0045-0004" num="0336">XBRL</li>            </ul>            </li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0003" num="0337">Evidence type        <ul id="ul0046" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0046-0001" num="0338">Invoice</li>            <li id="ul0046-0002" num="0339">PO</li>            <li id="ul0046-0003" num="0340">BoL, PoD</li>            <li id="ul0046-0004" num="0341">Contract/Lease</li>            <li id="ul0046-0005" num="0342">8K/10K/10Q</li>            <li id="ul0046-0006" num="0343">Tax Returns</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0004" num="0344">Entity Extraction        <ul id="ul0047" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0047-0001" num="0345">Header vs. Line</li>            <li id="ul0047-0002" num="0346">PO #, Invoice #</li>            <li id="ul0047-0003" num="0347">Amount (Line, Total)</li>            <li id="ul0047-0004" num="0348">Date</li>            <li id="ul0047-0005" num="0349">Customer Name/Address</li>            <li id="ul0047-0006" num="0350">Product description/SKU</li>            <li id="ul0047-0007" num="0351">Delivery terms/Payment Terms</li>            <li id="ul0047-0008" num="0352">Quantity, Unit Price</li>            <li id="ul0047-0009" num="0353">Currency</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0005" num="0354">Normalization        <ul id="ul0048" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0048-0001" num="0355">Master data (customer master, product master)</li>            <li id="ul0048-0002" num="0356">Ontology (e.g. incoterm 2020)</li>            <li id="ul0048-0003" num="0357">ERP variation</li>            <li id="ul0048-0004" num="0358">Client variation</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0006" num="0359">Contextualization        <ul id="ul0049" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0049-0001" num="0360">Order to Cash</li>            <li id="ul0049-0002" num="0361">Procure to Pay</li>            <li id="ul0049-0003" num="0362">Record to Report</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0007" num="0363">Source of Context        <ul id="ul0050" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0050-0001" num="0364">Endogenous</li>            <li id="ul0050-0002" num="0365">Exogenous</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0041-0008" num="0366">Matching Approach        <ul id="ul0051" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0051-0001" num="0367">Direct vs. Circumstantial            <ul id="ul0052" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0052-0001" num="0368">Precise</li>                <li id="ul0052-0002" num="0369">Fuzzy (with similarity score &#x26;

It is also foundational to the assurance of financial statements.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0387">Information integrity may be defined as the representational faithfulness of the information to the underlying subject of that information and the fitness of the information for its intended use. Information can be structured (e.g., tabular data, accounting transactions), semi-structured (e.g., XML) or unstructured (e.g., text, images and video). Information consists of representations regarding one or more events and/or instances that have been created for a specified use. Such events or instances can have numerous attributes and characteristics that may or may not be included in a set of information, depending on the intended use of the information.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0388">There are various risks associated with the design, creation and use of information as well as when performing an attestation engagement on its integrity. Four types of risks to information integrity have been suggested in the AICPA Whitepaper on Information Integrity (2013):<ul id="ul0057" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0057-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0058" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0058-0001" num="0389">1. Subject matter risk is the risk that suitable criteria cannot be developed for the events or instances and information about the events or instances is inappropriate for the use for which it is intended&#x2014;its fitness for purpose. It may include (1) The attributes of interest related to the event or instance or the environmental attributes and other meta-information may not be observable or measurable. (2) The information that can be supplied is misleading or is likely to be misunderstood by its intended recipient.</li>        <li id="ul0058-0002" num="0390">2. Use risk: is the risk that the information will be used for other than its intended purpose, used incorrectly, or not used when it should be. It includes (1) An intended user will make use of the information for purposes beyond its intended use or fail to use information for its intended uses resulting in erroneous decision-making or misunderstanding on the part of the user. (2) Someone other than the intended user will make use of the information resulting in a misunderstanding on the part of the user or an erroneous decision.</li>        <li id="ul0058-0003" num="0391">3. Information design risk: includes those risks of misstatement that arise from the failure of the information design to address subject matter and use risks, as well as the risks inherent in the activities that occur throughout the lifecycle of the information</li>        <li id="ul0058-0004" num="0392">4. Information processing lifecycle risk: includes of those risks that are introduced during the life cycle of particular pieces of information (1) Creation or identification of data (2) Measurement (3) Documentation or recording (4) Input (5) Processing, change or aggregation to transform data into information (6) Storage or archiving (7) Output or retrieval (8) Use (9) Destruction</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0236" num="0393">All the risks discussed above show that the integrity of information depends on the integrity of the meta-information. These risks and their nature therefore may, in some embodiments, be considered when reporting on information.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0394">Within the professional standards, opinions related to the integrity of information are arrived at by measuring or evaluating the information reported against suitable criteria. Since the criteria are closely related to the meta-information, it follows that the identification of criteria requires an analysis of the meta-information necessary to understand the subject matter. Information that contains complete meta-information would provide a greater array of possible criteria for evaluating information integrity or reporting on information integrity. For example, if the meta-information states that the information is prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, then this could be the criteria used for evaluating the information. In some embodiments, criteria must be suitable, which means they must be objective, measurable, complete and relevant. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the criteria must be identifiable and capable of consistent evaluation; consistent not only between periods but between entities or similar circumstances. In addition, it is important that the criteria can be subjected to procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence to support the opinion or conclusion provided in the practitioner's report. Moreover, in some embodiments, metrics may be selected that address the risks that were identified.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0395">Information integrity in the context of financial statement audit focuses on the representational faithfulness of the information used the financial statement audit. Financial statement audit includes the following categories, which is often referred to as Financial Statement Line Items (FSLI). A subset of these FSLIs are listed below:</p><p id="p-0239" num="0396">1. Revenue &#x26; Account Receivables:</p><p id="p-0240" num="0397">2.

Goodwill &#x26; Intangible</p><p id="p-0249" num="0406">Each of these line items may require the line item information in the general ledger to be connected to the real world. As an example, account receivable will need to be connect to the invoice and purchase order, account payable will need to be connect to the purchase order, invoice and goods received, journal entries will need supporting documents, and inventory require direct observation of the warehouse.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0407">This disclosure addresses the one of the major risk areas on information integrity&#x2014;information processing cycle risk as it is recurrent for handling each financial report. Other risk areas of information integrity are out of scope for this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0408">Common techniques for establishing the representation faithfulness for most of the FSLIs are based on documents (paper or electronic) that captured the events taking place in the real world using Vouching &#x26; Tracing Techniques.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0409">A vouching approach for PO based on sampling may involve the following steps:<ul id="ul0059" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0059-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0060" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0060-0001" num="0410">1.

Note that some of these evidences may come from one or more third parties&#x2014;such as evidence coming directly from bank or shipping companies. Some of the evidence could be in the form of semi-structured (such as EDI or XML/EDI message).</p><p id="p-0256" num="0436">The process for validating representation faithfulness may include one or more of the following steps:</p><p id="p-0257" num="0000">Step One&#x2014;Establish Subset of Data within the Financial System</p><p id="p-0258" num="0437">The system may establish a subset of data within the financial systems (such as an ERP) within the specified accounting period where validation of representation faithfulness through vouching &#x26; tracing between data in financial systems and various evidence.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0438">The accounting period could be the full year, a single quarter, a month, a week, or a single day (e.g., in the case of continuous control and monitoring).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0439">The subset selection may be based on a combination of best practice, prior knowledge of the specific industry, and specific client. The data within the financial systems that are related to revenue and receivable FSLI audit and might require going through validation of faithful representation include sales order tables, sales invoice tables, and payment journal tables.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0440">The window for conducting representation faithfulness validation might start slightly earlier and ends later than the accounting period based on the cutoff criteria as well as best practice as well as the industry and client specific knowledge.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Step Two&#x2014;Establish Set of Evidence Required for Validation</heading><p id="p-0262" num="0441">The system may establish a set of (potentially multi-modal) evidence (including its provenance/lineage) that may be required to validate the representation faithfulness</p><p id="p-0263" num="0442">Representation faithfulness for sales order is often based on purchase orders or contracts. A purchase order might be received in the form of a pdf, an email, an excel spreadsheet, a word document, an EDI message. Different part of sales order might be coming from different sources with different modalities. As an example, the sales order in automotive part manufacturing industry could have the price established by a sales contract and the quantity might be received through EDI message for just in time delivery. Alternatively, the pricing for commodity order could be based on a daily pricing table as opposed to based on agreement in advance.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0443">Representation faithfulness for shipping confirmation could be based on Bill of Lading, proof of delivery, packing list, or packing slip. It can be in the form of EDI message or obtained from third-party service provider (such as shippo.com)</p><p id="p-0265" num="0444">Representation faithfulness for payment journal could be based on various form of payment details, including check image, remittance advice, bank statement, daily ACH report, daily credit card settlement report, EDI message or obtained from third-party service provider (such as plaid.com)</p><p id="p-0266" num="0445">Validation of faithful representation may include using both the content and metadata associated with the evidence. In particular, the provenance and lineage of the evidence can greatly facilitate the validation process (see, USP US20100114628A1; US 20100114629A1) Provenance or lineage for the evidence captures everything related from the moment that the evidence is created. It should keep track where the evidence sits, who and when it was accessed, and the operations and transformations that might have been applied. Representation faithfulness can be entirely conducted on the provenance alone if the provenance captures everything from the time the evidence was created to the moment it was loaded into the financial systems, and if the provenance/lineage can be demonstrated to be non-alterable and hence non-repudiation can be fully established.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0446">Note that the finance system often captures the final state of an agreement or a transaction.

Subsequently, matching may be performed within each purchase order document for purchase order number, customer, delivery &#x26; payment terms, and individual line items. Some of these items may need to be further explored&#x2014;such as the customer and line items. The overall confidence score for each of the items may influence the overall rank of the evidence. As an example, top-2 documents that might be candidates for the entry in the financial system are doc_1 and doc_2 with similarity score (or confidence score) of c_11 and c_12. The subsequent evaluation of the combined confidence score for the next level evaluation is c_21 and c_22. The overall confidence for c_1 becomes c_11*c_21 and for c_2 becomes c_12*c_22 using the definition for fuzzyAND. Consequently, the relative rank between these two evidences as potential match to the entry in the financial system could change.
