application relates to the field of power conversion technologies, and in particular, to an uninterruptible power system and a driving method for an uninterruptible power system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, an uninterruptible power system (UPS) is an automatic system for supplying power without interruption when power interruption or failure occurs. The UPS is a component configured to supply power to an electronic device such as a computer, and such an electronic device requires continuous and uninterrupted power supply. Even when a voltage or a frequency of the power changes, or when the power is instantaneously cut off, the UPS can stably supply power. This reduces a possibility that data in the electronic device is damaged or lost, and avoids a shutdown or failure of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, the UPS includes a bypass and a main circuit. An ideal UPS ensures uninterrupted output of power through collaboration of the bypass and the main circuit. Power supply characteristics of the main circuit are a stable signal, but low efficiency and a high loss. Power supply characteristics of the bypass are high efficiency, but relatively poor signal stability compared with the main circuit. Depending on different requirements, the UPS generally includes two power supply modes. In one power supply mode, the main circuit preferentially supplies power, and the bypass serves as a backup power supply circuit. In the other mode, the bypass preferentially supplies power, and the main circuit serves as a backup power supply circuit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the power supply mode in which the bypass preferentially supplies power and the main circuit serves as a backup power supply circuit, the main circuit starts to work when power supply of the bypass is abnormal. In a conventional technology, a commonly used solution for power supply switching between the bypass and the main circuit is interrupted switching. After power supply of the bypass becomes abnormal, in a process of switching from the bypass to the main circuit, neither the bypass nor the main circuit supplies power, and output interruption occurs for a short time. In this way, there is short-time output interruption in a UPS output process. Consequently, a load connected to the UPS likely has a power outage, and a user requirement cannot be met.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides an uninterruptible power system and a driving method for an uninterruptible power system, to resolve output interruption of the uninterruptible power system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the foregoing objective, this application uses the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of this application, an uninterruptible power system is provided, and includes a first power input end, a second power input end, a load end, and a bypass, where the bypass includes a first bidirectional switch, and the first bidirectional switch is connected to the first power input end and the load end, and is configured to control connection or disconnection between the first power input end and the load end; and at least one main circuit, where each main circuit includes a bus and an inverter output unit. An input end of the bus is connected to the second power input end, and an output end of the bus is connected to the inverter output unit. The inverter output unit is further connected to the load end, and the inverter output unit is configured to control whether to perform DC-AC conversion on a current inputted from the output end of the bus, and transmit a current to the load end. A voltage value of the current outputted by the inverter output unit is different from a theoretical voltage value of a current outputted by the first power input end.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the uninterruptible power system provided in an embodiment of this application, the inverter output unit controls a current in the main circuit, so that when a voltage of a current in the bypass is normal, the current in the main circuit is controlled to be interrupted. When the voltage of the current in the bypass is abnormal, the main circuit is controlled to be connected, to output a current to the load end, thereby completing power supply switching from the bypass to the main circuit. In addition, for example, when a voltage value of a current transmitted from the first power input end to the load end abruptly drops and exceeds a lower threshold, switching from power supply of the bypass to power supply of the main circuit is performed. A first specified voltage value (for example, 210 VAC) of the current outputted by the inverter output unit is less than the theoretical voltage value (for example, 220 VAC) of the current outputted by the first power input end. Therefore, when the voltage value of the current of the first power input end abruptly drops, causing an actual voltage value of the current received by the load end to be less than the first specified voltage value of the current outputted by the inverter output unit, instantaneous switching to the main circuit is continuously performed to supply power to the load end. In other words, when a voltage value of a current supplied by the bypass to the load end is less than a voltage value of a current supplied by the main circuit M to the load end, automatic switching to the main circuit is performed to supply a current to the load end. This implements seamless switching from power supply of the bypass to power supply of the main circuit, and ensures uninterrupted output of the uninterruptible power system. In addition, when the power supply of the bypass is abnormal, the UPS provided in this example instantaneously switches to the power supply of the main circuit. When the bypass supplies power, no signal in the main circuit flows to the load end. Therefore, there is no case in which the main circuit and the bypass are simultaneously conducted to form a cross current, thereby avoiding affecting system reliability of the UPS due to the cross current formed by the two circuits that are simultaneously conducted.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the inverter output unit includes an inverter and a first controller. The inverter is connected to the output end of the bus, the load end, and the first controller, and the inverter is turned on under control of the first controller, and is configured to perform DC-AC conversion on the current inputted from the output end of the bus, and then transmit the current to the load end.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inverter output unit is disposed in a structure including the inverter and the first controller, so that physical components included in the inverter output unit can be reduced, an integration degree of the inverter output unit can be improved, and a volume of the UPS can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, there are two or more main circuits. A plurality of first controllers in the two or more main circuits are integrated in a same control unit. Distribution of the plurality of first controllers may be simplified, to simplify a layout of the UPS.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the inverter output unit includes an inverter and a second bidirectional switch. The inverter is connected to the output end of the bus and the second bidirectional switch, and is configured to perform DC-AC conversion on the current inputted from the output end of the bus, and then transmit the current to the second bidirectional switch. The second bidirectional switch is further connected to the load end, and is configured to control whether to transmit, to the load end, the current outputted by the inverter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inverter output unit is disposed in a structure including the inverter and the second bidirectional switch. When a signal inputted by the first power input end is normal, the second bidirectional switch is turned off due to a reverse voltage. When a signal inputted by the first power input end is abnormal, the second bidirectional switch is directly and naturally turned on, to automatically switch to the power supply of the main circuit without a determining process or a separate control component. This improves intelligence of the UPS.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, there are two or more main circuits. In the two or more main circuits, a voltage value of a current outputted by an inverter output unit in at least one main circuit is greater than the theoretical voltage value of the current outputted by the first power input end; and a voltage value of a current outputted by an inverter output unit in at least one main circuit is less than the theoretical voltage value of the current outputted by the first power input end.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this way, when a supply voltage of the bypass abruptly drops and exceeds a lower threshold, switching to power supply of one main circuit can be performed. When the supply voltage of the bypass abruptly increases and exceeds an upper threshold, switching to power supply of another main circuit can be performed. Therefore, both ultra-low voltage protection and ultra-high voltage protection can be performed, to prevent a very low or very high voltage value of a current outputted by the UPS from damaging a load connected to the UPS.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the first bidirectional switch includes a first silicon controlled rectifier and a second silicon controlled rectifier.

The uninterruptible power system includes a first power input end, a second power input end, a load end, and a bypass, where the bypass includes a first bidirectional switch, and the first bidirectional switch is connected to the first power input end and the load end; and a first main circuit, where the first main circuit includes a bus and an inverter output unit. An input end of the bus is connected to the second power input end, an output end of the bus is connected to the inverter output unit, and the inverter output unit is further connected to the load end. The driving method for an uninterruptible power system includes: in a first state, turning on the first bidirectional switch in the bypass to transmit a current of the first power input end to the load end by using the first bidirectional switch; and in a second state, controlling, by the first bidirectional switch, the first power input end to be disconnected from the load end; and performing, by the inverter output unit in the first main circuit, DC-AC conversion on a current inputted from the output end of the bus, and transmitting a current whose voltage value is a first voltage value to the load end, where the first voltage value of the current outputted by the inverter output unit in the first main circuit is different from a theoretical voltage value of a current outputted by the first power input end.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the driving method for a UPS provided in an embodiment of this application, the inverter output unit controls a current in the main circuit, so that when a voltage of a current in the bypass is normal, the current in the main circuit is controlled to be interrupted. When the voltage of the current in the bypass is abnormal, the main circuit is controlled to be connected, to output a current to the load end, thereby completing power supply switching from the bypass to the main circuit. In addition, for example, when a voltage value of a current transmitted from the first power input end to the load end abruptly drops and exceeds a lower threshold, switching from power supply of the bypass to power supply of the main circuit is performed. A first specified voltage value (for example, 210 VAC) of the current outputted by the inverter output unit is less than the theoretical voltage value (for example, 220 VAC) of the current outputted by the first power input end. Therefore, when the voltage value of the current of the first power input end abruptly drops, causing an actual voltage value of the current received by the load end to be less than the first specified voltage value of the current outputted by the inverter output unit, instantaneous switching to the main circuit is continuously performed to supply power to the load end. In other words, when a voltage value of a current supplied by the bypass to the load end is less than a voltage value of a current supplied by the main circuit to the load end, automatic switching to the main circuit is performed to supply a current to the load end. This implements seamless switching from power supply of the bypass to power supply of the main circuit, and ensures uninterrupted output of the UPS.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Optionally, the inverter output unit in the first main circuit includes an inverter and a first controller, and the inverter is connected to the output end of the bus, the load end, and the first controller.

The performing, by the inverter output unit in the first main circuit, DC-AC conversion on a current inputted from the output end of the bus, and transmitting a current whose voltage value is a first voltage value to the load end includes: controlling, by the first controller in the first main circuit, the inverter to be turned on, and performing, by the inverter, DC-AC conversion on the current inputted from the output end of the bus in the first main circuit, and transmitting the current whose voltage value is the first voltage value to the load end.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this example, whether the power supply of the bypass is normal is determined by collecting an instantaneous value of the actual voltage value of the current outputted by the load end.

Determining that the bypass is abnormal is instantaneously completed, and controlling, by the first controller, the inverter to output the current whose voltage value is the first voltage value is also instantaneously completed. Therefore, instantaneous switching to the first main circuit can be continuously performed to supply power to the load end.

Therefore, in this example, when the power supply of the bypass exceeds an upper threshold, instantaneous switching from the power supply of the bypass to the power supply of the first main circuit can be performed, without continuously outputting a high-voltage signal for a period of time before switching to the power supply of the first main circuit, thereby reducing a time in which the UPS continuously outputs an abnormal current.
