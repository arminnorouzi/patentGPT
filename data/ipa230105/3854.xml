The laser radar may transmit laser light to a detection environment, to detect an echo signal reflected by each sampling point in the detection environment and measure a target distance and a target angle of each sampling point based on each echo signal, and then, input each target distance and each target angle into a point cloud computing algorithm that is prestored on the laser radar, to obtain a measurement value of three-dimensional coordinates of each sampling in a same coordinate system, that is, a measurement value of a point cloud used to indicate the detection environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, one or more variable parameters are set in the point cloud computing algorithm. A value assigned to the variable parameter is adjusted, so that an error (a measurement error for short) between the measurement value that is of the point cloud and that is obtained by using the point cloud computing algorithm and a true value of the point cloud can be changed. To reduce the measurement error and improve accuracy of a laser radar system, before a measurement operation, the laser radar system may first calibrate a value of the variable parameter in the point cloud computing algorithm, and then perform the measurement operation based on the calibrated point cloud computing algorithm.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an existing method for calibrating an error parameter of a laser radar system, M planar calibration planes are first disposed in a calibration field. The laser radar system scans each planar calibration plane, assigns a measurement value to an error parameter in a point cloud computing algorithm to obtain a detected first point cloud, and fits a plane equation of the M plane calibration planes based on the first point cloud. The error parameter in the point cloud computing algorithm is used as a variable to obtain a corresponding detected second point cloud, and a position of any sampling point in the second point cloud is a function that uses the error parameter as an independent variable. For an accurate error parameter, the following limiting condition needs to be met: The second point cloud meets a plane equation used to describe a corresponding calibration plane. Therefore, in a conventional technology, a cost function is constructed based on a distance from the second point cloud to a plane represented by the fitted plane equation, and a variable of the cost function is the error parameter. Then, the error parameter of the laser radar system is calibrated by calculating an optimal solution of the cost function.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, there is a relatively large difference between an initial value of each error parameter and a true value of each error parameter. Therefore, there is a relatively large difference between a point cloud obtained by setting the error parameter to the initial value and a position of an m<sup>th </sup>calibration plane, and there is a relatively large difference between a plane described by a plane equation fitted based on the point cloud and a plane of the m<sup>th </sup>calibration plane. This is not conducive to improvement of point cloud measurement accuracy of the laser radar system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of this application provide a method and an apparatus for calibrating a parameter of a laser radar, and the method and the apparatus are used to calibrate a parameter in a point cloud computing algorithm in a laser radar system, to improve point cloud measurement accuracy of the laser radar system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a method for calibrating a parameter of a laser radar, including: obtaining three-dimensional coordinates, in a same coordinate system, of a plurality of sampling points detected on a calibration plane by a plurality of beams of laser light transmitted by a laser radar system, where the three-dimensional coordinates of the plurality of sampling points are obtained by inputting measurement information of the plurality of sampling points into a point cloud computing algorithm using a first parameter as a variable, three-dimensional coordinates of any one of the plurality of sampling points are a function using the first parameter as an independent variable, and the measurement information of the plurality of sampling points is used to determine target angles and target distances of the plurality of sampling points relative to the laser radar system; determining a predicted value that is of the first parameter and that enables a cost function using the first parameter as an independent variable to have an optimal solution, where the cost function is determined based on the three-dimensional coordinates of the plurality of sampling points and a fitting function for the plurality of sampling points, and the predicted value of the first parameter is used to enable the three-dimensional coordinates of the plurality of sampling points to meet the fitting function; and assigning a value to the first parameter in the point cloud computing algorithm based on the predicted value of the first parameter.

Because the predicted value of the first parameter is determined based on the measurement information of the sampling point and the optimal solution of the cost function, a fitted plane corresponding to the fitting function is closer to the calibration plane, and the predicted value of the first parameter is closer to a true value of the first parameter than a preset initial value of the first parameter in a conventional technology.

The laser radar system may emit laser light to the detection environment, and detect an echo signal reflected by a sampling point in the detection environment. When an echo signal of a beam of laser light is detected, measurement information of the laser light or measurement information that is of the sampling point and that is detected by the laser light may be calculated. For example, the laser radar system may calculate a distance (referred to as a detection distance of the laser light) between the sampling point and an emission point of the laser light based on flight duration, and the laser radar system may further calculate an emission angle of the laser light, for example, a horizontal exit angle and a vertical exit angle. Then, the laser radar system may input the measurement information (that is, the detection distance and the emission angle) of the laser light into a point cloud computing algorithm to obtain three-dimensional coordinates of each sampling point. The point cloud computing algorithm may be a program pre-stored in the laser radar system, and the program is used to output the three-dimensional coordinates of each sampling point that are detected by the laser radar system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The three-dimensional coordinates are a point that has a specific meaning and that includes three mutually independent variables. The three-dimensional coordinates represent a point in space, and have different expression forms in different three-dimensional coordinate systems. As an example in this embodiment of this application, a three-dimensional coordinate system is a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, and the three-dimensional coordinates are three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. For example, input of the point cloud computing algorithm includes a horizontal exit angle, a vertical exit angle, and a detection distance of laser light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a principle that the point cloud computing algorithm is based on.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a length of the dashed line with an arrow is used to represent the detection distance R of the laser light.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">However, there is usually an error (referred to as a measurement error) between the three-dimensional coordinates of the sampling point that are obtained by the point cloud computing algorithm and a real position of the sampling point, and a corresponding measurement error is not considered in the formula (1). Consequently, there is a relatively large difference between a measurement position that is of the sampling point and that is calculated by the laser radar system and the real position of the sampling point, and accuracy of a detection result of the laser radar system is reduced. To improve accuracy of a calculation result, a parameter (referred to as an error parameter) that is used to eliminate the corresponding measurement error needs to be introduced into the formula (1).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">For example, there are usually the following several measurement errors and corresponding error parameters in the laser radar system:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">(1) There is usually a measurement error (specifically referred to as an angle error) in a process in which the laser radar system calculates the emission angle of the laser light. An angle error parameter may be introduced into the formula (1), to eliminate the angle error and obtain an accurate emission angle.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">(2) There is usually a measurement error (specifically referred to as a distance error) in a process in which the laser radar system calculates the detection distance of the laser light. A distance error parameter may be introduced into the formula (1), to eliminate the distance error and obtain an accurate detection distance.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">(3) Laser radar systems may be classified into a single-beam laser radar system and a multi-beam laser radar system. The single-beam laser radar system generates only one laser scanning line when performing scanning once, and the multi-beam laser radar system may generate a plurality of laser scanning lines when performing scanning once. For a laser radar system corresponding to a multi-module laser radar or a laser radar system including a plurality of laser radars, each module or each laser radar in the laser radar system includes one or more lasers and photodetectors, and usually, may generate a plurality of beams of laser light at a time. Emission angles of lasers in different modules or different laser radars are usually different; for example, vertical exit angles of laser light emitted by different modules or different laser radars are different. Each module or each laser radar may emit laser light to the detection environment, and obtain a measurement position in a coordinate system (a module coordinate system for short) of the corresponding module or laser radar based on the formula (1). An origin of the module coordinate system is usually determined by an exit position of the laser light. Because emission positions of laser light of different modules or laser radars are different, different module coordinate systems usually do not overlap, and one of the module coordinate systems is usually selected as a unified coordinate system (referred to as a radar coordinate system). To calculate a position, in a same coordinate system (referred to as a radar coordinate system), of each sampling point in the detection environment based on measurement information that is of laser light and that is obtained by each module or each laser radar, a module error parameter may be introduced into the point cloud computing algorithm to eliminate a difference (referred to as a module error) between another module coordinate system and the radar coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">A possible error parameter model of the laser radar system is described below.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, a start point of a reference laser beam is used as an origin o to construct an xyz coordinate system of the laser radar system, where directions of an x-axis and a z-axis are respectively defined by a horizontal exit angle and a vertical exit angle of the laser beam, and a direction of a y-axis is determined by a right-hand rule.

It is assumed that the laser radar system includes I modules, and each module scans each planar calibration plane. It is assumed that in a process in which each module scans a single calibration plane, J beams of laser light are emitted at different positions or angles. In this case, the laser radar system emits M&#xb7;I&#xb7;J beams of laser light to the M calibration planes, and detects M&#xb7;I&#xb7;J sampling points.

A point cloud based on which the fitted plane of the m<sup>th </sup>calibration plane is determined is obtained by setting each error parameter in the formula (2) to an initial value. Generally, there is a relatively large difference between an initial value of each error parameter and a true value of each error parameter. Therefore, there is a relatively large difference between a point cloud obtained by setting the error parameter to the initial value and a position of the m<sup>th </sup>calibration plane, and there is a relatively large difference between a plane described by a plane equation fitted based on the point cloud and the plane of the m<sup>th </sup>calibration plane. It can be learned that, after the existing laser radar system calibrates each error parameter by calculating an optimal solution of the cost function of the formula (3), there is a relatively large difference between the obtained point cloud and positions of M calibration planes, and calibration accuracy for the error parameter is relatively poor, and consequently, accuracy of the point cloud detected by the laser radar system is reduced.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0082">To improve calibration accuracy for an error parameter in a laser radar system, this application provides another embodiment of a method for calibrating a parameter of a laser radar.

In a conventional technology, a fitting function is determined based on a preset initial value of the first parameter, and the initial value of the first parameter is a fixed value. However, because the true value of the first parameter usually changes with use of the laser radar system, a difference between the initial value of the first parameter and the true value of the first parameter is usually relatively large, and consequently, a difference between the fitted plane and the calibration plane is relatively large, and accuracy of the predicted value of the first parameter is relatively low. In the method for calibrating a parameter of a laser radar provided in this embodiment of this application, the cost function used to determine the predicted value of the first parameter is determined based on the three-dimensional coordinates of the sampling points and the fitting function for the sampling points. The fitting function for the plurality of sampling points uses the first parameter as an independent variable, and accuracy of the fitting function is determined by accuracy of the predicted value of the first parameter. Because the predicted value of the first parameter is determined based on the measurement information of the sampling point and the optimal solution of the cost function, a fitted plane corresponding to the fitting function is closer to the calibration plane, and the predicted value of the first parameter is closer to the true value of the first parameter than a preset initial value of the first parameter in the conventional technology. Therefore, the method in this application is conducive to improvement of accuracy of the predicted value of the first parameter. When the predicted value of the first parameter is the true value of the first parameter, the fitted plane corresponding to the fitting function is the calibration plane.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0100">In a possible implementation, the disposed calibration plane may be a plane, and the fitting function may be a plane equation.

In this embodiment of this application, a single plane limiting condition used in the optimization process is extended to combined limiting conditions, including a limiting condition in which a point cloud is in a plane, a limiting condition in which planes are parallel, a limiting condition in which planes are perpendicular, and a limiting condition in which planes are separated from each other.
