More specifically, this disclosure relates to SO<sub>2 </sub>removal on the emissions streams from a sulfur recovery operation using a CO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane and SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As part of natural gas processing and hydro-treatment of oil fractions, a large amount of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is produced. The conversion of H<sub>2</sub>S into elemental sulfur (S) is performed in a sulfur recovery unit (SRU). A need often exists to minimize the amount of sulfur compounds released to atmosphere from the recovery unit to meet mandated legal limits. The most common process used in the world for this conversion is known as the modified Claus treatment process or alternately the Claus unit or modified Claus unit. The modified Claus treatment process is a combination of thermal and catalytic processes that are used for converting gaseous H<sub>2</sub>S into S.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Claus unit feed gases have a wide range of compositions. Feed gases can originate from absorption processes using various solvents (amine, physical or hybrid solvents) to extract H<sub>2</sub>S from the by-product gases of petroleum refining, natural gas processing, and other industries using sour water stripper units.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first process of a Claus unit is a thermal process in a reaction furnace. The feed gas to the Claus unit is burned in the reaction furnace using sufficient combustion air, or oxygen enriched air to burn a stoichiometric one-third of the contained H<sub>2</sub>S. The H<sub>2</sub>S from the feed gas is thermally converted into S, along with sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). The reaction furnace operation is designed to maximize sulfur recovery in consideration of the feed composition, by adjusting air/oxygen feed, reaction temperature, pressure, additional fuel, and residence time. In addition, the reaction furnace can destroy contaminants, such as hydrocarbons, that are present in the feed gas stream. Such contaminants pose problems for the catalytic reactors through the development of carbon-sulfur compounds that can lead to plugging or deactivation of the catalyst beds. Maintaining proper reaction furnace temperatures is important to maintain effective Claus unit operations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The hot reaction product gas from the reaction furnace containing sulfur vapor is used to produce high pressure steam in a waste heat boiler, which also results in cooling the gas. The product gas is then further cooled and condensed in a heat exchanger, while producing additional low pressure steam. The condensed liquid S is separated from the remaining unreacted gas in the outlet end of the condenser and sent to a sulfur pit or other collection area.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The separated gas then enters the catalytic process of the Claus unit. The catalytic process contains between two and three catalytic reactors. Following the sulfur condenser, the separated gas is reheated and enters the first catalytic reactor. In the first catalytic reaction some of the H<sub>2</sub>S in the feed gas is converted into S through a reaction with the SO<sub>2</sub>. The outlet product gas from the first catalytic reactor is cooled in a second condenser. Again, the condensed liquid S is separated from the remaining unreacted gas in the outlet end of the second condenser and sent to sulfur storage. The separated gas from the second condenser is sent to another re-heater and the sequence of gas reheat, catalytic reaction, condensation and separation of liquid S from unreacted gas is repeated for the second and third catalytic reactors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, the gas stream is released to atmosphere via a stack after passing through an incinerator which oxidizes any remaining sulfur species into SO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the emissions stream compounds include water, nitrogen, oxygen, SO<sub>2 </sub>and eventually carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For a well-designed and well-operated Claus sulfur recovery plant having three catalytic reactors, an overall sulfur conversion of 96-98% can be achieved depending on the feed gas composition. To achieve higher conversion, a tail gas treatment unit must be added to further process the exhaust gas upstream of or as an alternative to an incinerator. Currently available tail gas treatment units can be effective at achieving up to 99.9% recovery, but can add significant capital cost to the Claus treatment unit, often on the same order of magnitude as the Claus unit itself.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several types of tail gas treatment unit (TGTU) technologies have been developed and include the Scot&#xae; process, Highsulf&#x2122;, BSR/MDEA&#x2122;, Sublimate&#x2122;, Bechtel TGTU, and Technip TGTU. The choice of tail gas treatment unit installed depends on the conversion target as cost is directly linked to the required conversion level. While the Scot process can reach 99.9% sulfur recovery, the added cost and unit complexity makes this process unfeasible when the Claus feed is not highly concentrated. In addition to increased operating and capital costs, these technologies can require a significant physical footprint for the various process vessels, columns, pumps, and storage vessels necessary for operation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, processes can be added as an alternative to tail gas treatment units to target SO<sub>2 </sub>for removal and reduce sulfur oxide emissions from combusted gas streams. The techniques are generally divided into regenerative processes and non-regenerative processes and can be further divided into wet processes and dry processes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Non-regenerative processes include a variety of wet-scrubbing processes, such as spray towers and limestone-gypsum processes, and are the leading technologies when high efficiency SO<sub>2 </sub>removal is targeted at relatively low cost. In a limestone-gypsum process, flue gas enters an absorber tower and bubbles through a spray of limestone and water, where the SO<sub>2 </sub>reacts with the lime to create calcium sulfite, which reacts with oxygen to produce gypsum, which can then be disposed. The unreacted gases then exit the top of the tower.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For regenerative processes, sorbent is reused after thermal or chemical treatment to produce concentrated SO<sub>2</sub>, which is usually converted to elemental sulfur. These are complex processes requiring high capital outlays and include the magnesium oxide process and Wellman-Lord process. On the dry process side, regenerative processes include activated carbon.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Regenerative processes can also utilize solvent technologies. Examples of such technologies include LAB-SORB&#x2122;, CANSOLV&#xae;, ClausMaster&#x2122;, and Clintox&#xae;. In most cases, flue gas is not saturated. However, before acid gases such as SO<sub>2 </sub>can be removed, the gas stream must be adiabatically saturated or &#x201c;quenched.&#x201d; Scrubbers can have a section where liquid (typically water or a scrubbing reagent) is contacted with the flue gas to &#x201c;quench&#x201d; the gas stream.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The LAB-SORB&#x2122; process utilizes an inorganic regenerable scrubbing reagent to react with SO<sub>2</sub>. The reagent, rich in SO<sub>2 </sub>from the scrubber, is processed in a regeneration unit to strip off the captured SO<sub>2</sub>, producing fresh reagent for scrubbing. The SO<sub>2 </sub>removed from the reagent is discharged as concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>(90+%) and can be sent to the front end of a Claus plant (or sulfuric acid plant) for recovery. Solids are removed from the flue gas in a pre-scrubbing section and de-watered in a system similar to what is used in the purge treatment unit of caustic soda based FCCU scrubbing system. Caustic soda (NaOH) and phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) are used for the buffer. Low pressure steam is used for buffer regeneration in single or double effects evaporation loop. The LAB-SORB&#x2122; process produces a minimum amount of waste for disposal, while recovered SO<sub>2 </sub>can be converted to saleable products.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The CANSOLV&#xae; system is similar to the amine treatment process for removal of H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2 </sub>from refinery streams and natural gas. The gas is contacted counter currently in the absorption tower, where the CANSOLV&#xae; solvent absorbs the sulfur dioxide, reducing the effluent gas down to the design SO<sub>2 </sub>concentration. The rich amine accumulates in the absorption sump. A constant stream of the CANSOLV&#xae; solvent (based on a sterically hindered diamine) is withdrawn from the absorption sump to be regenerated in the stripping tower. Once regenerated, the solvent is recirculated to the absorption tower to pick up additional SO<sub>2</sub>. Emissions as low as 10 ppmV can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the CLAUSMASTER&#xae; process hot SO<sub>2 </sub>gas is cooled by a DynaWave&#xae; wet scrubber and gas cooling tower. SO<sub>2 </sub>removal occurs after the SO<sub>2 </sub>gas has been quenched in two steps. The acid gases are absorbed into the scrubbing liquid and react with the reagent, forming reaction by-products, which then are removed from the clean gas. After passing through the proprietary SO<sub>2 </sub>physical absorbent, clean gas exits the stack and the SO<sub>2 </sub>is stripped from the SO<sub>2 </sub>loaded absorbent in the stripping tower. Concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>is recycled back to the Claus sulfur recovery plant. The recycled SO<sub>2 </sub>reduces the air and fuel requirements for a typical Claus plant and H<sub>2</sub>S tail gas system. This process is not prevalent in refineries or gas plants as it adds complexity. This process is used for smelters where concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>is directed to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>production as this chemical is being used in the metal manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The CLINTOX&#xae; and SOLINOX&#xae; process is a physical scrubber process. The completely oxidized tail gas containing only SO<sub>2 </sub>is fed to a physical scrubbing tower. The concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>is stripped from the solvent in a second column and sent back to the Claus inlet. In the CLINTOX&#xae; process, the residual SO<sub>2 </sub>in the flue is constant because of the higher solubility of SO<sub>2 </sub>in the scrubbing solution. This self-regulation allows the Claus plant to be less sophisticated and therefore, less expensive. High sulfur recovery rates are attainable with approximately 80 ppmV residual SO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaust gas.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another type of scrubbing system is using caustic/sodium sulfite solution to capture SO<sub>2 </sub>from catalytically oxidized sulfur species. Such a system processes lean acid gas over a catalyst which oxidizes the H<sub>2</sub>S to SO<sub>2 </sub>at a temperature of about 700&#xb0; F. This is desirable for low SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions as produced sodium sulfite has to be disposed in the waste water system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Regardless of which scrubbing technology is selected, one downside of scrubbers is that they all must have a method for removing the water droplets and reaction by-products from the gas before they exit the scrubber. When combined with the conventional Claus process, these processes increase the complexity of the system by requiring additional equipment and materials. In addition, the processes and systems require increases in energy use. All of these processes produce waste streams that require removal and processing. In addition, the processes need to provide removal of particulates in addition to acid gas removal. Most wet gas scrubbers will remove some particulates; however, another piece of equipment, such as a venturi scrubber, is often required to accomplish significant removal of particulates.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Therefore, a process which minimizes SO<sub>2 </sub>being released to atmosphere without requiring excessive amounts of energy, equipment and materials, or process shutdown is desired. Preferably, such a process would maintain the overall sulfur capacity of the Claus unit, while increasing the overall sulfur recovery efficiency. Due to the large amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>present in the tail gas of SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions streams, recycling the streams directly can cause upsets in the Claus treatment units. A more efficient and less disruptive way of recycling tail gas and SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions streams and separating components in the streams is needed. However, the presence of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the tail gas streams can results in complications with separation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Membranes can be used for separation of components in gas streams. Current membranes have difficulty in separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from SO<sub>2 </sub>containing streams. There are many different types of membranes, including porous membranes and dense polymer membranes. The various types of membranes operate via different methods. Dense polymer membranes operate through solution diffusion mechanisms.

Accordingly, the embodiments of the disclosure described are set forth without any loss of generality, and without imposing limitations, on the claims.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0058">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;membrane&#x201d; refers to a structure through which mass transfer can occur under a variety of driving forces. The driving forces can be a pressure differential between the two sides of the membrane generated by a positive pressure on the feed side of the membrane, a vacuum pressure on the permeate side of the membrane, stream component concentration differential between the permeate and retentate sides of the membrane, or combinations of the same. Driving forces that facilitate the transport of one or more components from the inlet gas stream through the selectively permeable membrane can be pressure, concentration, electrical potentials or combinations thereof across the membrane. Membrane operation can be in any mode such as high pressure at the feed side or vacuum pressure on the permeate side. The membrane allows a &#x201c;penetrant&#x201d; (a &#x201c;penetrant&#x201d; is an entity from a phase in contact with one of the membrane surfaces that passes through the membrane) to pass through the membrane from the retentate into the permeate. As used in this disclosure, the &#x201c;retentate&#x201d; is the stream that exits the membrane module without passing through the membrane, and has been depleted of penetrants. The membranes can be single or multilayered. As used in this disclosure, the &#x201c;permeate&#x201d; used as a noun can refer to the stream containing penetrants that leaves the membrane module, or can refer to the liquids and gases that have permeated the membrane of a membrane unit. Permeate can also be used in this disclosure as a verb, and means to spread through or flow through or pass through a membrane of a membrane unit. As an example, liquids and gases can permeate a membrane.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0059">As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;selective layer&#x201d; refers to the membrane layer that is active in allowing the penetrant to pass through the membrane generating the permeate stream. As used in this disclosure, when a membrane is &#x201c;selective for&#x201d; a gas, that refers to the property of the membrane that allows more mass transport across the membrane material of one component as compared to the other component. For example, a CO<sub>2 </sub>over SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane preferentially transports CO<sub>2 </sub>through the membrane in the presence of SO<sub>2 </sub>and other components in the process stream to produce a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched permeate and a CO<sub>2</sub>-depleted retentate. A membrane that is selective for one compound over another, such as a CO<sub>2 </sub>over SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane can be depicted as the following: CO<sub>2 </sub>over SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/SO<sub>2</sub>, or CO<sub>2 </sub>vs. SO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0060">As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;thin-film, composite membranes&#x201d; refers to membranes that consist of a thin polymer barrier layer formed on one or more porous support layers. The polymer barrier layer determines the flux and separation characteristics of the membrane; the porous backing serves only as a support for the selective layer and has no effect on membrane transport properties. As used in this disclosure, a reference to a membrane containing a specific material refers to the material used in the selective layer. The support structure can be made of any material.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0061">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;membrane module&#x201d; refers to a manifold assembly containing a membrane or membranes to separate the streams of feed, permeate, and retentate. The membrane module can be any type of membrane module, including hollow fiber membrane modules, plate-and-frame membrane modules, capillary fiber membrane modules, spiral wound membrane modules, or potted hollow-fiber modules. Membranes can be arranged in the membrane module in a variety of configurations. Membranes can be in a flat-sheet configuration, a plate and frame configuration, or can be arranged to increase packing density, for example in a hollow-fiber or a capillary configuration or a spirally-wound configuration.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0062">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; refers to a nonpermeating gas stream that passes continuously by the downstream membrane face such that the permeate does not sit statically against the permeate side of the membrane, but is collected by the gas stream. The sweep can provide a driving force for the separation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0063">As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;air&#x201d; refers to the collective gases that constitute earth's atmosphere. Air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other components. Unless otherwise indicated, the use of the term air includes all of the gases listed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0064">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;stage&#x201d; refers to a membrane process configuration where an additional membrane is positioned on the permeate discharge of a first membrane. Generally, additional compression is needed between the first membrane and the additional membrane because the permeate discharge is at a lower pressure than what is required to provide a driving force for separation. A multi-stage configuration can also have multiple recycles between membranes.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0065">As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;step&#x201d; refers to a membrane process configuration where an additional membrane is positioned on the retentate discharge of a first membrane. Generally, no additional compression is needed between the first membrane and the additional membrane, because the retentate discharge stream is at almost the same feed pressure. A multi-step configuration can also have multiple recycles between membranes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0066">The description may use the phrases &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; or &#x201c;in embodiments,&#x201d; which can each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; and the like, as used with respect to embodiments of the present disclosure, are synonymous.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0067">For the purposes of describing and defining the present disclosure, a composition that &#x201c;substantially contains&#x201d; a particular compound includes at least 51% by weight of that particular compound.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0068">As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is utilized to represent the inherent degree of uncertainty that may be attributed to any quantitative comparison, value, measurement, or other representation. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is also utilized in this disclosure to represent the degree by which a quantitative representation can vary from a stated reference without resulting in a change in the basic function of the subject matter at issue.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0069">Embodiments of methods and systems to increase sulfur recovery and separate SO<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2 </sub>from the tail gas and SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions streams from industrial processes, including the Claus sulfur recovery systems, are provided herein. The methods and systems use CO<sub>2 </sub>and SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membranes which selectively permeate CO<sub>2 </sub>and SO<sub>2 </sub>respectively over other components. An emissions stream containing SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions is sent to a membrane separation unit which includes an membrane selective for SO<sub>2 </sub>over other compounds, including CO<sub>2</sub>. The SO<sub>2 </sub>enriched permeate or SO<sub>2 </sub>depleted retentate can then be sent to additional membrane units that can contain membranes selective for SO<sub>2 </sub>to further concentrate or remove the SO<sub>2</sub>, or can be treated in a membrane selective for CO<sub>2 </sub>over other compounds, including SO<sub>2</sub>. The treatment in the membrane units results in a concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>stream that can be recycled with a 3 to 5 fold enrichment in SO<sub>2</sub>, and a CO<sub>2 </sub>enriched stream that includes a low concentration of SO<sub>2</sub>, such as less than 150 ppm.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0070">The concentrated SO<sub>2 </sub>stream has a lower concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>than the emissions stream, so that when the concentration SO<sub>2 </sub>stream is recycled to the sulfur removal unit, the reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>content assists in maintaining a proper temperature profile in the sulfur removal unit and results in requiring less fuel in the sulfur removal unit. Increased CO<sub>2 </sub>content requires additional fuel use in the reactors and heaters in the sulfur removal unit since CO<sub>2 </sub>has no heating value and does not contribute to the reactions. Due to the reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>content, the operability of the sulfur removal unit is improved. Therefore, reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the SO<sub>2 </sub>concentrated streams recycled to the sulfur recovery units results in significant advantages.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0071">If the SO<sub>2 </sub>rich permeate from the SO<sub>2 </sub>over CO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane has more than 50% CO<sub>2</sub>, then additional CO<sub>2 </sub>removal and SO<sub>2 </sub>purification to further reduce the amount of gas and the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>recycled to the sulfur removal units. Thus, the SO<sub>2 </sub>concentrated streams can have 5% to 20% more SO<sub>2 </sub>than the original tail gas and SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions stream treated with the membrane units. Additionally, the SO<sub>2 </sub>enriched stream recycled to the sulfur recovery unit is less than the 10% of the original stream volume, and can be less than 5% of the original stream volume, so that the SO<sub>2 </sub>enriched stream can be recycled to multiple points within the sulfur removal unit without affecting or disrupting plant operations. If the SO<sub>2 </sub>rich permeate from the SO<sub>2 </sub>over CO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane has less than 25% CO<sub>2</sub>, then SO<sub>2 </sub>purification can be used to further concentrate the gas stream.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0072">Advantages to the methods and systems include those stated above, as well as additional advantages in increased sulfur recovery, reduced emissions, increased cost-effectiveness, and ability to retrofit existing systems. The addition of an air sweep improves efficiency of the membranes. Additionally, when an air sweep is utilized along with the SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane, the SO<sub>2 </sub>enriched recycle stream has oxygen that can replace some or all of the air introduced to the sulfur removal units. When the permeate from the SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane is further treated with CO<sub>2 </sub>selective membranes, the SO<sub>2 </sub>enriched stream recycled to the sulfur removal units is also oxygen enriched.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0073">The SO<sub>2 </sub>over CO<sub>2 </sub>selective membrane, referred to as an SO2 selective membrane herein, can be a rubbery polar membrane. The SO2 selective membrane can be a composite membrane containing one or polymers. The SO2 selective membranes can have a selectivity of 3 and above. In some embodiments, the SO2 selective membrane is performed in a relatively low pressure process, such as membrane processes at 1 bar of pressure or less where the mass transfer is driven by concentration differentials or sweep gases, and not by pressure differential. In these embodiments, the membranes are housed in plate-and-frame membrane modules, or in capillary fiber membrane modules. In some embodiments, portions of the SO<sub>2 </sub>concentration utilizing the SO2 selective membranes are performed in a higher pressure process, such as 10 to 15 bar, and therefore the SO<sub>2 </sub>selective membranes are house in spiral wound membrane modules.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0074">The SO2 selective membrane can be made from PEBAX&#x2122; (a registered trademark of Arkema) 4011. The permeation properties of a membrane containing PEBAX&#x2122; 4011 is included in Table 1, below.
