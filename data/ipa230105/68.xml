It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. At least one embodiment of the present invention will be described and shown, and this application may show and/or describe other embodiments of the present invention, and further permits the reasonable and logical inference of still other embodiments as would be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is understood that any reference to &#x201c;the invention&#x201d; is a reference to an embodiment of a family of inventions, with no single embodiment including an apparatus, process, or composition that should be included in all embodiments, unless otherwise stated. Further, although there may be discussion with regards to &#x201c;advantages&#x201d; provided by some embodiments of the present invention, it is understood that yet other embodiments may not include those same advantages, or may include yet different advantages. Any advantages described herein are not to be construed as limiting to any of the claims. The usage of words indicating preference, such as &#x201c;various embodiments&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferably,&#x201d; refers to features and aspects that are present in at least one embodiment, but which are optional for some embodiments, it therefore being understood that use of the word &#x201c;preferably&#x201d; implies the term &#x201c;optional.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the description and the drawings. Additionally, the use of an N-series prefix for an element number (NXX.XX) refers to an element that is the same as the non-prefixed element (XX.XX), except as shown and described. As an example, an element <b>1020</b>.<b>1</b> would be the same as element <b>20</b>.<b>1</b>, except for those different features of element <b>1020</b>.<b>1</b> shown and described. Further, common elements and common features of related elements may be drawn in the same manner in different figures, and/or use the same symbology in different figures. As such, it is not necessary to describe the features of <b>1020</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>.<b>1</b> that are the same, since these common features are apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the related field of technology. Further, it is understood that some features <b>1020</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>.<b>1</b> may be backward compatible, such that a feature of a later discussed embodiment (NXX.XX) may include features compatible with other various embodiments that were discussed earlier (MXX.XX), as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. This description convention also applies to the use of prime (&#x2032;), double prime (&#x2033;), triple prime (&#x2032;&#x2033;) and star or asterisk (*) suffixed element numbers. Therefore, it is not necessary to describe the features of 20.1, 20.1&#x2032;, 20.1&#x2033;, 20.1&#x2032;&#x2033; and 20* that are the same, since these common features are apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the related field of technology.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">What follows are paragraphs that express particular embodiments of the present invention.

The user then reinstalls each retention pin <b>770</b> back into/through the respective apertures <b>760</b> and aperture <b>750</b>. Next, the user pivots each of the support arm <b>170</b>, support arm <b>190</b>, and support arm <b>210</b> relative to each one of the respective side rails <b>144</b> to fold out or extend each of the support arm <b>170</b>, support arm <b>190</b>, and support arm <b>210</b>. Next, the user leans the support arms (<b>170</b>, <b>190</b>, <b>210</b>) against a trunk of the tree (such that the bottom ladder section <b>110</b> is substantially somewhat spaced apart from the tree trunk, the lower middle ladder section <b>120</b> is substantially somewhat less spaced apart from the trunk, and the upper middle ladder section <b>130</b> is substantially somewhat even less spaced apart from the trunk) and the user leans the support posts <b>234</b> (of the top ladder section <b>140</b>) against the tree trunk and/or suitably presses or otherwise forces the support posts <b>234</b> into the tree trunk. The user then pivots the platform carriage <b>280</b> relative to the top ladder section <b>140</b> to swing the platform carriage around into desirably close proximity to the tree trunk. Next, the user pivots the platform <b>270</b> relative to the platform carriage <b>280</b> to unfold or extend the platform <b>270</b>. Then the user multi-pivotally adjusts&#x2014;via the pivotal couplings provided by the platform carriage pivot arms (<b>350</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>460</b>) and then corresponding joints (<b>370</b>, <b>380</b>, <b>390</b>, <b>470</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>490</b>)&#x2014;the leveling (or conversely, the skewing) of the platform carriage <b>280</b> (and, in turn, the leveling or skewing of the platform <b>270</b>) as desired.

It should be noted that in some embodiments, the pivot joints (<b>370</b>, <b>380</b>, <b>390</b>, <b>470</b>, <b>480</b>, <b>490</b>) are constructed to be have sufficient friction to suitably inhibit inadvertent shifting of the platform carriage <b>280</b> relative to the top ladder section <b>140</b> (yet without so much friction so as to preclude suitably facile multi-pivotal adjustments). With some embodiments, the user may use tools to loosen or tighten one or more of such joints as desired. Also, during or after the manipulation of the platform carriage <b>280</b> the user may secure the top ladder section <b>140</b> and/or the platform carriage <b>280</b> to the tree trunk with the chain(s), rope(s), or other strap(s).
