Each tooth of the traditional bearingless switched reluctance motor is provided with two windings. The magnetic fields generated by the two windings together act to generate the suspension force and torque, which leads to strong coupling between a suspension magnetic field and a torque magnetic field, and complex control. Moreover, there is no permanent magnet on the traditional bearingless switched reluctance motor, which cannot be designed to be sheet-shaped. Therefore, the application thereof in the fields of liquid transfer such as sealing pumps is also limited. Chinese invention patent (CN102306995A) relates to a permanent magnet biased bearingless switched reluctance motor, in which 12 stator poles and 14 rotor poles are arranged. A stator is provided with four suspension poles and eight torque poles, and the number of rotor teeth is 14, which realizes the natural decoupling between torque and a suspension force. However, the magnetic suspension switched reluctance motor of this structure requires two switching power amplifiers to realize the two-degree-of-freedom stable suspension of the rotor. Moreover, the number of radial circumferential poles is large and the pole area is small, resulting in small suspension force. It is difficult to reflect the excellent performance of the magnetic suspension switched reluctance motor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Purpose of invention: in order to solve the problem in the prior art, the present invention provides a three-suspension pole magnetic suspension sheet switched reluctance motor, in which a stator and a rotor of the motor are designed to be sheet-shaped, and the passive axial suspension is realized using a magnetic resistance.
