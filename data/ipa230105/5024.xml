The advertising platform <b>214</b> may provide an ecosystem or network or cloud in which entities associated with an impression trading industry may collaborate and share industry-specific information without latency, bandwidth, and security issues that may be associated with the public Internet. The impression trading industry may connect for purposes of sharing information and commerce disparate parties such as users, a bidding provider, members, publishers and others. Such industry-specific information shared within the advertising platform may include information associated with one or more users, one or more bidding providers, one or more members, one or more publisher pages, prices, advertising creatives, or any suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The advertising platform <b>214</b> includes servers <b>204</b> of the data center <b>102</b> that have been provisioned and deployed by data center tenants using application programming interface (APIs) specific to the advertising platform <b>214</b>. In general, each server <b>204</b> that is provisioned and deployed by a tenant is reserved for the exclusive use of that tenant. Doing so provides some measure of predictability with respect to available resources. Reservation of resources for exclusive use of a tenant provides security and privacy with respect to the tenant's data.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various tenants of the data center <b>202</b> may assume different roles in the context of the impression trading industry. Tenants of the data center <b>202</b> may include advertising platform providers, impression selling members, impression buyer member, and bidders. Other tenants may be hosted as well.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An advertising platform provider is an entity which provisions and deploys one or more servers <b>204</b> of the data center <b>202</b> to function as a transaction management computing subsystem. A transaction management subsystem may also be referred to as a platform impression bus or simply Imp Bus. The Imp Bus facilitates the transaction aspects of impression inventory trading. In general, the Imp Bus processes ad requests, feeds data to members, conducts auctions, returns ads to the publishers, keeps track of billing and usage, returns auction-result data, and enforces quality standards.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An impression seller member is an entity that sells impression inventory. An impression seller member may be, for example, a publisher of a web site or a video game or other online resource. An impression seller member may provision and deploy one or more servers <b>204</b> of the data center <b>202</b> to function as a web delivery engine that accepts HTTP requests from web browsers operable by impression consumers. Such a web delivery engine may implement a variety of functions or features, such as authentication and authorization request, handling of static and dynamic content, content compression support, virtual hosting, large file support, and bandwidth throttling or management. Equipment of the impression seller member may provide other functions, as well.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An impression buyer member may be an entity that buys impression inventory. An impression buyer member may provision and deploy one or more servers <b>204</b> of the data center <b>202</b> to operate to serve advertising creatives or simply creatives. Creatives are data which define an advertisement adapted to fill an impression on a web page, in a video stream or in another location. In some instances, creatives are stored on a storage unit <b>206</b> within the data center <b>202</b>, and the servers <b>204</b> of the impression buyer member will serve such creatives directly from the storage units <b>206</b> of the data center <b>202</b>. In some instance, creatives are stored on an ad server or a content delivery network located on a server located remotely, outside of the data center <b>202</b>. In such instance, the servers <b>204</b> of the impression buyer will facilitate the serving of creatives from the remote server. The entity may be an advertiser, an advertising network, an advertising agency, an advertising exchange, or a publisher.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To buy impression inventory, each impression buyer member engages a decisioning computing subsystem to operate on its behalf. Such a decisioning computing system may be referred to as a bidder. The term bidder generally refers to a computing system or other technological items rather than a person or entity that operates it. In a typical embodiment, a bidder includes a bidding engine that takes various pieces of bid-specific information as input and generates a bid for a particular item of impression inventory on behalf of an impression buyer member.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The advertising platform provides impression buyer members with a number of different bidder options. These include, for example, using a member-specific bidder. According to this option, the advertising platform provider provides a source code skeleton and allows an impression buyer partner to customize with priority information. In this case, the entity that buys impression inventory will further deploy a server <b>204</b> of the data center <b>202</b> to host a member-specific bidder for its exclusive use.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another option, a hosted bidder is designed, built, hosted, and maintained by the advertising platform provider and allows each impression buyer member to simply upload bid guides or modify basic parameters, such as user data, recency, location, etc. In some instances, multiple impression buyer members use the hosted bidder.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another option a bidding provider is an entity that provisions and deploys a server <b>204</b> of the data center <b>202</b> to operate a bidder on behalf of one or more impression buyer members with which it is contractually engaged. The bidder operable by the bidding provider generally includes a proprietary optimization bidding engine.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, tenants of the data center <b>202</b> may further assume additional or different roles than that described above. In some embodiments, the data center <b>202</b> and the advertising platform <b>214</b> may include other participants and tenants, in addition to those described above.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The advertising platform <b>214</b> also includes a cluster of high-performance storage units <b>206</b> of the data center <b>202</b>. Data stored by a tenant on a storage unit <b>206</b> of the data center <b>202</b> may be accessed exclusively by that tenant or shared with other tenants within the data center if so configured. The types of data that may be stored include advertising tags or ad tags, reserve price information, advertising creatives, reserve creative information, cookie information, and market analysis information. Other information that may facilitate the trading of impression inventory within the advertising platform <b>214</b> may also be stored on storage units <b>206</b> of the data center <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The interactive nature of the Internet provides a number of advertising solutions that take advantage of the two-way communication and direct connections established between browser and content server for every user. Web pages, web-enabled video games, web-based broadcasts of multimedia programming, and web-enabled photo frames are just a few examples of the types of multimedia streams in which electronic advertisements may be injected. Traditionally, creatives, including still images and video advertisements, appear in ad spaces that are located within a web page, a video stream or other location. More recently, web-enabled video games have been coded to enable a creative to be dynamically loaded within an ad space of a game frame, such as in an image of a billboard on the side of a highway of a car racing game, or in signage appearing to be affixed to a roof of a taxi cab in a role playing game. Similarly, web-based broadcasts of multimedia programming, such as a live broadcast or on-demand replay of a sporting event, may be coded to enable a creative to be dynamically loaded within an ad space of a broadcast frame. Examples include an ad space behind home plate during the broadcast of the sporting event. A creative may be inserted within an ad space between broadcast frames, such as an ad space that coincides with a live commercial break. Web-enabled photo frames are generally configured to receive digital photos from photo sharing sites, RSS feeds, and social networking sites or other sources through wired or wireless communication links. Other electronic content, such as news, weather, sports, and financial data may also be displayed on the web-enabled photo frame.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the multimedia stream types described above provides a host of creative serving opportunities. To facilitate the transaction of impression inventory on the advertising platform <b>214</b>, an impression seller member such as a publisher of a web site or a video game may associate each creative serving opportunity with an ad tag. In general, an ad tag includes data or a data file that specifies information indicative of attributes of an ad space with which the ad tag is associated. In the case of an ad space within a web page, the ad tag may specify, for example, the language of the text displayed on the page; the nature of the content being displayed on the page, such as business, politics, entertainment, sports, and technology; the geographical focus, such as international, national, and local, of the web page content; the physical dimensions of the ad space; and the region of the page the ad space is located. In the case of an ad space within a web-enabled video game, the ad tag may specify the video game category, such as role playing, racing, sports, puzzle, and fighting; the age appropriateness of the video game, such as via an Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating symbol, including for example, early childhood, everyone, everyone age 10 and over, mature, teen, and adults only; and the nature of the content being displayed within the game frame, such as via an Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) content descriptor, such as alcohol reference, animated blood, crude humor, intense violence, language, mature humor, nudity, tobacco reference, and drug reference. In the case of an ad space within a web-based broadcast of multimedia programming, the ad tag may specify the language of the audio associated with the programming; the nature of the content associated with the programming, such as business, politics, entertainment, sports, and technology; the geographical focus of the programming; and the time of day the programming is being broadcast live or the time period in which the programming is available on demand. For example, ad providers might have a registration system on their supply and, therefore, they have deterministic access to their user's demographic information. Then, they could pass some or all user demographic information voluntary or by an agreement to the bidder to increase the value of their impressions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations of the advertising platform <b>214</b>, a platform-specific ad tag may be generated and associated with one or more ad spaces. In addition to the types of information described above, other types of information, such as a universal inventory identifier, a reserve price, and a list of approved universal advertiser identifiers, may also be associated with a platform-specific ad tag. The information associated with any given platform-specific ad tag may be specified server-side, such as tag_id=123&#x26;ad_profile_id=456, or maintained within the platform by a server-side mapping, such as when the Imp Bus maintains a server-side mapping of tag_id=123 to ad_profile_id=456. In the latter case, once an ad space has been tagged, information associated with the platform-specific ad tag may be easily modified by adding or otherwise changing the information within the platform without having to re-tag the ad space.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each universal inventory identifier uniquely identifies a multimedia stream within the platform. As an example, a multimedia stream identified as large, such as the news website CNN.com may be divided into multiple multimedia streamlets such as CNN.com/entertainment, CNN.com/health, CNN.com/technology, and CNN.com/travel. In this example, each multimedia streamlet is assigned a universal inventory identifier within the platform. By contrast, a multimedia stream designated as small, such as the news website BostonHerald.com) may be assigned only one universal inventory identifier. The inclusion of a universal inventory identifier within a platform-specific ad tag enables bidders to refer to impression inventory associated with a particular multimedia stream in a common way. The size of the impression inventory associated with a multimedia stream is not the only factor in determining whether a multimedia stream is assigned one universal inventory identifier or multiple universal inventory identifiers. Other factors, such as the multimedia stream brand, may also be used. For example, a single universal inventory identifier may be assigned to a multimedia stream designated as large, such as web pages with a myspace.com domain name, based on its brand identity.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some cases, a multimedia stream or some aspect of it includes impression inventory that is designated within the platform as direct inventory. In general, direct inventory refers to impression inventory that is part of a pre-existing media buy. Such a media buy is typically established by way of a contractual agreement between an impression seller member and an impression buyer member. The contractual agreement specifies the specific impression inventory that is subject to an exclusive first right of refusal on the part of the impression buyer member, and the reserve price that bidders other than the bidder operating on behalf of the impression buyer member must meet in order to take the impression inventory away. This process will be described in more detail below with respect to the exemplary use cases in the following section.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some cases, a multimedia stream or some aspect of it includes impression inventory that may only be acquired by certain impression buyer members, or more specifically, impression buyer members that serve a specific brand of ad creatives. In such cases, a bidder performs an offline process that synchronizes creatives and/or brands that are approved or banned to run on the impression inventory with a specific ad profile ID that is subsequently passed along on the bid request.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ad creatives for various campaigns may be stored in storage units <b>206</b> of the data center <b>202</b> that function as an ad server for an impression buyer partner or hosted on ad servers and content delivery networks outside of the platform.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations of the advertising platform <b>214</b>, an impression buyer partner may be required to provide information that characterizes each ad creative that may be served responsive to ad calls from the platform and store such information within the platform. Such information may include attribute information that characterizes the type, dimensions, and content of the ad creative, and information that identifies a location where the ad creative can be retrieve, such as a redirect to a content delivery network. In other implementations of the advertising platform <b>214</b>, it is merely recommended that such information be stored within the platform and therefore accessible by the bidder acting on behalf of the impression buyer partner with minimal latency during the real-time bidding process. In still other implementations of the advertising platform <b>214</b>, the advertising platform provider itself looks at the creatives and supplies any of these attributes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the creatives that are served in response to ad calls from the advertising platform <b>214</b> conform to requirements, such as legality, decency, and common sense. For instance, creatives that promote gambling; depict libelous, violent, tasteless, hate, derogatory, or illegal content; portray partial or complete nudity, pornography, and/or adult themes or obscene content; are deceptive or purposely mislabeled; or spawn pops, simulate clicks, or contain malicious code, viruses, or executable files are generally not permitted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some publishers may prefer the creatives that are served to their inventory to comply with even more restrictive standards. For instance, such standards may be in place in order to maintain the reputation of the publisher's brand or to avoid promoting a rival. To simplify and speed the creative approval process for publishers, a list of preapproved creatives may be generated and maintained by a creative auditing computing subsystem on the advertising platform. When creating ad profiles, impression seller members can search for and/or elect to automatically approve creatives on this list, thus effectively outsourcing initial creative approval to a platform-based audit. For instance, the platform-based audit may review creatives for features such as having a meaningful and easily discernable brand or product offering; rotating images but not rotating brands or products; and having a brand on a platform-based list of approved brands. Additionally, the platform-based audit may prohibit creatives offering sweepstakes, giveaways, quizzes, surveys, or other brand-less games. If a brand is not discernable in a creative, it will not be approved and will run only on a member's exclusive inventory. Creatives that are modified after they have been audited will return to a pending status until they can be audited again. In some instances, advertisers may be charged a nominal fee in order to have their creatives audited.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Impression seller members such as publishers may also review and approve creatives on a case-by-case basis by creating an ad profile. A default ad profile may be created for a publisher. If no default ad profile is created for a publisher, all creatives may be allowed to run on the publisher's domain. In some embodiments, an ad profile includes three elements: members, brands, and creatives. Member- and brand-level approval standards can be used to reduce the number of creatives that need to be explicitly approved. For instance, when setting up the ad profile, a publisher may choose a designation such as trusted for members and brands that the publisher believes will always present acceptable ads. If a member or brand is marked or otherwise designated as trusted, all creatives of that member or brand may run by default, mitigating the need to audit each of that member's/brand's creatives. However, in some embodiments, the publisher or other seller member can override this default by reviewing the creatives and banning or otherwise designating individually any creatives of the trusted brand. The publisher may mark other members or brands as with a designation such as case-by-case, meaning that none of the creatives of that member or brand will run until explicitly approved by the publisher. The publisher may also designate or mark members or brands as banned, in which case none of the creatives of the banned member or brand will be shown. If a member or brand is banned, there is no ability to override the ban and approve a specific creative without knowing and searching for an individual creative identifier. In some instances, a separate ad profile may be created for each advertising campaign.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ad profiles may be stored by the transaction management computing subsystem in an impression seller data store associated with the corresponding impression seller member. Ad profiles may further be updated or replaced in storage upon receipt of a new or updated profile.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For more granular control over quality standards, the publisher or other seller member may also be designated as approved or banned or otherwise at the level of individual creatives. To review specific creatives, the publisher can search for creatives using specific criteria. A preview of the creative will appear and the publisher selects whether to approve or ban the creative.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Similarly, in some embodiments, publishers or other seller members may be required to conform to stated standards of legality, decency, and common sense. For instance, publishers that embody any of the following characteristics may not be permitted to participate in the advertising platform: desktop applications, download accelerators, non-website based widgets and/or toolbars; gambling, including free, paid, or gateway to paid gambling; libelous, violent, tasteless, hate, defamatory, or illegal content; or nudity, pornography, and/or adult themes or obscene content; peer to peer, bit torrent, or other websites facilitating illegal file sharing; proxy sites facilitating anonymous web browsing; sites enabling or permitting illegal activities and/or copyright infringement; or Warez or mp3 downloads.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Inventory of impressions may be grouped into predefined lists such that bidder clients can make decisions about a large amount of inventory simply by knowing the group to which the inventory belongs. The site that each impression that passes through the Imp Bus belongs to is on a single class list. The list to which a particular site and its corresponding impression belongs is communicated along with the ad call to each bidder participating in an auction. Individual bidders are then free to make their own decisions about whether to bid on that impression.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Impressions may be grouped or categorized in any convenient manner. In one example, inventory may be designated or categorized as Class 1, Class 2, unaudited or Blacklist. In this example, Class 1 inventory has been audited by a platform-based auditor and represents many of the most popular publisher brands on the Internet. Each of the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) on the Class 1 list has a minimum monthly volume, such as 100,000 impressions per month, and is certified to pass global inventory content standards. The Class 1 list is intended to be completely safe for any brand advertiser to purchase. Class 1 inventory does not contain sites that feature user-generated content or social media. Bidders accept Class 1 inventory by default.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Class 2 inventory in this example includes inventory that has been audited but does not meet the Class 1 volume or content criteria, but does meet the global inventory content standards. Social networking content may be included in Class 2 inventory. For instance, myspace.com, although a top publisher that by volume satisfies the Class 1 criteria, in this example is placed on the Class 2 list because it is designated as a social media web site. Bidders accept Class 2 inventory by default. If a bidder has chosen not to accept Class 2 inventory but also owns a Class 2 publisher, the bidder will receive its own Class 2 traffic.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">All other inventory that passes through the Imp Bus is assigned the unaudited inventory label in this example. Sites remain categorized as unaudited until audited and assigned to another categorization. To ensure maximum advertiser brand protection, bidders by default do not accept unaudited inventory. However, a flag or other indicator can be set to enable acceptance of unaudited inventory if desired. In another example, if a bidder does not accept unaudited inventory but owns an unaudited publisher, the bidder will receive its own unaudited traffic.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further in this example, inventory designated or contained in the Blacklist violates inventory content standards and has been prohibited. For example, prohibition may mean that impressions on the Blacklist will never reach the auction marketplace.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some implementations of the advertising platform, a multi-tenant user data store is provisioned within the advertising platform <b>214</b> by a first user data store management component to enable members of the impression trading industry. The multi-data tenant store may also be referred to as a server-side user data store. The multi-data tenant store operates to synchronize user data information with a common set of platform-specific user identifiers, or user IDs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, each platform-specific user ID of the server-side user data store is stored in association with data. Some of the stored may be specific to a particular impression consumer, such as data characterizing the impression consumer. In general, data that is stored in association with a platform-specific user ID may be supplemented and over the course of time as the impression consumer interacts with web pages and web delivery engines within the advertising platform <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, all data stored in association with a platform-specific user ID may be shared between all tenants of the data center(s). In other implementations, mechanisms may be put in place to limit access to the data stored in association with a platform-specific user ID based on certain criteria. For example, certain impression trading industry members may have contractual agreements that specify exclusive sharing of data stored in association with a particular set or sets of platform-specific user IDs regardless of which web delivery engine a content request is directed to. In another example, an impression trading industry member may specify that all data stored in association with a particular set or sets of platform-specific user-ids may be shared with respect to a particular set of web delivery engines, some of which may be associated with other impression trading industry members.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one specific implementation, user data information stored in association with a platform-specific user ID is formed by multiple segments of key-value pairs, where one or more key-value pairs may define each segment. Access permissions may be associated with one, some, or all of the segments to control which members access the user data information of respective segments. Accessing user data information may include reading, writing such data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">One issue that may arise following the serving of ads to a single impression consumer by impression seller partners located in geographically dispersed data centers is &#x201c;synching collision.&#x201d; Synching collision occurs when multiple impression seller members attempt to simultaneously sync their user data information with a particular segment of key-value pairs that defines the user data information stored in association with a particular impression consumer's platform-specific user-id. This is best described with an example.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the example, a user identified by user ID 12345 has two browser windows open, one pointing to a landing page of SiteAAA.com, which is hosted on a web server (&#x201c;SiteAAA web server&#x201d;) located in New York City, N.Y., and the other pointing to a landing page of SiteBBB.com, which is hosted on a web server (&#x201c;SiteBBB web server&#x201d;) located in San Jose, Calif. Each web server makes an ad call to the platform when the user 12345 navigates to respective pages of SiteAAA.com and SiteBBB.com, each of which includes at least one creative serving opportunity. This has the effect of causing the advertising platform to receive two impression requests for user 12345, one from the SiteAAA web server, which gets routed to the platform's New York City data center, and the other from the SiteBBB web server, which gets routed to the platform's Los Angeles, Calif. data center. Each of the platform's data centers includes a server-side user data store that has in it a variable global-frequency associated with user-id=12345.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Suppose, at time t=0, the global-frequency key-value pair of a user's impression frequency counter for user-id=12345 is &#x201c;25&#x201d;. Traditionally with cookies, the global frequency is set to a fixed value. Synching collision occurs when two impression requests are received nearly simultaneously and a &#x201c;set global-frequency to 26&#x201d; notification is sent responsive to both impression requests. In other words, only one of the impression requests is logged in the user data store even though two are received. To avoid this situation, the advertising platform is implemented to send an &#x201c;increment global frequency by 1&#x201d; notification responsive each of the impression requests. Returning to the example above, the New York City data center will increment the global-frequency key-value pair for user-id=12345 to &#x201c;26&#x201d; to account for the ad call received from SiteAAA.com and transmit a message to the Los Angeles data center to apply the same logic; the Los Angeles data center will increment the global-frequency key-value pair for user-id=12345 to &#x201c;27&#x201d; to account for the ad call received from SiteBBB.com and transmit a message to the New York City data center to apply the same logic. In this manner, even though the messages are processed in different order on each site the final result is the same. That is, the global-frequency key-value pair for user-id=12345 goes from &#x201c;25&#x201d; to &#x201c;27&#x201d;. User data store information is replicated consistently across multiple data centers.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, a portion of data storage of the data center <b>202</b> is designated as cookie space. Each bidder may be assigned a section of cookie space, known as a client-side user data store, in each user's browser. A bidder may freely push and pull data into or out of its own client-side user data store on each impression or pixel call. The data pushed into a particular bidder's client-side user data store is passed into requests for that bidder only, unless data contracts exist to allow the sharing of data with other bidders. However, when data is stored client-side by an advertiser outside of the user data store associated with the advertising platform provider, that data is inaccessible during an ad call, because the advertising platform domain, rather than the advertiser domain, is accessing the data forming the cookie. For this reason, data stored by the bidder is preferably stored synchronously in the client-side user data store by piggybacking a pixel call from the advertising platform.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, user data is passed to the client-side user data store using a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) mechanism. The advertising platform provider will execute a JavaScript function stored in each bidder's server-side context store and store the results in that bidder's section of the user's client-side user data store. Strings, integers, vectors, hash tables, and combinations of these may be stored and manipulated server side using a fully featured programming language such as JavaScript 1.8.1.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">More particularly, a bidder's user data may be stored in the user's cookie as a JSON object. During a bid request, the JSON object is forwarded to the bidder. If no JSON object exists, an empty object &#x201c;0&#x201d; may be returned. The JSON object is parsed for reading using libraries provided by the advertising platform provider. Instead of creating a new JSON object to send back to the client-side user data store, a bidder includes in the bid response a call to a predefined JavaScript function stored in association with that bidder. The JavaScript function, which operates on a global variable containing the user data, is executed by the Imp Bus, and the results are stored in the client-side user data store. In some embodiments, the advertising platform provider may provide functions for use or customization.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For instance, a bidder may wish to track the number of times a creative has been shown to a particular user or the most recent time an ad was shown to that user. In response to receipt of a notification that a creative has been served, a predefined function provided by the advertising platform provider may enable frequency and recency variables associated with that user to be incremented.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, each data provider or bidder has its own scheme for internally identifying users. In order to enable integration between the bidder and the Imp Bus, the bidder-specific user ID for each user is mapped to the platform-specific user ID for the same user.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In general, the platform-specific user ID is stored in a client-side user data store, such as in a client-side browser cookie. The mapping between bidder user ID and platform-specific user ID may exist in the bidder's data store, the server-side cookie store of the advertising platform, or both. In some instances, the bidder's user IDs are stored within the bidder's reserved section of the client-side user data store. In this case, the bidder's user ID is included in each request the bidder receives from the Imp Bus, such as bid requests and pixel requests. In other instances, the mapping information is stored within the bidder's data store. In this case, when impression or pixel requests are received by the bidder related to a platform-specific user-id, the bidder looks up the mapping information in its own data stores.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of an advertising platform <b>214</b> that may be implemented, for example in a data center <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the advertising platform <b>214</b> can facilitate in whole or in part an online content delivery system which conducts an auction among bids to serve an advertisement to a web page to fill an impression. In some embodiments, the advertising platform <b>214</b> can implement a ratio pacing system to detect and compensate for unintentional bias or skew introduced in serving of content items.

The ad call is provided from the server to the Imp Bus <b>240</b>, step <b>258</b>. The ad call is processed at the Imp Bus <b>240</b>, for example by examining the contents of the ad call. If a platform-specific user identifier, such as User ID 1234, is found within a browser header of the ad call, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> determines the page request as originating from a known impression consumer. In response, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> retrieves at step <b>260</b> and step <b>262</b>, from a server-side cookie store <b>246</b> within the advertising platform <b>214</b>, data that has been stored in association with the platform-specific user-id.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0106">Assume for this use case that none of the creative serving opportunities on the requested page is restricted.

Further assume for this use case that data retrieved from the server-side cookie store <b>246</b> may be shared between impression trading industry members without constraints.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0107">The Imp Bus <b>240</b>, or transaction management computing subsystem, generates a bid request that provides a multi-faceted characterization of each creative-serving opportunity of the requested page. In some embodiments, there is a one-to-one correspondence between creative-serving opportunities and bid requests. That is, a bid request is generated for each ad tag associated with the requested page. In some embodiments, the multiple ad tags associated with the requested page are handled in a single bid request.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0108">In general, a bid request includes information that characterizes the impression consumer. For example, the information included a bid request may be based on data retrieved from the server-side cookie store <b>246</b>. Further, the information included in a bid request may include information that characterizes the ad space. For example, the information included in the bid request may be based on information associated with the platform-specific ad tag itself, such as data uniquely identifying the impression seller member, an impression inventory identifier, an impression inventory categorization identifier, or a universal impression inventory identifier; or data characterizing the impression, the impression seller member, the impression inventory source, or an impression inventory category. Still further, the information included in a bid request may include information forming an auction identifier. Because in this use case there are no constraints placed on the sharing of data between impression trading industry members, one bid request, labelled Bid request Common <b>264</b>, in the drawing, may be generated and sent to all bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0109">The Imp Bus <b>240</b> sends, at step <b>262</b> the bid request to each bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> within the advertising platform <b>214</b>. The information included in the bid request is used, at least in part, by a bidding engine of each bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> or a decisioning processor of a decisioning subsystem to generate a real-time bid response on behalf of an impression buyer member <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> with which the bidder <b>248</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>252</b> is associated.

At a minimum, the bid response identifies a bid price, determined, for instance, using optimization techniques; and a creative that is to be served should the bid be identified as the winning bid of a platform-based auction. A bidder (e.g., Bidder A <b>248</b>) may be associated with multiple impression buyer members (e.g., Impression Buyer Member M <b>228</b> and Impression Buyer Member N <b>230</b>). In such instances, the respective bidding engines implemented by the respective bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> may be operable to conduct an internal auction using bids of the respective bid requests to identify a winning bid from among the eligible campaigns of its associated impression buyer members, and to generate a bid response for the platform-based auction based conducted by the Imp Bus <b>214</b> on the result of the internal auction.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0110">Following return of the bid responses at step <b>264</b> by the bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> or decisioning subsystems to the Imp Bus <b>214</b> or transaction management computing subsystem, the Imp Bus <b>214</b> identifies a winning bid. This is done within a predetermined response time period such as a period measured in milliseconds. In most instances, the winning bid is the bid associated with the highest dollar value, and the best price for a creative serving opportunity is the price that yields the highest revenue for the impression seller member. In some embodiments, the winning bid and the best price are based on other metrics, such as ad frequency. In some embodiments, if the winning bid response is associated with an ad creative that has not been approved by the impression seller member, the second-ranked bid response is selected as the winning bid.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0111">The Imp Bus <b>214</b> at step <b>266</b> returns information that identifies a location of a creative of the winning bid to the SiteXYZ web server <b>220</b>.

In the depicted example, the SiteXYZ web server <b>220</b> returns, step <b>268</b>, to the impression consumer's web browser <b>224</b>, content forming the page requested at step <b>256</b>. A tracking mechanism may be implemented to track presentation of the impression to the web browser <b>204</b>. For example, the content forming the requested page may be embedded with an impression tracking mechanism that causes the impression consumer's web browser <b>224</b> to first point to the Imp Bus <b>214</b>. This operates to allow the Imp Bus <b>214</b> to count the impression as served. Subsequently, the web browser <b>224</b> is redirected to cause the web browser <b>224</b> to retrieve, at step <b>270</b>, step <b>272</b>, the ad creative to be served from an ad server <b>254</b> within the advertising platform <b>214</b> or a server of a content delivery network <b>222</b>. In another example, the SiteXYZ web server <b>220</b> returns to the impression consumer's web browser <b>224</b> the requested page, a first URL that points to the ad creative to be served, and a second URL that points to the Imp Bus <b>214</b> for use by the Imp Bus in counting the impression as served.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates a second use case involving a known impression consumer in a transaction with restrictions on data sharing in an open platform-based auction.

In this use case, assume that restrictions have been placed on the sharing of data retrieved from the server-side cookie store <b>246</b> between some of the impression trading industry members. For each impression trading member, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> examines the restrictions to identify the subset of data retrieved from the server-side cookie store that may be shared with that impression trading member. For each creative serving opportunity of the requested page, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> generates an impression trading member-specific bid request. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, these are labelled Bid request A-specific and Bid request B-specific. The specific bid requests provide a multi-faceted characterization of a creative serving opportunity.

In some embodiments, each of Bidder A <b>248</b> and Bidder B <b>250</b> generates a bid response to be returned at step <b>288</b> to the Imp Bus <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0121">The Imp Bus <b>240</b> first eliminates from contention those bid responses having a bid price that fails to meet or exceed a reserve price included in the auction notification received at step <b>284</b>. If all of the returned bid responses are eliminated, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> sends at step <b>290</b> the redirect that was included in the auction notification to the SiteXYZ web server <b>202</b>. If, however, at least one of the returned bid responses meets or exceeds the reserve price included in the auction notification, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> performs an auction, identifies a winning bid, and returns at step <b>290</b> to the SiteXYZ web server <b>220</b> a redirect that identifies a location of a creative of the winning bid. Steps <b>268</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>272</b> are performed as described above to effect the delivery of an ad creative.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0122">In one example, the impression buyer member Impression Buyer Member Q <b>236</b> corresponds to an advertising agency and the creative serving opportunity on the requested page is part of the impression buyer member's pre-existing media buy for a first advertiser or advertising network that engaged the advertising agency. The advertising agency may choose to have its bidder, Bidder C <b>252</b>, conduct an internal auction to identify a winning bid among the eligible campaigns of the other advertisers and advertising networks associated with the advertising agency in those instances in which the value of the impression consumer to the first advertiser or advertising network does not exceed a predetermined threshold. Only if the winning bid resulting from the internal auction does not meet a reserve price set by the first advertiser or advertising network for that creative serving opportunity does the bidder, Bidder C <b>252</b>, return to the Imp Bus <b>240</b> an auction notification as described above.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0123">At the conclusion of a platform-based auction, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may generate a result notification for each bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> that submitted a bid response responsive to a bid request.

The result notification maybe presented or communicated in any suitable fashion, such as a message with a number of designated, formatted fields for each item of information. The information provided in the result notification may be used by a bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> or decisioning subsystem to fine tune or otherwise modify its bidding strategy to better position itself to win future platform-based auctions. Suppose, for example, that a bidder consistently loses a platform-based auction with a bid of $2.00 for a car buyer on a particular website such as nytimes.com/autos. By examining the Winning Price information provided in the result notification, the bidder may adjust a future bid price to maximize its potential to win such a platform-based auction without overpaying for the impression. Similarly, by examining the Response Time information provided in the result notification, the bidder may determine that its bid response is being received outside of the predetermined response time period set by the Imp Bus <b>240</b> and adjust its bidding algorithm to accelerate the rate at which its bid response is generated and returned to the Imp Bus <b>240</b>. Such adjustments may be made automatically after receipt and processing of the result notification, or manually by a campaign manager, or a combination of these.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0144">A bidder can also pass to the Imp Bus <b>240</b> or transaction management computing subsystem additional information such as a user ID, a user frequency, a campaign ID, or others, to be passed back to the same bidder during a result notification. This additional information can also be useful to the bidder or to the impression buyer member to manipulate bidding strategy or to understand the results of an ad campaign.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0145">From the advertising platform provider's standpoint, there are advantages to preventing impression trading industry members from obtaining detailed information about any one particular impression consumer or creative serving opportunities within the platform. For example, this minimizes the potential for an impression trading industry member to sign up to transact on the platform for a short period of time simply for the purposes of obtaining detailed information about impression consumers and quitting after a sufficient amount of detailed information has been obtained. To that end, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may be configured to filter the information that is passed between the various impression trading industry members during the course of transaction platform-based auctions.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0146">The use case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrated a scenario in which restrictions have been placed on the sharing of data retrieved from the server-side cookie store between some of the impression trading industry members. In this use case, for each impression trading member, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> examines the restrictions to identify the subset of data retrieved from the server-side cookie store <b>242</b> that may be shared with that impression trading member. The Imp Bus <b>240</b> generates an impression trading member-specific bid request that includes information that characterizes the impression consumer. The information may be based on the subset of data retrieved from the server-side cookie store that may be shared with that impression trading member, for example.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0147">In an alternative embodiment, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> or transaction management computing subsystem may also filter the information that is retrieved from the cookie store. In one embodiment, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> analyzes the entirety of the data retrieved from the server-side user data store <b>242</b> or user data store <b>246</b> and provides a somewhat abstracted version of the retrieved data in each impression trading member-specific bid request.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0148">In one example, the retrieved data includes information about the impression consumer's gender, age, zip code, income, and behavioral data. Also in this example, bidder A <b>248</b> previously pushed information into the server-side user data store <b>242</b> to identify this particular impression consumer's gender (gender=male), income (income=$138,000), and behavioral data (behavioral data=likes fishing, likes hunting) only; bidder B <b>250</b> previously pushed information into the cookie store to identify this particular impression consumer's age (age=28), zip code (zip code=02130), and behavioral data (behavioral data=buys ski gear) only; bidder C <b>252</b> has never pushed information into the cookie store with respect to this impression consumer. Other information in the user data store <b>246</b> may have been provided by a third-party data provider, an impression buyer member, and/or an impression seller member.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0149">The respective bid requests generated by the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may be tailored to the data provided by each respective bidder. For bidder A <b>248</b>, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may generate an impression trading member-specific bid request that includes gender=male, age=25-35; zip code=North East USA; income=$138,000, and behavioral data=likes fishing, likes hunting, likes winter sports. For bidder B <b>250</b>, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may generate an impression trading member-specific bid request that includes gender=male, age=28; zip code=02130; income=$100,000-$199,999, and behavioral data=likes outdoor sports, buys ski gear. For bidder C <b>252</b>, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may generate an impression trading member-specific bid request that includes gender=male, age=25-35; zip code=North East USA; income=$100,000-$199,999, and behavioral data=likes outdoor sports, likes winter sports. Each bidder is provided detailed information that it has itself pushed to the cookie store via a feedback mechanism through the platform but is only provided an abstracted version of the remaining information that is retrieved from the cookie store.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0150">In addition to providing an abstracted version of the data retrieved from the cookie store, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may also provide an abstracted characterization of the creative serving opportunity. For example, in lieu of specifying the URL of the page being requested (e.g., lodgeatvail.rockresorts.com/info/rr.gcchalet.asp) by the impression consumer's web browser, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may simply provide in the bid request an identifier of a category of the page and site, such as high-end ski resort. More generally, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may provide data characterizing an impression, an impression seller member, an impression inventory source, and/or an impression inventory category. In some embodiments, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> sends a data retrieval request to an inventory management subsystem operable to manage impression inventory information across multiple impression inventory sources. One example of a scenario in which it is advantageous to obfuscate the creative serving opportunity is as follows. A publisher has a sales force that is tasked with identifying impression buyer members with which to establish a contractual relationship that defines a media buy. An impression buyer member that is aware of the opportunity to obtain this publisher's impression inventory at a lower price through platform-based auctions may choose to bypass the publisher's sales force altogether and take its chances on the open market. This has the effect of reducing the number of media buys that are established between the publisher and the impression buyer member and/or altering the financial worth of the media buy from the publisher's perspective.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0151">In some embodiments, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> may provide data uniquely identifying the creative serving opportunity, including data uniquely identifying an impression seller member, an impression inventory identifier, an impression inventory categorization identifier, a universal impression inventory identifier, and/or a universal resource locator.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a system <b>300</b> for managing advertisement delivery for an online advertising campaign. An advertising campaign may be characterized by, for example, a campaign identifier, one or more keywords, advertising text, an advertiser identifier, a landing page identifier such as a uniform resource locator (URL), a campaign budget, campaign timing information, etc. In one particular application, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a bid shading system <b>300</b>. The system <b>300</b> has particular application for detecting variations in ad delivery from targets specified by campaign managers, advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks and others. For convenience, these will be referred to herein collectively as campaign managers.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0153">A campaign manager or other person associated with an advertising campaign may establish advertising delivery and targeting goals for a campaign being managed by an advertising platform. The targeting goals may specify features of particular interest about an audience intended to see the campaign manager's advertisements. Such targeting goals may specify demographic information, geographic information, psychographic information and behavioral information about an audience. Demographic information includes a viewer's age, gender, income, marital status, etc. Geographic information includes features such as a viewer's location or residence. Psychographic information explains a viewer's hobbies, spending habits, values, etc. Behavioral information including information about brand response, how viewers make purchasing decisions, etc. The campaign manager may use tools to set targeting goals according to these and other categories and the advertising platform will operate to automatically serve ads to viewers to best achieve the targeting goals.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0154">After a campaign is under way and the platform is operating automatically, a skew or bias in ad delivery may develop. A campaign manager's targeting goals for an ad campaign are intended to achieve predetermined business goals of the advertiser, such as increasing sales of a product or service among a market segment or increasing brand awareness among a market segment. The actual delivery of advertisements to an audience may vary from the targeting goal of the campaign manager. For example, an ad campaign targeted to viewers with an interest in men's dress pants will cause viewers to see advertisements for such products. A percentage of those viewers will respond to the advertisements by viewing the advertisements, clicking on the advertisements or taking some further action with respect to the advertisements. After a time, because of the nature of the audience targeted, the number of advertisements served may have a skew or bias in the audience that has viewed the advertisements. For example, ads for men's dress pants may be more likely to be responded to by men than women. After a period of time, the audience that has viewed such ads may have an intentional or unintentional bias towards male viewers This may be undesirable to some campaign managers, who prefer to maintain a balance in the gender of the viewing audience. This bias or skew may be invisible to the campaign managers.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0155">The advertising platform in accordance with the present disclosure operates according to the campaign manager's targeting goals to optimize a particular targeting goal, such as serving ads primarily to viewers most likely to respond to the advertisement. But while successfully optimizing for that targeting goal, a bias may be introduced. In the example above, the bias or skew that is introduced may be characterized as showing the ad to too many men, or too few women.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0156">This represents a technological problem. Many campaign managers require monitoring and control over the audience for their ads. A degree of control is provided through the advertising delivery and targeting goals for a campaign. However, those are generally set at the beginning of the campaign with limited opportunities for adjustment during the duration of the campaign. Moreover, the bias or skew that is introduced may be undetected using conventional systems. This bias or skew is due to the nature of the bidding, the nature of the products or service which are the subject of the campaign, and the nature of the audience viewing and responding to advertisements. In the example of a campaign for men's dress pants, the campaign manager and the advertising platform may have no way of detecting the bias that is introduced in the form of too many male viewers or too few female viewers. The demographic skew may be invisible, even after completion of the campaign. Accordingly, there is a need for an automated system that can detect and automatically compensate for a skew or bias in viewer characteristics that arises during the life of a campaign. The system and method must operate substantially in real time to analyze a bidding opportunity, generate a bid for participation in an auction to fill an impression on a web page being loaded on a user's device in an amount of time generally indistinguishable to the user.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a bid shading system <b>300</b> in accordance with various aspects described herein. The bid shading system <b>300</b> in this example embodiment includes a bidding function <b>304</b> which receives an impression <b>302</b>, a controller <b>306</b>, bid output <b>308</b>, no bid output <b>310</b>, storage logs <b>312</b> and a model <b>314</b>. Other embodiments may include more or fewer features or components than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0158">The bid shading system <b>300</b> operates to determine if a bid should be generated in response to an ad call or impression <b>302</b>. Further, the bid shading system <b>300</b> operates to determine if the bid should be shaded or adjusted to a higher or lower amount for a given advertising campaign. The system may choose to shade the bid in order to adjust or compensate for a skewed or biased targeting goal of the advertising campaign. The advertising campaign may be identified by a campaign identifier. The advertising platform which implements the bid shading system <b>300</b> stores campaign data according to the campaign identifier. The stored campaign data may include any data pertinent to the campaign, such as targeting goals of the campaign manager, information about bids received and winning bids, information about all impressions filled and the impression consumers who see advertisements, statistical data, etc. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the campaign data may be stored, for example, in data store <b>246</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0159">An impression <b>302</b> is received at the bidding function <b>304</b>. For example, when a web page is viewed by a browser of a device of a user, an ad call is received. The ad call identifies an impression on the web page to be filled. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> the ad call is received from the web server <b>220</b> by the Imp Bus <b>240</b>. In response to the ad call, the Imp Bus <b>240</b> generates an ad request for one or more bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b>. The ad call may include information about the impression consumer or user who viewed the web page. The information may include demographic, geographic, psychographic and behavioral information, for example, in a cookie file or other device. Further, the information could be numeric, categorical, or encoded in some manner. Still further, the information could be deterministic or probabilistic in nature. The bid request may include some or all of this information, and respective bid request information may be tailored to respective bidders. The bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> operate as described herein to determine if and how much to bid on the impression. The information about the ad call is contained in the impression <b>302</b>. Thus, for example, the impression <b>302</b> includes the information that the person responsible for the current impression or ad call, the viewer, is male or female. Alternatively, the information may be probabilistic, expressing a probability that the viewer associated with the ad call or impression is a male, such 80% likely to be male.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0160">The bidding function <b>304</b> may be implemented by one or more bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Alternatively, the bidding function <b>304</b> may be implemented by any other suitable component or party participating in the bid shading system <b>300</b>. The bidding function <b>304</b> may be implemented in hardware, software or any suitable combination. The bidding function <b>304</b> has access to various data about the impression consumer who initiated the impression <b>302</b> or ad call.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0161">The bidding function <b>304</b> determines the probability that the impression may match a targeting goal. In the illustrated example, the gender of the viewer is the targeting goal of interest. The gender targeting goal may be set at any suitable value by, for example a campaign manager. For example, the bid shading system <b>300</b> may seek to keep the gender ratio, or the ratio of male and female viewers at 1.0, or approximately fifty percent each, with some permitted tolerance. In other examples, the gender ratio may be set at seventy percent women to thirty percent men, or sixty percent men to forty percent women.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0162">Gender ratio is used in the illustrated example, However, any other suitable demographic, geographic, psychographic or behavioral characteristic could be used instead or in addition, or other characteristics could be used as well. For this present example, gender is the characteristic of interest. While the discussion here focuses on a male-female or m-f binary gender example, the system and method may be readily extended to non-binary gen355</p><p id="p-0131" num="0163">der examples as well including for example, m-f-x. The bidding function produces a probability about the gender of the impression consumer associated with the current impression being processed or the viewer who has requested to view a web page that generated an ad call. The bidding function <b>304</b> may not be able to determine with complete certainty the gender of the individual that is the source of the current ad call. Therefore, a gender probability p(gender) is produced from available information.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0164">In other examples, other characteristics may be monitored and adjusted, and such characteristics may have more than a binary value like male and female. For example, demographic information for an audience segment may include income information, where income is defined in bands from $0 to $50,000; $50,000 to $100,000; $100,000 to $200,000; $200,000 to $500,000; and above $500,000. The structures and functions illustrated herein may be readily adapted to a characteristic such as income having more than two possible values. Moreover, the structures and functions herein may be further adapted to a multi-dimensional system which implements bid shading for more than a single variable. Such a multi-dimensional system may monitor both the gender and the income level of impression consumers. Based on historical information for an ad campaign, the bid shading system may develop bid recommendations and bid shading values to optimize delivery of ads to achieve desired gender ratios and income bands.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0165">The bidding function <b>304</b> determined the probability that the viewer is a specified gender, male or female. Further, the bidding function <b>304</b> determines a bid value to return, for example, to the Imp Bus <b>240</b> for participating in an auction by the Imp Bus <b>240</b> to fill the impression. The determined bid value is passed to the controller <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0166">The controller <b>306</b> operates to determine if a bid should be submitted to the auction or not, and, if a bid is submitted, whether the bid should be shaded or not. A bid is shaded when the bid value is adjusted upward or downward to compensate for a perceived bias in the audience that has viewed advertisements for the current advertising campaign. The controller <b>306</b> produces a bidding indication at outputs <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> of the controller <b>306</b>. Any suitable bidding indication may be produced. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the controller <b>306</b> produces at a bid output <b>308</b> an indication that a bid should be produced, an indication that the bid should be shaded, and a shading amount. Further in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the controller <b>306</b> produces at a bid output <b>320</b> an indication that no bid should be produced.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0167">The result of the decision produced by the controller <b>306</b> may be stored in storage logs <b>312</b> for subsequent use by with model <b>314</b>. The storage logs <b>314</b> may store, for example, past information about the past impressions such as probability that an impression was received from a male or female, or any other characteristic. The illustration of the controller <b>306</b> with outputs <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is intended to be primarily conceptual to illustrate the processes implemented by one or more data processing systems, for example of an advertising platform such as the advertising platform <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The bid or no bid decision produced by the controller <b>306</b>, as well as a shading and shading amount decision, are intended to automatically correct for a bias or skew detected by the controller in data for the current advertising campaign.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0168">The controller <b>306</b> has access to a model <b>314</b>. In one example embodiment, the model <b>314</b> receives as input a campaign identifier which uniquely identifies the current campaign as well as the gender probability p(gender) received from the bidding function <b>304</b>. The model <b>314</b> produces as an output information about which decision to make, bid or no bid, and if bid, whether to shade or not to shade. The model <b>314</b> operates on historical data. In one embodiment, the model retrieves data from, for example, data store <b>246</b> of the advertising platform <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Further in some examples, the model <b>314</b> uses historical data from a predetermined time period. In one example, the predetermined time period is the immediately preceding two weeks. Other examples of longer or shorter duration may be used. For example, historical data can be retrieved from the starting date of the current campaign. Moreover, for purposes of privacy and confidentially, data used by the model <b>314</b> and the controller <b>306</b> are used solely by the model <b>314</b> and the controller <b>306</b>. Those data are preferably not shared with any other components of the advertising platform. The data many be anonymized or abstracted or otherwise made secure so that information about users or impression consumers or advertisers or impression buyers is not made otherwise available. This is true of the model <b>314</b> itself, as the model is trained over time based on historical data.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0169">The model <b>314</b> may produce a bid shading value. The value may be a real number that can serve as a multiplier to another value to control or manage bidding on the current impression. In one example, the bid shading value is a number greater than or less than 1.0 that may be multiplied by the bid value produced by the bidding function <b>304</b> and provided to the controller <b>306</b>. For example, the model <b>314</b> may produce a bid shading value of 0.90 or ninety percent. This would be an appropriate value if the model determines that excessive ads have been served to the bid consumer or web page viewer associated with the current impression being processed. The excess ads served represents a skew or bias in the serving of ads. There is a time domain component in that too many ads have been served to date to viewers with this viewer's characteristics. In the present example, if the viewer is male and too many ads have been served to date during the present campaign, based on the historical data from a predetermined time period, a bid shading value less than 1.0 is appropriate to, in effect, slow down the serving of additional ads to more male viewers.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0170">In contrast, the model <b>314</b> may produce a bid shading value of 1.20 or one hundred twenty percent. This would operate as a multiplier to the bid value produced by the bidding function <b>304</b>. This would be an appropriate value if the model determines that insufficient ads have been served to the bid consumer or web page viewer associated with the current impression being processed, based on a characteristic such as gender of the current bid consumer. If not enough women have viewed ads for the current campaign, and the gender probability p(gender) indicates this viewer is likely female, the model <b>314</b> may produce a bid shading value of 1.20. This would operate to speed up serving ads to more women, including the current viewer, and to thereby compensate for the bias introduced in the serving of advertisements to date.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0171">Some embodiments may use an additional parameter X that is introduced to stop bid shading from going too far and not overspend all the budget on a few bids. X may be a maximum permitted bid shading value, for example. It may be set to a static value or be determined dynamically. In this case, bid shading is defined as a minimum value between &#x3c1;(bid shading value) and the value X.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0172">The model is implemented as a set of instructions and data that may be processed on a data processing system. The instructions may be stored any convenient locations, such as the data store <b>246</b> of the advertising platform. Similarly, the data may be stored in any convenient location, either locally or at a location available over a network. The instructions and data may be processed by any suitable data processing system including a processor.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an exemplary curve <b>318</b> for the bid shading system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows time on the abscissa and a desired gender ratio &#x3c1; <b>320</b> and actual gender ratio on the ordinate. The gender ratio corresponds to a ratio of males to females (or females to males) viewing an advertisement. The desired gender ratio <b>320</b>, illustrated by the dashed line and letter p in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, may be received by the bid shading system <b>300</b> as an input from a campaign manager, for example.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0174">The desired gender ratio <b>320</b> serves as a targeting goal for the bid shading system <b>300</b>. The desired gender ratio may serve as a fairness ratio. Any user characteristic, including demographic, geographic, psychographic or behavioral or other characteristics may establish a fairness ratio. Fairness may not be a one-to-one ratio but may be determined based on particular goals of the advertising campaign. Fairness is viewed from the perspective of the impression buyer or advertiser. For example, the advertiser might be advertising to fill an available job. If the job is one that is traditionally or locally most commonly filled by males, and the advertiser wishes to recruit females and males equally, the fairness ratio may be adjusted by the advertiser to favor showing the job advertisement to more female job seekers than male job seekers to control the audience viewing the advertisement. This addresses a technological problem that can be inadvertently introduced by the nature of the viewing audience and the nature of the product or service advertised. The impression buyer or advertiser can adjust the fairness ratio provided as an input to the bid shading system <b>300</b> and the bid shading system will automatically compensate for the bias that is inadvertently introduced, including when the advertiser is aware of the bias in ad serving.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0175">The model <b>314</b> of the controller <b>306</b> of the bid shading system <b>306</b> receives or has access to historical data for advertisements served during the duration of the advertising campaign. This includes information about impressions received including the impression <b>302</b>, results of auctions that have been conducted to serve impressions, etc. The controller <b>306</b> can calculate or measure an actual gender ratio using the historical data. Calculated or measured actual gender ratios are illustrated as dots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. For example, one hour after the campaign is initiated, the actual gender ratio is below the desired gender ratio <b>320</b>. Two hours after initiation of the campaign, the actual gender ratio is above the desired gender ratio <b>320</b>. Three hours after initiation of the campaign, the actual gender ratio is below the desired gender ratio <b>320</b>. Four hours after initiation of the campaign, the actual gender ratio is slightly below the desired gender ratio <b>320</b>. As time elapses during an advertising campaign, the bid shading system <b>300</b> seeks to match the actual gender ratio, calculated at that time, for advertisements already served, to the desired gender ratio <b>320</b>. If the controller <b>306</b> determines that the actual gender ratio is below the desired gender ratio <b>320</b> at a time point, the controller <b>306</b> will produce a bid decision at the output <b>308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> along with a bid shading value greater than 1 to effectively speed up the serving of ads to impression consumers like the current impression consumer. On the other hand, if the controller <b>306</b> determines that the current actual gender ratio is above the desired gender ratio <b>320</b> at a time point, the controller <b>306</b> will produce a bid decision at the output <b>308</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> along with a bid shading value less than 1 to effectively slow down the serving of ads to impression consumers like the current impression consumer.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0176">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows determining the actual gender ratio on an hourly basis, any time increment may be used, including variable time increments. The bid shading process operates like an automatic accelerator or automatic brake to manage the serving of advertisements in the campaign to optimize a goal of a campaign manager. This may affect delivery of advertisements in the campaign. Moreover, some embodiments may provide for optimization for a number of values of plurality or characteristics of an audience An example might combine the audience age demographic and audience geography. Any other combination of audience features could be processed together and bid shading could be used to adjust ad delivery accordingly. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, since a single characteristic, gender, is used, the curve <b>318</b> for the bid shading system <b>300</b> is one dimensional with time. In embodiments using more characteristics, the curve would be multidimensional.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0177">The system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> implements a ratio pacing system for maintaining a predetermined ratio of a specified characteristic, such as gender of viewers of advertisements. The system <b>300</b> operates to return a value for adjusting a proposed by produced by one of bidder A <b>248</b>, bidder B <b>250</b> and bidder C <b>252</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The system knows the details of the current impression <b>302</b>, including characteristics of the viewer such as the viewers gender. The system determines a current gender ratio for the bidder relative to a desired gender ratio &#x3c1; <b>320</b> and produces a bid shading factor or bid adjustment factor.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0178">For example, consider an example where the current gender ratio for ads served during the course of the campaign is relatively low for females, meaning the campaign is biased low for female viewers. That is, the current gender ratio as a function of time is below the desired gender ratio &#x3c1; <b>320</b> represented by the line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. Further in this example, the current impression being considered for a bid by a bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> is for a female viewer. In that example, to remove the bias that has developed in the gender ratio, the system <b>300</b> will produce a bid shading factor greater than 1.0. This will be multiplied by the bid produced by the bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> to produce an adjusted bid amount. The adjusted bid amount will then be used in the auction among all bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>. Because the adjusted bid amount is increased relative to the bid produced by the bidder, the likelihood is increased of winning the auction and serving the ad to the current impression, identified as a female viewer. This will tend to reduce the apparent bias or to remove the skew in ad serving.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0179">In a similar example, where the current gender ratio for ads served during the course of the campaign is again relatively low for females, meaning the campaign shows a bias or skew that is low for females, and the current impression <b>302</b> is a male viewer. Because of the existing bias in gender of viewers to whom ads have been served during the campaign, the system <b>300</b> will attempt to compensate for the bias. In this example, to remove the bias that has developed in the gender ratio, the system <b>300</b> will produce a bid shading factor less than 1.0. This will be multiplied by the bid produced by the bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> to produce an adjusted bid amount. The adjusted bid amount will then be used in the auction among all bidders <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>. Because the adjusted bid amount is decreased relative to the bid produced by the bidder, the likelihood is decreased of winning the auction and serving the ad to the current impression, identified as a male viewer. This will tend to reduce the apparent bias or to remove the skew in ad serving.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0180">In some embodiments, the controller <b>306</b> may implement as the model <b>314</b> the relation</p><p id="p-0149" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>   <mi>pace</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>p</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>impressions</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>served</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>since</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mn>0</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>hour</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>total</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>number</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>of</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>impressions</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>served</mi>    </mrow>   </mfrac>   <mo>.</mo>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0150" num="0181">The number &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>is a pacing factor. It may be computed periodically, such as every hour by summing over past time periods. The pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>in this example determines the total probability of, for example an impression being served to a female, and divides by total number of impressions served to determine an average probability over time. The numerator represents that probability of the characteristic occurring (gender, in this example) since the beginning of the campaign or over any other predetermined period, e.g., the probability that the impression or ad request is coming from a male user, for example. The denominator represents the total number of impressions served since the beginning of the campaign. This information may be retrieved from stored data or determined from stored data collected during processing of advertisements and impressions or may be determined in any suitable fashion. The pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>may be used to shade bids produced by bidders responding to an ad call or impression. The pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>may have a value from 0 to X, for example, where X is set as the maximum pacing value. A value of 10 is one exemplary value for X. The pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>often will have a value slightly larger than 1.0 or slightly smaller than 1.0 in order to control pacing of a campaign to reduce perceived bias in a characteristic such as gender of impression viewers. After a bidder <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) determines bid values based on other factors the pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>may be used to shade the bidder's vid value prior to determining a winning bid for the impression in an auction. The bidder's bid value is shaded by the pacing factor to increase or decrease the likelihood of the bid winning the auction and thereby compensating for any bias that has accumulated during the campaign.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0182">Operated in conjunction with the curve <b>318</b> for the bid shading system <b>300</b>, the desired gender ratio &#x3c1; <b>320</b> can be compared with the pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace</sub>. If the pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>exceeds the desired gender ratio &#x3c1;<b>320</b>, then the system <b>300</b> should shade downward, or reduce the bid value submitted to the auction to fill the impression by the bidder. If the pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>is substantially equal to the desired gender ratio &#x3c1;<b>320</b>, the system should not shade the bid positively or negatively but pass the bidder's determined bid to the auction without modification. If the pacing factor &#x3c1;<sub>pace </sub>is less than the desired gender ratio &#x3c1;<b>320</b>, the system should shade upward, or increase the bid value submitted to the auction to fill the current impression by the bidder.

In one particular embodiment, at an interval which may be regular such as hourly, the model <b>314</b> or the controller <b>316</b> of the system queries all campaigns that have enabled a ratio pacing function. For each campaign that has enabled a ratio pacing function, the system <b>300</b> queries the composition of the audience reached so far. For example, the composition may be expressed as a male-to-female ratio. In deterministic or probabilistic fashion, each bidder knows how many male or female audience members the bidder has bid for, and how many auctions it has won. This data may be stored, for example, in data store <b>246</b> of the platform <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Such data is stored for other characteristics beyond gender, as well.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0185">The system <b>300</b> then models the ratios that represent each characteristic of interest to an advertiser for each campaign. Characteristics may include gender, as in the present example, but may also include any other characteristic of interest to the advertiser, such as demographic, psychograph and behavioral characteristics. After updating the mode, the system <b>300</b> then notifies respective advertisers associated with campaigns to reflect the updated statistics. Further, the system <b>300</b> notifies the controller <b>306</b> that there are updated statistics on the composition of the audience reached per campaign. The controller <b>306</b> loads the new parameters for each respective campaign and applies new delivery rules to incoming ad requests.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of operation of a ratio pacing system in the advertising platform <b>214</b>. The method <b>316</b> may implement a ratio pacing system, also referred to herein as a bid shading system, to adjust bid values in an online advertising platform to compensate for inadvertent bias in audience characteristics or parameters during serving of advertisements in response to impressions in an advertising campaign.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0187">At block <b>322</b>, it is determined if the advertiser opts into the ratio pacing system for the campaign. The campaign is defined by, for example, one or more target audience segments, a keyword or keywords or a line item, and data supporting and produced by the progress of the campaign. The campaign is managed by a campaign manager on behalf of an advertiser. If the campaign manager determines or suspects that there is or will be an unintended bias or skew in the delivery of ads, creating an unintentional unfairness in the delivery of ads, the campaign manager will opt in to the ratio pacing campaign. This may be done through a dashboard provided for the campaign manager by the advertising platform. If the campaign manager does not opt in for this campaign, the method <b>316</b> ends at block <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0188">If the campaign manager opts in to the ratio pacing operation, at block <b>326</b>, a pacing attribute is determined. In the present example, gender of an impression viewer is used. Gender in this example has a binary value, male or female. Other gender values may be used as well. Also, any other suitable characteristic or attribute of the campaign may be selected to monitor, including any demographic, behavioral or psychographic characteristic. The goal is to detect any unintentional skew in delivery of ads, where the skew or bias is a variation from a campaign goal of the campaign manager. For example, the campaign manager may desire to serve 80% of ads to a female audience. If, after progress of the campaign over time, data show 85% or 75% of ads have been served to female viewers, a skew or bias has occurred and may be corrected.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0189">At block <b>328</b>, the delivery of ads in response to received impressions occurs. As described in more detail herein, or in accordance with other embodiments of ad serving systems, ad calls are received, bids are received, and a winning bid is accepted. The winning bid is then used to fill the ad call. As this process continues, data is accumulated which characterizes the campaign. At block <b>330</b>, it is determined from the accumulated data whether a skew has occurred in the data. For example, in example above, if 85% of impressions were filled to female viewers when the campaign goal was 80%, a skew or bias has arisen.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0190">At block <b>332</b>, steps are taken to correct the skew or bias. In some embodiments, the system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> may be implemented to develop a bid shading value. The system <b>300</b> may produce a bid shading value that will reduce the likelihood of a bid being the winning bid. The system <b>300</b> may produce a bid shading value that will increase the likelihood of a bid being the winning bid. In some embodiments, the system <b>300</b> may decide to produce no bid at all, for example, if the skew exceeds a predetermined threshold and the skew or bias would be made worse if the current impression was filled.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0191">After adjusting the bid and proceeding with bidding for the auction, the system determines at block <b>334</b> if the advertiser or campaign manager has opted out of the ratio pacing system. The advertiser or campaign manager may opt out at any time for any reason. If the advertiser or campaign manager did not opt out, control returns to block <b>338</b> to continue monitoring ad delivery and detecting skew or bias. If the advertiser or campaign manager did opt out, the method ends at block <b>336</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of operation of a bid shading system in accordance with various aspects described herein.

The method <b>340</b> may implement a ratio pacing method in accordance with embodiment described herein.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0193">At block <b>342</b>, the system initializes one or more pacing parameters. In some examples, gender of an impression is chosen as the pacing parameter. Gender refers to the gender of a viewer associated with a current impression in an advertising serving system. Gender may be deterministic or probabilistic. A gender will be probabilistic when, given information received about the impression, it can only be concluded with a specified probability that the impression has a particular gender. The information received about the impression may include demographic, geographic and other information, past browsing history, cookie file data, etc., as discussed herein. Any other characteristic or parameter, other than or in addition to gender, may be chosen as the pacing parameter. Examples included demographic parameters such as income, geographic location, age, etc. Examples also include psychographic and behavioral information for the impression. In some example, more than one pacing parameter may be processed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0194">At block <b>344</b>, an impression or ad request or ad call is received by the system for processing. These are simply referred to as impression herein. The impression may be generated or received, for example, when a user views a web page on a device such as a computer, a tablet, a mobile device or a connected television. The web page may include advertising slots or locations to be filled with advertisements or other content. In accordance with some embodiments, an auction is conducted by an advertising platform to select an ad to fill the impression. The received impression may include any suitable data organized in any suitable manner. For example, the impression may include information about the user who views the web page, including demographic, geographic, psychographic or behavioral information. In a particular example, the impression includes information about the gender of the user, meaning one or more human entities, (e.g. having a capacity to make inference based, at least, on complex mathematical formalisms), which can provide simulated vision, sound recognition and so forth. The gender information may be probabilistic in nature, such as an 80% probability the user is female.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0195">At block <b>346</b>, the system retrieves a bid value produced for the impression and a probability of each category the specified attribute. In some embodiments, the bid value is produced by a bidder such as bidders <b>348</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> as described herein. Conventionally, the bids produced by such bidders are used in auction to determine an advertisement to fill the impression. In accordance with some embodiments, the bid may be adjusted prior to submission to the auction. The bid value may be retrieved from any suitable location, such as storage logs <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, the specified attribute of interest is gender. The probability p(category) corresponds to the probability that the impression has a female gender, p(female), or that the impression has a male gender, p(male). This corresponds to the probability that the viewer of the web page and advertisements thereon is female or male. The probability p(category) may be retrieved from any suitable storage such as the storage logs <b>312</b>, or may be received with other data forming the impression. The bid value and the category probabilities may be forwarded, in some examples, to the controller <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0196">At step <b>348</b>, a current ratio status is collected. The current ratio status is the ratio of impressions filled for each category for the specified attribute. This may be a number that varies over time, as a campaign progresses and impressions are filled. When an impression is filled, data is stored about the impression, including information about categories of attributes of interest. For example, where the specified attribute is gender and where possible categories are male and female, the current ratio status may be female:male ratio, and may have a current value of 0.85. As more ads are served and impressions are filled, the current ratio status may and likely will vary, in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0197">At block <b>350</b>, based on the current ratio status, the system generates a pacing value to de-skew the serving of ads, or remove any unintentional bias, if necessary. In the manner illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the current ratio status, as a function of time, may vary from a campaign goal ratio. The present embodiments detect the variation and determine if a bias exists and if it should be corrected. If so, at block <b>350</b>, a pacing value to compensate for the detected bias is determined. In some embodiments illustrated herein, the controller <b>306</b> may output a pacing value that is used to shade the bid value. If the delivery ratio is currently skewed by an amount or a percent and the current ad request would increase the skew, the system will adjust the pacing value to un-skew the delivery of ads. This shading pacing modifier effectively increases or decreases the probability that this ad request will be served, and by that is able to balance the delivery mechanism and reduce the skew.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0198">At block <b>352</b>, the system determines if the bid should be adjusted. If applying the pacing value with reduce the skew, the system may output the pacing value and adjust the bid accordingly, block <b>354</b>. A bid is then submitted to the auction, block <b>355</b>. In some cases, bidding or adjusting the bid may not operate to reduce a detected skew. That may occur, for example, if the current ratio status shows too many female impressions have been filled and the current impression has a probability of being female. If not bidding is the best option to reduce the current skew, the method ends at block <b>358</b> and no bid is produced to fill the impression. If bidding in the auction, using the pacing value to adjust the bid value to increase or decrease the likelihood that adjust bid is the winning bid, is the best option to reduce the current skew, at block <b>360</b> the bid amount is adjusted and the bid is submitted to the auction.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0199">Some embodiments involve a pre-existing media buy. A preexisting media buy is typically established by way of a contractual agreement between an impression seller member and an impression buyer member. The contractual agreement specifies the specific impression inventory that is subject to an exclusive first right of refusal on the part of the impression buyer member, and the reserve price that bidders other than the bidder operating on behalf of the impression buyer member must meet in order to take the impression inventory away.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0200">In the case of a pre-existing media buy, there is no auction to select a winning bid. However, the principles of the examples described herein may be readily extended to the pre-existing media buy embodiment. For example, gender distribution is still tracked in a pre-existing media buy arrangement and a decision on bid/no bid can be still used. In that case, even though the media is paid but the fairness ratio is exceeded, the system might decide to not show an impression.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of operation of a bid shading system in accordance with various aspects described herein.

At block <b>306</b>, only campaigns which have the feature activated will be queried for their current status and data.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0203">At block <b>366</b>, for each queried campaign, the system queries the composition of the audience reached so far. For example, for an attribute or characteristic of interest, the system will determine how many impressions for each category have been filled. If the attribute of interest is gender, and possible categories are male and female, this data may be retrieved and processed for the campaign to date. At block <b>368</b>, for each queried campaign, the system will model the ratios that represent each category of each attribute that are of interest to the advertiser or campaign manager. At block <b>370</b>, the system will update the database (DB) of campaigns for attributes ratios relationships.

Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0206">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a block diagram <b>400</b> is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein. In particular a virtualized communication network is presented that can be used to implement some or all of the subsystems and functions of communication network <b>100</b>, the subsystems and functions of systems, and methods presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D, <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>F and <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>E</figref>. For example, virtualized communication network <b>400</b> can facilitate in whole or in part an online content delivery system which conducts an auction among bids to server an advertisement to a web page to fill an impression. The virtualized communication network <b>400</b> can implement a ratio pacing system to detect and compensate for unintentional bias or skew introduced in serving of content items.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0207">In particular, a cloud networking architecture is shown that leverages cloud technologies and supports rapid innovation and scalability via a transport layer <b>450</b>, a virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b> and/or one or more cloud computing environments <b>475</b>. In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0208">In contrast to traditional network elements&#x2014;which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements (VNEs) <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>450</b>, <b>452</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0209">As an example, a traditional network element <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a VNE <b>430</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it's elastic: so the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle-boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0210">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>450</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>410</b>, wireless access <b>420</b>, voice access <b>430</b>, media access <b>440</b> and/or access to content sources <b>475</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized, and might require special DSP code and analog front-ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as VNEs <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> or <b>434</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0211">The virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>450</b> to provide the VNEs <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> and <b>434</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, VNEs <b>430</b>, <b>432</b> and <b>434</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements do not typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers&#x2014;each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0212">The cloud computing environments <b>475</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNEs <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>425</b> and cloud computing environment <b>475</b> and in the commercial cloud, or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third party locations.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0213">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac, ag, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands for example or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0233">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an embodiment <b>600</b> of a mobile network platform <b>610</b> is shown that is an example of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and/or VNEs <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, etc. For example, platform <b>610</b> can facilitate in whole or in part an online content delivery system which conducts an auction among bids to server an advertisement to a web page to fill an impression.

In one or more embodiments, the mobile network platform <b>610</b> can generate and receive signals transmitted and received by base stations or access points such as base station or access point <b>122</b>. Generally, mobile network platform <b>610</b> can comprise components, e.g., nodes, gateways, interfaces, servers, or disparate platforms, that facilitate both packet-switched (PS) (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) and circuit-switched (CS) traffic (e.g., voice and data), as well as control generation for networked wireless telecommunication. As a non-limiting example, mobile network platform <b>610</b> can be included in telecommunications carrier networks, and can be considered carrier-side components as discussed elsewhere herein.

In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0252">In one or more embodiments, information regarding use of services can be generated including services being accessed, media consumption history, user preferences, and so forth. This information can be obtained by various methods including user input, detecting types of communications (e.g., video content vs. audio content), analysis of content streams, sampling, and so forth. The generating, obtaining and/or monitoring of this information can be responsive to an authorization provided by the user. In one or more embodiments, an analysis of data can be subject to authorization from user(s) associated with the data, such as an opt-in, an opt-out, acknowledgement requirements, notifications, selective authorization based on types of data, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0253">Some of the embodiments described herein can also employ artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate automating one or more features described herein. The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0254">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0255">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
