When using a medical robot, the surgical instrument is sterilized and therefore is a clean area, but the medical robot side is not as sterilized as the surgical instrument side and is therefore an unclear area. For this reason, in surgery using a medical robot, the medical robot side is covered with a drape in order to isolate the clean area and the unclean area from each other.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1 discloses a surgical robotic drape for covering a surgical robot arm that includes a drive device for providing the drive to a surgical instrument. This drape comprises a cover for covering the robot arm to define a sterile boundary thereon and an interface element attached to the cover.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 2 discloses a surgical robotic drape for covering a part of a surgical robot. This drape is configured to include a cover that covers the drive device of a surgical robot to define a sterile boundary thereon and a plurality of interface elements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 3 discloses a drape unit that, when a manipulator is connected to a drive unit, can maintain a state in which a clean area and an unclean area are isolated from each other even by the operation of the drive unit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Translation of PCT International Application, No. 2018-515212</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">[Patent Document 2] Japanese Translation of PCT International Application, No. 2018-515213</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">[Patent Document 3] JP6138396B</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0009">The portion of a medical robot to which a surgical instrument is attached is provided with a movable member that transmits driving force to the surgical instrument and an opening that guides the movement of a movable member. If such an opening is provided between a clean area and an unclean area, the isolation between the clean area and the unclean area will be insufficient. In Patent Document 3, an adapter that covers such an opening is provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">However, the opening for the forward/backward movement (linear movement) of the movable member is a long hole extending in the forward/backward direction, and an adapter that covers the entire opening is therefore provided also long. If such an adapter is exposed, it interferes with the movement of the movable member, and when some external force is applied to the adapter, unnecessary force is applied to the surgical instrument via the movable member, which may impair the accuracy and safety of treatment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a drape unit capable of sufficiently isolating a clean area and an unclean area from each other and improving the operability/safety of surgery.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0012">To solve the above problems, an aspect of the present invention provides a drape unit that is disposed between a medical robot holding a surgical instrument and the surgical instrument to isolate the surgical instrument and the medical robot from each other. The drape unit transmits power in a forward/backward direction from a power transmission part of the medical robot to a movable part provided in the surgical instrument. The drape unit comprises: a movable intervening part that receives the power from the power transmission part; and a fixed intervening part that is detachably attached to the medical robot. The fixed intervening part has a through-hole through which a part of the movable intervening part is inserted. The fixed intervening part has a housing portion that covers a part of the movable intervening part as viewed in a penetrating direction of the through-hole when the movable intervening part moves to an end portion in the forward/backward direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">According to such a configuration, when the movable intervening part which closes the through-hole to prevent the exposure of an unclean area receives the power from the power transmission part to move to the end portion in the forward/backward direction, a part of the movable intervening part is covered with the housing portion of the fixed intervening part, and the exposure of the movable intervening part moving in the forward/backward direction can therefore be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">In the above drape unit, the movable intervening part may have: a first movable portion that receives the power from the power transmission part; a second movable portion that transmits the power to the movable part; and a third movable portion that extends from the second movable portion in the forward/backward direction, and the third movable portion may have a cover area that is housed in the housing portion. This allows the housing portion to house the cover area of the third movable portion extending in the forward/backward direction, and the third movable portion covers the through-hole and suppresses the exposure of the movable intervening part.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">In the above drape unit, the fixed intervening part is preferably an assembly that comprises a first fixed portion provided with a first opening through which the first movable portion is inserted and a second fixed portion provided with a second opening through which the second movable portion is inserted, and the movable intervening part is preferably interposed between the first fixed portion and the second fixed portion and housed in the fixed intervening part so as not to drop off. This allows the movable intervening part to be interposed between the first fixed portion and the second fixed portion, and the movable intervening part is reliably prevented from dropping off from the fixed intervening part while suppressing the exposure of the movable intervening part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">In the above drape unit, a length of the second opening in the forward/backward direction is preferably shorter than a length of the first opening in the forward/backward direction. This allows the first opening to be covered in a region in which the second opening and the first opening do not overlap when viewed in the penetrating direction, so that the through-hole is less likely to occur even when the third movable portion moves in the forward/backward direction, and the exposure of an unclean area is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">In the above drape unit, the fixed intervening part may have a guide groove that receives a part of the movable intervening part and guides the movable intervening part to move in the forward/backward direction, and in a state in which the drape unit and the surgical instrument are mounted on the medical robot, when viewed in the penetrating direction, predetermined gaps may be provided between the third movable portion and the first fixed portion and between the third movable portion and the second fixed portion. The presence of the above gaps can reduce the possibility of occurrence of a problem in that, when the movable part of the surgical instrument attached to the medical robot is being moved, the fixed intervening part and the movable intervening part collide with each other to lock the movable part.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In the above drape unit, the second opening may be closed by the third movable portion. This allows the third movable portion to cover the second opening, and the exposure of an unclean area is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">In the above drape unit, a length of the third movable portion in the forward/backward direction is preferably longer than a length of the second opening in the forward/backward direction. This allows the second opening to be covered even when the third movable portion moves in the forward/backward direction, and the exposure of an unclean area is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">In the above drape unit, in a state before the surgical instrument is mounted on the medical robot, the movable intervening part is preferably disposed so as to close the entire first opening of the fixed intervening part mounted on the surgical instrument. This allows the movable intervening part to close the entire first opening even when the surgical instrument is not mounted on the medical robot, and the exposure of an unclean area is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In the above drape unit, the movable intervening part may be configured so as not to come into contact with an inner wall surface that constitutes the through-hole of the fixed intervening part, in a state in which the movable intervening part is located at the end portion in the forward/backward direction. This can alleviate the force applied to the surgical instrument from the movable intervening part when the movable intervening part stops at the movable range end portion.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In the above drape unit, a plurality of the movable intervening parts may be arranged in parallel in a direction orthogonal to the forward/backward direction and the penetrating direction. Through this configuration, even when a plurality of movable intervening parts is provided, interference between the movable intervening parts and exposure of the movable intervening parts are suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0023">According to the present invention, there can be provided a drape unit capable of sufficiently isolating a clean area and an unclean area from each other and improving the operability/safety of surgery.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view for exemplifying a drape unit according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view for exemplifying the mounting state of a surgical instrument.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view for exemplifying attachment of the surgical instrument to the drape unit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view for exemplifying a driving portion of a medical robot.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the drape unit according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view for exemplifying the configuration of the drape unit according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> are schematic views for exemplifying a movable intervening part and a fixed intervening part.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>8</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref> are schematic views for exemplifying the movement of the movable intervening part.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a plan view of the drape unit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view for exemplifying guide grooves of the fixed intervening part.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>11</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> are schematic views for exemplifying the configuration of another movable intervening part.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>12</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating an example of stoppers.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0036">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.
