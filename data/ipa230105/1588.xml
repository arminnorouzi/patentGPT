The gripper may in particular be mounted on a robot arm or other moving platform for picking and placing objects, for instance for the assembly of components.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gripper mechanisms are widely used in automated manufacturing processes for assembly of components and are typically mounted on a moving robot arm or on a moving table or slide for picking and placing components. Both pneumatically and electromagnetically operated gripper mechanisms are known. In many applications it is desirable to have a gripper mechanism that is compact and light in order to allow high acceleration and deceleration of mobile machine elements carrying the gripper. The reliability and durability of the gripper mechanism is also important in view of the high cost of machine down time in manufacturing processes. Ease of installation and maintenance are also important factors to ensure reduce costs. The performance of the gripper mechanism is also important, in particular the speed of actuation. There are also increasing demands for reducing energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many gripper mechanisms are based on pneumatic actuation, however these generally lack flexibility, in particular when changes in manufacturing process are required, for instance requiring adjustment to different parts. In this regard, electromagnetically actuated gripper systems are generally more convenient, however conventional electromagnetic gripper mechanisms do not satisfy desired requirements, in particular a combination of low weight, compactness, reliability, ease of control and maintenance, and low energy consumption. In many electromagnetic gripper systems, one of the drawbacks is the heating of the gripper motors during operation and the need for cooling systems for high performance applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the foregoing, an object of this invention is to provide a gripper mechanism that is reliable, has a high actuation speed and a low energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is advantageous to provide a gripper mechanism that is light weight and compact.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is advantageous to provide a gripper mechanism that is easy to control.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is advantageous to provide a gripper mechanism that is easy to install and maintain.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Objects of the invention have been achieved by providing the gripper mechanism according to claim <b>1</b>.

id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to the figures, a gripper mechanism <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the invention comprises a stator <b>2</b> and a pair of mobile grippers <b>19</b> movably mounted to the stator <b>2</b> via a bearing <b>8</b>. The bearing <b>8</b> is arranged to guide the mobile grippers <b>19</b> in translation D with relative to the stator <b>2</b>. In an advantageous embodiment, the bearing <b>8</b> may be in form of a linear ball or roller bearing. In other embodiments the bearing may however be a slide bearing comprising low friction materials or a lubricated slide bearing. The term &#x201c;bearing&#x201d;, it is intended to mean one or more bearings which may be arranged close together or in a spaced apart relationship depending on the size of the gripper mechanism and the required gripping force, since the higher the gripping force the larger the gripper mechanism typically should be.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The stator <b>2</b> comprises a permanent magnet <b>3</b> arranged between the pair of mobile grippers <b>19</b>. The permanent magnet <b>3</b> forms a common stator component for both grippers. The mobile grippers <b>19</b> move linearly in opposite directions between open and closed positions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The permanent magnet may advantageously be essentially in form of a flat plate, for instance a rectangular plate, having a thickness W substantially smaller than a length L<b>1</b> or height H<b>1</b> of the plate shape, the thickness W being the seen in the direction T orthogonal to the direction of translation or movement D of the mobile grippers <b>19</b> relative to the stator <b>2</b>. The permanent magnet <b>3</b> has a pair of poles N-S generating a magnetic flux perpendicular to the direction of movement of the mobile grippers D. The permanent magnet <b>3</b> is thus arranged substantially centrally between the mobile grippers <b>19</b>, the major plane of the permanent magnet <b>3</b> being substantially parallel to the direction of movement D of the mobile grippers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The stator <b>2</b> comprises a housing <b>4</b> comprising a centre part <b>4</b><i>b </i>supporting the permanent magnet <b>3</b>, and outer parts <b>4</b><i>a </i>surrounding the mobile grippers <b>19</b> positioned either side of the centre part <b>4</b><i>b. </i>A support frame portion <b>16</b> of the centre part <b>4</b><i>b </i>mechanically supports the permanent magnet <b>3</b>. The housing <b>4</b> further comprises a bearing portion <b>17</b> for supporting the static portion <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the bearing <b>8</b>. The housing centre part <b>4</b><i>b </i>and outer parts <b>4</b><i>a </i>may be made of a non-magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The stator <b>2</b> further comprises a magnetic circuit armature <b>5</b> made of a ferromagnetic or soft magnetic material, having at least a pair of armature lateral outer parts <b>5</b><i>a </i>mounted to the housing outer part <b>4</b><i>a </i>on outer lateral sides of the mobile grippers <b>19</b>, the armature outer parts <b>5</b> forming with the permanent magnet <b>3</b> a magnetic circuit with magnetic field lines passing through support portions <b>9</b> of the mobile grippers <b>19</b>. The armature outer parts <b>5</b><i>a </i>may have a size substantially the same or larger than the permanent magnet. The armature outer parts <b>5</b><i>a </i>face the permanent magnet <b>3</b> in order to form an air gap therebetween in which an active portion of the mobile gripper <b>19</b> displaces.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mobile gripper <b>19</b> comprises a coil <b>11</b> configured to be connected to an electrical circuit (not shown) that drives a current through the coil during actuation of the gripper mechanism <b>1</b> in order to move the mobile grippers <b>19</b>. The coil <b>11</b> is mounted in a support portion <b>9</b> of the mobile gripper, for instance in particular in a coil mounting cavity <b>13</b> of the support portion <b>9</b>. The support portion <b>9</b> may form a substantially flat plate shaped component that is translatable within the air gap formed between the permanent magnet <b>3</b> and magnetic circuit armature <b>5</b>, the coil in the support portion <b>9</b> having a height H that may be comparable, or approximately equivalent to a height H<b>1</b> of the permanent magnet. A length of L the support portion <b>9</b> (seen in the direction of translation D) is smaller than a length L<b>1</b> of the permanent magnet <b>3</b> but greater than half of the length of the permanent magnet <b>3</b>. The length L of the support portion preferably corresponds to the length of the permanent magnet <b>3</b> minus the amplitude of maximum displacement of the mobile gripper. This ensures that the coil <b>11</b> is always within the air gap formed between the permanent magnet <b>3</b> and magnetic circuit armature <b>5</b> and always overlaps the permanent magnet <b>3</b> in order to ensure a maximum magnetic force interaction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mobile gripper further comprises a gripper finger <b>10</b>, or a fixture for a gripper finger (hereinafter generally referred to as a &#x201c;gripper finger&#x201d;) integrally formed with, or separately formed and assembled to, the support portion <b>9</b>. The gripper finger may in particular project below a lower end of the housing <b>4</b>, although in certain applications it is also possible to have the gripper fingers within a housing or protective cage having an orifice allowing access to a component to be held by the gripper. The support portion <b>9</b> further comprises a bearing portion <b>14</b> for supporting a mobile portion <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the bearing <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The gripper finger <b>10</b> is schematically shown as a substantially rectangular block in the illustrated embodiments, however the shape of the gripper finger in practical applications shall be adapted to the shape of the component to be picked. In an advantageous embodiment, the gripper finger, or part of the gripper finger, is removable and replaceable by another gripper finger or part in order to change the shape or material depending on the object to be handled. This allows also various surface materials for the application concerned to be modified, for instance regarding the hardness, friction and other surface properties. Although in the illustrated embodiments the gripper fingers are shown in a closed position as being in direct contact against each other, it may be noted that depending on the application the gripper fingers in a &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position may be separated by a gap. In many applications, the gripping function is effected by having the gripper fingers move towards each other to clamp an object to be handled therebetween. However within the scope of the invention, it is possible for the gripper fingers to grip an object by moving the gripper fingers apart, for instance by insertion in an orifice or cavity of an object.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to displace the mobile grippers <b>19</b> between an opened and closed position, a current is injected in the coil <b>11</b> creating a magnetic field that is opposed to the magnetic field within the air gap at the position in which the gripper is at the time of actuation. The magnetic field traversing the coil <b>11</b> when the gripper is in an open position is generally opposed to the magnetic field traversing the coil when the gripper is in a closed position due to the arrangement of the poles N-S of the substantially plate shaped permanent magnet <b>3</b> relative to the air gap and the position of the mobile gripper support portion <b>9</b>. In order to move the gripper from the opened to closed position and back from the closed position to the opened position, the direction of the current in the coil is inversed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mobile grippers <b>19</b> may be interconnected by a mechanical system such as a rack and pinion or by link arms configured to ensure that the mobile grippers move in opposite directions of equal amplitude and speed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a variant however the mobile grippers may be independently controlled without any mechanical linking mechanism therebetween.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The gripper mechanism according to embodiments of this invention further comprises at least one magnetic lock <b>7</b>, <b>7</b><i>a, </i><b>7</b><i>b </i>that is arranged to maintain the mobile grippers <b>19</b> in a gripping position (e.g. closed position) for handling an object. In an advantageous embodiment, the gripper mechanism comprises at least a second magnetic lock <b>7</b><i>a, </i><b>7</b><i>b </i>such that the mobile grippers are held passively by a magnetic force in both the opened and closed positions, whereby the displacement of the mobile grippers from an opened to a closed positions and vice versa is effected by injecting a current in the coil <b>11</b> in one direction or in the opposite direction depending on the direction of the magnetic field to be generated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the open and/or closed positions the current in the coil is either switched off or set at a lower amplitude than during the actuation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">This advantageously provides a gripper mechanism that has a low energy consumption and in particular that generates a low amount of heat loss such that a particularly compact and light gripper mechanism may be provided.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In handling functions requiring a high gripping force, the passive magnetic force of the magnetic lock acting upon the gripper elements may be supplemented by an electromagnetic force provided by injecting current in the coils of the mobile grippers <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The magnetic lock may advantageously comprise a permanent magnet <b>18</b><i>a, </i><b>18</b><i>b </i>mounted to the housing <b>4</b> or to the mobile gripper <b>19</b>, whereby the other of the mobile gripper or housing comprises a ferromagnetic or soft magnetic material <b>15</b><i>a, </i><b>15</b><i>b, </i>or in a variant, a permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a first embodiment, the magnetic lock <b>7</b><i>a </i>comprises a permanent magnet <b>18</b> mounted to the centre part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>4</b> and associated ferromagnetic material <b>15</b><i>a </i>mounted on the mobile gripper support portion <b>19</b>, for instance as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a second embodiment, the magnetic lock <b>7</b><i>b </i>comprises permanent magnets <b>18</b> and associated ferromagnetic materials <b>15</b><i>b </i>mounted on the outer parts <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the housing respectively outer edges of the mobile gripper support portions <b>9</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b></figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c. </i>In a variant, the magnetic locking mechanism may comprise a combination of the foregoing such that there is a magnetic lock arranged both on the outer parts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the inner part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the housing, depending on the magnetic force to be generated by the locking mechanism.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an advantageous embodiment, the stator and mobile gripper comprise a spacer element <b>21</b> that ensures that a gap is formed between the permanent magnet <b>18</b> and the soft magnetic material <b>15</b><i>a, </i><b>15</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic locking mechanism <b>7</b> in the fully locked and/or fully open position. The gap may be formed by an airgap or an insert <b>21</b> of a non-magnetic material as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>. In a variant, the spacer element may be a protuberance <b>21</b> formed of a magnetic material that contacts the permanent magnet <b>18</b>, for instance as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, whereby the reduced contact surface area reduces the magnetic attraction force between the gripper and the permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spacer element <b>21</b> advantageously allows avoiding an excessively high peak magnetic locking force that would require a high electromagnetic force to overcome.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned previously, the magnetic locking function may be configured to maintain the mobile grippers passively in an open (spaced apart) position instead of a closed together position.
