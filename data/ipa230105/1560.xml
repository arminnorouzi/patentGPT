That an object, in particular the fluid cooling unit, is designed for a particular function, in particular to cool the drive unit by means of the at least two sub-streams, is to be understood to mean, in particular, that the object fulfils and/or executes this particular function in at least one application state and/or operating state.

It is conceivable for the separating element arranged in the proximity region of the drive unit to constitute a single piece with the drive unit, in particular the housing of the drive unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also proposed that the fluid cooling unit comprise at least one channel element, in particular the aforementioned, which is designed to guide the sub-stream, in particular separately from the other sub-stream, at least partially past an outer wall of the drive unit. Fouling of the drive unit with foreign bodies in the sub-stream can be advantageously prevented when the sub-streams are used to the drive unit.

A &#x201c;direction of main extent&#x201d; of an object, in particular of the outer wall and/or of the outer surface of the outer wall, is in this case to be understood to mean, in particular, a direction that is parallel to a longest edge of a smallest geometric cuboid that only just completely encloses the object.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is further proposed that the separating unit comprise at least one conveying unit, which is arranged within the fluid cooling unit and is designed to convey at least the sub-stream out of or through the housing unit. Advantageously effective cooling can be achieved, in particular because high flow rates of the fluid streams, in particular of the sub-streams, become possible by means the conveyor unit. Distribution of foreign bodies from the sub-stream within the housing unit, the separator unit and/or the fluid cooling unit, in particular into the other sub-stream, can be advantageously prevented.

An advantageously simple and inexpensive design of the conveying unit can be achieved. Advantageously, a fan impeller of the drive unit can be used as a conveying element for the sub-streams. It is conceivable for the conveying element realized as an axial fan to be realized as part of the drive unit. Preferably, the conveying element constitutes a single piece with a fan impeller of the drive unit. Preferably, the conveying element is arranged fluidically behind the drive unit, as viewed from the intake opening.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, it is conceivable for the conveying element to be arranged in a channel element of the fluid cooling unit that is designed to conduct the sub-stream.

For example, the conveying element is realized as a fan impeller, in particular a two-part fan impeller. Particularly preferably, the conveying element is arranged, in particular fluidically, behind the drive unit, preferably as viewed from the intake opening. In particular, the conveying element is realized as part of the drive unit.

Preferably, the conveying unit is designed to convey the sub-stream and the other sub-stream out of the power tool, or the housing unit, each through differently realized and/or spaced outlet openings of the fluid cooling unit.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is furthermore proposed that the separating unit comprise at least one separating element, in particular a further separating element, that is arranged within a channel element, in particular a further channel element, in particular a main channel element, of the fluid cooling unit, and that is designed to conduct the fluid stream onto a circular path, for the purpose of dividing the sub-streams, as viewed along the channel element, in particular the further channel element. An advantageously compact design of the separating unit becomes possible, in particular since the further separating element can be arranged in the further channel element. It becomes possible to achieve advantageously little settling of foreign bodies, in particular because the further channel element can be realized with a flat inner wall.

Advantageously simple and inexpensive separation of the fluid stream into the sub-streams can be achieved.

It is conceivable for the conveying element arranged between the intake opening and the drive unit to be arranged between the separating unit and the drive unit, or between the intake opening and the separating unit. In particular, the conveying element arranged between the intake opening and the drive unit is designed to convey the sub-stream and/or the other sub-stream through the fluid cooling unit, through the separating unit and/or out of the power tool, or the housing unit. Alternatively or additionally, it is conceivable for the conveying unit to comprise at least one, in particular the aforementioned or a further, conveying element, which is realized as a spiral wheel. Preferably, the conveying element realized as a spiral wheel is realized as part of the separation unit. In particular, the conveying element realized as a spiral wheel is designed to divide the fluid stream into the sub-streams, in particular the sub-stream being at a greater radial distance from the drive axis than the other sub-stream. Preferably, a separating element of the separating unit and/or the fluid cooling unit are/is realized in such a manner that the sub-stream and the other sub-stream are conducted separately from one another after exiting the conveying element realized as a spiral wheel, or a conveying region of the conveying element realized as a spiral wheel. For example, the separating element is realized as a funnel, in particular the other sub-stream being conducted along a central axis of the funnel that in particular is coaxial with the drive axis of the conveying element, and the sub-stream being guided along an outer wall of the separating element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is also proposed that the separating unit and/or the fluid cooling unit comprise at least one filter element that is designed to alter, in particular to reduce, the foreign body density of the fluid stream.

It becomes possible to achieve an advantageously low foreign body density of the sub-stream used to cool the drive unit. It becomes possible to achieve an advantageously low degree of fouling, or deposition of foreign bodies, within the housing unit, the separating unit and/or the fluid cooling unit. In particular, the filter element is arranged, in particular directly, at the intake opening of the fluid cooling unit. Preferably, the filter element, in particular a filter surface of the filter element, is arranged at least partially transversely or at least substantially perpendicularly to a direction of flow of the fluid stream. Preferably, the filter surface spans, with the direction of flow of the fluid stream, in a region of the filter element, or of the intake opening, an angle having a value from a value range of, in particular, 8&#xb0; to 82&#xb0;, preferably 10&#xb0; to 50&#xb0; and particularly preferably 15&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;. In a preferred design, the filter element is at least partially, in particular at least largely, cone-shaped.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is further proposed that the fluid cooling unit comprise at least one main channel element, in particular the aforementioned, for conducting the fluid stream, which is arranged in front of the drive unit as viewed along a direction of main extent of the fluid cooling unit, wherein the conveying element is arranged within the main channel element and/or within a region of the fluid cooling unit delimited by the main channel element. An advantageously simple and inexpensive design becomes possible, in particular since the conveying unit in the main channel element can be used centrally for conveying the entire fluid stream, and/or since all components influencing the fluid stream, such as, for example, the filter element and/or the separator unit, can be advantageously realized as a single piece. It becomes possible to achieve advantageously effective cooling of the drive unit and/or of the other components of the power tool that are arranged in front of the drive unit, on the main channel element, as viewed along the direction of main extent of the fluid cooling unit.
