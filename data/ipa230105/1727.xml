An image to be infused is printed on a paper (or any type of sheet) using sublimation dyes (contained in the sublimation inks) and the printed paper is pressed against a substrate (generally a thermoplastic material) under heat. The heat causes the dyes to sublimate from a solid state on the printed paper to a gaseous state to travel into the substrate, where the dyes are deposited as solids. This sublimation process therefore infuses the image from the printed paper into the substrate. As the infused image is embedded into the substrate rather than applied at a topical level, the image may not chip, fade, or delaminate like capped and printed images.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dye sublimation apparatus has a heating surface to generate the heat for sublimating the dyes. The heating surface includes one or more zones, each zone containing multiple heaters with a linked control. Therefore, all the heaters in a zone are controlled as a combined unit. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a conventional heater arrangement <b>100</b> on a heating surface of a conventional dye sublimation apparatus. As shown, the heater arrangement <b>100</b> include heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>n </i>arranged into six zones <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>c</i>, <b>104</b><i>d</i>, <b>104</b><i>e</i>, <b>104</b><i>f</i>. Heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>may therefore have a linked control because all these heaters are in the same zone <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Even within the same zone <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the heaters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>can merely be turned OFF and ON collectively. A controller controlling the heat generated from each of the zones <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<b>104</b><i>f </i>may utilize the temperature reading from a thermocouple <b>106</b> for control the amount of heat from the zones <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<b>104</b><i>f </i>by turning the corresponding zone OFF or ON.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows another example of conventional heater arrangement <b>200</b> containing multiple heaters arranged in multiple zones <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n</i>. A controller may use temperature readings from a thermocouple <b>204</b> to control the heat generated by each of the zone <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n </i>by turning a corresponding zone OFF or ON. However, such linked control causes the heating arrangement <b>200</b> to generate an uneven temperature distribution. For example, zone <b>202</b><i>a </i>may be generate heat at 640&#xb0; F. and zone <b>202</b><i>b </i>may generate heat at 630&#xb0; F. The unevenness of temperature may be due to the fact that the heaters, although identical, may not generate the same amount of heat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The uneven temperature distribution produced by conventional heater arrangements may generate an uneven infused image into the substrate. A larger amount of dyes may sublimate and deposit at zones with higher temperature compared to the zones with lower temperatures where a smaller amount of dyes may sublimate and deposit. The quality of the infused image may therefore suffer because of the unevenness of the temperature. In other words, the conventional heater arrangement may generate a substrate containing an infused image with dark areas with more dyes and light areas with less dyes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is therefore desired is an improvement upon the heaters for dye sublimation. Embodiments described herein attempt to solve the aforementioned technical problems, such as uneven temperature distribution, and may provide other solutions as well. An illustrative dye sublimation apparatus may include a heating surface that may have multiple zones. Each zone may include one or more individually (or independently) controlled heaters. A controller may control the heater to generate a range of heat and not merely turn the heater ON and OFF. Therefore, one or more controllers may individually regulate heat from corresponding heaters in the zones thereby maintaining a constant and nearly constant temperature throughout the bed of the dye sublimation apparatus in the heating surface. Furthermore, one or more controllers may maintain a first range of temperatures during a first state of a dye sublimation process and a second range of temperatures during a second stage of the dye sublimation process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a dye sublimation apparatus for infusing an image on a printed sheet to a substrate comprises a heating surface comprising a plurality of zones, wherein the heating surface is configured to radiate heat on the printed sheet to sublimate one or more dyes forming the image, such that the one or more dyes travel into the substrate in a gaseous state and deposit into the substrate in a solid state to infuse the image into the substrate; and one or more controllers configured to individually regulate heat from each of the plurality of zones, wherein each of the plurality of zones comprises an individually regulated heater.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a method for infusing an image on a printed sheet to a substrate through dye sublimation comprises heating, by a plurality of heaters on a heating surface of a dye sublimation apparatus, the printed sheet to sublimate one or more dyes forming the image, such that the one or more dyes travel into the substrate in a gaseous state and deposit into the substrate in a solid state to infuse the image into the substrate, the heating surface comprising a plurality of zones wherein each of the plurality of zones comprises a heater; and regulating, by one or more controllers of the dye sublimation apparatus, heat from each of the plurality of zones.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the disclosed embodiment and subject matter as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The accompanying drawings constitute a part of this specification and illustrate embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a first example of a conventional heating arrangement of a conventional dye sublimation apparatus;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a second example of a conventional heating arrangement of a conventional dye sublimation apparatus;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a dye sublimation machine, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a system for printing a paper with an image for dye sublimation, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative heater configuration on a heating surface of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an illustrative heater configuration on a heating surface of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating component of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an illustrative heating component of a dye sublimation apparatus, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of an illustrative method for dye sublimation, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made to the illustrative embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used here to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the claims or this disclosure is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the subject matter illustrated herein, which would occur to one ordinarily skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein. The present disclosure is here described in detail with reference to embodiments illustrated in the drawings, which form a part here.

The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description are not meant to be limiting of the subject matter presented here.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments disclosed herein describe systems and methods for generating and controlling heat from a heating surface of a dye sublimation apparatus. The heating surface may include a heater configuration having a plurality of heaters (e.g., electrical heaters). The heating surface may be divided into individually (or independently) controlled zones, each zone containing at least one heater. One or more controllers may regulate the heat generated from each zone. A temperature sensor such as a thermocouple may provide a temperature feedback to the one or more controllers for regulating the heat. The controllers may regulate the heat from each zone and consequently cause each heater to maintain a constant or near constant bed temperature within the heating surface of the dye sublimation apparatus to generate a uniform quality infused image. In some embodiments, the controllers may cause (or instruct) the heaters to maintain a first bed temperature at a first stage of the dye sublimation process and a second bed temperature at a second stage of the dye sublimation process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should however be understood that the several configurations of the heating surface described throughout this disclosure are for illustration only and should not be considered limiting.

It should be understood that the dye sublimation machine <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and described herein is merely for illustration and explanation and machines with other form factors and components should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure. For example, dye sublimation machines having additional, alternative, or a fewer number of components than the illustrative dye sublimation machine <b>300</b> should be included within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The dye sublimation machine <b>300</b> may comprise a sublimation table <b>302</b>, which may provide structural support for the components of the dye sublimation machine <b>300</b>. The dye sublimation machine <b>300</b> and/or the sublimation table <b>302</b> may be divided into three zones: a loading component (also referred to as a loading zone) <b>304</b>, a heating component <b>306</b>, and a cooling component (also referred to as a cooling zone) <b>308</b>. The loading zone <b>304</b> may allow a worker (or a user) to load a printed sheet <b>318</b> and a substrate <b>324</b>. The printed sheet <b>318</b> may have an image printed thereon using sublimation inks containing sublimation dyes. The substrate <b>324</b> may be of any type of material such as thermoplastic where the image may be infused through the dye sublimation process. The combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b> may be loaded onto a bed <b>314</b> at the loading zone <b>304</b>. The bed <b>314</b> may be formed by a graphite honeycomb structure. The bed <b>314</b> may be configured as a conveyer belt that moves through the loading zone <b>304</b>, the heating zone <b>306</b>, and the cooling zone <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The heating component <b>306</b> includes a heating surface having a plurality of heating elements <b>310</b>, and the heating surface may be in an enclosure or on a portion of the dye sublimation machine <b>300</b>. The heating elements <b>310</b> may include heating coils in any type of configuration. The heating elements <b>310</b> may be electrically heated providing a radiative type heating to the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b>. For example, the heating elements <b>310</b> may be included in multiple electrical heaters, each heating a portion of the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate. The heating component <b>306</b> may also include a temperature sensor <b>320</b> (e.g., a thermocouple) to measure the temperature of the heat generated by the heating elements <b>310</b>. The heating elements <b>310</b> may be within individual heaters that may be individually controlled by one or more controllers. For example, a controller associated with a heater may receive a temperature measurement from the temperature sensor <b>320</b> and determine the amount of heat to be radiated by the heater. The heating elements <b>310</b> may also be divided into a plurality of zones, each zone containing a single heater. Therefore, a corresponding controller may individually control the heat output of each zone to maintain a consistent temperature at the bed <b>314</b> within the heating component <b>306</b>. Within the heating component <b>306</b>, a membrane <b>316</b> may cover the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b>.

However, it should be understood that the cooling zone <b>308</b> may not necessarily include the cooling elements <b>312</b> and the substrate <b>324</b> may cool down to ambient temperature without the aid of the cooling elements <b>312</b>. It should also be understood that the loading zone <b>304</b> and the cooling zone <b>308</b> may be combined in some embodiments. In these embodiments, the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b> may be placed on the combined zone providing both loading and cooling functionality, be moved to the heating component <b>306</b>, and moved back to the combined zone for cooling. Therefore, it should generally be understood that the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is merely illustrative and alternative configurations should also be considered within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an illustrative operation, a worker may place the substrate <b>324</b> on the loading zone <b>304</b> and place the printed sheet <b>318</b> directly on the substrate <b>324</b>.

The heating component <b>306</b> may be a covered area within the dye sublimation machine <b>300</b>. Within the heating component <b>306</b>, the vacuum pump <b>322</b> may pull a vacuum between the membrane <b>316</b> and the bed <b>314</b> such that the membrane <b>316</b> presses down on the printed sheet <b>318</b>. The heating elements <b>310</b> may generate a requisite amount of heat to sublimate the ink on the printed sheet <b>318</b>. The sublimated ink may then be deposited into the substrate <b>324</b>. The temperature sensor <b>320</b> may measure the temperature within the enclosure created by the membrane <b>316</b> and the bed <b>314</b> and the temperature measurement may be used by the heating elements to regulate the generated heat. After the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b> are left in the heating component <b>306</b> for a requisite amount of time (e.g., based upon the properties of the substrate <b>324</b>), the combination of the printed sheet <b>318</b> and the substrate <b>324</b> is moved to the cooling zone.

For the heating part of the dye sublimation process, the dye sublimation apparatus <b>402</b> may include a heating component <b>410</b>. The heating component may generally be enclosed for temperature control and to preempt the heat escaping the dye sublimation apparatus <b>402</b>. The heating component <b>410</b> may include a heating surface having heaters <b>412</b>, which may be organized into different zones with each zone containing at least one heater.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heaters <b>412</b> may be controller by a controller <b>408</b>. The single controller <b>408</b> is shown merely for illustration and there may be a plurality of controllers <b>408</b> controlling the heaters <b>412</b>. More particularly, the controller <b>408</b> may regulate the heat generated by each zone (containing at least one heater) individually. For example, the controller <b>408</b> may increase the heat, decrease the heat, turn ON, or turn OFF the heat generated by a zone by controlling the corresponding heater. The controller <b>408</b> may be any kind of hardware and/or software controller, including, but not limited to PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller and/or any other type of controller. The controller <b>408</b> may continuously receive a feedback from the items being heated (e.g., printed sheet, substrate) through a connection <b>414</b>. The connection <b>414</b> may be wired, e.g., a thermocouple providing the feedback to the controller <b>408</b>, or wireless, e.g., a wireless temperature sensor wirelessly providing the feedback to the controller <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to the controller <b>408</b>, the heaters <b>412</b> may be controlled based upon instructions provided by a computing device <b>406</b>.

Alternatively or additionally, the computing device <b>406</b> may provide the instruction to maintain the temperature to the controller <b>408</b>. In some embodiments, the computing device <b>406</b> may provide instructions to the array of heaters <b>412</b> to maintain a first temperature at a first stage of the dye sublimation process and to maintain a second temperature at a second stage of the dye sublimation process. It should be understood that the instructions to maintain the temperature and the process of maintaining the temperature may be maintained either in hardware, e.g., through the controller <b>408</b>, or as a combination of hardware and software, e.g., through one or more applications in the computing device <b>406</b>, the controller <b>408</b>, and/or other hardware components in the dye sublimation apparatus. In some embodiments, the controller <b>408</b> may sequentially activate the heaters in the array of heaters <b>412</b>. For example, the dye sublimation process may require a gradual ramping up of the heat and therefore the sequential activation may allow heat to build up to a desired temperature. As another example, activating the heaters at the periphery of the heating component <b>410</b> first may allow a controller to determine an amount of heat (generally lesser than the heaters at the periphery) to be generated by heaters at the center of the heating surface <b>410</b> to maintain a desired temperature within the heating component <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The computing devices <b>406</b> may include any type processor-based device that may provide one or more instructions (e.g., instructions to maintain a desired temperature) to the dye sublimation apparatus <b>402</b> through the network <b>404</b>.

At minimum, each computing device <b>406</b> may include a processor and non-transitory storage medium that is electrically connected to the processor. The non-transitory storage medium may store a plurality of computer program instructions (e.g., operating system, applications) and the processor may execute the plurality of computer program instructions to implement the functionality of the computing device <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The network <b>404</b> may be any kind of local or remote network that may provide a communication medium between the computing devices <b>406</b> and the dye sublimation apparatus <b>402</b>. For example, the network <b>404</b> may be a local area network (LAN), a desktop area network (DAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN). However, it should be understood that aforementioned types of networks are merely illustrative and any type of component providing the communication medium between the computing devices <b>406</b> and the dye sublimation apparatus <b>402</b> should be considered within the scope this disclosure.

The heaters <b>502</b> on a surface <b>510</b> may be divided into zones, wherein each zone may contain a single heater <b>502</b>. Each zone and therefore the corresponding heater <b>502</b> may be controlled individually by a controller <b>506</b>. The heaters <b>502</b> may be any kind of heater such as an electrical heater or an electrochemical heater. If they are electrical heaters, each of the heaters <b>502</b> may comprise a heating filament that may covert electrical energy to heat energy. The heat energy generated by the heating filament may be based upon the amount of electricity flowing through the heating filament. Therefore, the controller <b>506</b> may control the amount of the electricity flowing through the corresponding filament of each of the heaters <b>502</b> to regulate the overall heat generated by the heater configuration <b>500</b>.

For example, the controller <b>506</b> may be a hardware controller such as a PID controller. As an alternative or an addition, the controller <b>506</b> may be a software controller including one or more software modules that may receive instructions from other devices or an interface within the dye sublimation apparatus itself and control the heaters <b>502</b> based upon the received instructions. For example, a computing device connected to the dye sublimation apparatus may render an interface for a user to enter a desired temperature for a particular image to be infused into a substrate and the controller <b>506</b> may accordingly control the heaters <b>502</b> based upon the desired temperature. In some embodiments, the image infusion process through dye sublimation may include multiple stages with varying temperatures. In these embodiments, the controller <b>506</b> may control the heaters <b>502</b> to maintain a first temperature at a first stage and to maintain a second temperature at the second stage. For example, the image infusion process may require a lower temperature during an initial stage and require a higher temperature for a later stage. In some instances, the controller <b>506</b> may cause the heaters <b>502</b> near the center of the heater configuration <b>500</b> (e.g., heaters <b>502</b><i>o</i>, <b>502</b><i>p</i>, <b>502</b><i>u</i>, <b>502</b><i>v</i>) to operate at a lower temperature than the heaters <b>502</b> near the periphery of the heater configuration <b>500</b> (e.g., heaters <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>f</i>, <b>502</b><i>ae</i>, <b>502</b><i>aj</i>). To maintain a constant temperature within the heating zone, the heaters <b>502</b> near the center of the heater configuration <b>500</b> may have to generate a lesser amount of heat than the heaters <b>502</b> near the periphery of the heater configuration <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>506</b> may regulate the heaters <b>502</b> based upon temperature measurements made by a temperature sensor <b>504</b>. The temperature sensor <b>504</b> may be a thermocouple, for example. It should be understood that the temperature sensor <b>504</b> may not be within the heater configuration <b>500</b> itself and may be on the bed of the dye sublimation apparatus.

A controller <b>606</b>, which may be a hardware and/or software controller, may individually regulate the heat generated by each of the heaters <b>602</b>. The heaters <b>602</b> may be electric heaters and the amount of heat generated by each heater may be based upon the electrical current flowing through the corresponding heating element.

As described above, the center of the heater configuration <b>600</b> has a higher concentration of heaters <b>602</b> than the periphery of the heater configuration <b>600</b>. A lower number of heaters <b>602</b> (therefore a lower number of zones) may be sufficient to maintain a desired temperature at the center of the heater configuration <b>600</b> compared to the periphery. For example, heat generated by the heaters <b>602</b> near the periphery of the heater configuration <b>600</b> may radiate to the center of the heater configuration <b>600</b> while the heat generated by the heaters <b>602</b> near the center may not necessarily radiate to the periphery. Furthermore, the periphery of the heater configuration <b>600</b> may include heat sinks or other components that may operate as heat sinks. Therefore, a large number or a large concentration of heaters may be desired at the periphery and a fewer number of heaters and a small concentration of heaters may be desired at the center.

The printed sheet <b>712</b> may include an image printed with sublimation ink containing sublimation dyes. The sublimation dyes may change into gaseous form when heated by the heaters <b>702</b> and travel into the substrate <b>714</b>. The dyes may then get deposited as solids into the substrate <b>714</b> thereby infusing the image into the substrate <b>714</b>. The bed <b>716</b> may be a conveyer belt that may move the combination of the printed sheet <b>712</b> and the substrate <b>714</b> into the heating component <b>700</b> and out of the heating component <b>700</b> for cooling.
