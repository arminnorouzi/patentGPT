The assemblies are typically attached to power ends run by engines. The power ends reciprocate plungers within the assemblies to pump fluid throughout the fluid end. Fluid may be pumped through the fluid end at pressures that range from 5,000-15,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Fluid used in high pressure hydraulic fracturing operations is typically pumped through the fluid end at a minimum of 8,000 psi; however, fluid will normally be pumped through the fluid end at pressures around 10,000-15,000 psi during such operations.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a fluid end assembly <b>10</b> comprising a housing <b>12</b> having an external surface <b>14</b> and an internal chamber <b>16</b> is shown. A first conduit <b>18</b> and a second conduit <b>20</b> are formed within the housing <b>12</b>. The conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> intersect each other to form the internal chamber <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the diameter of the conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> may vary throughout the housing <b>12</b>. This allows the conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> to closely receive structures of different sizes described later herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first conduit <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has aligned first and second sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and the second conduit <b>20</b> has aligned third and fourth sections <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Each section <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> independently connects the internal chamber <b>16</b> and the external surface <b>14</b>. The sections <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> are aligned such that the conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are orthogonal to one another. However, the sections <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> may also be aligned so they intersect the internal chamber <b>16</b> at a non-straight angle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the second conduit <b>20</b> may only comprise a third section <b>26</b>, meaning the second conduit <b>20</b> only has one opening on the external surface <b>14</b>. The fourth section <b>28</b> is not required for operation of the fluid end <b>10</b>. The fourth section <b>28</b> is typically machined in the housing <b>12</b> for ease of creating the second conduit <b>20</b> and to provide an opening to service parts within the housing <b>12</b>, if needed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second section <b>24</b> has an intake opening <b>68</b>. The intake opening <b>68</b> may be secured to a piping system that delivers fluid to the fluid end <b>10</b>. A set of valves <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are positioned within the first conduit <b>18</b>. The valves <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> help move fluid within the housing <b>12</b>. An intake valve <b>72</b> prevents fluid from flowing back through the intake opening <b>68</b> after entering the housing <b>12</b>. A discharge valve <b>70</b> allows fluid to exit the fluid end <b>10</b> through a discharge opening <b>74</b> positioned proximate a top end <b>76</b> of the fluid end <b>10</b>. Each of the valves <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may also have a seal <b>78</b> positioned around its outer surface to block fluid from leaking around the valves <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the housing <b>12</b> may have a plurality of first and second conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> positioned adjacent one another. Each first conduit <b>18</b> may have an intake opening <b>68</b> formed in its second section <b>24</b>. The intake openings <b>68</b> may each be connected to a different coupler or pipe that leads to the same piping system (not shown). This allows fluid to enter the fluid end <b>10</b> through multiple openings. In contrast, only one discharge opening <b>74</b> may be formed in the housing <b>12</b>. Each first section <b>22</b> of the first conduits <b>18</b> may be connected to the discharge opening <b>74</b>. This allows fluid to exit the housing <b>12</b> through a single opening.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A second discharge opening (not shown) may also be formed in the housing <b>12</b> that is in fluid communication with the discharge opening <b>74</b>. This allows fluid to exit the housing <b>12</b> through two openings. Additional discharge openings may also be formed in the housing <b>12</b>, if needed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of closure elements <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> are shown positioned within the first, third, and fourth sections <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. The closure element positioned within the first section <b>22</b> is a discharge cover or discharge plug <b>30</b>, and the closure element positioned within the fourth section <b>28</b> is a suction cover or suction plug <b>32</b>. The covers <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are substantially identical. Each cover <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is sized to fully block fluid flow within the section <b>22</b> or <b>28</b> it is situated in. The covers <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are retained within each section <b>22</b> or <b>28</b> by a retaining nut <b>36</b> that threads into each section <b>22</b> and <b>28</b> proximate the external surface <b>14</b> of the housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The closure element positioned within the third section <b>26</b> is a sleeve <b>34</b>. The sleeve <b>34</b> is tubular and sized to be closely received within the third section <b>26</b>. The sleeve <b>34</b> is retained within the third section <b>26</b> by a tubular retaining nut <b>40</b>. The retaining nut <b>40</b> threads into the third section <b>26</b> proximate the external surface <b>14</b> of the housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A plunger <b>42</b> is shown disposed within the sleeve <b>34</b> and the retaining nut <b>40</b>. During operation, the plunger <b>42</b> reciprocates within the housing <b>12</b> to pump fluid throughout the fluid end <b>10</b>. The plunger <b>42</b> is powered by a power end run by an engine (not shown) that is connected to a first end <b>44</b> of the plunger <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the closure elements <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> has a seal <b>46</b> positioned around its outer surface to block fluid from leaking from the sections <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, or <b>28</b>. The seals <b>46</b> block the flow of fluid by tightly engaging an inner surface or sealing surface <b>48</b> of conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Fluid end assemblies <b>10</b> are susceptible to corrosive and/or abrasive fluid becoming trapped between the seal <b>46</b> and the sealing surface <b>48</b>. This may cause the sealing surfaces <b>48</b> to erode over time and prevent the seals <b>46</b> from tightly engaging the sealing surfaces <b>48</b>. Fluid may leak from the sections <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> if the seals <b>46</b> cannot effectively seal against the sealing surfaces <b>48</b>. If fluid leaks from the fluid end <b>10</b>, the housing <b>12</b> will likely need to be replaced, because it may no longer maintain the requisite fluid pressure for operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention is directed to a system including one or more closure elements <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> that permit the seal <b>46</b> to be relocated within the conduits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> over time. Relocating the seal <b>46</b> also relocates the sealing surface <b>48</b>. Thus, if the original sealing surface <b>48</b> suffers erosion, the seal <b>46</b> can be moved to engage with a different sealing surface <b>48</b> in the conduits <b>18</b> or <b>20</b>. Such relocation will help extend the life of the fluid end housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first embodiment of the closure element <b>100</b> is shown.
