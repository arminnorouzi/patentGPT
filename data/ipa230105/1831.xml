No. 63/215,069, filed Jun. 25, 2021, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a child restraint, and particularly to a child restraint configured to be secured to a vehicle seat within a vehicle. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a child restraint that is configured to reduce undesirable forces acting on a child in the child restraint during operation of vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the present disclosure, a child restraint includes a seat bottom and a seat back coupled to the seat bottom. The seat back includes a backrest configured to extend upwardly from the seat bottom and a headrest coupled to the backrest for supporting a head of a child. The headrest includes a rear section arranged along a forward-facing surface of the backrest, a first side section extending outwardly away from the rear section, and a second side section extending outwardly away from the rear section and away from the first side section.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In illustrative embodiments, the child restraint further includes energy-redirection means coupled to the first and second side sections. The energy-redirection means redirect at least a portion of a cumulative force from the head of the child during an impact event into at least a first force extending into one of the first and second side sections and a second force extending outwardly away from the rear section of the headrest so that the head of the child does not experience the cumulative force when impacting the one of the first and second side sections. The first and second forces are each less than the cumulative force as a result of the head of child impacting the energy-redirection means.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In illustrative embodiments, the energy-redirection means includes at least one energy-redirection layer that is coupled to both the first side section and the second side section. The energy redirection layer has an outer, energy-redirection surface that faces toward the head of the child. The energy-redirection surface may be convexly-shaped relative to the head of the child. During a lateral impact event, the energy-redirection layer causes the head of the child to roll across the energy-redirection surface and to maintain contact with the energy-redirection surface for a longer period of time and/or distance during the lateral impact event. This disperses forces acting on the head of the child over a greater area and longer period of time thereby reducing the potential for a cumulative force that may injure the child.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of illustrative embodiments exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the disclosure as presently perceived.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The detailed description particularly refers to the accompanying figures in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a child restraint, in accordance with the present disclosure, including a seat bottom and a seat back coupled to the seat bottom, the seat back including a backrest and a headrest, and showing that the headrest includes a rear section and left and right side sections, each side section including a support base, a comfort layer, and an energy-redirection layer or insert that may be added to the headrest to increase side impact force dampening by providing energy-redirection means for a head of a child during a collision event;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the headrest shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> without the energy-redirection layer and suggesting that a side impact experienced by the child may result in a cumulative lateral force on the side wing of the headrest;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the headrest shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the energy-redirection layer installed on the headrest and suggesting that the energy-redirection layer is configured to redirect or separate forces imparted on the side wing by the child's head into at least a first force extending laterally into the side section of the headrest and a second force extending outwardly away from the rear section of the headrest so that the child does not experience the cumulative force when impacting the side section;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of one of the energy-redirection layers showing that the energy-redirection layer includes a convex outer surface configured to support the head of the child during the lateral collision event, a rear surface configured to interface with one of the side sections of the headrest, and a chamfered surface configured to interface with the rear section of the headrest;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a rear view of the energy-redirection layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the energy-redirection layer taken along line 6-6 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> showing that the energy-redirection layer has a thickness that decreases from an upper end of the energy-redirection layer to a lower end of the energy-redirection layer;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the energy-redirection layer taken along line 7-7 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> showing the shape of the energy-redirection layer that provides the convex outer surface, the rear surface, and the chamfered surface;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the headrest from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> showing the support layer, the comfort layer, and the energy-redirection inserts interfacing with one another;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of another headrest, in accordance with the present disclosure, including a support layer and a one-piece, energy-redirection insert that provides both comfort and energy-redirection means for the head of a child;

The seat back <b>14</b> includes a backrest <b>18</b> coupled to the seat bottom <b>12</b> and arranged to extend upwardly from the seat bottom <b>12</b> and the headrest <b>20</b> coupled to the backrest for supporting a head of the child.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The headrest <b>20</b> may include a rear section <b>22</b> coupled to the backrest <b>18</b>, a first side section or wing <b>24</b> extending outwardly away from the rear section <b>22</b>, and a second side section or wing <b>26</b> extending outwardly away from the rear section <b>22</b> and away from the first side section <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the headrest <b>20</b> is movable relative to the backrest <b>18</b>.

The support layer <b>30</b> is illustratively a polymeric panel arranged between the backrest <b>18</b> and the comfort layer <b>32</b>. The comfort layer <b>32</b> is, for example, a foam layer that is configured to provide cushioning for the head of a child. The support layer <b>30</b> and the comfort layer <b>32</b> establish an outer contour <b>40</b> of each side section <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> that may interact with the head of a child during a collision event to absorb energy from the head of a child when the headrest does not include the energy-redirection layer <b>34</b>.
