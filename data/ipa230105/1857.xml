More specifically, it relates to an off-road vehicle utility rack apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Off-road vehicles are vehicles used on dirt roads, trails, forests, farms and other non-paved surfaces. Off road vehicles include All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) and Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) is includes a motorized off-highway vehicle designed to travel on four low-pressure or non-pneumatic tires. One type of ATV includes a single seat designed to be straddled by an operator and handlebars for steering control.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">ATVs with side-by-side seating are called utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) or side-by-sides to distinguish the classes of vehicle. UTVs have two or more seats and a steering wheel for steering control.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Both ATV's and UTV's typically have cargo areas on a back end of the vehicle. The cargo areas are used to store personal items, maintenance items, fuel cans, spare tires, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are several problems with off-road vehicles. One problem is that off road vehicles are used in remote areas, fuel consumption must be carefully monitored as there are no gas stations or re-fueling stations to purchase fuel. On long trips, users of off-road have to car fuel cans which are difficult to carry safely.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem with off-road vehicles is that many off-road vehicles do not have a spare tire. If the off-road vehicle gets a flat tire, then the off-read vehicle may become stranded.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another problem with off-road vehicles is that some off-road vehicles have a spare tire holder that is either attached to a back-end or a roof of the off-road vehicle. Such spare tire holders are statically attached to the off-road vehicle and interfere with access to cargo areas on the off-road vehicles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There have been some attempts to solve some of the problems associated with off-road vehicles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,293,681, that issued to Wills teaches &#x201c;A rack designed to provide convenient storage of doors optionally removable from &#x201c;JEEP&#x201d; style Sport Utility Vehicles. This allows a driver to operate the vehicle with the doors removed and thus free up interior space. The rack is mounted on the rear of the vehicle exteriorly of the rear-mounted spare tire. Mounted securely in the rack, the doors are spaced from the spare tire and are prevented from rubbing each other and the spare tire. The doors are therefore protected from scratches and abrasions.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 9,623,807, that issued to Singleton teaches A carrying system for a SUV hardtop, which includes a carrier that allows the hardtop and doors to be detached from the vehicle but still kept with the vehicle while removed. The carrying system allows for easy attachment and securing of the hardtop and doors to the carrier. In some exemplary embodiments, the carrier attaches to the hitch and to the rear-mounted spare tire carrier of the SUV. In other exemplary embodiments, the carrier attaches to the vehicle only at the hitch. Conveying the doors and hardtop with the SUV allows the SUV, at any time and in any place, to be converted quickly between convertible and non-convertible modes, depending on weather conditions and other factors.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Published Patent Application number US2020/0130600, published by Morgan, et al. teaches &#x201c;A cargo and storage rack for increasing the carrying capacity of a vehicle having a spare tire mount on the exterior of the vehicle. Retaining features of a mounting boss engage the detainment features of the spare tire to the spare tire mount. The mounting boss is adapted to receive storage brackets above or below or both of above and below the mounting boss, to secure cargo securing features at desired distances of engagement from the boss. Rails of any bracket secured to the boss provide support for alternately translating and selectably locatable cargo supporting features, such that the rack can secure cargo without a bracket that provides its own securing features. Optionally, the rack can support cargo with any combination of selectably locatable cargo supporting features on the rails and a bracket, and the rack comprises methods of construction and customization that facilitate rapid reconstruction of the rack and removal from the vehicle.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Published Patent Application number US2011/0133438, published by Haines teaches &#x201c;A rack for an all-terrain vehicle is disclosed. The rack is attached to the roll cage of the all-terrain vehicle as well as a frame of the all-terrain vehicle. In particular, the rack may have one or more parts that permit movement of the rack to mitigate failure as the all-terrain vehicle traverses over uneven terrain.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, these solutions still do not solve all of the problems associated with off-road vehicles. Thus, it is desirable to solve some of the problems associated with off-road vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, some of the problems associated with off-road vehicles are overcome.
