and such that an attempt to fold or curve such rigid PV unit by applying mechanical force(s) to it would typically cause breaking or damaging of such rigid PV unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, a second electricity-generating PV unit is flexible and/or non-planar; such that it may change its spatial structure, or may be bent or folded or rolled, or may become curved or partially-curved or non-planar or angular or partially-angular, in response to application of mechanical force(s); without such mechanical force(s) causing it to break or damaging it (e.g., at least while such mechanical force(s) are within a pre-defined range of forces that may be safely applied to the PV unit in order to safely modify its shape or structure or curvature without damaging it).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Applicants have realized that such rigid and planar PV unit, while not being able to be bent or folded, typically has the highest efficiency in converting light or sunlight into electricity; relative to a curved or a non-planar PV unit, or relative to a flexible or non-rigid PV unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The Applicants have realized that it may be beneficial to provide a combined or hybrid PV device or PV article or PV unit; which includes, for example: (i) a first segment, which is a first electricity-generating PV segment that is planar and/or rigid; connected mechanically and/or electrically to a second segment, which is a second electricity-generating PV segment that is flexible and/or non-planar and/or curved and/or angular; wherein the first electricity-generating PV segment and the second electricity-generating PV segment are encapsulated and/or enclosed together within a single encapsulant, or within a single set of multiple encapsulating materials or encapsulation layers or encapsulation coatings; forming a single electricity-generating PV device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each solar segment or PV segment may comprise a semiconductor, such as silicon or other suitable substrate or material(s). For example, the underlying components of a PV segment are solar cells or a plurality of PV cells, formed of relatively large semiconductor wafers (e.g., formed of silicon wafers, or other suitable substrate or material), which may be very brittle (e.g., hard, but might break or shatter easily) and thus require one or more protection layer(s).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The flexibility of a PV segment or PV unit, or the capability for such PV unit or PV segment to take a curved form or a non-planar form or an angular form (or a combination of such forms), may depend on: (i) the flexibility of the particular PV cells from which the entire PV module is composed, and (ii) the composition and/or selection and/or structure of coating layers, encapsulating layers, protective layers, electricity conductive layers (or components), and/or or other functional layers that are utilized in forming the PV unit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some PV units are based upon rigid silicon wafers, which are very brittle and which have a very low level of flexibility; which are mounted on rigid structures that are protected by at least a glass layer as a top protective layer. Some semi-flexible PV units may be based upon one or more types of PV cells that are protected by a polymer-based top-sheet or top-side sheet, and may have a semi-flexible stack of materials or layers which limit the extent to which the PV unit can be bent (or rolled, or folded, or curved, or bent, or bended), mainly in order to protect the underlying PV cells (which are brittle) from breakage. Some fully-flexible PV modules may be based upon one or more relevant technologies, and may include PV cells that are &#x201c;sandwiched&#x201d; between polymeric layers on both sides.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Applicants have realized that conventional PV devices include, exclusively, a single type of PV cells or a single type of PV segments: for example, a first conventional PV device includes, exclusively, only rigid and non-flexible and planar PV segments, forming together an entire conventional PV device that is rigid and planar in its entirety; or, a second conventional PV device includes, exclusively, only flexible and non-planar PV segments, forming together an entire conventional PV device that is flexible and is curved (and/or angular) and non-planar.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The Applicants have realized that there does not exist, and that there is a need for, a combined or hybrid PV device. Accordingly, some embodiments provide a combined or hybrid PV device, which includes, within one encapsulant, or within one set of the same encapsulants, both a rigid PV segment and a flexible PV segment. Additionally or alternatively, some embodiments provide a combined or hybrid PV device that includes, within one encapsulant, or within one set of the same encapsulants, both a rigid and planar PV segment and a flexible and non-planar PV segment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Applicants have realized that the mechanical and/or electrical components (or characteristics) of a rigid and/or planar PV segment or PV unit, may be different from the mechanical and/or electrical components (or characteristics) of a flexible and/or non-planar PV segment or PV unit. The Applicants have realized that it may be beneficial to overcome such possible &#x201c;mismatch&#x201d; in the components or characteristics of PV units, in order to enable the production of a single PV device that includes therein both a rigid PV unit and a flexible PV unit, that are interconnected mechanically and/or electrically, and that are all encapsulated within the same encapsulant and/or within the same set of protective layers or protective encapsulants.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The Applicants have realized that conventional PV units have utilized only a single uniform type of PV cells (e.g., either rigid or flexible, but not both); in order to avoid a mismatch in their electrical characteristics (e.g., current and voltage) along the surface of the PV unit; and/or in order to simplify the production of the conventional PV unit via simple matching of current and/or voltage in serial or parallel interconnections. However, this assumes that the entire surface of the PV unit is experiencing the same illumination conditions (e.g., no shades; no reflections; no different lighting angles across the surface of the PV unit), and the Applicants have realized that this assumption may not necessarily hold true, and thus it may be beneficial to make the additional efforts to combine and connect together PV segments of different types (e.g., a rigid planar PV segment, with a flexible curved PV segment, or with a flexible angular PV segment); thereby producing a combined or hybrid PV device which may be installed or mounted or placed or positioned at particular locations or places (e.g., a roof of a house; a horizontal wall; a vertical wall; a slanted wall; a vehicle; a marine vessel; an aircraft; or the like), to accommodate such non-uniform lighting conditions that may exist, and/or to accommodate non-planar locations or items on which the PV device is mounted.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Applicants have also realized that the electrical characteristics may differ between different types of PV cells, as well as in different lighting conditions; however, the voltage of the electricity that is generated is mainly determined by the type of material from which the PV cell is formed, whereas the electric current is more significantly affected by the actual lighting conditions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The Applicants have realized that rigid PV segments have been used only in rigid and planar PV units or PV devices; and that flexible PV segments have been used only in flexible and non-planar PV units or PV devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The Applicants have also realized that the flexiangbility of flexible PV cells or flexible PV segments, enables to utilize them in the manufacturing of not only a fully-flexibly PV device, but also in the manufacturing of a semi-flexible PV device, and/or in the manufacturing of a PV device that is not necessarily flexible and/or that is not necessarily subject to mechanical forces or bending or rolling or curving or folding; and/or in the manufacturing of a PV device having a non-planar or non-flat structure, or having a curvature, or having one or more curved regions and/or concave regions and/or convex regions and/or angular regions; and flexible PV segments may be used for manufacturing such PV devices, having such non-planar or non-flat structure, instead of using one or more rigid planar PV cells that may fracture and/or break. The Applicants have also realized that the same is also true with regard to PV devices or PV articles which have joints of areas or joints of regions that need to be functionally flexible, but also have other surface areas that remain or stay rigid and are not expected to become curved or angular or non-planar, and/or that are not expected to be subject to folding forces and/or bending forces and/or rolling forces and/or curving forces, and/or are expected to maintain no curvature or a low degree or low level of spatial curvature. The Applicants have realized that the greater the curvature of the PV article, the greater is the degree of flexibility or the level of flexibility of the PV cells that is needed in order to withstand the incorporation of such PV cells into the curved (or angular) non-planar PV article. Therefore, realized the Applicants, flexible PV cells may be suitable for manufacturing PV modules having large curvature or having sharp angles, and rigid PV cells may be less suitable for those purposes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The Applicants have realized that flexible PV cells often exhibit lower efficiency (in electricity generation) relative to that of rigid PV cells; and that curved PV articles or curved PV devices often encounter different lighting conditions at different areas or regions thereof; and that flexible PV devices may exhibit a smaller time-period of efficient performance relative to rigid planar (or flat) PV devices.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some embodiments may combine PV cells or PV segments of different types (e.g., a PV segment that is rigid and planar; a PV segment that is rigid and non-planar; a PV segment that is flexible and curved; a PV segment that is flexible and planar), to form a single, unified, electronic surface PV product or PV device or PV article, which is not flat in its entirety, or which is not entirely flat, or which is not entirely planar.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the combined or hybrid PV device may include multiple PV cells or multiple PV segments, each one of them having a different degree or a different level of flexibility or elasticity or rigidity or rigidness, and all those different PV segments are combined and connected (e.g., mechanically and/or electrically) within the same single PV device, and are all coated by, or encapsulated within, or &#x201c;sandwiched&#x201d; by, the same protective layer(s) and/or the same set of multiple protective layers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some embodiments may utilize, at a particular location or region of the PV device or the PV article, the particular type of PV cell or PV segment having the highest electricity-generating efficiency (and/or the highest cost-effective level of such efficiency), that can still withstand the curvature requirements (e.g., due to a planned installation or an expected mounting of that region of the PV device, onto or adjacent to a curved location or a non-planar location or object), and that can still withstand the mechanical stress that is expected to occur at such location (e.g., during production, and/or during mounting or installation, and/or during the service life of the PV device).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some embodiments may thus enable incorporation of several different types of PV cells or PV segments, in the same single unified PV article or PV device. For example, rigid (and planar) PV cells or PV segments, having high electricity-generating efficiency, would be used at flat regions or flat portions or flat locations of the PV article (e.g., locations or regions that are not expected or intended to undergo bending or folding or rolling or curving); whereas, flexible PV cells or flexible PV segments would be used at other locations or regions or areas of the same PV device which require or which have a spatial curvature (e.g., which would cause rigid PV cells to fracture or to break) or which require some degree of mechanical flexibility in those particular regions of portions of the unified PV device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The PV device is thus divided into areas or locations or regions or portions, each one of them having different electrical and/or mechanical characteristics, taking into account the type of PV cells that can match the intended usage of that particular device-portion or device-region, and/or taking into account the expected lighting conditions that are expected or are estimated with regard to each particular device-portion or device-region.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In such combined or hybrid PV device, for example, a group of PV cells that are expected to produce the same or similar electric currents may be connected to each other in series; whereas, a group of PV cells that are expected to produce the same or similar electric voltages may be connected to each other in parallel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, &#x201c;similar&#x201d; currents or &#x201c;similar&#x201d; voltages may be defined or pre-defined, for example, by using numerical threshold value(s) of similarity; for example, value A may be defined as &#x201c;similar&#x201d; to value B, if (for example) 0.9A&#x3c;B&#x3c;1.1A, or if value A is within 10 percent (or, within N percent, where N is a pre-defined number) more than value B or less than value B. Other suitable ways may be used to define a level of similarity between values, currents, voltages, illumination conditions, efficiency, or other characteristics or parameters.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the difference in voltage and/or current between a first PV cell or a first PV segment, and a second PV cell or a second PV segment, may be overcome or mitigated or alleviated, by selecting in advance an electrical connection in parallel or in series. In other embodiments, a mismatch in current and/or voltage may not necessarily be overcome only by selective grouping of PV cells (or PV segments) in parallel or in series, and local Direct Current to Direct Current (DC/DC) converter(s) may be utilized within the combined or hybrid PV device, optionally with maximum power point tracking capabilities, such converters being connected to each group of PV cells in order to enable matching of current and/or voltage, and/or in order to increase the overall production of electricity at the expense of a more complicated or expensive solution or structure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some embodiments may be particularly suitable or particularly efficient for utilization in a situation where a PV device or a PV article is needed for being mounted on, or placed at or near, a curved object or curves surface, or a non-planar object or non-planar surface, or a mixed-shape or mixed-curvature object; for example, a curved object, a non-planar object, a vehicle, a car, a marine vessel, an aircraft, a drone, an object having patterned surface(s) and/or curved surface(s), car roof, car hood, car bonnet, carbon fiber and/or glass fiber articles, metal objects, metal car roof, carbon or glass fiber roof (or bonnet or hood or other vehicular part), plastic elements, spoilers, aerodynamic add-ons or extensions, a truck, a bus, a Recreational Vehicle (RV), a ship, a boat, a yacht, and/or other vessels; as well as stationary and/or non-mobile objects, for example, a non-planar roof of a house or a business venue, a non-planar storage facility or storage container, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the rigid and/or planar PV segments or PV units, that are utilized in the combined or hybrid PV device, may be formed of crystalline silicon.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the flexible and/or curved and/or angular and/or non-planar PV segments or PV units, that are utilized in the combined or hybrid PV device, may include one or more PV units that are described in patent publication number US 2020/0212238 A1 and/or in patent publication number WO 2020/136653 A1, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety; for example, being a PV unit that is structured, using protrusions or channels or craters that are introduced into the wafer or the substrate, to become shock absorbent and/or more resilient to mechanical forces.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the combined or hybrid PV article comprises one or more composite material(s), which may include, for example, glass and/or carbon fiber and/or other composite materials. Optionally, flexible and/or stretchable and/or elastic polymer(s) may be included in the composite material(s), to provide elasticity and/or flexibility and/or stretching ability to the combined or hybrid PV article or to selected regions thereof.
