Specifically, for example, a semiconductor element is mounted on a sheet-shaped die pad that is arranged in the center of a lead frame, and the semiconductor element is connected, by wire bonding, to a plurality of leads that are arranged around the die pad, for example. Further, in some cases, a semiconductor device may be formed by encapsulating a semiconductor element mounted on a lead frame by resin, such as epoxy resin, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the lead frame as described above, a lead frame that is constructed by bonding a heat sink to a frame member including a plurality of leads without arranging a die pad is known. Specifically, in some cases, a heat sink that has a larger plate thickness than a frame member that is formed of a thin plate made of metal may be bonded in the center of the frame member by, for example, welding, and a semiconductor element may be directly mounted on the heat sink. With this configuration, it is possible to efficiently dissipate heat that is generated by the semiconductor element.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. H08-162590</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. H10-144852</li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0007">However, when the heat sink is bonded to the frame member, there is a problem in that the frame member or the heat sink may be deformed or damaged due to the heat. In other words, when fine components, such as the frame member and the heat sink, are bonded together, in some cases, laser welding may be used, but due to long time application of laser to the frame member and the heat sink to be bonded together, heat may be transmitted even to the vicinity of a bonded portion and thermal deformation or the like may occur. In particular, when laser welding is performed in a portion in which the frame member and the heat sink overlap with each other, laser may be applied so as to penetrate through the frame member that is formed of a thin plate, so that the frame member may be deformed or the heat sink may be damaged in the vicinity of the bonded portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">In contrast, if laser output is suppressed or the laser application time is reduced in order to prevent the deformation and the damage as described above, it becomes difficult to fully weld the frame member and the heat sink together, so that quality of the lead frame and the semiconductor device is reduced.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0009">According to an aspect of an embodiment, a lead frame includes a support portion, a lead and a heat sink.

In this case, by applying an etching mask on only one side surfaces of portions that are formed into the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> of the support bars <b>120</b>, these portions are subjected to half etching and the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> are formed. Further, for example, when the frame member is formed by pressing, it may be possible to form the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> by performing forging using a mold that has a certain shape corresponding to the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> of the support bars <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">After the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> are formed on the support bars <b>120</b>, the plating layers are formed on the central-side end portions of the leads <b>130</b> (Step S<b>103</b>).

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the semiconductor chip <b>210</b> is mounted on the mounting surface <b>150</b><i>a </i>of the heat sink <b>150</b>, and the semiconductor chip <b>210</b> and the support bars <b>120</b> are connected by wire bonding. In other words, the electrode of the semiconductor chip <b>210</b> and the residual portions <b>122</b> of the support bars <b>120</b> are connected by the wires <b>230</b>. It may be possible to provide the plating layers by using the wire bonding of the support bars <b>120</b>. In this manner, the support bars <b>120</b> are connected to the semiconductor chip <b>210</b>, so that the support bars <b>120</b> may be used as leads for ground wiring.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Meanwhile, it may be possible to form a through hole that penetrates through the residual portion <b>122</b> in the support bars <b>120</b>, in addition to forming the thin thickness portions <b>121</b>. If the through hole is formed, it is possible to adopt the through hole as a welding portion, in addition to the thin thickness portions <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref> are diagrams illustrating a configuration of the welding portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>in which a through hole is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of the welding portion <b>120</b><i>a</i>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating a cross section taken along a line III-III in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>, a through hole <b>122</b><i>a </i>that penetrates through the support bar <b>120</b> in a thickness direction is formed in the residual portion <b>122</b> that remains in the center of the support bar <b>120</b> in the width direction. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, the through hole <b>122</b><i>a </i>has a truncated cone shape with a tapered-shape cross section, where an inner surface of the through hole <b>122</b><i>a </i>serves as a welding portion in addition to the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> arranged on the both sides of the residual portion <b>122</b> as indicated by straight arrows in the figure, and the support bars <b>120</b> and the heat sink <b>150</b> are welded together.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">The mounting surface <b>150</b><i>a </i>of the heat sink <b>150</b> is exposed from a bottom surface of the through hole <b>122</b><i>a</i>; therefore, in laser welding at the through hole <b>122</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to fully bond the support bar <b>120</b> and the heat sink <b>150</b> by applying laser to the inner surface of the through hole <b>122</b><i>a </i>for a short time. Therefore, by adopting the thin thickness portions <b>121</b> and the inner surface of the through hole <b>122</b><i>a </i>as the welding portions, it is possible to prevent heat of the laser from being transmitted to the vicinities of the welding portions, so that it is possible to prevent unnecessary deformation and damage due to welding.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">The disclosed technology has been conceived in view of the foregoing situation, and an object of the disclosed technology is to provide a lead frame, a semiconductor device, and a lead frame manufacturing method capable of preventing unnecessary deformation and damage due to welding.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">According to one embodiment of the lead frame, the semiconductor device, and the lead frame manufacturing method disclosed in the present application, it is possible to prevent unnecessary deformation and damage due to welding.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">All examples and conditional language recited herein are intended for pedagogical purposes of aiding the reader in understanding the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor to further the art, and are not to be construed as limitations to such specifically recited examples and conditions, nor does the organization of such examples in the specification relate to a showing of the superiority and inferiority of the invention.
