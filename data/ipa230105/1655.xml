The present invention also relates to an organopolysiloxane-based mold release agent lubricant composition</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The manufacture of a tire mainly comprises three steps, namely the preparation of the semifinished products, the assembly of said products and the curing of the casing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The preparation of the semifinished products consists in producing the components of the casing: rubbers, textile and metal plies, bead wires.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The assembly step consists in superposing the various semifinished products in order to form the tire. The carcass, made up of different internal layers: inner liner rubber, carcass ply, bead wires, and all the rubber plies, is placed on a cylinder having the diameter of the tire: the drum. After forming, the drum giving the carcass its toroidal appearance, the belt plies and the tread band are laid: a green tire, with a non-vulcanized and unformed casing, which is still plastic, is obtained. At the end of the assembly step, the future tire is also called a green outer casing or green casing. Its cohesion is ensured simply by the raw bonding of the products.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Finally, curing makes the tire change from the plastic state to the elastic state by forming sulfur bridges between the elastomer chains: this is vulcanization. The curing process creates the composite structure between the various components of the casing. The mixtures bond together, the plies and the threads intermingle. Vulcanization in a mold is performed in metal presses using the combined action of heat and pressure. The green outer casing or green tire is heated simultaneously on the outside, for example with steam circulating inside the walls of the mold, and on the inside, generally with a hot fluid under pressure contained in a rubber membrane, also called an expandable bladder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The hot fluid, such as hot gas, hot water and/or steam, participates in the heat transfer for the vulcanization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pressure, generally greater than 10 bar, usually between 15 and 25 bar, serves to compress the tire from the inside and to press it against the mold so that it can take on the shape, the sculptures and the markings that have been engraved in said metal mold.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The curing time varies according to the size of the tire, the operating techniques and the mixtures used: it is about 15 minutes for a motor vehicle tire and can be up to 24 hours or more for large tires intended for earthmoving machinery. The vulcanization temperature is generally between 80&#xb0; C. and 220&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This operation causes the rubber mixture to lose its initial plasticity, giving it stable elastic properties.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The casing is then partially cooled in the mold, this cooling sometimes being aided by introducing cold or cooler water into the bladder. The mold is then opened and the bladder is deflated by releasing the pressure of the internal fluid, and the vulcanized tire is removed from the press. This use of vulcanization bladders is well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is acknowledged that appreciable relative movement takes places between the outer contact surface of the bladder and the inner surface of the green casing during the bladder expansion phase prior to complete vulcanization of the casing. Similarly, there is also considerable relative movement between the outer contact surface of the bladder and the inner surface of the molded and vulcanized casing, during deflation of the bladder and removal of the tire.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">If adequate lubrication is not provided between the bladder and the inner surface of the casing, the bladder generally tends to wrinkle, resulting in deformation of the casing in the mold and also excessive wear and roughening of the surface of the bladder itself. The bladder surface also tends to bond to the inner surface of the casing during curing. After the casing is vulcanized, and notably during the final part of the casing vulcanization cycle during which the bladder is deflated, the bladder then remains inseparably bonded to the tire.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This involves demolding two rubber surfaces, namely the inner surface of the vulcanized tire from the outer surface of the bladder and not the outer surface of the vulcanized tire from the inner surface of the metal mold. EP022706 describes an agent for molding rubber objects to be deposited on the outer surface of the rubber blank in contact with the mold.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the bladder must be reusable without further processing for other molding/demolding cycles. For this reason, the outer surface of the bladder or the inner surface of the green or non-vulcanized casing is coated with a suitable lubricant or mold-release agent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Lubrication of the vulcanization bladder may be performed at each molding/demolding cycle, referred to as a single mold release, or after multiple molding/demolding cycles, referred to as multiple demolding. Multiple demolding allows tire manufacturers to improve productivity by reducing the rate of defect occurrence and decreasing the frequency of treatment with said mold-release agent.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Lubrication of the vulcanization bladder used in the forming and vulcanization of green tires may be performed in two different ways.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The expandable rubber bladder used in the vulcanization of green tires is initially coated with a lubricant composition. The lubrication of the bladder is direct.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an alternative, the mold-release agent is applied to the inside of the green tire that will be in contact with the expandable bladder. Next, the green tire is placed inside the press. The mold is closed and the bladder is inflated. The mold-release agent ensures that the bladder is optimally centered inside the tire, which is necessary for producing perfectly symmetrical tires. It also aids in preventing bladder defects such as pinching and wrinkling. When the metal mold is closed and the bladder is fully expanded, the temperature is increased to 220&#xb0; C. During this phase, the mold-release agent must withstand the temperature and must transfer from the inner face of the tire to the outer face of the bladder. The tire is vulcanized in the closed press, with the bladder fully expanded with a pressurized fluid, between 150 and 220&#xb0; C. During this step, the tire must not stick to the bladder. The film of mold-release agent forms the necessary barrier between the tire and the bladder. The antibonding effect of the mold-release agent is ensured by creating a continuous separating layer between the bladder and the inner face of the tire. This is the main function of a bladder mold-release agent. If the barrier has defects, the tire may vulcanize on the bladder rubber, making it impossible to separate the two without destructive rupture. After vulcanization, the bladder is deflated. The mold-release agent must provide the antibonding effect, enabling the bladder to separate from the tire.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The advantage of applying the mold-release agent to the inside of the green tire is that this is done outside the press, thus avoiding any unwanted pollution of the press.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Silicone compositions that can be crosslinked into elastomers to facilitate molding-demolding during the manufacture of tires are known, and are described, for example, in the review Tire Technology (Tire release agents, Stefan Breunig, Tire technology International 2013, 68-72).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, patents EP1240283, EP1495076 and EP2038354 relate to siloxane-based lubricant compositions that are capable of crosslinking by polycondensation and thus without giving off hydrogen. Patent application EP1899447 and patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,742 relate to silicone compositions that are capable of crosslinking by dehydrogenation-condensation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, it is important for the deposition of the mold-release agent on the tire or bladder to be regular, in order to ensure the absence of uncovered areas, which would lead to release difficulties or to appearance defects on the vulcanized tire. However, due to the black color of the tire and the bladder, it is not always easy to see where the mold-release agent has been applied. Furthermore, it is important that the mold-release agent not degrade the appearance of the vulcanized tire.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this context, one object of the present invention is to provide a process for vulcanizing a green tire using a mold-release composition whose application to the green tire or to the bladder can be visually controlled, and which does not degrade the appearance of the vulcanized tire.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another object of the invention is to provide a mold-release composition whose application to the green tire or to the bladder can be visually controlled.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another object of the invention is to provide a mold-release composition whose application to the green tire or to the bladder can be visually controlled, and which does not degrade the appearance of the vulcanized tire.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">These and other objects are achieved by the present invention, which relates firstly to a process for vulcanizing a green tire in a metal press using an expandable rubber bladder, said process comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0027">1. coating the inside of the green tire or the outside of the expandable rubber bladder with a colored lubricant mold-release composition (I), in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion, to form a colored coating that is visible to the naked eye on the green tire or on the bladder, said lubricant composition (I) comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0028">a. at least one organopolysiloxane (A);</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0029">b. at least one surfactant (B);</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0030">c. at least one non-fluorescent pigment (C); and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0031">d. water (D);</li>            <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0032">the amounts of surfactant(s) and water being sufficient to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0033">2. inflating the bladder and vulcanizing the tire in the metal press, preferably at a temperature of between 80 and 220&#xb0; C. and for a time of between 10 minutes and 24 hours; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0034">3. demolding the tire;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0035">characterized in that the interior of the tire obtained in step 3) no longer has any coloring that is visible to the naked eye.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">By using a lubricant mold-release composition (I) comprising a non-fluorescent pigment (C), it is possible to obtain a colored composition. Consequently, its application to the green tire or to the bladder enables the formation of a colored coating that is visible to the naked eye. It is thus readily possible to visualize, with the naked eye, where the composition has been applied. Since the colored coating is visible to the naked eye, no equipment, such as a UV lamp, is needed to visualize where the composition has been applied. This ensures even application and that there are no areas not covered with the mold-release agent.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037">Furthermore, after vulcanization, the coloring is no longer visible on the inside of the vulcanized tire.
