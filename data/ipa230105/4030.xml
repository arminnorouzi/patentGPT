level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to display devices. More specifically, the disclosure relates to a see-through display including a polymer dispersed liquid crystal panel and a light source.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid crystal display devices are display devices utilizing a liquid crystal composition to display images. Typical display methods thereof include applying voltage to the liquid crystal composition sealed between paired substrates to change the alignment of liquid crystal components in the liquid crystal composition based on the applied voltage, thus controlling the amount of light passing through the liquid crystal display device. Such liquid crystal display devices are used in a variety of fields owing to their features including their thin profile, light weight, and low power consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">See-through displays have drawn attention which are capable of providing display where the background of its liquid crystal display device can be seen through the device. Liquid crystal display devices using a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) material have been developed as liquid crystal display devices for see-through displays. A PDLC material contains liquid crystal components dispersed in a polymer network. Application of voltage to the PDLC material changes the alignment of the liquid crystal components and produces a difference in refractive index between the liquid crystal components and the polymer network. The liquid crystal display devices use this difference to switch between a transparent state and a scattering state.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, JP 2016-85452 A discloses a display device including a pair of transparent substrates facing each other with a space in between; a light modulation layer which is disposed between the transparent substrates, has a predetermined anisotropy of refractive index, and includes light modulation elements differing in response property to an electric field generated by electrodes formed on the transparent substrates; and a light source that applies light of a predetermined color to a side surface of the light modulation layer, wherein the light modulation layer transmits incident light from the light source when the electric field is not generated, and the light modulation layer scatters the incident light from the light source toward the transparent substrates.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of the light source for see-through displays include edge-lit backlights. With an edge-lit backlight, a liquid crystal display device can be reduced in thickness. Examples of the edge-lit backlight include light-guiding type backlights using a light guide plate. The light-guiding type backlights using a light guide plate have a light source on a side surface of the light guide plate. Light emitted from the light source and incident on the side surface of the light guide plate is reflected in the light guide plate multiple times, and then emitted from the front surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, part of the light reflected in the light guide plate is lost due to diffraction by the components of a liquid crystal panel, such as thin film transistors (TFTs). More light is lost at a position farther from the light source, which possibly leads to a decrease in front characteristics such as the contrast ratio and the luminance in the central portion of the display screen. An examination made by the present inventors demonstrated that when a light-guiding type backlight was used to display images on liquid crystal panels containing a PDLC material, a 19-inch large display device had a contrast ratio of 2 or lower and a luminance of 60 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>or lower at the center of its display screen in the scattering state. The luminance in the central portion of the display screen was about &#xbc; of the luminance in the end portions of the display screen, meaning that the luminance gradient was high between the end portions and the central portion of the display screen. Thus, there have been problems in displaying images with a uniform luminance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a decrease in front characteristics in the central portion of a display screen was more significant on display screens with a larger area. In addition, part of transmitted light is lost due to scattering also when the light passes through the PDLC material. It is therefore difficult to achieve both an increase in area of the display screen and favorable front characteristics (high contrast ratio and high luminance) in thin-profile see-through displays.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the display device disclosed in JP 2016-85452 A, light is incident on the side surface of the light modulation layer, meaning that more light is lost at a position closer to the center of the display screen as in the case of using a light-guiding type backlight. This suggests that the display device would fail to achieve sufficient front characteristics when increased in size.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention aims to provide a thin-profile see-through display capable of achieving a high contrast ratio and a high luminance even with a display screen with a large area.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(1) One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a display device including: a liquid crystal panel including a pair of substrates and a polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer held between the substrates, and a light source behind a back surface of the liquid crystal panel, the substrates including an electrode that applies voltage to the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer, the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer containing a polymer network and liquid crystal components dispersed in the polymer network, the light source being apart from the liquid crystal panel with an air layer in between, extending along at least one outer edge of the liquid crystal panel, and configured to emit light toward the liquid crystal panel from an oblique direction, the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer being controlled to be in a transparent state where a background is seen through the display device with no voltage applied and shift into a scattering state where light emitted from the light source and incident on the

portion farther from the light source than the end portion is, the end portion and the central portion each having, in the scattering state, an angle dependence which changes a transmittance of light to be emitted from a front surface based on an angle at which light is incident on a back surface of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer, with the angle dependence of the end portion being different from the angle dependence of the central portion, the light source irradiating the end portion and the central portion with light at different angles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(2) In an

the display device includes the structure (1) or (2), and with no voltage applied, a twist angle of the liquid crystal components in the end portion is greater than a twist angle of the liquid crystal

includes a pair of electrodes that are disposed in the respective substrates and face toward the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(8) In an embodiment of the present invention, the display device includes any one of the structures (1) to (7), the light source includes light-emitting elements of multiple colors, and the light-emitting elements of multiple colors are driven based on a field-sequential color system in which the light-emitting elements are turned on time-divisionally.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention can provide a thin-profile see-through display capable of achieving a high contrast ratio and a high luminance even with a display screen having a large area.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of

The light source <b>2</b> may be fixed to a housing (not shown), for example. Herein, the &#x201c;front surface&#x201d; refers to the surface that is closer to the viewer and defines the display screen of the display device. The &#x201c;back surface&#x201d; is the surface that is farther from and opposite the display screen (front surface) of the display device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The liquid crystal panel <b>1</b> includes a pair of substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and a polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer <b>30</b>. The substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> hold the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> in between. The substrate <b>10</b> may include a transparent base material <b>11</b>, an electrode <b>12</b>, and an alignment film <b>13</b>. The substrate <b>20</b> may include a transparent base material <b>21</b>, an electrode <b>22</b>, and an alignment film <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transparent base materials <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> may be, for example, glass substrates or plastic substrates. The transparent base materials <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> have a total light transmittance of 90% or higher, for example. The total light transmittance is measured by a method in conformity with JIS K 7361-1. The total light transmittance can be measured with, for example, the haze meter &#x201c;Haze Meter NDH2000&#x201d; available from Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> each include an electrode that applies voltage to the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the case where the electrodes are the pair of electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> that are respectively disposed in the substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and face toward the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer <b>30</b>.

The alignment films <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> control the alignment azimuth of the liquid crystal components dispersed in the polymer network with no voltage applied to the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer <b>30</b>. The alignment films <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> have preferably been subjected to parallel alignment treatment such that, with no voltage applied, the liquid crystal components are in homogeneous alignment in which the long axes of the liquid crystal components are aligned parallel to the surfaces of the substrate <b>10</b> and the substrate <b>20</b>. The alignment films <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> may be made of any material usually used in the field of liquid crystal display devices, such as an alignment film material for rubbing alignment or an alignment film material for photoalignment.

Some conventional display devices use an edge-lit backlight with a light guide plate or use an optical clear adhesive (OCA) to attach the liquid crystal panel and the light guide plate together. Light applied to a side surface of the light guide plate from the horizontal direction is reflected inside the light guide plate and emitted toward the liquid crystal panel. The light, however, is sometimes lost when reflected inside the light guide plate or when passing through the OCA, causing a low luminance of the display device. The display device of the present embodiment, including the light source apart from the liquid crystal panel with the air layer <b>4</b> in between, causes no loss of light when the light is reflected inside the light guide plate or when passing through the OCA unlike the conventional display devices, thus achieving a high luminance.
