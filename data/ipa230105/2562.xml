The present invention further relates to a thermosetting resin composition and an encapsulating material, each comprising the fine particles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field of encapsulating elements of electronic devices such as transistors and ICs, the elements are conventionally encapsulated mainly with a resin from the standpoint of productivity, and costs. An epoxy resin is mainly used as an encapsulating resin because of well-balanced various properties such as electrical properties, humidity resistance, heat resistance, mechanical properties, and adhesion with inserted parts. However, the epoxy resin is hard and fragile. Therefore, for the usage of encapsulation, the epoxy resin itself is modified or an additive having a stress relaxation effect is added to the epoxy resin.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Acrylic rubber, an epoxy-modified silicone oil, an amino-modified silicone oil, and silicone rubber powders are generally known as a stress relaxation additive. The acrylic rubber have no chemical reaction point to react with the epoxy resin and, therefore, does not adhere well with the epoxy resin. The epoxy-modified silicone oil and amino-modified silicone oil have a low molecular weight and, accordingly, have an insufficient stress relaxation effect. The silicone rubber powder has poor compatibility with the epoxy resin and, therefore, are not uniformly dispersed therein.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-23061 describes an epoxy resin composition obtained by adding an epoxy-modified low-molecular-weight silicone to an epoxy resin in order to improve fluidity. The epoxy-modified low-molecular-weight silicone has poor compatibility with the epoxy resin and is therefore not easily mixed uniformly with the epoxy resin when a sufficient amount of an epoxy-modified low-molecular-weight silicone is added to attain a stress relaxation effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2018-172545 describes a solid encapsulating material which is used for compression molding and comprises an epoxy resin and an epoxy-modified silicone and describes that the solid encapsulating material is excellent in the stability in warpage behavior. However, the stress relaxation effect brought only by these components is insufficient, so that further improvement is required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-146148 describes that a core-shell type silicone compound comprising a silicone oil core and an organic polymer shell such as acrylic resin is added to an epoxy resin and, thereby, the epoxy resin having a reduced modulus of elasticity is obtained. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 8 (1996)-85753 describes that silicone fine particles obtained by coating a spherical silicone rubber fine particle with an organosilsesquioxane resin are added to an epoxy resin and, thereby, an epoxy resin having improved dispersibility is obtained. However, the shell portion of the acrylic resin or silicone has no chemical bond with the epoxy resin and therefore does not adhere well with the epoxy resin. In addition, the acrylic resin has a Tg not higher than the curing temperature of the epoxy resin, so that the acrylic resin may melt, aggregate to prevent uniform dispersion. Therefore, further improvement is required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR LITERATURES</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literatures</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-23061</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2018-172545</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-146148</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">Patent Literature 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 8 (1996)-85753</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0011">The present invention has been made in the aforesaid circumstances.

Examples of the monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms include alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl groups, aryl groups such as phenyl and tolyl groups, alkenyl groups such as vinyl and allyl groups, and aralkyl groups such as &#x3b2;-phenylethyl and &#x3b2;-phenylpropyl group.

If the pH is less than the aforesaid lower limit, the hydrolysis and condensation of a mixture of the organotrialkoxysilane (b1) and the epoxytrialkoxysilane (b2) do not sufficiently proceed and therefore, fusion bonding between particles may occur, which is not preferred. If the pH is more than the aforesaid upper limit, a rate of the hydrolysis of the organotrialkoxysilane with the epoxytrialkoxysilane increases to cause a hydrolysis reaction at a portion of the silicone rubber fine particles besides the surface, which may make it difficult to efficiently prepare a polyorganosilsesquioxane on the surface of the silicone rubber fine particles. In the present preparation method, the pH is required to be set higher than that, for example, in the reaction of only a methyltrialkoxysilane, because the hydrolysis and condensation of the epoxytrialkoxysilane proceed slowly.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0045">Any alkaline substance or alkaline aqueous solution is usable as far as it has a catalytic action on the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the organotrialkoxysilane and the epoxytrialkoxysilane.

Tables 2 and 3, the viscosities in the cases of epoxy-modified silicone fine particles of the present invention are low. This suggests the enhancement of the compatibility between the silicone fine particles and the epoxy resin. Thus, the silicone fine particles do not aggregate in the epoxy resin and well dispersed therein, so that the mixture with the epoxy resin has an adequate viscosity. In addition, the cured product of the resin composition comprising the silicone fine particles according to the present invention shows a high proportion of the remaining particles in the adhesion test and, the less number of the silicone fine particles are left out in the cutting of the test piece. This shows that the silicone fine particles have excellent adhesion with the epoxy resin. Further, the cured product thus obtained has excellent mechanical properties such as the bending strength and the bending modulus of elasticity. In contrast, the silicone fine particles of Comparative Examples 1, 2, and 4 are inferior in adhesion with the epoxy resin as shown in Comparative Examples 6 to 9 and 10. The silicone fine particles of Comparative Example 5 have a small particle diameter and therefore are not inferior in adhesion as shown in Comparative Example 11, but the particles aggregate in the resin, which is not preferred. In Comparative Example 9, the mixture of the silicone fine particles with the epoxy resin has a high viscosity and, therefore, the silicone fine particles are inferior in dispersibility in the epoxy resin composition.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0090">The epoxy-modified silicone fine particles of the present invention have softness derived from the silicone rubber and do not aggregate and therefore have excellent dispersibility in a thermosetting resin, particularly an epoxy resin. In addition, they are excellent in adhesion with a thermosetting resin, particularly, an epoxy resin. Further, a thermosetting resin composition and an encapsulating material comprising the epoxy-modified silicone fine particles provides a cured product having excellent in mechanical properties such as a bending strength and a bending modulus of elasticity. The present thermosetting resin composition is useful as an encapsulating material for a semiconductor element. For example, the present thermosetting resin composition may be applied on an object such as an electronic circuit substrate by a known application method and suited for use as an encapsulating material.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230002563A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
