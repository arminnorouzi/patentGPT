A radiation delivery system may include one or more radiation sources that generate a therapeutic radiation beam to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation to a target, such as a tumor, and one or more imaging radiation beams which are used to acquire imaging data associated with the target.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a conventional radiation delivery system, a 3D volumetric image may be constructed of a volume of interest that includes the target. The volumetric image may be constructed by a processing device using a series of two-dimensional (2D) images that are captured before therapeutic radiation beam delivery has begun. For the purposes of this disclosure, a radiation treatment session may be defined as a period of time from when a patient enters a room to begin radiation treatment to when the patient leaves the room. Therapeutic radiation beam delivery may be defined as a period of time during which the therapeutic radiation beam is initially turned on to when the therapeutic radiation beam is finally turned off. In embodiments, the therapeutic radiation beam may be turned on and off during the period of time of therapeutic radiation beam delivery. Because the volumetric images are constructed using 2D images that were not acquired during therapeutic radiation beam delivery, the volumetric images may not accurately represent the volume of interest at the time of therapeutic radiation beam delivery. This may make it difficult to accurately track the motion of the target and estimate the therapeutic dose delivered to the target and/or other structures in proximity to the target, such as organs of a patient.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Aspects of the disclosure may remedy the above and other deficiencies by constructing volumetric images during therapeutic radiation beam delivery. Processing logic of a processing device of a radiation delivery system may initiate a radiation treatment session to deliver a therapeutic radiation beam to a target. During therapeutic radiation beam delivery, the processing logic may cause a radiation source to generate an imaging radiation beam through the target to one or more X-ray detectors to acquire imaging data associated with the target.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the radiation delivery system may utilize a therapeutic radiation source to generate the therapeutic radiation beam and an imaging radiation beam. The imaging radiation beam may be used to acquire imaging data that may be used in conjunction with imaging data captured by an imaging system of the radiation delivery system. In some embodiments, one or more imaging radiation beam pulses may be interleaved between one or more therapeutic radiation beam pulses. For example, an imaging beam pulse may occur after two therapeutic radiation beam pulses or two imaging beam pulses may occur after one therapeutic radiation beam pulse. It should be noted that embodiments of the disclosure may utilize any number of imaging radiation beam pulses that are interleaved with any number of therapeutic radiation beam pulses. In an embodiment, the therapeutic radiation source may be used to simultaneously generate the therapeutic radiation beam and the imaging radiation beam, as will be described in further detail at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In embodiments, the radiation delivery system may utilize multiple radiation sources. For example, the radiation delivery system may include a therapeutic radiation source and one or more X-ray radiation sources. In an embodiment, the one or more X-ray radiation sources may be offset relative to the therapeutic radiation source along an axis of rotation about the target. In some embodiments, an X-ray radiation source of the one or more X-ray radiation sources may be in alignment with the therapeutic radiation source to provide imaging data that corresponds to the perspective of the therapeutic radiation source.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The processing logic may utilize the imaging data acquired during therapeutic radiation beam delivery to construct one or more volumetric images. The volumetric images may correspond to a volume of interest that includes the target. In some embodiments, the processing logic may construct the volumetric images using less than a completely sampled set of imaging data. For example, the processing logic may utilize an image reconstruction algorithm to construct a volumetric image from a limited arc of imaging data. In another example, the processing logic may execute an iterative reconstruction algorithm to construct the most likely volumetric image from an under-sampled set of imaging data, which may not be in the form of continuous arcs. In some embodiments, the processing logic may utilize pre-treatment imaging data, planning time imaging data, or previously acquired imaging data in addition to the imaging data acquired during therapeutic radiation beam delivery to construct the volumetric image. In embodiments, pre-treatment imaging data may include imaging acquired before a radiation treatment session as well as imaging acquired during a radiation treatment session but before therapeutic radiation beam delivery. In some embodiments, the therapeutic radiation beam may also be used to acquire imaging data to be used in the construction of the volumetric images.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Constructing the volumetric images from imaging data that is acquired during therapeutic radiation beam delivery provides for an improved radiation delivery system. In embodiments, the volumetric images may be used to more accurately estimate a therapeutic dose delivered to the target or an object in proximity to the target (e.g., a radiation sensitive structure, such as an organ of a patient). In some embodiments, the volumetric images may be used to modify therapeutic radiation delivery to compensate for the motion or other visible change of the target, ensuring that the appropriate therapeutic dose is accurately delivered to the target.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a helical radiation delivery system <b>800</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The helical radiation delivery system <b>800</b> may include a linear accelerator (LINAC) <b>850</b> mounted to a ring gantry <b>820</b>. The LINAC <b>850</b> may be used to generate a radiation beam (i.e., treatment beam) by directing an electron beam towards an x-ray emitting target. The treatment beam may deliver radiation to a target region (i.e., a tumor). The treatment system further includes a multileaf collimator (MLC) <b>860</b> coupled with the distal end of the LINAC <b>850</b>. The MLC includes a housing that houses multiple leaves that are movable to adjust an aperture of the MLC to enable shaping of the treatment beam. In embodiments, the MLC <b>860</b> may be a binary MLC that includes a plurality of leaves arranged in two opposing banks, where the leaves of the two opposing banks are interdigitated with one another and can be opened or closed to form an aperture. In some embodiments, the MLC <b>860</b> may be an electromagnetically-actuated MLC. In embodiments, MLC <b>860</b> may be any other type of MLC. The ring gantry <b>820</b> has a toroidal shape in which the patient <b>830</b> extends through a bore of the ring/toroid and the LINAC <b>850</b> is mounted on the perimeter of the ring and rotates about the axis passing through the center to irradiate a target region with beams delivered from one or more angles around the patient. During treatment, the patient <b>830</b> may be simultaneously moved through the bore of the gantry on a treatment couch <b>840</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The helical radiation delivery system <b>800</b> includes an imaging system, comprising the LINAC <b>850</b> as an imaging source and an x-ray detector <b>870</b>. The LINAC <b>850</b> may be used to generate a mega-voltage x-ray image (MVCT) of a region of interest (ROI) of patient <b>830</b> by directing a sequence of x-ray beams at the ROI which are incident on the x-ray detector <b>870</b> opposite the LINAC <b>850</b> to image the patient <b>830</b> for setup and generate pre-treatment images. In one embodiment, the helical radiation delivery system <b>800</b> may also include a secondary imaging system consisting of a kV imaging source <b>810</b> mounted orthogonally relative to the LINAC <b>850</b> (e.g., separated by 90 degrees) on the ring gantry <b>820</b> and may be aligned to project an imaging x-ray beam at a target region and to illuminate an imaging plane of a detector after passing through the patient <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a radiation treatment system <b>1200</b> that may be used in accordance with alternative embodiments described herein. As shown, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a configuration of a radiation treatment system <b>1200</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the radiation treatment system <b>1200</b> includes a linear accelerator (LINAC) <b>1201</b> that acts as a radiation treatment source and an MLC <b>1205</b> coupled with the distal end of the LINAC <b>1201</b> to shape the treatment beam. In one embodiment, the LINAC <b>1201</b> is mounted on the end of a robotic arm <b>1202</b> having multiple (e.g., 5 or more) degrees of freedom in order to position the LINAC <b>1201</b> to irradiate a pathological anatomy (e.g., target) with beams delivered from many angles, in many planes, in an operating volume around a patient. Treatment may involve beam paths with a single isocenter, multiple isocenters, or with a non-isocentric approach.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">LINAC <b>1201</b> may be positioned at multiple different nodes (predefined positions at which the LINAC <b>1201</b> is stopped and radiation may be delivered) during treatment by moving the robotic arm <b>1202</b>. At the nodes, the LINAC <b>1201</b> can deliver one or more radiation treatment beams to a target, where the radiation beam shape is determined by the leaf positions in the MLC <b>1205</b>. The nodes may be arranged in an approximately spherical distribution about a patient. The particular number of nodes and the number of treatment beams applied at each node may vary as a function of the location and type of pathological anatomy to be treated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the robotic arm <b>1202</b> and LINAC <b>1201</b> at its end may be in continuous motion between nodes while radiation is being delivered. The radiation beam shape and 2-D intensity map is determined by rapid motion of the leaves in the MLC <b>1205</b> during the continuous motion of the LINAC <b>1201</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The radiation treatment system <b>1200</b> includes an imaging system <b>1210</b> having a processing device <b>1230</b> connected with x-ray sources <b>1203</b>A and <b>1203</b>B (i.e., imaging sources) and fixed x-ray detectors <b>1204</b>A and <b>1204</b>B. Alternatively, the x-ray sources <b>1203</b>A, <b>1203</b>B and/or x-ray detectors <b>1204</b>A, <b>1204</b>B may be mobile, in which case they may be repositioned to maintain alignment with the target, or alternatively to image the target from different orientations or to acquire many x-ray images and reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) cone-beam CT. In one embodiment, the x-ray sources are not point sources, but rather x-ray source arrays, as would be appreciated by the skilled artisan. In one embodiment, LINAC <b>1201</b> serves as an imaging source, where the LINAC power level is reduced to acceptable levels for imaging.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Imaging system <b>1210</b> may perform computed tomography (CT) such as cone beam CT or helical megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT), and images generated by imaging system <b>1210</b> may be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). The two x-ray sources <b>1203</b>A and <b>1203</b>B may be mounted in fixed positions on the ceiling of an operating room and may be aligned to project x-ray imaging beams from two different angular positions (e.g., separated by 90 degrees) to intersect at a machine isocenter (referred to herein as a treatment center, which provides a reference point for positioning the patient on a treatment couch <b>1206</b> during treatment) and to illuminate imaging planes of respective detectors <b>1204</b>A and <b>1204</b>B after passing through the patient. In one embodiment, imaging system <b>1210</b> provides stereoscopic imaging of a target and the surrounding volume of interest (VOI). In other embodiments, imaging system <b>1210</b> may include more or less than two x-ray sources and more or less than two detectors, and any of the detectors may be movable rather than fixed. In yet other embodiments, the positions of the x-ray sources and the detectors may be interchanged. In embodiments, the imaging data acquired from the fixed angles of by imaging system <b>1210</b> may be combined with prior images, such as a planning image or pre-treatment CT image. The imaging data acquired from the fixed angles acquired during therapeutic radiation beam delivery may be used to deform the prior images into a volumetric image representing the patient at the time of therapeutic radiation beam delivery. Detectors <b>1204</b>A and <b>1204</b>B may be fabricated from a scintillating material that converts the x-rays to visible light (e.g., amorphous silicon), and an array of CMOS (complementary metal oxide silicon) or CCD (charge-coupled device) imaging cells that convert the light to a digital image that can be compared with a reference image during an image registration process that transforms a coordinate system of the digital image to a coordinate system of the reference image, as is well known to the skilled artisan. The reference image may be, for example, a digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR), which is a virtual x-ray image that is generated from a 3D CT image based on simulating the x-ray image formation process by casting rays through the CT image.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, IGRT delivery system <b>1200</b> also includes a secondary imaging system <b>1239</b>. Imaging system <b>1239</b> may be a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) imaging system. Alternatively, other types of volumetric imaging systems may be used. The secondary imaging system <b>1239</b> includes a rotatable gantry <b>1240</b> (e.g., a ring) attached to an arm and rail system (not shown) that move the rotatable gantry <b>1240</b> along one or more axes (e.g., along an axis that extends from a head to a foot of the treatment couch <b>1206</b>. An imaging source <b>1245</b> and a detector <b>1250</b> are mounted to the rotatable gantry <b>1240</b>. The rotatable gantry <b>1240</b> may rotate 360 degrees about the axis that extends from the head to the foot of the treatment couch. Accordingly, the imaging source <b>1245</b> and detector <b>1250</b> may be positioned at numerous different angles. In one embodiment, the imaging source <b>1245</b> is an x-ray source and the detector <b>1250</b> is an x-ray detector. In one embodiment, the secondary imaging system <b>1239</b> includes two rings that are separately rotatable. The imaging source <b>1245</b> may be mounted to a first ring and the detector <b>1250</b> may be mounted to a second ring.
