At the same time, the terminal transmits the powersaving assistance information by using the overheating assistance information, and does not need to send a powersaving assistance message separately, thus signaling overhead is reduced, and resource occupation is reduced.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In some examples, sending the powersaving assistance information through the overheating assistance information includes:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">the powersaving assistance information is sent through the overheating assistance information during terminal overheating relieving.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In the implementation, during overheating relieving, the terminal usually needs to send overheating assistance information carrying a null field to the access network device to inform the access network device that the terminal is in an overheating relieving state. Since the overheating assistance information carries the null field, at this time, the powersaving assistance information is sent by adopting the overheating assistance information, which does not affect transmission of the overheating assistance information and the powersaving assistance information, and saves transmission resources.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In some examples, the overheating assistance information includes at least one field, and the at least one field is configured to carry the powersaving assistance information.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In the signaling structure of the overheating assistance information, each field is an optional field. As previously mentioned, the powersaving assistance information includes at least one option. Since each option of the powersaving assistance information corresponds to the corresponding field of the overheating assistance information, after several options of the powersaving assistance information are determined, they are carried by correspondingly setting the field in the overheating assistance information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In some examples, the overheating assistance information includes a first field, and the first field is any one of the at least one field; and information carried by the first field is overheating assistance information when a value of the first field is within a first range; and the information carried by the first field is powersaving assistance information when the value of the first field is within a second range.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In the example of the present disclosure, each field in the overheating assistance information may be divided into two ranges, a numerical value in one range corresponds to the overheating assistance information, and a numerical value in the other range corresponds to the powersaving assistance information. Thus the terminal and a base station may know whether each field carries the overheating assistance information or the powersaving assistance information, and the range of the value of each field may be divided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In some examples, the method further includes:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">obtaining a relationship between a value range of the first field and a type of information carried by the first field; and</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">generating the overheating assistance information based on the relationship between the value range of the first field and the type of the information carried by the first field.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In the step, it needs to obtain the above relationship first, then determine the value of each field according to whether to report the overheating assistance information or the powersaving assistance information, and then generate the overheating assistance information.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In some examples, obtaining the relationship between the value range of the first field and the type of the information carried by the first field includes: receiving the relationship between the value range of the first field and the type of the information carried by the first field sent by a server; or</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">obtaining the relationship between the value range of the first field and the type of the information carried by the first field includes: obtaining the relationship between the value range of the first field and the type of the information carried by the first field from local storage.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In the implementation, the obtaining the relationship between the value range and the type of the carried information may include: obtaining from the server and obtaining from a locally stored protocol, in which the protocol is agreed upon by the server and the terminal.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In some examples, the overheating assistance information includes a custom field for indicating whether the overheating assistance information carries the powersaving assistance information.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">For example, the overheating assistance information may indicate that the carried information is the powersaving assistance information by newly adding a bit.
