More particularly, the present disclosure relates to deployable decoy systems for the attraction of wild game and to methods for deploying and manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There exists in the art a plurality of decoy devices and systems to attract wild game, such as wild fowl game species, wild waterfowl game species, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some of them are made of a material that can allow the decoy device to float, so they can be used into water. Such floatable decoy devices are usually provided as a single piece, three-dimensional decoy device, which can be troublesome when it is time to transport and/or to store the plurality of decoy devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There also exists on the market deployable or foldable decoy devices and/or inflatable decoy devices that can easily be stored and/or transported. The final deployed decoy device however rarely realistically represents the wild game species body and/or head. For example, they can be two-dimensional and/or static (all the deployed decoy devices represent the same wild game, identically positioned, etc.) The available deployable decoy devices are also usually difficult to deploy and/or non-resistant once on field or into water.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of published patents references are as follow: US patent publication no. 20170280705, US patent publication no. 2016,0235053, U.S. Pat.

In some implementations, the blank panel can be made from a lightweight, flexible, and/or semi-rigid material. The decoy panel <b>12</b> can be formed from, or die cut into, a substantially planar and foldable blank panel. As illustrated in the non-limitative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the decoy panel <b>12</b> defines a top (or outer or first) surface <b>48</b> and a bottom (or inner or second) surface <b>50</b>, which is found opposite to the top surface <b>48</b>. The decoy panel <b>12</b> further includes a sidewall <b>52</b> which joins the top and bottom surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> (or first and second surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>) together.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some implementations, at least one of the first and second surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> comprises at least one marking thereon so as to represent a specific wild game species. In some implementations, only one of the top and bottom surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> (or first and second surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>) of the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be adorned with markings and colors so as to represent a specific wild game species (e.g. one of a fowl or a bird species, one of a male or a female species, etc.). In some other implementations, the first and second surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> comprise different markings thereon, so that the foldable decoy panel <b>12</b> can be used reversibly. In other words, the top surface <b>48</b> of the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be adorned with markings and colors so as to represent a first wild game species (e.g. a first fowl or bird species, a male or a female, etc.), while the bottom surface <b>50</b> of the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be adorned with different markings and colors so as to represent a second wild game species (e.g. a second fowl or bird species, the other one of the male or the female, etc.). Therefore, each surface <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can be adorned with different markings and colors so as to allow the decoy panel <b>12</b> to represent two particular bird or fowl species. Such configuration of the decoy panel <b>12</b> helps in reusing the same deployable decoy system <b>10</b> for different hunting (according to different species, different regions, different times of the year, etc.), or to put in place a more realistic sample of a plurality of wild game species so as to efficiently attract the selected wild game species.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some implementations, the markings on the first and/or second surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are at least one of printed, painted, lithographed and silkscreen printed on the corresponding surface for the markings to be substantially realistic (i.e. substantially similar to the wild game species to be represented). In other words, the top and/or bottom surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can be molded, painted, textured (e.g. with feathers), disposed with an ornamental canvas, lined, dyed, silk screen sprayed, woven, coated, layered with ornamental media or picture, lithographed and the like, so as to provide the top and/or bottom surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> with the desired appearance. The fact that the foldable decoy panel <b>12</b> is at least partially made of a substantially flat blank panel eases the use of different printing technologies enabling the substantially faithful reproduction of the desired wild game species.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some implementations, the top surface <b>48</b> and/or the bottom surface <b>50</b> of the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be adorned with markings and colors so as to represent a wild game waterfowl species or a wild game fowl species. The wild game waterfowl species can include, without limitation, Canada geese, Snow geese, mallards, black ducks, mottled ducks, Mexican ducks, pintails, gadwalls, American pigeons, shovelers, wood ducks, green-winged teal, blue-winged teal, cinnamon teal, fulvous tree duck, black-bellied tree ducks, American coots, and the like. The wild game fowl species can include, without limitations, owls, wild turkey, pigeons, crows, and the like. A person skilled in the art to which the decoy system <b>10</b> pertains would understand that any animal can be represented (i.e., rabbit, jackrabbit, wild boar, and the like).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some implementations, the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be at least partially made of, without limitations, a plastic, a rubber, a foam, a fabric, and the like. In some implementations, the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be made of a material which allows the decoy panel <b>12</b>, and therefore the deployable decoy system <b>10</b>, to be buoyant, to float. In other words, in the embodiment shown, the foldable decoy panel <b>12</b> is at least partially formed of a buoyant material. In some implementations, the material which allows the decoy panel <b>12</b> to be buoyant can include a polymer material. Such polymer material can include, without limitations, a plastic material, a rubber material, a polymeric material, a neoprene material, a closed-cell acrylonitrile butadiene rubber material, a polyethylene material, a polypropylene material, a polyurethane material, a foam material, a foam material comprising ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), a foam material comprising ethanolamine (ETA), a foam material provided with cells configured in opened or closed configurations, and the like. For instance, the foldable decoy panel <b>12</b> is at least partially formed in a resilient material allowing the foldable decoy panel <b>12</b> to be configured back into a substantially two-dimensional configuration. A person skilled in the art to which the deployable decoy system <b>10</b> pertains would however understand that the material used to form the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be any material that allows the decoy panel <b>12</b> to be substantially planar when in its two-dimensional configuration, that is configured to form the decoy hollow body <b>14</b> in the deployed three-dimensional configuration, and that takes back its initial substantially planar configuration when provided back in its two-dimensional configuration (i.e. when the assembling elongated member <b>30</b> is released).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some implementations, the selected material can be lightweight, resilient, and/or provide buoyancy to the decoy panel <b>12</b>. In some implementations, the selected material can have a memory (i.e. to be substantially resilient) so that the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be deployed between its two-dimensional configuration and its deployed three-dimensional configuration. For instance, one or more rods, for instance at least partially made of plastic, metal or any other suitable resilient material, can be provided and inserted into or mounted to a surface of the decoy panel (for instance substantially centrally into or onto one of the plurality of decoy extensions). In some implementations, the selected material can be impervious to weather conditions, to water, to extreme temperatures, and the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The deployable decoy system <b>10</b> described herein can therefore realistically and/or substantially faithfully represent a particular wild game species and can therefore attract or stimulate a particular wild game species, thanks to the three-dimensional configuration of the decoy panel <b>12</b> which provides a decoy hollow body <b>14</b> that substantially realistically represents a wild game body, and further, to the decoy three-dimensional head <b>26</b> which realistically represents a wild game head.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Again, the decoy hollow body <b>14</b> and/or the decoy three-dimensional head <b>26</b> can take any shape, size and/or configuration, as long as it realistically represents a wild game body or head. Therefore, a person skilled in the art to which the deployable decoy system <b>10</b> pertains would understand that, while wild waterfowl game species are illustrated in the figures, other wild fowl game species or wild game species (birds, mammals, etc.) can be represented by the decoy panel <b>12</b> forming the decoy hollow body <b>14</b>, and the decoy three-dimensional head <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Still referring to the non-limitative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the decoy panel <b>12</b> can be deployed (i.e. configured) in its deployed three-dimensional configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) so as to represent a wild game body and releasably secured in such configuration by pulling the assembling elongated member <b>30</b> which passes through (i.e. which is received within) the plurality of elongated member-receiving channels <b>24</b>.

A stabilizer device can also be secured to the decoy hollow body <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, for instance when the decoy hollow body <b>14</b>, <b>114</b> is provided into a body of water.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">However, when the decoy three-dimensional head <b>26</b>, <b>126</b>, the anchoring member <b>84</b>, the legs, the wings, the head cover, and the like have been removed or released from the decoy hollow body <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, and when the elongated attachment member <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> is being released (e.g., from the locking fastener <b>74</b>), the resilient material forming the decoy panel <b>12</b>, <b>112</b> allows it to regain its substantially planar two-dimensional configuration. The deployable decoy system <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> is thus easily storable and/or transportable. A plurality of decoy panels <b>12</b>, <b>112</b> can therefore be quickly, easily, and efficiently stacked one over the other for facilitating storage, transport and reinstallation on a different site.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The present disclosure thus also concerns a decoy kit for forming at least one deployable decoy system, the kit comprising at least one foldable decoy panel according to the present disclosure, and one or more interchangeable decoy three-dimensional heads mountable to at least one of foldable decoy panel.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to another aspect of the disclosure, as represented in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, there is provided a method <b>2000</b> for manufacturing a foldable decoy panel.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The method <b>2000</b> comprises a step <b>2100</b> of providing a sheet of material comprising first and second opposed surfaces; a step <b>2200</b> of forming a pattern (comprising for instance a plurality of marks) on at least one of the first and second opposed surfaces; and a step <b>2300</b> of die cutting into the sheet of material a decoy main section and a plurality of decoy extensions extending from the decoy main section, each decoy extension being foldable with respect to the main section.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the embodiment shown, the step <b>2200</b> of forming the pattern on the at least one of the first and second opposed surfaces comprises at least one of printing, painting, lithographing and silkscreen printing the pattern.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the embodiment shown, the step <b>2200</b> of forming the pattern comprises at least one of texturing, arranging an ornamental canvas, lining, dying, weaving, coating and layering with ornamental media at least one of the first and second surfaces.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to another aspect of the disclosure, as represented in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, there is provided a method <b>3000</b> for deploying a decoy system for the attraction of wild game.
