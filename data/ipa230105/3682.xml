Typically, this is done using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) in which a surface can be modulated between being relatively hydrophobic and relatively hydrophilic based on the application of a voltage. EWOD devices make use of an electrode to which a voltage is applied. The electrowetting voltage used to induce the movement of droplets can be, for example, a DC voltage or an AC voltage. A dielectric layer separates the droplet and the electrode and contains an electrical field which effectively makes the dielectric surface more hydrophilic. In a typical implementation, the dielectric layer may have a hydrophobic coating that establishes an initially high contact angle between the droplet and dielectric surface. By toggling a grid of electrowetting electrodes, a surface energy gradient can be established which propels the fluidic droplet across the surface of the DMF device from one electrode to another. Additionally, in a DMF device, magnetic or optical forces can be used to localize and/or move fluidic droplets. Further, in a DMF device, an optical signal can be focused on a semiconductor to generate the electrowetting voltage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical device architecture may include two substrates separated by a gap and wherein a multi-layer structure is built upon each substrate. For example, a bottom substrate may include a layer of discrete electrodes. Atop the electrode layer may be the dielectric layer to facilitate the buildup of charge for the EWOD effect. Atop the dielectric layer may be the hydrophobic layer to create an initially high contact angle and low contact angle hysteresis. The fluidic droplets are contained in the gap between the bottom and top substrates. In some configurations, a top substrate includes a conductive layer to provide a ground reference for the EWOD system. A second hydrophobic layer atop the conductive layer in the top substrate faces the gap. Thus, the device can be considered in two portions, with a gap therebetween: the bottom portion that may include the bottom substrate, the electrodes, the dielectric, and a hydrophobic layer and a top portion that may include another hydrophobic layer, the ground reference layer, and the top substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The bottom portion of DMF devices can be fabricated on a variety of substrates including but not limited to silicon, glass, printed circuit boards (PCB), and paper. The choice of substrate may influence the technology used to pattern the electrodes, which, for example, includes photolithography for silicon, glass and PCBs, and printing for paper. The dielectric material can be applied in methods including but not limited to an evaporated layer, as a sputtered layer or as a laminated sheet. The hydrophobic layer can be deposited in methods including, but not limited to, spin coating, spray coating, and dip coating. The top portion typically consists of a conductive layer (often indium tin oxide) coated onto a plastic or glass substrate with a hydrophobic layer deposited as above.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are a few primary challenges with DMF devices, notably in the implementation of a smooth and uniform hydrophobic layer on both the top and bottom portions; any disturbance in this film could result in pinned droplets that do not move as expected. Accordingly, new approaches are needed for implementing sensing techniques in DMF devices that do not perturb droplet movement.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides an electrowetting digital microfluidics (DMF) device. The electrowetting device includes electrodes for conducting droplet operations, and an FETB. The FETB may be situated in sufficient proximity to a set of one or more of the electrodes that a droplet subject to droplet operations mediated by the set of one or more electrodes will come into contact with the FETB. The FETB has a first portion comprising an exposed hydrophilic surface area of a sufficiently small size that the set of one or more electrodes is capable of conducting droplet operations to remove the droplet, when present, from contact with the FETB. In this regard, the exposed hydrophilic surface area may be sized in relation to a droplet to allow for the droplet to be removed or substantially removed when the droplet is migrated from the FETB using the electrodes. That is, the droplet may fully separate or substantially fully separate from the FETB upon migration of the droplet away from the FETB by the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the electrowetting device of the present disclosure has two substrates separated to form a droplet operations gap. One or both of the substrates may include droplet operations electrodes. One or both of the substrates may include an FETB. An FETB may be mounted on one of the substrates in sufficient proximity to a subset of one or more of the droplet operations electrodes such the subset may mediate droplet operations causing the droplet to contact the FETB and to fully separate or substantially fully separate from the FETB.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also provides an instrument. The instrument in this embodiment includes FETB drive circuitry; FETB read circuitry; and circuitry for controlling droplet operations electrodes. The FETB may be provided with an electrowetting DMF cartridge that may interface with the instrument. Thus, the instrument may include includes a mount for physically and electronically coupling the instrument to the electrowetting DMF cartridge. The mount includes connectors for electronically coupling the FETB drive circuitry and FETB read circuitry of the instrument to an FETB of the electrowetting DMF cartridge. The mount includes connectors for electronically coupling the circuitry of the instrument for controlling droplet operations electrodes to one or more droplet operations electrodes of the electrowetting cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a detection method.

Namely, the DMF device utilizes DMF (i.e., electrowetting) for fluid movement and a field-effect transistor (FET) as the sensor readout.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides (1) integrated nanowire or graphene-based devices for high sensitivity and streamlined manufacturing, (2) methods of integrating these devices with active-matrix technology for additional fluidic functionality, and/or (3) methods of integrating the sensor with previously-developed DMF technologies.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of implementing FETB sensing in a manner wherein the FETB sensing that does not inhibit or disrupt droplet movement.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the DMF device may include one or more integrated FETBs. In one example, the DMF device may include at least one FETB integrated into the top substrate of the DMF device. In another example, the DMF device may include at least one FETB integrated into the bottom substrate of the DMF device. In yet another example, the DMF device may include at least one FETB integrated into the top substrate as well as at least one FETB integrated into the bottom substrate of the DMF device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the FETB is provided separate from the DMF device and wherein the separately provided FETB can be installed into the DMF device, e.g., as a &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; style FETB. Accordingly, the DMF device may include one or more &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; style FETBs. In one example, at least one &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; style FETB is installed in the top substrate of the DMF device. In another example, at least one &#x201c;drop-in&#x201d; style FETB is installed in the bottom substrate of the DMF device.

In this arrangement, there exists an electric double layer in the aqueous phase along the gate which can be perturbed by various stimuli. For example, a change in pH of the reagent contacting the gate will change this layer resulting in a different gate potential. In a biosensing application, a ligand may be immobilized on the surface to capture a target analyte in the reagent. When this analyte binds to the ligand, the gate potential is perturbed. The change in gate voltage can be detected by observing a modulation of the source-drain current at a given voltage.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">There are many methods of implementing a FETB based on the materials used. For example, the device can be structured using conventional silicon semiconductor or with a thin-film transistor (TFT). More recently, nanomaterials have been developed with many advantages, such as silicon nanowires or using graphene that have improved sensitivity. Specifically, graphene-based FETB devices currently exist. A practical implementation of FETB requires the patterning and fabrication of the transistor elements (typically photolithography on silicon) followed by the creation of the gate depending on the technology. While floating-gate architectures exist in which the liquid gate is the only interaction with the sample, these devices often have stability and noise issues. To avoid these issues, a reference electrode and an FETB return electrode need also be introduced to the system, as described hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. For example, the DMF device, FETB, and method of field-effect sensing provide three (3) points of contact: liquid gate and two electrodes. Further, one of the primary challenges of the field is integrating a sensor into a fluidic device for the analysis of analytes.

That is, in typical DMF designs, the top substrate-portion contains only the substrate, ground (optional), and hydrophobic layers, this design introduces a number of electrical functions.

Likewise, routing layer <b>130</b> of top substrate <b>112</b> is representative of a plurality of routing layers for routing the required electrical signals. In top substrate <b>112</b> and close to droplet operations gap <b>114</b>, ground reference electrode <b>132</b> is patterned to contain the FET source (e.g., source electrode <b>152</b>) and drain (e.g., drain electrode <b>154</b>) as well as FETB return electrode <b>134</b>.

One design aspect of the DMF device <b>100</b> is that the hydrophobic layer sees minimal perturbation to reduce or prevent droplet pinning in which fluid from the droplet is trapped in contact with the exposed portion of the FETB and/or electrodes that may comprise a hydrophilic surface area. When any droplet operations electrode <b>118</b> of bottom substrate <b>110</b> is toggled on, the droplet stabilizes above the electrode. However, when this droplet operations electrode <b>118</b> is toggled off and an adjacent droplet operations electrode <b>118</b> is toggled on, the droplet should move to the new electrode to minimize its energy. The presence of hydrophilic surface areas associated with entities such as the electrodes in the integrated FETB <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may perturb this system and could potentially cause droplets to be stuck on the FET features.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this regard, the size exposed hydrophilic surface area may be controlled in relation to the droplet size to reduce or eliminate such pinning of the fluid of the droplet to allow the droplet to be removed or substantially removed by fully separating or substantially fully separating the fluid of the droplet from the hydrophilic surface area.

The droplet footprint area may correspond to an area contacted by the droplet at an interface with one or both of the substrates. In this regard, the openings <b>140</b> exposing the hydrophilic surface area of the FETB may comprise not more than 20% of a droplet footprint area of the droplet relative to the FETB, not more than 10% of a droplet footprint area of the droplet relative to the FETB, not more than 5% of a droplet footprint area of the droplet relative to the FETB, or even not more than 1% of a droplet footprint area of the droplet relative to the FETB.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, exposed hydrophilic surface areas in the configuration of DMF device <b>100</b> that may cause pinning of the droplet may not present a sufficiently large area to pin a droplet as the thermodynamic stability of the system favors the entire droplet moving as opposed to it splitting or remaining stationary on the features of FETB <b>150</b> based on the relative area of the hydrophilic surface area relative to the droplet footprint area. Another consideration is that ground reference electrode <b>132</b> of top substrate <b>112</b> must be generally present wherever the droplet is to ensure that the circuit is completed properly and the DMF system can be reliably used.

Therefore, a m&#xd7;n matrix can be controlled with only m+n elements. This technology is primarily used in display technologies. However, in recent years the use of active-matrix control has been applied to DMF. Specifically, technologies have implemented thin-film transistor (TFT) devices that control DMF electrodes. The principle is that the desired DMF electrode is the drain of a transistor and can be accessed by applying the voltage to the source of the transistor and applying an activating voltage on the gate. In the case wherein only gate voltage is applied, the DMF electrode is connected to a floating source and therefore the droplet does not actuate. Furthermore, in the case where only the source has an applied voltage, this voltage does not convey to the drain without the gate voltage applied. One of the primary constraints with DMF is that a typical commercial device can have hundreds of electrodes that need to be controlled. With conventional control systems, the routing and switching on these devices can become prohibitively complicated. An active-matrix DMF device drastically increases the number of DMF electrodes that can be controlled by the device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an example of the DMF device <b>100</b> including active-matrix control in combination with an integrated FETB <b>150</b> in the bottom substrate thereof.
