id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">The present invention relates to novel cystine analogs, methods of making cystine analogs, compositions containing cystine analogs and methods of using such analogs for inhibiting cystine stone formation and treatment of cystinuria. The cystine analogs of the present invention improve the aqueous solubility of L-cystine in vivo. The present invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these novel compounds for both diagnostic applications and treatment of pathological cystinuria.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Cystinuria is a rare chronic lifelong condition that affects about 20,000 Americans. It is the result of an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in one of the two genes, either SLC31A or SLC7A9, leading to abnormal transport of dibasic amino acids from the luminal fluid of the renal proximal tubules and small intestine. About 5% of American women and 12% of American men will develop a kidney stone at some time in their lifetime, and prevalence has been rising in both sexes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Kidney stone recurrence is also common. It is estimated that almost 50% of stone formers will have a recurrence within 10 years. Approximately 59% of kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones (pure) or with small amounts of calcium phosphate; 10% are predominantly calcium phosphate stones; 17% are uric acid stones; 12% are struvite or infection stones; and remaining 2% are cystine and other stones. Although the rate of cystine stones is much lower than calcium oxalate stones, cystine stones are larger, recur more frequently, and are more likely to cause chronic kidney disease. Medically, the disease caused by cystine stones in the kidney, ureter, and bladder is named cystinuria, which is a genetic abnormality results in abnormal transport of dibasic amino acids from the luminal fluid of the renal proximal tubules and small intestine.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Cystinuria is a chronic, lifelong condition and is most common in young adults under age 40. It is the result of an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in one of the two genes, either SLC3A1 on chromosome 2 (type A) or SLC7A9 on chromosome 19 (type B), which code for components of the major proximal renal tubule cystine and dibasic amino acid transporter. Current clinical treatment of cystinuria aims to reduce the concentration of free cystine in urine and to increase its solubility. A high fluid intake of around 4-5 liters a day and alkalinization of urine pH with citrate or bicarbonate salt can suppress but may not completely prevent stone formation. At severe condition, chelation therapy is necessary, which utilizing the reaction of D-penicillamine or &#x3b1;-mercaptopropionylglycine with L-cystine to generate more soluble asymmetric disulfides. These drugs have side effects including loss of taste, fever, proteinuria, serum sickness-type reactions, and even frank nephritic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Recently, a group of researchers reported an alternative approach to prevent cystinuria based on crystal growth inhibition, which is achieved through the binding of tailored growth inhibitors-L-cystine dimethylester (CDME) and L-cystine methylester (CME) to specific crystal surfaces. Real-time in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that CDME and CME dramatically reduce the growth velocity of six symmetry-equivalent {100} steps because of specific binding at the crystal surface, which frustrates the attachment of L-cystine molecules. CDME almost completely inhibits the crystallization of L-cystine in water with concentrations above 2 mg/L. While in cell culture experiments, CDME causes loss of cell viability at approximately 1 mM, and in rats study, demonstrates adverse effects at dosages of approximately 500 mg/kg per day.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Even though CDME inhibits cystine stone formation in the in vitro study, the methyl esters in CDME are cleavable by the variety of esterases widely present in almost all organs and tissues, most abundantly in our digestive system, blood and liver. In addition, the ester-mediated hydrolysis of cystine esters will produce cystine, which would add to the already elevated levels of cystine in the kidneys and bladder and potentially increase the likelihood of cystine crystal formation and thus making the problem even worse. Therefore, there is a need for new and improved methods for treating cystinuria.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0008">The present invention addresses the shortcomings in the prior art including those outlined above by providing cystine analog compounds with enhanced ability to inhibit cystine crystal formations.

In at least one embodiment with respect to this aspect of the invention, the concentration of the L-cystine was assessed by a fluorescence assay. Accordingly, the inventors developed a fluorescence-based assay using O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and N-Boc-cysteine (NBC) to accurately measure the concentration of L-cystine in aqueous solutions using a similar protocol we previously reported. OPA/NBC are popular reagents used for precolumn derivatization of amino acids in HPLC. This derivatization is fast and simple to operate. However, the reaction of OPA with the disulfide cystine and NBC yielded derivatives with weak fluorescence. The disulfide in cystine was reduced and then alkylated with iodoacetic acid to form S-carboxymethylcysteine, which yielded OPA/NBS derivatives with normal fluorescence. L-Cystine solution was thus used to construct a standard curve. L-Cystine first reacted with DTT for 10 min, followed by reaction with iodoacetic acid for 15 min, then reacted with OPA and NBC for 3 min. The final mixture was pipetted into 384-well plate and the fluorescence intensity was read at Ex 340 nm/Em 460 nm. A linear standard curve was obtained in the concentration range between 50 &#x3bc;M and 400 &#x3bc;M (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Fluorescence Assay for Inhibition of L-Cystine Crystal Formation</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0120">Formation of supersaturation solution&#x2014;a supersaturated solution was formed by dissolving 21 mg of L-cystine in 30 mL of Millipore water (&#x2dc;3 mM) under reflux at 100&#xb0; C. for 20 min until the L-cystine was completely dissolved.

As LH708 has a polyamine core structure, it is concluded that LH708 may be absorbed similar to polyamines such as spermine or spermidine, rather than to cystine. This is an unexpected observation, as it suggests that other transporters (like polyamine transporters) are likely elevated in cystineuric mice (i.e. after knocking out the SLC3A1 gene) which worked in favor of LH708 availability, but not in LH707.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0148">Finally, the higher volumes of urine collected in LH708-treated mice as compared to before treatment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> suggests that LH708 could also be having diuretic effects as an additional benefit. As there were no significant changes in the urine concentration of other amino acids such as ornithine, lysine, arginine, proline, valine, leucine and phenylalanine, those of ordinary skill in the art can extrapolate that the diuretic effects are attributed to the compounds administered and/or the rise of urine cystine concentration during the treatment course (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0149">While certain of the embodiment of the present invention have been described and specifically exemplified above, it is not intended that the invention be limited to such embodiments.
