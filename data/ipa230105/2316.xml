Obesity has been shown to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes about ten-fold (Field et al., Arch Intern Med, 161: 1581-6 (2001). Even mild obesity increases the risk for premature death and conditions such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, gallbladder disease and certain types of cancer. The term Metabolic Syndrome has been coined to describe a cluster of interrelated common clinical conditions, including obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension and dyslipidemia (Reaven, (1988) Diabetes 37; 1595-1607). Metabolic syndrome, its components, conditions, and sequelae are a severe and increasing health problem world-wide (Zimmet et al., Obesity, 14:1-3, 2006).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">In certain embodiments, the subject matter described herein is directed to a compound of Formula II,</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="18.97mm" wi="61.47mm" file="US20230002317A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0007" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein J, ring M, J&#x2032;, w, q, P, D, G, N, R<sub>5</sub>, and R<sub>6 </sub>are defined herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0004">In certain embodiments, the subject matter described herein is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula II and a carrier acceptable for human administration.

The International Diabetes Federation consensus worldwide definition of the metabolic syndrome (2006) is: Central obesity AND any two of the following: raised triglycerides: &#x3e;150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality; reduced HDL cholesterol: &#x3c;40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in males, &#x3c;50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in females, or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality; raised blood pressure (BP): systolic BP&#x3e;130 or diastolic BP&#x3e;85 mm Hg, or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension; raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG): &#x3e;100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">&#x201c;Impaired insulin sensitivity&#x201d; is a condition in which one or more of the body's normal physiological responses to insulin are impaired or lost. Impaired insulin sensitivity in a subject is characterized by a reduced biological response to endogenous or exogenous insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with a number of conditions in humans, including increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Impaired insulin sensitivity is also a feature of metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of abnormalities that create risk for many of our most common medial conditions. Impaired insulin sensitivity can be determined by methods such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), IV glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), insulin sensitivity test (1ST), and continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment (CIGMA), or the glucose clamp.

The result of these defects is elevated blood glucose, referred to as &#x201c;hyperglycemia.&#x201d; Diabetes can be defined as a condition corresponding to a fasting plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l), or a plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) two hours after ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose load. Two major forms of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is generally the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone that regulates glucose utilization. Type 2 diabetes often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and can result from the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most Type 2 diabetic patients are insulin resistant (i.e., having impaired insulin sensitivity) and have a relative deficiency of insulin, in that insulin secretion cannot compensate for the resistance of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin. In addition, many type 2 diabetics are obese. Type 1.5 diabetes (late autoimmune onset in adults) shows some characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102">&#x201c;Obese&#x201d; and &#x201c;obesity&#x201d; are defined according to the World Health Organization, as a Body Mass Index (&#x201c;BMI&#x201d;) greater than or equal to 30 (BMI equals weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>)). Obesity is linked to a variety of medical conditions including diabetes II and hyperlipidemia. (see, e.g., Barrett-Conner E, Epidemol. Rev. (1989) 11: 172-181; and Knowler, et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr.

Impairment in this system results in transient hyperglycemia as the organism is unable to maintain normoglycemia following a glucose load (for example, a carbohydrate containing meal) because of insufficient secretion of insulin from the islet beta-cells or because of insensitivity of target tissues to circulating insulin. &#x201c;Impaired glucose tolerance&#x201d; can be defined as a plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) two hours after ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose load.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0105">&#x201c;Body mass index&#x201d; (BMI) is s a measure of body fat.

Exemplary methods of determining the stage of NASH are described, for example, in Kleiner et al., 2005, Hepatology, 41(6):1313-1321, and Brunt et al., 2007, Modern Pathol., 20: S40-S48.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111">A &#x201c;subject having NAFLD&#x201d; refers to a subject that has been diagnosed with NAFLD by a qualified medical professional as the most likely condition causing the patient's signs and symptoms. The diagnosis of NAFLD is often based on some or all of the following three criteria: zero or low-alcoholic intake, detection of steatosis either by imaging or by histology, and appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases (Hashimoto, J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2013 December; 28 Suppl 4:64-70). In some embodiments, NAFLD is suspected during a routine checkup, monitoring of metabolic syndrome and obesity, or monitoring for possible side effects of drugs (e.g., cholesterol lowering agents or steroids). In some instance, liver enzymes such AST and ALT are high. In some embodiments, a subject is diagnosed following abdominal or thoracic imaging, liver ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging. In some embodiments, other conditions such as excess alcohol consumption, hepatitis C, and Wilson's disease have been ruled out prior to an NAFLD diagnosis. In some embodiments, a subject has been diagnosed following a liver biopsy.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112">A &#x201c;subject having NASH&#x201d; refers to a subject that has been diagnosed with NASH by a qualified medical professional as the most likely condition causing the patient's signs and symptoms. The diagnosis of NASH is based on similar criterion to NAFLD with differentiation being on hepatocellular morphology including steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte ballooning with or without fibrosis. A biopsy is useful for identifying the characteristic pathology of NASH.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113">&#x201c;Primary sclerosing cholangitis&#x201d; or &#x201c;PSC&#x201d; refers to a chronic cholestatic condition that affects all sizes of bile ducts (Angulo, et al. Clinics in Liver Disease, 1999. 3 (3): p. 529-70; Angulo, et al. Hepatology, 1999. 30 (1): p. 325-32). As in PBC, the inflammation in PSC usually starts adjacent the biliary system resulting in cholestatic disease leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Up to about 80% of PSC cases are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, in particular ulcerative colitis. The disease can be complicated by the development of bile duct cancer in up to 15%. In addition, the incidence of pancreatic cancer and colonic cancer is increased relative to unaffected individuals. Diagnosis is usually based on the endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and/or magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC), which are showing the typical strictures and dilations in intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, along with the exclusion of other causes of the typical multifocal biliary strictures and intervening dilatations. On liver biopsy, periductular fibrosis with concentric layers of fibrous tissue called onion skin fibrosis can be observed. PSC is more common in men than women.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0114">&#x201c;Primary biliary cholangitis&#x201d; or &#x201c;PBC&#x201d; is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly targets the cholangiocytes of the interlobular bile ducts in the liver. The condition primarily affects middle-aged women. Without treatment, PBC generally progresses to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure over a period of 10-20 years. PBC is a rare disease with prevalence of less than 1/2000. PBC is thought to result from a combination of multiple genetic factors and superimposed environmental triggers. The contribution of the genetic predisposition is evidenced by the familial clustering. Several risk factors, including exposure to infectious agents and chemical xenobiotics, have been suggested. The detection of serum antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and increased levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) are biochemical features of this disease along with biochemical evidence of cholestasis with elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity. Histopathologically, it is characterized by portal inflammation and the slow progressive destruction of the portal interlobular bile ducts due to chronic non-suppurative cholangitis. The loss of bile ducts leads to cholestasis, which leads to further hepatic damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately, liver failure (Kaplan M, Gershwin M E. Primary biliary cirrhosis. N Engl J Med, 353, 2005, 1261-1273). There are three major forms of PBC. The typical or classical form is represented by the slowly progressive decline of small bile ducts and parallel increase in liver fibrosis, leading to biliary cirrhosis over a period of 10-20 years. A second form, which affects 10-20% of patients, is characterized by the fluctuating or persistent presence of the features of Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (R. Poupon Autoimmune overlapping syndromes, Clin Liver Dis, 7, 2003, pp. 865-878). These patients have a more severe disease course, with early development of liver fibrosis and liver failure. A third form, which affects 5-10% of patients, is represented by the so-called premature ductopenic variant (F. P. Vleggaar, H. R. van Buuren, P. E. Zondervan, F. J. ten Kate, W. C. Hop, Jaundice in non-cirrhotic primary biliary cirrhosis: the premature ductopenic variant, Gut, 49, 2001, 276-281). Its hallmark is a very rapid onset of ductopenia and severe icteric cholestasis, progressing very quickly towards cirrhosis in less than 5 years.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">An &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d; is a molecule which, when bound to a target protein (such as Shc), decreases the amount (expression) or the duration of the effect of the biological or immunological activity of the target protein.

Mice were fed the Liver fibrosis-inducing Methionine Choline-Deficient (MCD) Mouse model NASH for 8 weeks, and the last 4 weeks they were dosed orally with 20 mg/kg of compound number 3 (RTX60933293), compound number 5 (RTX73145433), or placebo. After 8 weeks of MCD dosing, mice were sacrificed, and livers were extracted for nucleic acids and classical markers of liver fibrosis were assayed by QRTPCR. In this treatment regimen, compounds 3 and 5 significantly reduced many standard markers of NASH liver fibrosis, including: (A), alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA); (B), Collagen 1a1 (Col1); (C), Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-b); (D), Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2); and (E), Tissue metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). In addition, the classical liver fibrosis bio marker hydroxyproline was measured, and both compounds 3 and 5 significantly reduced this marker. *=p&#x3c;0.05; **=p&#x3c;0.01</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0124">I. General</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">The subject matter described herein identifies novel She inhibitors identified by a combination of in silico screening and various bioassays. These compounds are useful for treating impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">II. Shc Protein</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">Unless otherwise apparent from the context, Shc refers to human Shc-1, for which the canonical form (p66Shc) is assigned Swiss Prot P29353. Allelic variants and isoforms of the canonical form are also included. The canonical form has 583 amino acids. Residues 156-339 constitute a phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Residues 488-579 constitute a SH2 domain. At least three Shc protein isoforms including the canonical form are known to exist in mammals. These isoforms originate from alternative splicing followed by usage of alternative start codons at a single DNA locus and are p66Shc-minor, p52Shc-major (Swiss Prot P29353-2) or the metabolic isoform, and p46Shc&#x2014;the mitochondrial isoform (Swiss-Prot P29353-3). P52Shc and p46Shc differ from the canonical form in omission of amino acids 1-110 and 1-155 respectively. Thus, the PTB domain runs from residues 378 to 469 in p52Shc and residues 333-424 in p46Shc.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">Shc proteins are essential for insulin sensitivity and regulation of fuel selection by cells. Glucose metabolism is regulated by insulin. When sugar is not available, the cells switch on utilizing lipids, ketone bodies and proteins. Shc proteins are adaptors which interact with receptor tyrosine kinases and transmit growth signals towards induction of protein synthesis and cell division, and are known to interact with the insulin receptor by way of the phospho tyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Shc proteins also oppose metabolic insulin signaling, thus regulating fuel selection by the cell. The p52Shc isoform is preferred to identify compounds for Shc PTB domain binding because it is the most highly expressed of all Shc isoforms and is correctly folded and non-toxic in many mammalian cells lines.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">III.

Any of these factors can be taken into consideration when determining a subject's risk of obesity.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0221">Some genes implicated in developing type 2 diabetes encode the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8), the calpain 10 enzyme (CAPN10), the glucagon receptor (GCGR), the enzyme glucokinase (GCK), the glucose transporter (GLUT2), the transcription factor HNF4A, the insulin hormone (INS), the insulin receptor (INSR), the potassium channel KCNJ11, the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the transcription factor PPAR gamma, the regulatory subunit of phosphorylating enzyme (PIK3R1) and others. These genes can be evaluated when identifying a subject who may benefit from the present methods. About 18 regions of the genome have been linked with type 1 diabetes risk (see, e.g., Dean et al., &#x201c;The Genetic Landscape of Diabetes,&#x201d; National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)). These regions, each of which may contain several genes, have been labeled IDDM1 to IDDM18. The most well-studied is IDDM1, which contains the HLA genes that encode immune response proteins. There are two other non-HLA genes which have been identified thus far. One, IDDM2, is the insulin gene, and the other maps close to CTLA4, which has a regulatory role in the immune response.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0222">The present methods are also useful in suppressing the negative sequelae associated with impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions.

Methods of Treatment and Prophylaxis</p><p id="p-0219" num="0231">The subject may already exhibit symptoms of a condition or be diagnosed as having impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component condition. In such subjects, administration of the present compounds can reverse or delay progression of and or reduce the severity of symptoms.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0232">The effectiveness of treatment can be determined by comparing a baseline measure of a parameter of a condition before administration of the present compounds is commenced to the same parameter one or more time points after the present compounds has been administered. The parameter of a condition can be one or more of the signs or symptoms of impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions described herein. Measurement of a level of various biomarkers described herein in response to treatment can indicate that treatment is effective.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0233">In certain embodiments, the compounds of Formula II are useful in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of amyloidogenic diseases and conditions that are characterized by the presence of deposits of amyloid proteins, such as amylin or A&#x3b2; peptide. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and cognitive impairment, type II diabetes, Parkinson's disease, amyloidoses such as hereditary or systemic amyloidoses, and diseases caused all or in part by prion infection.

For example, subjects may be asymptomatic but judged to be at high risk based on genetic tests, or other predictive tests. Alternatively, the subject may be exhibiting symptoms of early stages of a condition. In such subjects, administration of one of the present compounds can inhibit or delay onset or progression of conditions into later stages of conditions, and/or reduce the severity of the condition once present.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0235">Measurable parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of the prevention regime are as discussed herein for therapy and monitoring.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0236">VII. Formulation and Administration of Compounds</p><p id="p-0225" num="0237">a. Formulation</p><p id="p-0226" num="0238">The compounds described herein or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered orally, parenterally, (intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), depo-IM, subcutaneously (SQ), and depo-SQ), sublingually, intranasally (e.g., inhalation, nasal mist or drops), intrathecally, topically, transmucosally, bucally, sublingually, ionophoretically or rectally.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0239">Compositions are provided that contain therapeutically effective amounts of one of the present compounds. The compounds are preferably formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, capsules, or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0240">The present compounds can be administered in the &#x201c;native&#x201d; form or, if desired, in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, derivatives, and the like, provided the salt, ester, amide, prodrug or derivative is suitable pharmacologically, i.e., effective in the present method(s). Salts, esters, amides, prodrugs and other derivatives of the compounds can be prepared using standard procedures described, for example, by March (1992) Advanced Organic Chemistry; Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 4th Ed. N.Y. Wiley-Interscience. Prodrugs of the compounds readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Conversion usually occurs after administration to a subject.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0241">Such derivatives can be formulated by conventional methods. For example, the disulfide salts of a number of delivery agents are described in WO 2000/059863 which is incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, acid salts of compounds can be prepared from the free base using conventional methodology that typically involves reaction with a suitable acid. Generally, the base form of the drug is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol and the acid is added thereto. The resulting salt either precipitates or can be brought out of solution by addition of a less polar solvent. Suitable acids for preparing acid addition salts include to both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid, carboxylic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, suberic acid, lactic acid, benzene sulfonic acid, p-tolylsulfonic acid, arginine, glucuronic acid, galactunoric acid phthalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid isobutyric, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like (see, e.g., Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66, 1-19 (1977).</p><p id="p-0230" num="0242">Although compounds can be supplied in the form of an HCl salt, acid salts with weaker acids (e.g., pKa 1-6-9 or preferably pKa 4-6.5) are preferred for parenteral administration. An acid addition salt can be reconverted to the free base by treatment with a suitable base. Preferred acid addition salts include halide salts, such as may be prepared using hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. Basic salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared in a similar manner using a pharmaceutically acceptable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, trimethylamine, or the like. For example, basic salts can include alkali metal salts, e.g., the sodium salt, and copper salts.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0243">For the preparation of salt forms of basic drugs, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH lower than the pKa of the drug. Similarly, for the preparation of salt forms of acidic drugs, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH higher than the pKa of the drug. This permits the counterion to bring the solution's pH to a level lower than the pHmax to reach the salt plateau, at which the solubility of salt prevails over the solubility of free acid or base. The generalized rule of difference in pKa units of the ionizable group in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the acid or base is meant to make the proton transfer energetically favorable. When the pKa of the API and counterion are not significantly different, a solid complex may form but may rapidly disproportionate (i.e., break down into the individual entities of drug and counterion) in an aqueous environment.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0244">Preferably, the counterion is a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion. Suitable anionic salt forms include acetate, benzoate, besylate, benzylate, bitartrate, bromide, carbonate, chloride, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, iodide, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methyl bromide, methyl sulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, pamoate (embonate), phosphate and diphosphate, salicylate and disalicylate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate, triethiodide, valerate, and the like. Suitable cationic salt forms include aluminum, benzathine, calcium, ethylene diamine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, potassium, procaine, sodium, tromethamine, zinc, and the like.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0245">Preparation of esters can typically involve functionalization of hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups that are present within the molecular structure of the compound. For example, the esters are typically acyl-substituted derivatives of free alcohol groups, i.e., moieties that are derived from carboxylic acids of the formula RCOOH where R is alky, and preferably is lower alkyl. Esters can be reconverted to the free acids, if desired, by using conventional hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis procedures.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0246">Amides can also be prepared using techniques described in the pertinent literature. For example, amides may be prepared from esters, using suitable amine reactants, or they may be prepared from an anhydride or an acid chloride by reaction with ammonia or a lower alkyl amine.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0247">About 1 to 1000 mg of a compound is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, and so forth, in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in those compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1-1000 mg, 2-800 mg, 5-500 mg, 10-400 mg, 50-200 mg, e.g., about 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40 mg, 45 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 700 mg, 800 mg, 900 mg or 1000 mg of the active ingredient. The term &#x201c;unit dosage from&#x201d; refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary (i.e., single) dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0248">To prepare compositions, the one or more compounds is mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. On mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion, or the like. Liposomal suspensions may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for lessening or ameliorating at least one symptom of the condition may be empirically determined.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0249">Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. In addition, the active materials can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, or have another action. The compounds may be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0250">Where the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing may be used. Such methods include, using cosolvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants such as Tween&#x2122;, and dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the compounds, such as salts or prodrugs may also be used in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0251">The concentration of the one or more compounds is effective for delivery of an amount upon administration that lessens or ameliorates at least one symptom of the condition for which the compound is administered and/or that is effective in a prophylactic context. Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage (e.g., daily) administration.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0252">The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in known in vitro and in vivo model systems for the treated condition. A therapeutically or prophylactically effective dose can be determined by first administering a low dose, and then incrementally increasing until a dose is reached that achieves the desired effect with minimal or no undesired side effects.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0253">The compounds described herein, derivatives and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be enclosed in multiple or single dose containers.

Optionally, such containers contain a unit dose for single administration.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0254">The concentration and/or amount of active compound in the drug composition depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0255">The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. The precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the condition being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. Concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens can be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0256">If oral administration is desired, the compound can be provided in a formulation that protects it from the acidic environment of the stomach. For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0257">Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier and may be compressed into tablets or enclosed in gelatin capsules. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound or compounds can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, capsules, or troches. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0258">The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can contain any of the following ingredients or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as, gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch, or gelatin; an excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, or lactose; a disintegrating agent such as, alginic acid and corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant, such as, colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; and a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or fruit flavoring.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0259">When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials, which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, medicated chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings, and flavors.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0260">The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0261">Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, a naturally occurring vegetable oil such as sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and the like, or a synthetic fatty vehicle such as ethyl oleate, and the like, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers such as acetates, citrates, and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride and dextrose.

Liposomal suspensions including tissue-targeted liposomes may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0263">The present compounds may be prepared with carriers that protect them against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release formulations or coatings. Controlled release is a mechanism of formulation to release a drug over an extended time. Use of controlled release formulation may reduce the frequency of administration, reduce fluctuations in blood concentration and protect the gastrointestinal tract from side effects. The active compounds may be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release formulations or coating. Such carriers include controlled release formulations (also known as modified, delayed, extended or sustained release or gastric retention dosage forms, such as the Depomed GR&#x2122; system in which agents are encapsulated by polymers that swell in the stomach and are retained for about eight hours, sufficient for daily dosing of many drugs). Controlled release systems include microencapsulated delivery systems, implants and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid, matrix controlled release devices, osmotic controlled release devices, multiparticulate controlled release devices, ion-exchange resins, enteric coatings, multilayered coatings, microspheres, liposomes, and combinations thereof. The release rate of the active ingredient can also be modified by varying the particle size of the active ingredient(s). Examples of modified release include, e.g., those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; 5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; 5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6, 113,943; 6, 197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; 6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0264">b) Route of Administration and Dosing</p><p id="p-0253" num="0265">The compounds can be administered orally, parenterally (IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo-SQ), sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intraspinally, intrathecally, topically, or rectally.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0266">The compounds can be administered enterally or parenterally. Oral formulations include tablets and capsules as well as liquid dosage forms such as solutions, suspensions, and elixirs. When the solid dosage forms are used, it is preferred that they be of the sustained release type so that the one or more active agents need to be administered only once or twice daily (or less frequency).</p><p id="p-0255" num="0267">The oral dosage forms can be administered to the patient 1, 2, 3, or 4 times daily or less frequently, such as on alternate days, every third day, twice a week or once a week. It is preferred that the one or more active agents be administered either three or fewer times, more preferably once or twice daily. Oral dosage forms are preferably designed so as to protect the one or more active agents from the acidic environment of the stomach, such as by enteric coated or by use of capsules filled with small spheres each coated to protect from the acidic stomach.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0268">When administered orally, an administered amount therapeutically effective to prevent, mitigate or treat impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, aging, metabolic syndrome, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions is from about 0.1 mg/day to about 200 mg/day, for example, from about 1 mg/day to about 100 mg/day, for example, from about 5 mg/day to about 50 mg/day. The subject can be administered a compound at a dose of about 0.05 to about 0.50 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, for example, about 0.05 mg/kg, 0.10 mg/kg, 0.20 mg/kg, 0.33 mg/kg, 0.50 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. Although a patient may be started at one dose, that dose may be varied (increased or decreased, as appropriate) over time as the patient's condition changes. Depending on outcome evaluations, higher doses may be used. For example, in certain subjects, up to as much as 1000 mg/day can be administered, e.g., 200 mg/day, 300 mg/day, 400 mg/day, 500 mg/day, 600 mg/day, 700 mg/day, 800 mg/day, 900 mg/day or 1000 mg/day.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0269">The present compounds can also be delivered in a nano crystal dispersion formulation (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 or 6,045,829). The nano crystalline formulations typically afford greater bioavailability of drug compounds.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0270">The present compounds can be administered parenterally, for example, by IV, IM, depo-IM, SC, or depo-SC. When administered parenterally, a therapeutically effective amount of about 0.5 to about 1000 mg/day, preferably from about 5 to about 500 or 50-200 mg daily should be delivered. The parenteral dosage form can be a depo formulation in which case a larger amount of drug can be administered with reduced frequency.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0271">The present compounds can be administered sublingually. When given sublingually, the one or more active agents and/or analogs thereof can be given one to four times daily in the amounts described above for IM administration.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0272">The present compounds can be administered intranasally.

The dosage of the one or more active agents and/or analogs thereof for intranasal administration is the amount described above for IM administration.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0273">The present compounds can be administered intrathecally in a parenteral formulation. The dosage of the one or more active agents and/or analogs thereof for intrathecal administration is the amount described above for IM administration.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0274">The present compounds can be administered topically or transdermally. When given by this route, the appropriate dosage form is a cream, ointment, or patch. When administered topically, the dosage can be from about 0.5 mg/day to about 200 mg/day. Because the amount that can be delivered by a patch is limited, two or more patches may be used. The number and size of the patch is not important, what is important is that a therapeutically effective amount of the one or more active agents and/or analogs thereof be delivered. The one or more active agents and/or analogs thereof can be administered rectally by suppository. When administered by suppository, the therapeutically effective amount can be from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0275">The present compounds can be administered by implants. When administering one or more active agents by implant, the therapeutically effective amount is the amount described above for depot administration.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0276">The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, general physical condition of the particular patient, and other medication the individual may be taking.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0277">VII. Combination Therapies</p><p id="p-0266" num="0278">The present compounds can be used in combination with each other or with other therapeutic agents or approaches used to treat, mitigate or prevent impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions. For example, the one or more active agents described herein and/or analogs thereof can be co-administered with insulin. Insulin is frequently required in patients with long standing diabetes mellitus, and one or more active agents described herein may lower the insulin requirements. Insulin at high doses may have a proatherogenic effect. The combination drug will, therefore, have multiple benefits compared to insulin alone.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0279">The present compounds can be co-administered with other diabetes drugs and obesity drugs. Diabetes drugs suitable for combination therapy include sulfonylurea agents such as glipizide, glyburide (glibenclamide), chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, tolazamide and glimepiride, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof (see, e.g., U.S. 2003/008869); biguanide agents such as metformin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms (see, e.g., U.S. patent Pub. No. 2003/0018028); thiazolidinedione agents pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof (see, e.g., U.S. 2002/0198203); alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as miglitol or acarbose, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof (see, e.g., U.S. 2003/0013709); antilipemic agents (also known as antihyperlipidemic agents) such as bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nicotinic acid compounds (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0198202); angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as quinapril, ramipril, verapamil, captopril, diltiazem, clonidine, hydrochlorothiazide, benazepril, prazosin, fosinopril, lisinopril, atenolol, enalapril, perindopril, perindopril tert-butylamine, trandolapril and moexipril, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0055058); aldose reductase inhibitors (preventing eye and nerve damage in people with diabetes) such as minalrestat Tolrestat, Sorbinil, Methosorbinil, Zopolrestat, Epalrestat, Zenarestat Imirestat, and Ponalrestat or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0198201). Obesity drugs suitable for combination therapy include central nervous system (CNS) stimulants such as phentermines (e.g., those sold under the tradenames Ionamin&#xae; and Adipex-P&#xae;) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,594). The phentermines are members of a class of drugs known as the sympathomimetics for their ability to mimic stimulation of the central nervous system; re-uptake inhibitors such as 5HT-2C inhibitors (e.g., Meridia&#xae; (sibutramine), Lorcaserin (APD-356)) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,629); CB-1 antagonists such as rimonabant (Acomplia&#xae;) and CP-945598 (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,941); and GLP-1 agonists or mimetics such as exenatide (Byetta&#xae;) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,286).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0280">IX. Monitoring Efficacy</p><p id="p-0269" num="0281">Clinical efficacy can be monitored by measuring one or more of the condition parameters or physical symptoms of impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions, including blood pressure, blood insulin, free fatty acid, bodyweight, triglyceride levels, blood glucose levels, high body mass index. Observation of the stabilization, improvement and/or reversal of one or more symptoms indicates that the treatment or prophylaxis regime is efficacious. Observation of the progression, increase or exacerbation of one or more symptoms indicates that the treatment or prophylaxis regime is not efficacious.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0282">Clinical efficacy can also be monitored using biomarkers. Biomarkers for assessing treatment are preferably assessed at the protein level, but measurement of mRNA encoding biomarkers can also be used as a surrogate measure of biomarker expression. Such a level can be measured in a blood sample, e.g., on PBMC's. The level of some biomarkers are reduced in subjects with impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions relative to a control population of normal individuals (i.e., free of known conditions). An increase in level of such a marker provides an indication of a favorable treatment response, whereas an unchanged or decreasing levels provides an indication of unfavorable or at least non-optimal treatment response. The level of other biomarkers is increased in subjects with impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, PSC, PBC, or other metabolic syndrome component conditions relative to a control population of normal individuals. An decrease in level of such a biomarker provides an indication of a favorable treatment response, whereas an unchanged or increasing levels provides an indication of unfavorable or at least non-optimal treatment response.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0283">The monitoring methods can entail determining a baseline value of a measurable biomarker or condition parameter in a subject before administering a dosage of the one or more active agents described herein, and comparing this with a value for the same measurable biomarker or parameter after a course of treatment.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0284">In other methods, a control value (i.e., a mean and standard deviation) of the measurable biomarker or parameter is determined for a control population. A suitable control population is one in which subjects have not received prior treatment and do not have a target condition, nor are at known risk of developing a target condition. In such methods, if the value of the measurable biomarker or clinical parameter approaches the control value, then treatment is considered efficacious. In other methods, the individuals in the control population have not received prior treatment and have been diagnosed with a target condition. In such methods, if the value of the measurable biomarker or clinical parameter approaches the control value, then treatment is considered inefficacious.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0285">In other methods, a subject who is not presently receiving treatment but has undergone a previous course of treatment is monitored for one or more of the biomarkers or clinical parameters to determine whether a resumption of treatment is required. The measured value of one or more of the biomarkers or clinical parameters in the subject can be compared with a value previously achieved in the subject after a previous course of treatment. Alternatively, the value measured in the subject can be compared with a control value (mean plus standard deviation or preferably two standard deviations) determined in population of subjects after undergoing a course of treatment. Alternatively, the measured value in the subject can be compared with a control value in populations of prophylactically treated subjects who remain free of symptoms of a condition, or populations of therapeutically treated subjects who show amelioration of the condition's characteristics. In such cases, if the value of the measurable biomarker or clinical parameter approaches the control value, then treatment is considered efficacious and need not be resumed. On the other hand, a significant difference relative to the control level (i.e., more than one or preferably two standard deviations) is an indicator that treatment should be resumed in the subject.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0286">The subject matter described herein is directed to the following embodiments: 1B.

Thus, peripheral cells become more sensitive per molecule insulin, and consequently more glucose tolerant. This prediction is borne out in the Corticosteroid model. Corticosterone is a known model of Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome, as Corticosterone induces peripheral insulin insensitivity.

There is a usual progression from NAFLD (fatty liver) to the more fibrotic/cirrhotic NASH. While the precise mechanism of the transition of NAFLD to NASH is not completely understood, hepatocyte death and resulting fibrosis has been proposed. Fibrosis and fibrotic scarring are thought to be the most important pathophysiological endpoints to end-stage NASH, which typically necessitates an expensive and difficult liver transplant. As shown in other examples, Shc blockers through their sensitization to insulin, IGF-1 and other growth factors, are cytoprotective. Thus, by inhibiting hepatocyte death which promotes fibrosis, they should also be anti-fibrotic. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when fed to mice on the strongly liver fibrotic MCD diet, Shc blockers significantly reduced 6 out of 6 biomarkers of liver fibrosis, which suggests that they could be of benefit in human liver fibrosis.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 2: Synthetic Preparation of Compounds of Formula II</heading><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2A: Preparation of RTX73145433 (Compound 5)</heading><p id="p-0377" num="0560">Scheme 1 depicts the preparation of an exemplary compound.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00105" num="00105"><img id="EMI-C00105" he="107.70mm" wi="153.67mm" file="US20230002317A1-20230105-C00105.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00106" num="00106"><img id="EMI-C00106" he="187.28mm" wi="120.82mm" file="US20230002317A1-20230105-C00106.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0379" num="0561">Step A: TMSCN, SnI<sub>2</sub>, in Et<sub>2</sub>O. 18 h, rt (Linn, J.
