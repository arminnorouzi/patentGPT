Obviously, the described embodiments It is a part of the embodiments of the present application, but not all of the embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, this embodiment provides an electric connector comprising a male terminal <b>1</b> and a female terminal <b>2</b>, and the male terminal <b>1</b> and the female terminal <b>2</b> are electrically connected together in a detachable manner. The male terminal <b>1</b> comprises a first connecting member <b>11</b>, a first elastic member <b>12</b>, a first wire opening <b>13</b>, and a first connecting opening <b>14</b>. The first elastic member <b>12</b> can apply pressure to a wire to make the conductor of the wire closely abutted against the first connecting member <b>11</b>. The first elastic member <b>12</b> and the wire pass through the first wire opening <b>13</b> and are mounted in the male terminal <b>1</b>, and the first connecting member <b>11</b> passes through the first connecting opening <b>14</b> and is mounted in the male terminal <b>1</b> to establish the electrical connection of the first connecting member <b>11</b> to the conductor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above embodiment, a first wire opening <b>13</b> is defined on one of the outer ends of the male terminal <b>1</b> to allow an external conductor to be clamped in the conductive element of the male terminal <b>1</b>, which facilitates further electric connection to the female terminal <b>2</b> and thus electric connection to a conductor externally connected at one side of the female terminal <b>2</b>. A first connecting opening <b>14</b> disposed opposite to the first wire opening <b>13</b> is defined on the other outer end of the male terminal <b>1</b>, and the first connecting opening <b>14</b> is used to disassemble and assemble with the female terminal <b>2</b>. The first connecting member <b>11</b> and the first elastic member <b>12</b> are separately provided so that the first elastic member <b>12</b> is configured to be able to pass through the first wire opening <b>13</b> and be mounted and limited in the terminal. Also, the first connecting member <b>11</b> is configured to be able to pass through the first opening and firmly mounted at the mounting position in the terminal. In this way, a clamping opening capable of elastically clamping the conductor is defined between the first elastic member <b>12</b> and the first connecting member <b>11</b>. Therefore, the elastic force provided by the first elastic member <b>12</b> to the conductor in the clamping direction enables the conductor to stably and closely contact the first connecting member <b>11</b> to achieve an electric connection.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this configuration, it is ensured that the two conductive elements in the male terminal <b>1</b> can be disassembled and assembled in different horizontal directions so that the assembly of the first connecting member <b>11</b> can be highly adapted to the plugging operation of the conductor in the terminal. Specifically, when a conductor is inserted at the side of the first wire opening <b>13</b>, the first connecting member <b>11</b> receives a thrust along the insertion direction and mechanically and electrically contacts and fits the conductive element in the female terminal <b>2</b>. Further, when the conductor is pulled out at the side of the first wire opening <b>13</b>, the first connecting member <b>11</b> receives a pulling force along the pulling-out direction consistent with the assembling direction of the first connecting member <b>11</b>. In this way, the first connecting member <b>11</b> is further mounted in place so that it is firmly confined in the mounting position. Therefore, the movement and detachment of the first connecting member <b>11</b> can be effectively prevented, thus maintaining the formed elastic force stable.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Among them, one of the embodiments of the above-mentioned conductor is an electric wire with an insulating layer peeled off at the end. Moreover, the conductive element of the male terminal <b>1</b> can be, but is not limited to, components such as electrical connectors and elastic members.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the male terminal <b>1</b> is provided with a first mounting cavity <b>15</b> and a second mounting cavity <b>16</b> communicating with each other. The first mounting cavity <b>15</b> is located at the side of the first wire opening <b>13</b> and communicates with the first wire opening <b>13</b>. Correspondingly, the second mounting cavity <b>16</b> is located at the side of the first connecting opening <b>14</b> and communicates with the first connecting opening <b>14</b>. The first wire opening <b>13</b> and the first connecting opening <b>14</b> are engaged and matched via the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> and the second mounting cavity <b>16</b> to form a wire insertion space in the male terminal <b>1</b> which facilitates the entry of the conductor along the wire openings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Among them, a partition plate <b>17</b> is provided between the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> and the second mounting cavity <b>16</b>, and the partition plate <b>17</b> is arranged in the male terminal <b>1</b> to define two different mounting cavities so that the power supply connector and the elastic member can be assembled and matched properly.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, an inner lower part of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> is provided with a first clamping protrusion <b>151</b> and a limiting groove <b>152</b> for mounting of both sides of the first connecting member. The first connecting member <b>11</b> is provided with a hollow opening <b>113</b> matched with the first clamping protrusion <b>151</b> and a step <b>114</b> matched with the partition plate <b>17</b>. Therefore, the first connecting member <b>11</b> enters along the first connecting opening <b>14</b> until it reaches its mounting position. On the one hand, the hollow opening <b>113</b> is engaged with the first clamping protrusion <b>151</b> to ensure that the electric connector is mounted in place in the male terminal <b>1</b>. On the other hand, through the in-place cooperation between the partition plate <b>17</b> and the corresponding step <b>114</b> of the electric connector, the accurate mounting and alignment are achieved, and the assembly is achieved well. The second mounting cavity <b>16</b> and the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> are communicated through a through opening opened at the partition plate <b>17</b>, to allow the first connecting member <b>11</b> to enter the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> along the through opening, and the step <b>114</b> is precisely matched with the through opening.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, an upper part of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> is provided with mounting grooves <b>154</b> for mounting of both sides of the first elastic member <b>12</b> and a second clamping protrusion <b>153</b> that restricts the first elastic member <b>12</b> at its mounting position. The second clamping protrusion <b>153</b> cooperates with the first elastic member <b>12</b> to prevent the first elastic member <b>12</b> from detaching towards the first wire opening <b>13</b>. The specific matching of the second clamping protrusion <b>153</b> and the first elastic member <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, is achieved in that the male terminal <b>1</b> is formed with the second clamping protrusion <b>153</b> on the inner wall of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b>, and the first elastic member <b>12</b> is provided with a support arm <b>1232</b> that cooperates with the second clamping protrusion <b>153</b>. The support arm <b>1232</b> is arranged obliquely in the form of an elastic piece on the end surface of the first elastic member <b>12</b> facing the clamping protrusion, and the inclination direction of the support arm <b>1232</b> is provided such as to protrude outward along the mounting direction of the first elastic member <b>12</b>, to facilitate smooth matching into the clamping protrusion. Further, after the clamping, a limit match can be formed between the support arm <b>1232</b> and the clamping protrusion to prevent the elastic member from running out of position during the process of plugging and unplugging the conductor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the above, any of the engaging protrusions are configured as an oblique body with a guiding slope, and the guiding slope is oriented to facilitate the gradually inclined arrangement of the electric connector/elastic member in the direction of the respective mounting and assembly to quickly assemble in place.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, at least one side of the first elastic member <b>12</b> is provided with a clamping portion <b>1231</b>, and the clamping portion <b>1231</b> is clamped with the mounting groove <b>154</b> to generate movement resistance. Therefore, the first elastic member <b>12</b> is assembled into the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> along the assembly direction and is inserted into the mounting groove <b>154</b> through the clamping portion <b>1231</b> to be slidably fitted until the first elastic member <b>12</b> is mounted in place.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specifically, a stop portion is provided on the mounting groove <b>154</b>, and the stop portion is matched with an end of the first elastic member <b>12</b>. The stop portion is formed on an inner end of the mounting groove <b>154</b>, and the first elastic member <b>12</b> moves until the clamping portion <b>1231</b> of the first elastic member <b>12</b> engages with the stop portion, to be firmly confined in the first mounting cavity <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the left and right sides of the first elastic member <b>12</b> are both provided with a clamping portion <b>1231</b>, and the mounting grooves <b>154</b> are correspondingly arranged on both sides of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b>.

The inner end side of the elastic arm <b>121</b> is arranged to face the limiting arms <b>122</b> to form the aforementioned notch <b>124</b> to allow the elastic arm <b>121</b> to deform elastically only in the path of the notch <b>124</b>, thereby avoiding elastic failure of the elastic arm <b>121</b>. The outer end side of the elastic arm <b>121</b> is arranged to face the first connecting member <b>11</b> to form the aforementioned clamping opening. The elastic arm <b>121</b> obliquely abuts on the connecting arm <b>123</b> and is fitted with and supported by the connecting arm <b>123</b>. In addition, the first elastic member <b>12</b> in the shape of a triangle is arranged on one side of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b>, and the first connecting member <b>11</b> with a bar-shaped body is oppositely arranged on the other side of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> to form a clamping opening with elastic force. In this way, it is ensured that the external conductor is clamped by each of two independent components, and the elastic clamping effect is significant.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one of the embodiments, the clamping portions <b>1231</b> are arranged on the left and right sides of the connecting arm <b>123</b>, and the support arm <b>1232</b> are arranged protrudingly on the outer end side of the connecting arm <b>123</b>. In addition, the connecting arm <b>123</b> is supported and arranged in the first mounting cavity <b>15</b> to provide a stable and effective elastic support for the elastic arm <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the male terminal <b>1</b> is provided with a plurality of wire openings side by side and connecting openings matched with the wire openings, and the configuration of the female terminal <b>2</b> is identical to that of the male terminal <b>1</b> to facilitate plug-in fitting of the male and female terminals.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, correspondingly, the female terminal <b>2</b> comprises a second connecting member <b>21</b>, a second elastic member <b>22</b>, a second wire opening <b>23</b>, and a second connecting opening <b>24</b>. The second elastic member <b>22</b> can apply pressure to a wire to make a conductor of the wire closely abutted against the second connecting member <b>21</b>. The second elastic member <b>22</b> and the wire pass through the second wire opening <b>23</b> and are mounted in the female terminal <b>2</b>, and the second connecting member <b>21</b> passes through the second connecting opening <b>24</b> and is mounted in the female terminal <b>2</b> to realize the electric connection of the second connecting member <b>21</b> and the conductor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above, the second elastic member <b>22</b> is mounted in the female terminal through the second wire opening <b>23</b>, and the second connecting member <b>21</b> is fixedly mounted in the female terminal <b>2</b> through the second connecting opening <b>24</b> to prevent the second connecting member <b>21</b> from detaching out of the mounting position when receiving a pulling force towards the second wire opening <b>23</b>. In addition, for the structural configuration, working principle, and implementation of the conductive elements in the female terminal <b>2</b>, reference can be made to the related content of the first connecting member <b>11</b> and the first elastic member <b>12</b> of the male terminal <b>1</b>, which will not be repeated herein. In addition, the elastic clamping fit of the electric connecting member and the elastic member of the female terminal <b>2</b> in the mounting cavity, as well as the mounting and limiting thereof, are generally consistent with the specific configuration of the electric connecting member and the elastic member of the male terminal <b>1</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, it is particularly critical that the male terminal <b>1</b> and the female terminal <b>2</b> can be snap-fitted with each other when the two terminals are joined. The housing of the male terminal <b>1</b> on the side of the first connecting opening <b>14</b> is configured to be snap-fitted and embedded in the second connecting opening <b>24</b> of the female terminal <b>2</b> to form a male-female-connection mode of disassembly and assembly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first connecting member <b>11</b> comprises an electric connecting section <b>111</b> connected to the conductor and a mating section <b>112</b> electrically connected to the second connecting member <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>2</b>. The electric connecting section <b>111</b> is closely abutted against the bottom surface of the first mounting cavity <b>15</b>, and the mating section <b>112</b> is closely abutted against the bottom surface of the second mounting cavity <b>16</b>. Therefore, the electric connecting member is stably supported inside the male terminal <b>1</b> to achieve a stable electric connection.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the two terminals are assembled, the conductive elements in each terminal are brought into contact to achieve an electric connection. Specifically, the second connecting member <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>2</b> and the first connecting member <b>11</b> of the male terminal <b>1</b> realize disassembly and assembly in a manner of end butting. The second connecting member <b>21</b> is in the shape of a plate, and one end thereof is bent and sunk to form a fork-shaped elastic structure <b>212</b>. The mating section <b>112</b> of the first connecting member <b>11</b> is configured to extend upward to form an enclosed structure. After the terminals are joined, the fork-shape elastic structure <b>212</b> is elastically clamped and arranged in the enclosed structure so that the two electric connecting members are tightly clamped so as to be mechanically and electrically butted together.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In particular, the plug-in fitting formed by the bending and sinking of one end of the electric connector can adapt to the mutual butting between the two electric connecting members, making the mounting positions of the electric connecting members at their respective terminals more flexible. The floating range that allows the two ends to be effectively joined is larger, and the operability of the quick connection and quick disassembly is significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">This embodiment also provides an LED lamp.
