The contents of this application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a sample holder system for particle beam microscopy, that is to say microscopy systems that operate with a beam of charged particles, such as for example scanning electron microscopes (SEM) or ion beam microscopes (focused beam, FIB). Imaging, analysis and/or processing of a microscopic sample using such a particle beam microscope frequently involves orienting the sample in a specific way in three-dimensional space.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spatial orientation of a sample is understood to mean the alignment of the sample in relation to an optical axis, with the spatial orientation of the sample being a result of the sample being turned about one or more axes. Turning of the sample about an axis that extends parallel to the optical axis of the particle beam microscope is referred to here as rotation of the sample. Turning of the sample about an axis that is aligned perpendicular to the axis of rotation is referred to as inclination of the sample, or in the following text also as tilting of the sample.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To enable tilting of the sample in a microscope system, various solutions are known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a sample stage (five-axis stage) with a tilt axis can be made available in the particle beam microscope. Sample stages typically comprise at least three translational axes (x, y, z) and two rotation axes (R, T). One of the rotation axes serves as tilt axis T, which is arranged perpendicular to the other axis of rotation R. The rotation axis R is typically aligned parallel to one of the optical axes of the microscope system. In general, the sample is applied to a flat sample holder, which in turn is mounted on the sample stage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When using a five-axis sample stage, the alignment of the tilt axis T in relation to the other movement axes is generally fixed. In order to tilt the sample into a specific spatial orientation, the tilt of the sample about the tilt axis T can be combined with a rotation of the sample stage about the rotation axis R or rotated mounting of the sample on the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, not every particle beam microscope has a sample stage with a tilt axis. Simple particle beam microscopes are often not equipped with a tilt axis for cost reasons. Particle beam laser microscope systems also do not always have a sample stage with a tilt axis. In some particle beam laser microscopes, the laser subsystem does not have a sample stage with a tilt axis, and the angle of incidence of the laser beam in relation to the sample surface consequently cannot be changed. However, since the inclination of the laser cuts produced in principle deviates from the angle of incidence of the laser beam, the sample can be counter-tilted in order to produce laser cuts perpendicular to the sample surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an alternative approach, the sample is applied onto a sample holder having a fixed or a settable tilt angle (what is known as a &#x201c;pre-tilted sample holder&#x201d;). The alignment of the tilt axis in relation to the sample holder is typically fixed here. In order to change the alignment of the tilt axis in relation to the sample, the sample is usually mounted on the sample holder in a changed alignment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A pre-tilted sample holder can be used for example if the tilt angle range of the tilt axis T of a sample stage is not large enough.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A pre-tilted sample holder can additionally be used if the surface of the sample is not plane-parallel to the xy plane of the sample stage. In this case, it might be desirable to tilt the sample, but without rotating the sample. This may exist for example in the case of a sample which is mounted in a non-planar fashion and has structures that have a preferred direction, for example semiconductor structures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Depending on the availability of features for tilting and rotating the sample stage, the combination with a correspondingly designed pre-tilted sample holder is feasible.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, a sample holder having a tilt axis may be very small and setting the tilt angle precisely and reproducibly is therefore difficult. This is often the case even if an angular scale is present.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A sample holder having a fixed tilt angle can mean that the tilt angle of the sample surface corresponds to the angle specified by the sample holder only if the sample is mounted such that the sample surface is exactly parallel to the placement surface of the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, it may not be possible to change the tilt angle. In order to set another tilt angle, a sample stage with a tilt axis may be additionally used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, the applied sample usually cannot be rotated. That is to say, the alignment of the sample in the inclined plane cannot be easily changed. To do so, the placement surface could have a rotatable receiving apparatus. If this is not the case, the sample could be detached and applied in an appropriately turned alignment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the sample holder was turned by a rotation of the sample stage about the rotation axis R or by rotated mounting of the sample holder on the sample stage, the effective tilt angles in relation to the x and y axes of the sample stage may not be readily evident. They are typically calculated or ascertained experimentally.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Depending on the specific application, the respectively maximum tilt angles can be of different sizes. Therefore, a flexible system that can offer different maximum tilt angles for different applications would be desirable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various five-axis stages and six-axis stages for microscope systems are known.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">EP 2 001 038 A2 (Zeile &#x26; Schertel) describes a pre-tilted sample holder.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">DE102018212511 B4 (Nicoletti &#x26; Biberger) discloses a sample holder system that offers an additional degree of freedom of movement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It would be desirable to propose an apparatus and a method that enable a precise and stable alignment of the sample surface across all solid angles. It could be favourable here if the inclination of the sample surface were continuously adjustable.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure seeks to provide a sample holder system with which a sample to be examined can be oriented continuously in relation to an optical axis of a microscope system. The sample holder system can allow for a precise and stable alignment of the sample surface across all solid angles, which can make the examination and/or processing of the sample in the microscope system easier.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The spatial orientation of the sample can be changed by tilting. Tilting is understood to mean the spatial turning of the sample about an axis (tilt axis, as it is known), wherein the tilt axis is generally aligned perpendicular to an optical axis of the microscope system. For example, the tilt axis can be aligned perpendicular to the optical axis of the electron or ion beam column.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A spatial orientation is understood to mean the alignment of the sample in relation to the optical axis/axes of the microscope system in which the sample is observed and/or processed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure also seeks to provide methods for continuously adjusting the inclination angle of a sample in a microscope system, wherein the sample can be inclined in any desired spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure further seeks to provide a computer program product which causes a microscope system to carry out the method according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The disclosure is based on the finding that the inclination angle of a held sample can be set in a sample holder system by the coaction of at least two wedge-shaped rotation elements, which are arranged one after the other in an open kinematic chain.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For this purpose, the rotation elements can be connected to one another in a rotatable manner. By selectively rotating the individual rotation elements, any desired inclination angles &#x3b8; (tilt angles) of a sample receiving surface (and thus of the held sample) can be continuously adjusted in terms of size and direction. The sample is tilted in relation to one of the optical axes of the microscope system, in which the sample holder system is used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to tilt the sample in accordance with the disclosure, at least two rotation elements of the sample holder system can have a wedge-type cross-sectional profile. This can be achieved by each rotation element having two side surfaces that lie opposite one another but are not aligned parallel to one another. Rather, the side surfaces can enclose a non-zero angle &#x3b1;. The angle &#x3b1; thus in each case can form the wedge angle of the wedge-shaped rotation element. For example, the angle &#x3b1; can be an acute angle. The wedge angles &#x3b1;<b>1</b> of the first rotation element and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> of the second rotation element can have a value that is greater than 0&#xb0; and at most 45&#xb0;, for example 10&#xb0;. In a configuration, the angle &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rotation elements can each have a circular, elliptical or square shape or have a base with a different shape.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first rotation element can be designed such that it can be received on a holder receiving surface of a base element. The base element can be embodied in the form of a base plate of compatible design with respect to a receiving apparatus of a sample stage. That means that the baseplate of the sample holder system is receivable on the sample stage of a microscope system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is also conceivable that the sample holder system is used in a microscope system that has no sample stage. In this special case, the sample holder system according to the disclosure can assume the function of a sample stage. To this end, the first rotation element can be configured in a special embodiment in a manner such that it is receivable directly in an arbitrarily designed receiving apparatus of the microscope system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since tilting and rotation of the sample can be set independently from one another by a coordinated movement of the at least two rotation elements, it is possible for the function according to the disclosure of the turnable rotation elements to replace the tilt and rotation axles of conventional sample stages.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Eccentric rotation elements can produce a lateral shift of the sample by way of movements that are coordinated with the movement of the other rotation elements and thereby replace the linear axles of conventional sample stages for the lateral shift of the sample within certain limits. The use of rotation axles with a spindle-shaped thread rather than pin-shaped rotation axles can replace the height adjustment of conventional sample stages within certain limits.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, the second rotation element of the sample holder system is designed such that it can receive the sample to be examined. For this purpose, a sample receptacle can be provided on the upper side surface (also referred to as sample receiving surface below) of the second rotation element.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The designation &#x201c;upper&#x201d; here refers in each case to a side surface facing the sample. In the operating state, that is to say when the sample holder system is used in the microscope system, the &#x201c;upper&#x201d; side surface is consequently arranged such that it faces the incident particle beam. The &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side surface, by contrast, designates the side surface of a rotation element that faces the holder receiving surface (that is to say the base element).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The rotation elements of the sample holder system can each have a rotation axis around which the respective rotation element is arranged so that it is turnable. This means that the first rotation element has a first rotation axis about which it can be rotated by the angle &#x3b2;<b>1</b>. The second rotation element has a second rotation axis about which the second rotation element is turnable by the angle &#x3b2;<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second rotation element can here be connected to the first rotation element in a turnable fashion, whereas the first rotation element can be connected to the base element in a turnable fashion. The rotation elements can be stacked one above the other and are receivable together on the base element. In this way, the sample holder system according to the disclosure can offer at least two rotational degrees of freedom of movement for moving the received sample.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b> can be freely selectable or selectable within certain limits. In a special embodiment, it is also conceivable that one of the angles &#x3b2; is fixed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an alternative embodiment, the second rotation element can rotatably receive a third rotation element rather than a sample, wherein the third rotation element then has the function of receiving and holding the sample. In this embodiment, it is thus the upper side surface of the third rotation element that can serve as the sample receiving surface (also referred to as sample receiving surface of the third rotation element below).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The third rotation element can have a third rotation axis about which it is arranged so as to be turnable by the rotation angle &#x3b2;<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The third rotation element can be designed such that it allows an additional rotation of the sample without the degree of tilt being changed. For this purpose, the third rotation element can be cylindrical and the third rotation axis extends parallel to the cylindrical axis and is perpendicular to the upper side surface of the second rotation element. It can be desirable if the upper side surface and the lower side surface of the third rotation element are aligned parallel to one another. In other words, the third rotation element is not wedge-shaped. This can ensure that the extent of the tilt of the sample is maintained, even though the third rotation element is turned.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning the sample via the third rotation element can allow the sample to be aligned optimally for observing and/or processing purposes in the tilted state.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The third rotation element can have a circular, elliptical, square or another basic shape.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, it is conceivable that the sample holder system also comprises further rotation elements that are designed as described and coact in order to keep a sample tiltably and rotatably on the sample holding system.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Owing to the wedge-type profile of the rotation elements and since the two rotational degrees of freedom of movement can be coordinated with one another, the extent and direction of the tilting of the held sample can be adjusted continuously using the sample holder system. When the sample holder system is mounted on a multi-axis sample stage, the latter typically offers further degrees of freedom of movement.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The wedge angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> of the first rotation element and the wedge angle &#x3b1;<b>2</b> of the second rotation element can be the same. However, it is also possible for the sizes of angles &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> to differ, meaning that the rotation elements have wedge shapes of different steepness. In addition, it is conceivable for a set with different rotation elements to be used, which each have different wedge angles &#x3b1;x. This can be desirable in order to be able to flexibly set different tilt angles depending on the relevant application.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The disclosure additionally relates to a method for setting the inclination angle of a sample that is held in a microscope system with the aid of the described sample holder system.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">By selectively changing the rotation angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b> by rotating the first and the second rotation element, the rotation angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b> and the wedge angles &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> can combine in a way such that the inclination of the sample in relation to the holder receiving surface of the base element and in relation to the optical axis or axes is settable.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the sample holder system used additionally has a third rotation element without a wedge profile, it is possible to set not only the inclination of the sample as desired, but also the alignment of the sample in relation to the optical axis/axes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Exemplary embodiments of the disclosure are explained below with reference to figures. For the purpose of explaining the components, therefore, reference is also made to the respectively preceding and succeeding description in its entirety.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows, in an exploded view, an embodiment of a sample holder system according to the disclosure, wherein the sample holder system comprises three rotation elements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> show the sample holder system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in two different operating states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and in the view from above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an alternative embodiment comprising only two rotation elements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the dependence of the settable tilt angle of a received sample on the rotation angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b>, in reference to the x direction of the coordinate system of the base element.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a dependence of the tilt angle of a received sample on the rotation angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b>, in reference to the y direction of the coordinate system of the base element.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows by way of example a two-beam device, which is set up to receive a sample holder system according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a flowchart of the method according to the disclosure for tilting a sample with the aid of the sample holder system.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the sample holder system <b>20</b>, in which the sample holder system <b>20</b> has three rotation elements <b>1</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>15</b>, which coact.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The sample holder system <b>20</b> comprises a first rotation element <b>1</b>, which has a first side surface (upper side surface) <b>2</b> and a second side surface (lower side surface) <b>3</b>.

It is thus conceivable to bring about the setting of the sample inclination in situ in the sample chamber of the microscope system by remotely controlling the motors from the outside, without the need to manually move the rotation elements. The software controller of the microscope system can be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a special embodiment, it is additionally conceivable that the rotation of the rotation elements is passively effected, specifically by using the movement of the sample stage via a suitable carrier apparatus.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the sample holder system according to the disclosure, it is furthermore conceivable that the rotation elements used have different wedge angles a. That means that the wedge shapes of the rotation elements manifest to different extents. In this way, rotation elements having different angles a can be combined. The maximum inclination angle of the sample receiving surface that is achievable with the sample holder system can thereby be varied depending on the application and type of the sample.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the sample is mounted exactly at the centre of the second rotation element, the height of the sample surface over the surface of the base element is here independent of the tilt angles.

A mechanical extension of this type can, for example, be the support of the rotation elements on thread spindles having a suitable thread pitch rather than simple pin-type connections. Another possibility is the tilted support of the first rotation element on the base element or a wedge-shaped embodiment of the third rotation element or the combination of these possibilities.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">It has proven to desirable for each of the rotation elements <b>1</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>15</b> to have a scale <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The sample holder system according to the disclosure can therefore be set with significantly greater precision than previously known adjustable tilt holders.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">That is because in the present sample holder system, the tilt angles are attained by turning wedge-shaped rotation elements in a manner such that not only the tilt angles themselves but also their errors are dependent on the angle scales via the above-stated mathematical relationships. Since the changes in rotation angle to attain a specific tilt angle are greater than the tilt angle changes that are caused thereby themselves, the setting errors are also reduced to the same extent.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Since the desired tilt angles and the possibly desired counter-rotation of the sample by &#x3b2;<b>3</b> are dependent on &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> and also on &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b>, it is possible to find a mathematical formulation for the design of the scales.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, the total tilt could be set with a first scale, while a second scale sets the relative components of the tilts in the x and y directions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">If no scale graduation that is sufficiently easy to manage by an unskilled user can be found, the turning angles to be set can be calculated using software.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">It can be desirable for the sample holder system to be without play when all the rotation elements are fixed.

When processing samples with a pulsed laser, the intention is frequently to produce cross sections that are oriented perfectly perpendicularly to the sample surface. However, the result in principle is always cross sections that are inclined by up to 20&#xb0; to the perpendicular. The exact angle of the deviation depends on the sample material and the laser parameters used. Since the laser beam can frequently not be set to a different angle of incidence, perpendicular cross sections can be achieved only by counter-tilting the sample. The disclosure now represents a compact, precisely settable solution that is of a low height if correspondingly designed (for this application, for example &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>=&#x2212;&#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>=10&#xb0; would suffice).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">A further important application of the laser option is the cutting of pillars out of the full sample, wherein the pillars have a size of a few tens of micrometres to a few hundred micrometres. The intention in this case is to cut pillars that are as cylindrical as possible, which, for the stated reason, is possible only by counter-tilting the sample. The tilt axle would have to rotate counter to the laser beam guided on circular trajectories. This can be implemented with the motorized version of the sample holder system according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Another application of the sample holder system is the analysis of samples with a ToF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy) detector. It may be possible here that the detector lies on a different axis than the exciting FUB beam, for example laterally and/or at a different height. In samples that have a surface topography, this results in inhomogeneous detection. Since the present disclosure provides further degrees of freedom of movement such that the samples can be aligned differently in relation to the detector, this can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In addition, it is conceivable to use the sample holder system described as an alternative to rocking stage applications. Rocking stage methods are used in order to avoid what is known as &#x201c;curtaining&#x201d; when generating sample cross sections with the focused ion beam by continuously eucentrically tilting the sample stage to and fro during the material ablation.

The sample is held by the sample holder system according to the disclosure in the sample chamber of the microscope system used. For this purpose, the sample is received either directly on the fourth side surface (upper side surface) of the second rotation element (as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) or&#x2014;if a further rotation element is present &#x2014; is received on said rotation element (as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The angle &#x3b2;<b>1</b> is now changed in step S<b>2</b> by rotating the first rotation element about the rotation axis R<b>1</b> in relation to the holder receiving surface of the base element.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Next, the angle &#x3b2;<b>2</b> is changed in step S<b>3</b> by rotating the second rotation element about the rotation axis R<b>2</b>.
