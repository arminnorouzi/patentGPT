The containers can be contained in a housing. Timers and other controls can be employed to control dispensation of the fragrance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview of Certain Features</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fragrance dispenser can include a reservoir with the fragrant material. Some reservoirs comprise a fragrant liquid, such as an oil. However, liquid reservoirs can be messy and prone to spills. Some reservoirs are solid or gelatinous. For example, the fragrance can be contained in a substantially solid (e.g., gummy) substrate. A substantially solid reservoir can be convenient to store, handle, and use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The reservoir may eventually become depleted, such as the fragrance becoming substantially exhausted and/or less potent. Some dispensers house the reservoir in a replaceable cartridge, which can make exchanging an exhausted reservoir with a fresh (e.g., non-exhausted) reservoir quick and easy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it can be inconvenient to determine when and whether it is time to replace a cartridge. For example, a maintenance person may need to be physically present at the fragrance dispenser, open a door on the fragrance dispenser, and look inside to determine the status of the cartridge. This can be time consuming and inconvenient, especially if a facility has multiple fragrance dispensers. The extra steps needed to check the status of the cartridge may lead to maintenance personnel delaying such work, or not performing it at all. Thus, dispensers due for a fresh cartridge may go unmaintained.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be helpful to be able to tell from a remote position whether a cartridge in a dispenser is due for replacement. For example, it would be helpful to be able to tell from a visual inspection of the outside of the fragrance dispenser whether the cartridge is ready for replacement. This would allow, for example, a maintenance person to remotely scan (e.g., by sight) the fragrance dispenser, immediately know the status of the dispenser (e.g., whether the cartridge is exhausted), and/or make a disposition as to the dispenser (e.g., whether to replace the cartridge). The scan can be performed without having to open a door of the dispenser.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">During use, air can enter the cartridge, pick up some of the fragrance, and exit the cartridge, thereby moving the fragrance into the space. To facilitate such movement, it can be desirable to actively, rather than passively, move the air. For example, it can be beneficial to have an airflow-enhancing element, such as one or more fan blades, that encourages air to flow over the fragrance reservoir. To reduce the number of components and/or to facilitate efficient dispensation of the fragrance, it can be helpful to have the blades themselves include the fragrance. For example, it can be advantageous to have the blades made of reservoir material and/or be part of the reservoir. The blades can be included in the replaceable cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A fragrance in the environment within the space may dissipate over time. Thus, additional dispensations of the fragrance may be needed. It can be desirable for a fragrance dispenser to control such dispensation to maintain a desired level of the fragrance in a space.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The various fragrance dispensers disclosed herein address one or more of the aforementioned concerns, or others.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to some embodiments, a fragrance dispenser system comprises a housing. The housing can comprise a rigid material that is configured to house and/or protect other system components. The housing can have an opening on the bottom.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The fragrance dispenser system can include a core unit. The core unit can be located in the housing. The core unit can include a connection unit. The connection unit can include a securing element. The securing element can include one or more first positioning features (e.g., slots) and/or one or more first securing features (e.g., hooks). The connection unit can include an engagement element. The engagement element can include, for example, an annular member. The engagement element can be configured to move relative to the securing element and/or the housing. The connection unit can include a biasing member that biases the engagement element away from the securing element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fragrance dispenser system can include a control unit. The control unit can include a controller. The control unit can include a cartridge sensor, such as a switch. Some or all of the control unit can be located in the housing or outside of the housing (e.g., in a remote location). The control unit can be configured to govern the operation of other system components. For example, the control unit can control operation of a motor of the fragrance dispenser system. The motor can be an electric motor. The motor can have a drive shaft. The motor can be configured to rotate the drive shaft in a first rotational direction and a second rotational direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fragrance dispenser system can include a cartridge. The cartridge can be configured to removably engage with the core unit, such as with the connection unit. The cartridge can include a casing. The casing can have one or more second positioning elements (e.g., posts). The second positioning element can be configured to mate with the first positioning element. The casing can include one or more second securing elements (e.g., openings). The second securing element can be configured to mate with the first securing element. The cartridge can include an airflow element, such as an impeller. The cartridge can include a fragrant material, such as fragrant oil. The fragrant material can be embedded in the impeller.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fragrance dispenser can be configured such that, when the cartridge is engaged with the core unit and the drive shaft spins in the first rotational direction, the impeller spins. This can distribute fragrance into the room or other space in which the dispenser is located.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fragrance dispenser can be configured such that, when the drive shaft spins in the second rotational direction, the cartridge disengages from the connection unit. This can result in the cartridge separating from some or all of the core unit, such as from the securing element. In certain implementations, when the cartridge disengages from the connection unit, the cartridge falls downward (e.g., due to the force of gravity and/or the biasing member) and/or a bottom of the cartridge protrudes out of the bottom opening in the housing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the connection unit includes a control gear. The control gear can be movable by the motor. The control gear can be configured to engage with at least one of the second positioning features.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In several implementations, the connection unit has a one-way torque transmission device, such as a one-way bearing. The one-way torque transmission device can be configured to activate to transmit torque only when the drive shaft spins in one rotational direction, such as the second rotational direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain variants, the cartridge sensor is configured to detect that the cartridge is secured to the connection unit. The cartridge sensor can provide a signal to the controller, which can provide an indication to the user. For example, in response to the cartridge being secured to the connection unit, a light can be illuminated or change status (e.g., color).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Certain implementations of a fragrance dispenser system include a core unit that includes a connection unit, a control unit, and a motor. In some embodiments, the motor is part of the connection unit or the control unit. In certain variants, the fragrance dispenser system includes a housing, such as a hard plastic enclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fragrance dispenser system can include a cartridge. The cartridge can be configured to removably engage with the core unit. The cartridge can include an impeller and a fragrant material. In some implementations, the impeller comprises a lattice of thermoplastic elastomer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fragrance dispenser system can be configured such that the impeller is rotatable by the motor. In some variants, the control unit can determine that the cartridge has reached a depleted state, such as based on time. In response, the cartridge can be disengaged from the connection unit. This can result in, for example, the cartridge moving (e.g., dropping) from an engaged position to a disengaged position. In certain variants, the cartridge is retained in the disengaged position by a catch (e.g., a radially inward protrusion) on the housing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to some embodiments, the fragrance dispenser system includes a cartridge present sensor. The cartridge present sensor can be configured to detect that the cartridge is engaged with the connection unit. The cartridge present sensor can be, for example, a switch or proximity sensor. The cartridge present sensor can provide a signal to the controller, which can provide an indication to the user. For example, in response to detecting that the cartridge is engaged with the connection unit, a light can be illuminated or change status (e.g., color).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain embodiments, the fragrance dispenser system includes a cartridge secured sensor. The cartridge secured sensor can be configured to detect that the cartridge is secured to the connection unit. The cartridge present sensor can be, for example, a switch or proximity sensor. The cartridge secured sensor can provide a signal to the controller, which can provide an indication to the user. For example, in response to detecting that the cartridge is secured to the connection unit, a light can be illuminated or change status (e.g., color).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to certain implementations, the connection unit has a support element and an engagement element. The support element can be configured to removably secure with the cartridge. The engagement element can be configured to move (e.g., slide) relative to the support element, such as in a generally vertical direction. A biasing member can bias the engagement element away from the support element.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The connection unit can have a torque-transmission element, such as a shaft, spline, gearing, or otherwise. The torque-transmission element can be configured to transfer torque from the motor to the impeller. The torque-transmission element can engage with a corresponding feature on the impeller. For example, a shaft of the connection unit can be received in a cavity of the impeller. In some implementations, the torque-transmission element and the impeller are configured to magnetically couple. For example, the shaft can include a magnet and the impeller can include a corresponding metallic component, such as a metal washer. In some implementations, when the cartridge is engaged with the core unit, the impeller is suspended above a stop on a bottom of the cartridge (e.g., by the force of the magnet). In some variants, the shaft has one or more radially outwardly extending wings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A method of operating a fragrance dispenser can include receiving a fragrance cartridge into a housing of the fragrance dispenser. The method can include rotating the cartridge relative to a support element of the fragrance dispenser. In some embodiments, this causes engagement of the first and second securing features of the support element and cartridge, respectively. For example, a hook of the support element can be rotated relative to an opening in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method can include operably connecting a motor of the fragrance dispenser with an airflow element, such as an impeller, of the fragrance cartridge. For example, a shaft of the support element can be engaged with (e.g., received into) a cavity of the impeller. The method can include spinning the impeller, such as by driving the motor in a first rotational direction.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The method can include disengaging (e.g., partially or completely ejecting) the cartridge. In certain implementations, the method includes driving the motor in a second rotational direction. In some variants, driving the motor in a second rotational direction can cause activation of a one-way torque transmission device. The method can include transmitting torque from the motor and via the one-way torque transmission device to the cartridge. In certain implementations, this can result in the cartridge rotating relative to the support element. The method can include disengaging the first and second securing features. The method can include releasing (e.g., dropping) the fragrance cartridge into a disengaged position. The method can include pushing the fragrance cartridge away from the support element with a biasing member. The method can include determining that the cartridge has reached a depleted state.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For purposes of summarizing the disclosure, certain aspects, advantages, and features of the technology have been described herein.

Certain embodiments of the fragrance dispensers are described in the context of a fragrance dispenser with a replaceable cartridge having fragrant material in a substantially solid form and/or embedded in a substantially solid substrate, due to particular utility in that context. However, the embodiments and inventions disclosed herein can also be applied to other types of dispensers and other types of dispensed materials, such as fragrance dispensers that include fragrant material in a liquid, gel, or gaseous form, dispensers with non-replaceable cartridges, non-fragrance dispensers (e.g., humidifiers), or otherwise. No features, structure, or step disclosed herein is essential or indispensable.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a fragrance dispenser <b>10</b> (also called a dispenser). The dispenser <b>10</b> can be configured to dispense fragrance into a space in which the dispenser <b>10</b> is located, such as a bathroom, kitchen, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dispenser <b>10</b> can include housing that receives a replaceable fragrance unit <b>12</b> (also called a refill or a cartridge) that includes the fragrance reservoir <b>14</b>. The fragrance unit <b>12</b> can comprise a material that is odorizing or deodorizing. In some embodiments, the fragrance is embedded in a substrate, such as a polymer, carbohydrate (e.g., polysaccharide) or otherwise. The fragrance reservoir <b>14</b> can be substantially solid, such as being a highly viscous gel. The fragrance reservoir <b>14</b> can be solid enough to hold a shape. The fragrance reservoir <b>14</b> can be shaped as an impeller or other airflow-enhancing shape. The fragrance unit <b>12</b> can be positioned in an outer casing, which can protect the reservoir <b>14</b> and/or reduce the chance of a user touching the reservoir <b>14</b>. The fragrance unit <b>12</b> can be removable from the rest of the dispenser, such as when the fragrant material has become exhausted, thereby allowing a new fragrance unit <b>12</b> to be installed in the dispenser <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dispenser <b>10</b> can include a connection unit <b>16</b> that is configured to connect with the fragrance unit <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the connection unit <b>16</b> is configured to removably couple with the fragrance unit <b>12</b>. For example, the connection unit <b>16</b> can comprise a bayonet mount. The connection unit <b>16</b> can be configured to automatically release (e.g., partially or completely eject) the fragrance unit <b>12</b>, such as when the fragrance unit <b>12</b> is due for replacement.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The dispenser <b>10</b> can include a control unit <b>18</b> that directs certain operations of the dispenser <b>10</b>. For example, the control unit <b>18</b> can be configured to control dispensation of the fragrance from the reservoir <b>14</b> and/or release of the fragrance unit <b>12</b> from the connection unit <b>16</b>. The control unit <b>18</b> can include a controller <b>20</b>, such as an electronic microprocessor and a memory. The control unit <b>18</b> can include a motor <b>22</b>, such as an AC or DC electric motor, which can be controlled by the controller <b>20</b>. The motor <b>22</b> can be configured to spin a fan, such as an impeller. The motor <b>22</b> can be configured to release the fragrance unit <b>12</b> from the connection unit <b>16</b>, such as by rotating the fragrance unit <b>12</b> relative to the connection unit <b>16</b>. The control unit <b>18</b> can include one or more sensors <b>24</b>, such as proximity sensors or switches, which can communicate with the controller <b>20</b>. The sensors <b>24</b> can detect, for example, a position of the fragrance unit <b>12</b>. The controller <b>20</b>, motor <b>22</b>, and/or sensors <b>24</b> and motor can receive electric energy from a power supply, such batteries, a plug or hardwired electrical connection, or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The dispenser <b>10</b> can be configured to indicate a status to an observer, such as maintenance personnel. The status can be, for example, that the fragrance unit <b>12</b> is due for replacement. In certain implementations, the change in status is indicated by a change in the position of the fragrance unit <b>12</b> within the dispenser <b>10</b>. For example, when due for replacement, the fragrance unit <b>12</b> can be released from the connection unit <b>16</b>, which causes the fragrance unit <b>12</b> to drop downward. As illustrated, a portion of the fragrance unit <b>12</b> can protrude from a bottom of the dispenser <b>10</b>. In certain implementations, the fragrance unit <b>12</b> moves from a non-protruding position to a protruding position, or increases the amount by which the fragrance unit <b>12</b> protrudes out of the housing. In some variants, the fragrance unit <b>12</b> is moved by force of gravity and/or by a biasing force, such as from a spring. An observer can easily see that fragrance unit <b>12</b> has changed position and thus readily identify the status of the dispenser <b>10</b>. For example, the observer can readily see whether the fragrance unit <b>12</b> is due for replacement.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">II. Dispenser <b>110</b></heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>12</b>H</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a dispenser <b>110</b>. The dispenser <b>110</b> resembles and/or can include any of the features of the dispenser <b>10</b>. Reference numerals used to identify like features are incremented by a factor of one hundred. This numbering convention generally applies throughout this disclosure. Any component or step disclosed in any embodiment in this specification can be used in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the dispenser <b>110</b> includes a housing H, such as a hard plastic or metal outer casing or other protective cover. The dispenser <b>110</b> can be configured to mount on a wall. The dispenser <b>110</b> can have an upper end <b>125</b>A and a lower end <b>125</b>B. The dispenser <b>110</b> can include one or more vents V, which can facilitate airflow into and/or out of the dispenser <b>110</b>. The dispenser <b>110</b> can have an indicator unit <b>127</b>, such as lights.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the dispenser <b>110</b> can include a core unit <b>111</b> and a cartridge <b>112</b>. The cartridge <b>112</b> can be received in the housing H. For example, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be inserted into a chamber in the lower end <b>125</b>B (e.g., bottom) of the dispenser <b>110</b>. In certain implementations, the housing H is configured to interact with the cartridge <b>112</b>. For example, the housing H can have a catch <b>128</b> that engages with the cartridge <b>112</b> when the cartridge <b>112</b> disengages from (e.g., drops from) the core unit <b>111</b>, as discussed below. The catch <b>128</b> can retain the cartridge <b>112</b> in a disengaged position. In some embodiments, the catch <b>128</b> comprises an arm or a flange.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The dispenser <b>110</b> can include a motor <b>122</b>, such as an electric motor. The motor <b>122</b> can drive an impeller <b>126</b> of the cartridge <b>112</b>. The motor <b>122</b> can be positioned above the cartridge <b>112</b>. The motor <b>122</b> can be a direct drive or indirect drive (e.g., with a transmission device, such as a belt, geartrain, etc.). The motor <b>122</b> and other components of the dispenser <b>10</b> can receive electric power from a power supply P. As shown, the power supply P can comprise one or more single-use or rechargeable batteries. In some variants, the power supply P comprises a wall outlet plug, solar cell, capacitor, or otherwise. The housing H can have a door D, which can provide access to the power supply, such as to enable replacement of the batteries.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some implementations, the housing H has features that orient the cartridge <b>112</b> relative to the connection unit <b>116</b>. For example, the housing H and cartridge <b>112</b> can be keyed such that the cartridge <b>112</b> can be inserted into the housing H in only certain orientations. This can aid in co-locating mating features of the cartridge <b>112</b> and core unit <b>111</b>, which are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In various embodiments, the dispenser <b>110</b> is configured to automatically indicate a status of the cartridge <b>112</b>. For example, the cartridge <b>112</b> can move from an engaged position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) to a disengaged position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) in response to the cartridge <b>112</b> being ready for replacement. As illustrated, in the disengaged position, the cartridge <b>112</b> can protrude, or can increase the amount of the cartridge <b>112</b> that protrudes, from a bottom of the housing H. This can be readily seen by an outside observer, such as a maintenance person, and thus communicate to the observer whether the cartridge <b>112</b> is ready for replacement. The indication can occur without the observer needing to physically contact the dispenser <b>110</b> (e.g., without opening a door on the dispenser) and/or with the observer being remote from the dispenser (e.g., on an opposite side of a room that the dispenser <b>110</b> is located in).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">II.A. Core Unit</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate an example of the core unit <b>111</b> (coupled or associated with the cartridge <b>112</b> in certain figures). The core unit <b>111</b> can be positioned in the housing H. For example, the core unit <b>11</b> can be permanently mounted in the housing H.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The core unit <b>111</b> can include a connection unit <b>116</b> and a control unit <b>118</b>. The connection unit <b>116</b> can removably couple with the cartridge <b>112</b>. The connection unit <b>116</b> can be biased to disengage from the cartridge <b>112</b>. The control unit <b>118</b> can control various operations of the dispenser <b>110</b>.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">II.A.1. Connection Unit</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The connection unit <b>116</b> can include a support element <b>129</b> and an engagement element <b>130</b>. As discussed in more detail below, in certain embodiments, the support element <b>129</b> is configured to be stationary relative to the housing H and/or the engagement element <b>130</b> is configured to move (e.g., slide) relative to the support element <b>129</b>. For example, the engagement element <b>130</b> can be configured to push the cartridge <b>112</b> away from the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The support element <b>129</b> can comprise a rigid plate, disk, or other shape of material. The support element <b>129</b> can be adapted to couple to and/or secure the cartridge <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the support element <b>129</b> has one or more first securing features <b>131</b>A, such as hooks, arms, male elements, or otherwise. The first securing features <b>131</b>A can project downward from the support element <b>129</b>. The support element <b>129</b> can include one or more tracks <b>132</b>, such as channels. The support element <b>129</b> can include one or more first positioning features <b>135</b>A. In some embodiments, the first positioning features <b>135</b>A comprise slots (e.g., elongate through holes), female elements, or otherwise. The illustrated embodiment has four first securing features <b>131</b>A and four first positioning features <b>135</b>A, but other numbers are contemplated, such as one, two, three, five, six, or more. In some embodiments, the number of first securing features <b>131</b>A is equal to the number of first positioning features <b>135</b>A. In certain variants, the number of first securing features <b>131</b>A is different from the number of first positioning features <b>135</b>A. As illustrated, in certain embodiments, the first securing features <b>131</b>A and first positioning features <b>135</b>A are interspersed in an alternating manner in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, the first securing features <b>131</b>A of the support element <b>129</b> are configured to engage with second securing features <b>131</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b>, such as apertures, female elements, etc. (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). For example, the first securing features <b>131</b>A can engage (e.g., be received in) the second securing features <b>131</b>B. In some embodiments, the first and second securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B comprise a bayonet connection mechanism. After the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B have engaged, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be rotated relative to the support element <b>129</b>. This can move a portion of the first securing features <b>131</b>A (e.g., hooks) out of alignment with the second securing features <b>131</b>B, thereby providing a physical interference between the first securing features <b>131</b>A and the cartridge <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, force from one or more biasing members <b>134</b> is applied to the cartridge <b>112</b>, but the cartridge <b>112</b> is maintained in position by the first securing features <b>131</b>A (e.g., the hooks engaged with a lid of the cartridge <b>112</b>). The cartridge <b>112</b> can thus be coupled and/or secured to the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In certain implementations, the first positioning features <b>135</b>A of the support element <b>129</b> are configured to engage with second positioning features <b>135</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b>, such as posts, male elements, etc. (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). For example, the first positioning features <b>135</b>A can engage (e.g., receive) the second positioning features <b>135</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the first and second positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B comprise a slot and pin. In some embodiments, the pin can be configured to slide in the slot as the cartridge <b>112</b> is rotated relative to the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some implementations, the support element <b>129</b> includes a torque transmission element, such as a shaft <b>136</b>. As illustrated, the shaft <b>136</b> can project downward, such as generally vertically downward. The shaft <b>136</b> can be centrally located on the support element <b>129</b>. The torque transmission element can operably connect to the cartridge <b>112</b> to transmit motive force to the cartridge <b>112</b>. For example, the shaft <b>136</b> can be configured to be received in a corresponding cavity <b>137</b> in the cartridge <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the shaft <b>136</b> includes one or more alignment features, such as flanges <b>138</b>. In some embodiments, the flanges <b>138</b> comprise radially extending wings. In some embodiments, the flanges <b>138</b> can taper outward, such as at an upper end, as illustrated. The flanges <b>138</b> can facilitate aligning and/or centering the cartridge <b>112</b> onto the shaft <b>136</b>. For example, the flanges <b>138</b> can aid in positioning the cartridge <b>112</b> such that an axis of rotation of the impeller <b>126</b> of the cartridge <b>112</b> is substantially collinear with an axis of rotation of the shaft <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The shaft <b>136</b> can couple to the impeller <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>136</b> includes a first connecting element <b>139</b>A, such as a magnet. The first connecting element <b>139</b>A can be positioned on a bottom and/or free end of the shaft <b>136</b>. The first connecting element <b>139</b>A can be removably coupled with a second connecting element <b>139</b>B (e.g., a metal washer) of the cartridge <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The shaft <b>136</b> can couple to the motor <b>122</b>. For example, an output drive shaft of the motor <b>122</b> can be received in an upper end of the shaft <b>136</b> such that rotational motion from the motor <b>122</b> is transferred into the shaft <b>136</b>. In some implementations, the motor <b>122</b> can rotate the output drive shaft in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The shaft <b>136</b> and motor <b>122</b> can be coupled with a one-way connection <b>140</b>, such as a one-way clutch, bearing, bushing, or other one-way torque transmission device. The one-way connection <b>140</b> can activate in only one rotational direction. This can permit rotation from the motor <b>122</b> to be transferred to the shaft <b>136</b> in one rotational direction (e.g., counterclockwise) but not in the other direction (e.g., clockwise). In several implementations, rotation of the motor <b>122</b> in a first direction spins the impeller <b>126</b> and/or rotation of the motor <b>122</b> in a second direction disengages the cartridge <b>112</b> from the connection unit <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the shaft <b>136</b> is connected to a gear <b>141</b> (e.g., a spur gear) or other torque transfer element, such as via the one-way connection <b>140</b>. The gear <b>141</b> can be connected to one or more control gears <b>142</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the control gear <b>142</b> can include a smaller body portion <b>143</b> that includes the axis of rotation of the control gear <b>142</b> and a larger toothed portion <b>144</b>. The toothed portion <b>144</b> can engage with the gear <b>141</b>. In some implementations, the toothed portion <b>144</b> extends only around a portion of the periphery of the control gear <b>142</b>, such as at least about: 90&#xb0;, 120&#xb0;, 150&#xb0;, or more.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The control gear <b>142</b> can include one or more cartridge interface features, such as holes <b>145</b> (e.g., through holes). In certain implementations, when the first and second positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B are engaged (e.g., the posts protrude through the slots), the second positioning features <b>135</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b> extends into the holes <b>145</b> of the control gears <b>142</b>. The position of the cartridge <b>112</b> can thus be affected by the position of the control gear <b>142</b>. For example, in an embodiment in which the first and second positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B comprise a slot and pin, rotating the control gear <b>142</b> in a first direction (e.g., counterclockwise) to a first rotational position can move the pin to one end of the slot and/or rotating the control gear <b>142</b> in a second direction (e.g., clockwise) to a second rotational position can move the pin to the other end of the slot. The control gear <b>142</b> can include a position indicator <b>146</b>, such as a peg. Movement of the control gear <b>142</b> can be limited by stops <b>147</b> on the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The engagement element <b>130</b> can be positioned below the support element <b>129</b>. In certain implementations, the engagement element <b>130</b> comprises an annular member, such as a ring. As illustrated, in some embodiments, the engagement element <b>130</b> is radially outward and/or surrounds the first securing features <b>131</b>A and/or the first positioning features <b>135</b>A. When the cartridge <b>112</b> is not installed in the housing H and/or when the cartridge <b>112</b> has been dropped to the disengaged position, which may indicate that the cartridge <b>112</b> is due for replacement, the engagement element <b>130</b> can be visible through the vent V. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the engagement element <b>130</b> can be generally horizontally positioned in and/or aligned with at least one of the vents V. The engagement element <b>130</b> can be brightly colored (e.g., yellow, orange, red, etc.) or otherwise provide a visual signal that the cartridge <b>112</b> is not present or is in the disengaged position.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The engagement element <b>130</b> can include guides <b>133</b>, such as arms, which can project upwardly. The guides <b>133</b> can be received in a corresponding one of the tracks <b>132</b>. One or multiple biasing members <b>134</b>, such as springs, can be positioned between the support element <b>129</b> and an engagement element <b>130</b>. For example, the biasing members <b>134</b> can be positioned over a respective one of the guides <b>133</b> and/or in a respective one of the tracks <b>132</b>. The biasing member <b>134</b> can bias the engagement element <b>130</b> away from the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The engagement element <b>130</b> can be adapted to engage with an upper portion of the cartridge <b>112</b>. For example, when the cartridge <b>112</b> is inserted into the dispenser <b>110</b>, the cartridge <b>112</b> can abut against the engagement element <b>130</b>. With continued upward force on the cartridge <b>112</b>, the cartridge <b>112</b> and engagement element <b>130</b> can be moved against the bias of the biasing member <b>134</b>.

The cartridge <b>112</b> includes a fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> (also called a fragrance composition), which can include a fragrance liquid, such as a fragrance oil. The fragrance liquid can be suitable for use with plastics with sustained release and/or evaporation rate-vapor pressure. The cartridge <b>112</b> can be configured to reduce the chance of a person touching the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>, which could cause damage to the reservoir <b>114</b> or apply the fragrance liquid directly to the person. For example, the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can be enclosed in the cartridge <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can include a substrate (also called a support structure) that the fragrance liquid is contained or embedded in or on. In some embodiments, the substrate comprises a lattice. The substrate can comprise a plurality of cells or chambers, such as interstitial spaces. The chambers can be in fluid communication. The chambers can receive the fragrance liquid. The substrate can be configured to facilitate movement of the fragrance liquid through the chambers. For example, the fragrance liquid can move from inner chambers to outer chambers in the substrate, thereby enabling the fragrance liquid to migrate to a location to escape the substrate (e.g., due to evaporation) to provide fragrance to a surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The substrate can have a yielding, porous, and/or fibrous skeleton or framework. For example, the substrate can have a spongy texture and/or resiliency. In some embodiments, the substrate comprises thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) and/or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) resin. In certain implementations, the substrate comprises a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a blend of hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer and a plasticizer (e.g., parafinic or naphthenic) that is compatible with the mid-blocks of the hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer. The hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer can comprise a polyolefin. In some variants, the TPE comprises olefinic block copolymers, thermoplastic urethane, coplysters, and coplyamides. In certain implementations, the substrate is comprised of gums (e.g., cellulose gum), gellers or thickeners (e.g., carrageenan), polymers, or other materials. In some embodiments, the framework is hydrophilic. In certain variants, the framework is hydrophobic.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> includes hydrophilic and/or diffusion agents. For example, the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can include a powdered or beaded blend of amorphous silicon dioxide (e.g., silica and fumed silica) with optimal surface area and alumino silicate (e.g., zeolite) and/or inorganic fillers and/or EVA polymer binder. In certain implementations, using a TPE or EVA resin as a base, fillers are added to create a porous hydrophilic or resin. In some cases, a hydrophobic cell structure may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Various proportions of the substrate to other components (e.g., the combination of the liquid fragrance, a foamer, and/or a hydrophilic agent) are contemplated. In some implementations, the other components comprise 15% or greater by weight and/or the base resin comprises 85% or less by weight. In some implementations, the other components comprise 30% or greater by weight and/or the base resin comprises 70% or less by weight. In certain embodiments, the substrate comprises at least about 80% by weight of the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>. In some variants, the substrate comprises less than or equal to about 80% by weight of the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some implementations, the substrate comprises a material that has been foamed. For example, the substrate can be formed by adding a foamer to a base resin (such as the materials described above). The foamer can comprise chemical foaming agents that include, for example, blends or individual chemicals of isocyanate and water, azodicarbonamide, hydrazine, and sodium bicarbonate. The action of the foamer can create the chambers in the substrate. In certain embodiments, the foamer comprises azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can be contained in a casing, such as a hard plastic case. The casing can include a shell <b>160</b> and a lid <b>161</b>. The shell <b>160</b> can comprise a taper such that an upper portion is wider than a lower portion. A lower end (e.g., bottom) of the shell <b>160</b> can include a grip G, such as ribs, knurling, a handle, etc. When the cartridge <b>112</b> is in the disengaged position, the grip can protrude out of the housing H. The grip can provide a convenient location to grasp the cartridge <b>112</b>, such as during installation and/or removal from the housing H. The shell <b>160</b> can have a lower opening O. In some embodiments, the lid <b>161</b> includes the vents V. The lid <b>161</b> can be configured to engage (e.g., abut) the engagement element <b>130</b>. The lid <b>161</b> can be configured to receive the engagement element <b>130</b>. For example, the lid <b>161</b> can include a groove that the engagement element <b>130</b> fits into when the cartridge <b>112</b> is connected with the support element <b>129</b>. The groove and/or the engagement element <b>130</b> can be rounded or chamfered to facilitate guiding the engagement element <b>130</b> into the groove. The lid <b>161</b> can have windows W. The windows W align with and/or be in fluid communication with the vents V. In some embodiments, air can enter the opening O, pass over and/or around the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>, and exit through the windows W and vents V. In some variants, air can enter the vents V and windows W, pass over and/or around the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>, and exit through the opening O.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The shell <b>160</b> can have one or more struts <b>162</b>, such as ribs. The struts <b>162</b> can protrude into the opening O. The struts can include a stop <b>163</b>, such as at the intersection of the struts <b>163</b>. The stop <b>163</b> can limit downward travel of the impeller <b>126</b> relative to the shell <b>160</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can include the impeller <b>126</b>. For example, some or all of the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> can be molded or otherwise formed into an impeller shape. The impeller <b>126</b> can include a plurality of blades. The blades can be configured to facilitate airflow over the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>, thereby dispensing some of the fragrance to the air. As mentioned above, the impeller <b>126</b> can include the cavity <b>137</b>, which can be configured to receive the shaft <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>137</b> extends at least about half of the height of the impeller <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the impeller <b>126</b> is hollow though some, most, or all of its axial height. The impeller <b>126</b> can be floating in the casing. For example, in certain variants, the impeller <b>126</b> can move within and relative to the casing, such as in the axial direction. In several embodiments, the impeller <b>126</b> is configured to rotate around an axis or rotation and slide along the axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The impeller <b>126</b> can include the second connecting element <b>139</b>B, such as a metal washer. As illustrated, in some embodiments, the second connecting element <b>139</b>B is positioned in a bottom end of the cavity <b>137</b>. The impeller <b>126</b> can include a step or other feature that supports the second connecting element <b>139</b>B.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">II.C Operation</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In use, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be positioned under the housing H. The cartridge <b>112</b> can be moved upward into the housing H. For example, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be passed through an opening in the bottom of the housing H. As mentioned above, the housing H can have features that orient the cartridge <b>112</b> relative to the connection unit <b>116</b>. For example, the housing H and cartridge <b>112</b> can be keyed such that the cartridge <b>112</b> can be inserted into the housing H in only certain orientations. This can aid in co-locating mating features of the cartridge <b>112</b> and core unit <b>111</b>, such as the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B and/or the positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the shaft <b>136</b> is received in the cavity <b>137</b> of the cartridge <b>112</b>. The shaft <b>136</b> can interface with walls of the cavity <b>137</b>, thereby aligning the cartridge <b>112</b> with the shaft <b>136</b> and/or other portions of the core unit <b>111</b>. For example, an axial centerline of the impeller <b>126</b> can be substantially aligned with (e.g., substantially collinear with) an axial centerline of the shaft <b>136</b>. The shaft <b>136</b> can be configured to engage with the walls of the cavity <b>137</b> in such a manner that rotation of the shaft <b>136</b> is transferred to the impeller <b>126</b>. For example, the shaft <b>136</b> can be received in the cavity <b>137</b> with an interference fit. In some implementations, the shaft <b>136</b> is resilient and/or configured to compress within the walls of the cavity <b>137</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The cartridge <b>112</b> can be engaged with the engagement element <b>130</b>. For example, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be pressed against the engagement element <b>130</b>. The cartridge <b>112</b> and engagement element <b>130</b> can be moved upward as a unit. This can compress or otherwise energize the biasing member <b>134</b>. In certain variants, the engagement element <b>130</b> is moved to abut against the support element <b>129</b> or a stop on the housing H.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B interface. For example, the first positioning features <b>135</b>A (e.g., slots) of the support element <b>129</b> can receive the second positioning features <b>135</b>B (e.g., posts) of the cartridge <b>112</b>. The posts <b>135</b>B can be positioned at an end of the slots. The positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B can aid in properly orienting the cartridge <b>112</b> relative to the support element <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In certain embodiments, the second positioning features <b>135</b>B are received in the respective holes <b>145</b> in the control gears <b>142</b>. For example, the posts on the cartridge <b>112</b> can protrude through the slots in the support element <b>129</b> and extend into the holes <b>145</b> of the control gears <b>142</b>. The control gears <b>142</b> can be in a first position. The first position of the control gears <b>142</b> can be called an &#x201c;unsecured position&#x201d; because, in this position, the cartridge <b>112</b> is not secured to the connection unit <b>116</b> (e.g., if released by the user the cartridge <b>112</b> can be pushed away from the support element <b>129</b> by the biasing member <b>134</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some implementations, the impeller <b>126</b> moves axially relative to the casing of the cartridge <b>112</b>. For example, in response to the shaft <b>136</b> being inserted into the cavity <b>137</b>, and/or the cartridge <b>112</b> being engaged with the connection unit <b>116</b>, an attractive force between the first and second connecting elements <b>139</b>A, <b>139</b>B can move (e.g., pull) the impeller <b>126</b> upward. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the impeller <b>126</b> can be spaced apart from (e.g., suspended above) the stop <b>163</b>. This can reduce friction on the impeller <b>126</b> or otherwise facilitate rotation of the impeller <b>126</b> in the casing. In some embodiments, the connection between the connecting elements <b>139</b>A, <b>139</b>B transfers torque between the shaft <b>136</b> and the impeller <b>126</b>. In certain implementations, the movement of the impeller <b>126</b> occurs concurrent with or after the interfacing of the positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In certain implementations, the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B can enter a first stage of engagement. For example, in the first stage of engagement, the first securing features <b>131</b>A (e.g., hooks) of the connection unit <b>116</b> can be received in the second features <b>131</b>B (e.g., apertures) of the cartridge <b>112</b>. In certain implementations, the first stage of engagement of the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B occurs concurrent with or after the interfacing of the positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B. In some embodiments, when the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B are in the first stage of engagement, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be readily separated from the connection unit <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The cartridge <b>112</b> can secured to the support element <b>129</b>. This can comprise moving the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B into a second stage of engagement. For example, in some embodiments, the cartridge <b>112</b> is rotated relative to the support element <b>129</b> and/or the engagement element <b>130</b>. The securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B can move relative to each other. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the hooks can slide within the apertures <b>131</b>B. This can move an end portion of the hooks out of alignment with the apertures <b>131</b>B, thereby providing a physical interference between the first securing features <b>131</b>A and the support element <b>129</b> in the axial direction. In some embodiments, when the securing features <b>131</b>A, <b>131</b>B are in the second stage of engagement, the cartridge <b>112</b> is inhibited or prevented from being separated from the connection unit <b>116</b>. For example, the physical interference can stop the biasing member <b>134</b> from moving the cartridge <b>112</b> out of position (e.g., downward).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In certain implementations, the rotation of the cartridge <b>112</b> causes the positioning features <b>135</b>A, <b>135</b>B to move relative to each other. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the posts of the cartridge <b>112</b> can slide in the slots of the support element <b>129</b>, such as to an opposite end of the slots. In certain embodiments, because the posts are received in the respective holes <b>145</b> in the control gears <b>142</b>, the movement of the posts causes the control gears <b>142</b> to rotate, such as to a second position. The second position of the control gears <b>142</b> can be called a &#x201c;secured position&#x201d; because, in this position, the cartridge <b>112</b> is secured to the support element <b>129</b>, as discussed above. In some embodiments, rotation of the control gears <b>142</b> causes rotation of the gear <b>141</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the controller can determine that the cartridge <b>112</b> has been properly installed, such as using information from one or more of the sensors <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B. At least partly in response, the controller can instruct the motor <b>122</b> to operate. For example, after detecting that the cartridge <b>112</b> is present and secure, the dispenser <b>110</b> can commence spinning the impeller <b>126</b>. The motor can spin the shaft <b>136</b>, which is transferred to the impeller <b>126</b>. This can cause air to flow over the impeller <b>126</b> and then exit the dispenser <b>110</b>, thereby providing fragrance to the ambient environment. In some embodiments, the dispenser <b>110</b> dispenses fragrance at least partly based on the occupancy sensor detecting that the space is occupied and/or has recently been occupied (e.g., within the at least about the last 10 minutes).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The control unit <b>118</b> can be configured to control various operations of the dispenser <b>110</b>. For example, the control unit <b>118</b> can control operation of the motor <b>122</b>, such as rotational speed, &#x201c;on time,&#x201d; and/or activation frequency. The control unit <b>118</b> can be configured to balance fragrance distribution over the life of the cartridge <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the control unit <b>118</b> activates the motor <b>122</b> such that the impeller <b>126</b> rotates at a rotational speed for a period, stops for a period, and then repeats. In certain implementations, the amount of fragrance released is controlled at least in part by factors such as: the rate of impeller rotation, the period of impeller rotation, the frequency of impeller rotation (e.g., the time between periods), the type of fragrant material, and/or other factors. The control unit <b>118</b> can account for of these factors in directing operation of the dispenser <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The dispenser <b>110</b> can be configured to maintain a substantially constant level of fragrance in the environment. In some embodiments, the length of time that the motor <b>122</b> is operated (the run time) is a function of the age of the cartridge <b>112</b> (e.g., the length of time that the cartridge <b>122</b> has been installed in the dispenser <b>110</b>). For example, the longer the cartridge <b>112</b> has been in the dispenser <b>110</b> the longer the motor <b>122</b> can be operated and/or the shorter the cartridge <b>112</b> has been in the dispenser <b>110</b> the shorter the motor <b>122</b> can be operated. This can compensate, for example, for the fragrance reservoir <b>114</b> becoming less full and/or less portent over time and/or with use. In some implementations, the run time for a dispensation cycle is directly tied to the age of the cartridge <b>112</b>. The run time can be affected by other factors. For example, the run time can be affected by the type of fragrant material, as certain materials are more potent than others.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some implementations, the dispenser <b>110</b> is configured to provide a desired service life. For example, the dispenser <b>110</b> can be configured to dispense scent, operate the motor <b>122</b>, and/or perform other operations achieve a service life of about: 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, or otherwise. In some variants, the dispenser <b>110</b> is configured to receive (e.g., via an input device) or to determine an amount of available power or fragrance, such as in the battery or fragrance reservoir <b>114</b>. The dispenser <b>110</b> can be configured to adjust operation based at least partly on the amount of available power or fragrance, such as to ration the power and/or fragrance to achieve a desired service time. In some embodiments, the cartridge <b>112</b> is configured to communicate a service life to the control unit <b>118</b>. For example, the cartridge <b>112</b> can communicate via RFID or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some implementations, the dispenser <b>110</b> is configured to vary operation based at least partly on the size of the room that the dispenser <b>110</b> is installed in. In some embodiments, the dispenser <b>110</b> is configured to receive an input, such as via a switch on the control unit <b>118</b>, regarding the size of the room. For example, the dispenser <b>110</b> can receive an input of whether the room is small or large. According to some embodiments, for a small room, the motor <b>122</b> is operated for less than or equal to about 15 seconds every cycle period (e.g., greater than or equal to about 30 minutes). In certain variants, for a large room, the motor <b>122</b> is operated for greater than or equal to about 25 seconds every cycle period (e.g., less than or equal to about 30 minutes).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The dispenser <b>110</b> can be adapted to disengage the cartridge <b>112</b> from the support element <b>129</b>. This can occur, for example, in response to a period of use of the cartridge <b>112</b>, number of uses of the cartridge <b>112</b>, or other criteria. In various embodiments, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be disengaged when (e.g., in response to) a determination is made (e.g., by the controller) that the cartridge <b>112</b> has reached a depleted state. In some embodiments, the dispenser <b>110</b> determines that the cartridge <b>112</b> is depleted based on time. For example, based on the number of days or months since the cartridge <b>112</b> was engaged with (e.g., installed in) the connection unit <b>116</b>. In certain implementations, the time is at least: 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, or otherwise. In some implementations, a component of the dispenser <b>110</b>, such as the controller, has a software-controlled timer that resets and/or activates when the cartridge <b>112</b> is inserted. The timer can be based at least partly on a &#x201c;term&#x201d; of the cartridge <b>112</b>. The term can be programmed in the controller, such as being retained in non-transitory memory. The term can be based on, for example, the size and/or life of the cartridge that determines its useful life. The dispenser <b>110</b> can eject the cartridge <b>112</b> when the term is reached and/or the cartridge <b>112</b> is otherwise considered depleted. In some variants, the dispenser <b>110</b> determines that the cartridge <b>112</b> is depleted based on the length of time that the motor <b>122</b> has been on since the cartridge <b>112</b> was installed.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, during a disengagement operation, the motor <b>122</b> changes direction. As discussed above, during normal operation, the motor <b>122</b> spins the output drive shaft in a first rotational direction, and such rotation can be transferred to the shaft <b>136</b> and impeller <b>126</b>. Because of the one-way connection <b>140</b>, such rotation is not transferred to the gear <b>141</b>. In some implementations, during the disengagement operation, the motor <b>122</b> reverses to spin the output drive shaft in the opposite rotational direction. This causes the one-way connection <b>140</b> (e.g., one-way clutch) to activate and thus transfer the motion to the gear <b>141</b>. In turn, the gear <b>141</b> can cause the control gears <b>142</b> to rotate from the secured position toward the unsecured position. In certain implementations, when the motor <b>122</b> spins the output drive shaft in the opposite rotational direction, torque from the motor <b>122</b> is not transferred to the impeller <b>126</b> and/or the impeller <b>126</b> does not rotate.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Because the second positioning features <b>135</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b> (e.g., the posts) are located in the holes <b>145</b> of the control gears <b>142</b>, the movement of the control gears <b>142</b> cause movement of the posts too. For example, the posts <b>135</b>B of the cartridge <b>112</b> can slide in the slots <b>135</b>A of the support element <b>129</b>. This causes the cartridge <b>112</b> to rotate relative to the support element <b>129</b> and/or to slide along the engagement element <b>130</b>. As the cartridge <b>112</b> rotates, the securing features <b>131</b>B (e.g., hooks) can rotate too, which can remove the physical interference holding the cartridge <b>112</b> in place. For example, the ends of the hooks can rotate back into the slots. Because the physical interference has been removed, the cartridge <b>112</b> is released and/or is no longer supported. The cartridge <b>112</b> can thus can be ejected from the support element <b>129</b> and/or can fall downward, such as by force of gravity. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in the disengaged position, the cartridge <b>112</b> can be separated from the support element <b>129</b>. The separation of the cartridge <b>112</b> from the support element <b>129</b> can occur because of and/or be furthered by the biasing members <b>134</b>, which apply a downward force on cartridge <b>112</b> (e.g., via the engagement element <b>130</b>). In certain embodiments, in the disengaged position, the cartridge <b>112</b> is spaced apart from the engagement element <b>130</b>. In some variants, the cartridge <b>112</b> remains in contact with the engagement element <b>130</b> in the disengaged position.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The connection between the impeller <b>126</b> can the shaft <b>136</b> can detach during release of the cartridge <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the force of the biasing members <b>134</b> and/or the weight of the cartridge <b>112</b> can overcome the attractive force of the connecting elements <b>139</b>A, <b>139</b>B and/or the frictional force between the shaft <b>136</b> and walls of the cavity <b>137</b>. Thus, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the impeller <b>126</b> moves downward relative to (e.g., disengages at least partly from) the shaft <b>136</b> and/or the elements <b>139</b>A, <b>139</b>B separate from each other. In some embodiments, the impeller <b>126</b> can drop within the casing. For example, the impeller <b>126</b> can fall into contact with the stop <b>163</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In various embodiments, the cartridge <b>112</b> can fall to the disengaged position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The cartridge <b>112</b> can be caught and/or inhibited from further downward movement by the catch <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, the cartridge <b>112</b> drops at least about: 12 mm, 19 mm, 25 mm, or otherwise. The cartridge <b>112</b> can be maintained in the housing H even after the cartridge <b>112</b> has dropped. An observer can readily see the changed position of the cartridge <b>112</b> and recognize that replacement is needed.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">III.

The controller can balance fragrance distribution over the life of the cartridge <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the controller activates the motor <b>222</b> such that the fragrance reservoir <b>214</b> rotates at a certain rotational speed, during an amount of time, stops for an amount of time and then repeats. In certain implementations, the amount of fragrance released is controlled by: the speed at which the fragrance reservoir <b>214</b> rotates, the length of time during which the fragrance reservoir <b>214</b> rotates, how often the fragrance reservoir <b>214</b> is activated (e.g., the time between intervals), and/or the type of fragrance reservoir <b>214</b>. The time, speed, and intervals can be automatically adjusted as the fragrance in the fragrance is depleted, such as to maintain a similar (e.g., generally uniform) level of scent distribution. In some implementations, when new, the fragrance reservoir <b>214</b> will rotate slower, for less time, and/or will have longer intervals in between uses.
