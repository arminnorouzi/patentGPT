A known procedure for the correction of a hallux valgus deformity is the minimal-invasive chevron osteotomy procedure. After performing the chevron osteotomy, bone fragments are realigned and fixed by fixation screws. The screws may be inserted by the surgeon in a minimally invasive fashion in an oblique angle into the bone. For correct placement of the screws, a large number of X-ray images is required which may result in loss of time, a large radiation dose, and costs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein are guides to aid in screw placement for minimally invasive foot surgery (e.g., bunion surgery&#x2014;Chevron and/or Akin osteotomies).

After a target pin has been placed in a bone (which may be made by a drill or similar tool) and the tool is placed on the reference pin, the tool ensures that the screws are in a plane through the target pin. Due to markings and/or a window, the length of the target pin can easily be adjusted such that the target pin ends within a target window or at an intersect point.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Location of a plane can easily be checked by a surgeon by considering the position of the body and the target pin. For better indicating the plane, the body may have a flat shape. The tool can be adjusted by moving the extension relative to the body, such that the angle between the target pin and the guide pins can be adapted to specific needs. Independent of this adjustment, the guide pins remain parallel. If one of the guide pins is fixed to the bone (which may be made by a drill or similar tool), the tool is fixed in its position relative to the bone. The second or any further guide pins are forced to be parallel to the first guide pin. Therefore, oblique screws and the weakening of bone material are prevented. The length of the guide pins is indicated by markings at the tool. The length of the first guide pin to contact with its tip the tip of the target pin is always the same if the target pin has been adjusted with respect to the tool or vice-versa as mentioned above. The indicated lengths allow a calculation of the required screw lengths.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of fixing bone fragments in minimally invasive foot surgery comprises using a percutaneous targeting device. The targeting device with the target guide can be positioned on the target pin, such that the target pin is guided within the target guide. Positioning may be done such that a visible mark at the target pin is aligned with the body of the target guide or a marking thereof. Alternatively, the sleeve of the target guide may be positioned over the target pin and the targeting device body may be attached later to the target guide. After performing the osteotomy, the hook of a hook sleeve assembly may be inserted intramedullary into the proximal part of the metatarsal bone. A first guide wire may be placed through a positioning screw of the hook sleeve assembly and the hook sleeve into the distal part of the metatarsal bone. The distal part of the metatarsal bone may be shifted/positioned by rotating the positioning screw along the guide wire. The tip of the positioning screw may be in direct contact with the distal bone fragment or may push the fragment through the skin (via a plunger tip). Additionally, a first guide sleeve may be inserted into the outmost attachment hole and at least a further guide sleeve may be inserted into one of the other attachment holes. Then, the tool can be adjusted by moving the extension such that the guide sleeves or guide wires are under a desired angle relative to the target pin. This allows a precise selection of the screw angle in the bone.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By these methods, multiple screws are precisely parallel. The length of the screws can be selected based on the lengths of the first guide wire and the second guide wire extending into the bone. Therefore, perforating two surfaces of the bone by screws that are too long can be prevented.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a targeting device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the application of the targeting device at a bone.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows details of the geometry and movement of the targeting device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>show a further embodiment of the targeting device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the targeting device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the targeting device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a further targeting device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a hook sleeve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a detailed view of a hook sleeve.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of devices disclosed herein simplify the placement of fixation screws in a bone of distal extremities, which can be problematic during such surgical procedures. For example, fixation of metatarsal bone fragments is simplified using the devices as described herein after a minimally invasive chevron osteotomy procedure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a first embodiment, a percutaneous targeting device for minimal invasive foot surgery comprises a body holding an extension. The body has attachment means for a target guide comprising a target sleeve for holding a target pin. Additionally or alternatively, a hook sleeve or hook sleeve assembly having a sideward hook may be used. The extension has multiple attachment holes for holding at least one guide wire and/or at least one guide sleeve. The at least one guide sleeve may further hold a guide wire. The guide sleeves give a better guidance and a higher stability to the guide wires. The target sleeve is configured for holding a target pin, which may be a K-wire. The target pin may extend axially through the target sleeve. The target sleeve may be configured to hold the target pin in a fixed position relative to the target sleeve. If required, the target pin may be released from its fixed position. The target pin may be movable within the target sleeve, in a direction, which may be along its longitudinal axis. This may allow to position the target pin and/or to insert/remove the target pin. The guide sleeves may be configured for holding guide wires. A K-wire is a wire having a tip and configured to be drilled into a bone. The guide wires may have a tip and may be configured to be drilled into a bone. Any of the guide wires may be a K-wire. The target pin and the guide wires may have a diameter between 5 mm and 0.5 mm or between 3 mm and 1 mm. A first attachment hole for holding a first guide sleeve or a first guide wire is located out most of the extension and therefore most distant from the target sleeve. Further attachment holes for holding further guide sleeves or guide</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Wires may be parallel to the first attachment hole and closer to the target sleeve. The extension may be movable against the body and may be held slidably in the body to extend the distance and/or angle between the target sleeve and the guide sleeves. The target sleeve and the guide sleeves and/or the guide wires may be in a common plane and point into a common target area. Therefore, wires held by the target sleeve and the guide sleeves may be in the same plane and when inserted correctly, their tips may end within the target area.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The target sleeve may have a tubular shape forming a target sleeve channel. The first guide sleeve may have a tubular shape forming a first guide sleeve channel. A second guide sleeve may have a tubular shape forming a second guide sleeve channel. The other guide sleeves may have a tubular shape, and the guide sleeves forming a guide sleeve channel. The channels may have an inner bore adapted to the outer diameter of the wires they are used for. The target guide may be adapted to fit to the body and the guide sleeves may be adapted to fit into the attachment holes. The guide sleeves may have marks or rules which may indicate the depth of wires held by the guide sleeves. For this purpose, the wires may have visible marks such as laser marks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The body and the extension may be arc-shaped. The arc-shaped body may define a first radial axis and the arc-shaped extension may define a second radial axis. The first radial axis and the second radial axis may intersect at an intersect point within the target area. The target sleeve and one of the guide sleeves may also point to an intersect point within the target area which may be the same intersect point as mentioned above. The target area may be defined as a circular area centered on the intersect point. When sliding the extension in or out of the body, there may be an arched movement and the intersect point may not move, but the angle between the target sleeve channel and the first guide sleeve channel or a first guide wire, if the guide wire is held without sleeve, changes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The target pin may have at least one visible mark which may be a laser mark in a predetermined distance from its tip. The target guide may have a window through which the target pin may be seen such that the visible mark at the target pin may be aligned with the body. For this purpose, the body may have an alignment mark. Alignment of the visible mark at the target pin with the body may ensure that the tip of the target pin is within the target area. In a further embodiment, the tip of the target pin may be at the intersect point. The target guide may also have a target sleeve which may have a coupling section, which may be threaded and by which it may be moved to position the metatarsal bone fragments. The target sleeve may have a gear rack which interfaces with a rack-wheel at the body and which allows movement of the target sleeve along a longitudinal axis of the target sleeve.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further embodiment, the body may be one piece with the extension or at least fixedly attached thereto. Angular adjustment may be made by selecting attachment holes which result in a required angle between the target pin and the at least one guide wire.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The percutaneous targeting device, herein also mentioned as tool, according to the embodiments allow simple and precise targeting for the placement of screws to secure bone fragments of small bones. After the target pin has been placed in a bone (which may be made by a drill or similar tool) and the tool is placed on the reference pin, the tool ensures that the screws are in a plane through the target pin. Due to markings and/or a window, the length of the target pin can easily be adjusted such that the target pin ends within a target window, or even at an intersect point.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The location of the plane can easily be checked by a surgeon by considering the position of the body and the target pin. For better indicating the plane, the body may have a flat shape. The tool can be adjusted by moving the extension relative to the body, such that the angle between the get pin and the guide pins can be adapted to specific needs. Independent of this adjustment, the guide pins remain parallel. If one of the guide pins is fixed to the bone (which may be made by a drill or similar tool), the tool is fixed in its position relative to the bone. The second or any further guide pins may be forced to be parallel to the first guide pin. Therefore, oblique screws and the weakening of bone material are prevented. The length of the guide pins is indicated by markings at the tool. The length of the first guide pin to contact with its tip the tip of the target pin is always the same if the target pin has been adjusted with respect to the tool or vice-versa as mentioned above. The indicated lengths allow a calculation of the required screw lengths.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, the screws, (e.g., cannulated fixation screws) may be inserted over the guide wires. The instrument can easily be removed by removing one wire after the other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A method of fixing bone fragments in minimally invasive foot surgery comprises placing a target pin, which may be a K-wire, in the distal part of a metatarsal bone. Then an osteotomy may be performed, and the distal bone part with the target pin may be repositioned. In a next step, the targeting device with the target guide may be positioned on the target pin, such that the target pin is guided within the target guide. Positioning may be done such that a visible mark at the target pin is aligned with the body of the target guide or a marking thereof. Alternatively, the sleeve of the target guide may be positioned over the target pin, and the targeting device body may be attached later to the target guide. In a further embodiment, after performing the osteotomy, the hook of a hook sleeve assembly may be inserted intramedullary into the proximal part of the metatarsal bone. A first target pin may be placed through a positioning screw of the hook sleeve assembly and the hook sleeve into the distal part of the metatarsal bone. The distal part of the metatarsal bone may be shifted/positioned by rotating the positioning screw along the target pin. The tip of the positioning screw may be in direct contact with the distal bone fragment or may push the fragment through the skin (e.g., via a plunger tip).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first guide sleeve may be inserted into the outmost attachment hole and at least a further guide sleeve may be inserted into one of the other attachment holes. This step may also be performed before positioning the tool over the reference guide. The guide sleeves may also be pre-assembled. The tool can be adjusted by moving the extension such that the guide sleeves or guide wires may be under a desired angle relative to the target pin. This allows a precise selection of the screw angle in the bone.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Guide wires, e.g., two guide wires, may be inserted through the guide sleeves into the bone. Alternatively, at least one guide wire may be directly inserted through an attachment hole. In this embodiment, the step of inserting a guide sleeve can be omitted. The tip of the outmost guide wire in a first guide sleeve may contact the tip of the target pin within the target area or may even contact at the intersect point. The tip of other guide wires in other guide sleeves may contact a target pin within the target area. An intersection between the target pin and the first guide wire and/or an intersection between the target pin and the second guide wire may be outside of the target sleeve. The target pin and the guide wires may be all in the same plane. The guide wires may be inserted in any sequence. The first guide wire may be inserted first, followed by the second guidewire. Alternatively, the first guide wire may follow the second guide wire. It may also be possible to insert a guidewire first, followed by a target pin.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any of the target pin, the first guide wire, and the second guide wire may define a center axis. In general, the center axis of the target pin may intersect with the center axis of the first guide wire and/or the center axis of the target pin may intersect with the center axis of the second guide wire. The center axis of the first guide wire may be parallel to the center axis of the second guide wire.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the extension may be adjusted to bring the guide sleeve in a new position for another guide wire after inserting a first guide wire.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cannulated fixation screws may be screwed into the bone by using the guide wires. The guide wires pass through the cannulations of the screws. The tool may be removed before or after screwing the fixation screws into the bone. At the end, the tool, the guide wires, and the target pin may be removed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By these methods, multiple screws are precisely parallel. The length of the screws can be selected based on the lengths of the first guide wire and the second guide wire extending into the bone. Therefore, perforating two surfaces of the bone by screws that are too long can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a first embodiment is shown.
