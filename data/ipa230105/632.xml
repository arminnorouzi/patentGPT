Such a replacement may become necessary due to arthritis or trauma. Further, it may be necessary to replace at least a portion of a longbone such as due to surgical removal of cancerous tissue. In other words, it may be necessary to replace a synovial joint and/or at least a portion of an adjacent longbone. Here, the modularity of implants allows highly customized joint replacements for reasonable costs although the replacement of larger amounts of tissue may still be done using customized implants, i. e. single implants that have been produced on the basis of anatomical dimensions taken from a patient. More recently, there are also modular systems for the latter cases that make the treatment of patients in need for substantial replacement of the skeleton faster and at the same time more affordable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nonetheless, for all these modular implants, the stability and reliability of the connection between implant components is crucial for their longevity. For this reason, a common technique to connect implant components is the use of a tapered connection. This type of connection is employed for connections that transfer compressive forces across their interfaces, is self-locking under these forces, and is based on a friction fit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although these tapered connections have been proven as an effective way to connect implant components to each other, issues have been observed with this type of connection that may make a replacement of implant components or even the revision of an entire implant necessary. Among these issues are unintentional loosening, fretting, wear and instability, and micromotions. It is believed that one of the reasons for these issues is an insufficient tapered connection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it was an objective of the present disclosure to provide an interface for a tapered connection that enhances the reliability of the connection without affecting the advantage of this type of connection for modular implants.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an interface for a tapered connection with increased reliability and modular flexibility and a method for establishing such a tapered connection.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above-described problems are solved by the humeral implant component according to claim <b>1</b> and the method according to claim <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, above-noted objectives are addressed by providing an implant component, preferably a humeral implant component, according to a first aspect, wherein the implant component is connectable to another implant component, preferably humeral implant component. The implant component comprises a longitudinal axis, a first end and a second end, the first end and the second end opposing each other along the longitudinal axis of the implant component, and an interface part for connecting the implant component to the other implant component, wherein the interface part is tapered along the longitudinal axis in a direction from the second end to the first end, the interface part being engageable with a tapered interface part of the other implant component to form a tapered connection between the implant component and the other implant component, wherein the implant component further comprises a through hole extending along the longitudinal axis for locking the tapered connection by a longitudinal fastener.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the implant component, preferably the humeral implant component, comprises a through hole for locking the tapered connection by the longitudinal fastener, it is possible to provide a reliable and predefined tapered connection. This is due to the tapered connection between the implant component and the other implant component, preferably humeral implant component, being tightened by the longitudinal fastener, in particular by applying a predefined torque. In order to prevent interference when establishing the predefined tapered connection, the through hole preferably does not comprise a thread. Alternatively, the through hole may include a thread with an inner diameter that is at least larger than the outer diameter of a section of the longitudinal fastener to be inserted into the through hole. With this configuration, unintentional loosening and micromotions leading to wear or fretting can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, in conventional systems, implant components using a tapered connection are connected by forcing one implant component onto or into another implant component, in particular by means of a hammer. It turned out that this technique fails to provide a defined friction fit as it is hard to provide a predetermined compressive force during assembly. With providing an implant component comprising the through hole for locking the tapered connection by the longitudinal fastener, it is possible to apply a predefined force for locking or tightening the tapered connection between the implant components.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The implant component described herein is preferably a humeral implant component. As a result, the other implant component described herein is preferably another humeral implant component.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The implant component may be an implant component forming part of an implant device to be implanted into a patient, such as an upper limb implant device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The expression &#x201c;implant device&#x201d; may generally refer to an assembly of at least two implant components being connected to each other by tapered connections, preferably by the tapered connections as described in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The longitudinal axis of the implant component may be a central axis passing through the longest extension of the implant component. The longitudinal axis may also be a symmetry axis, such as the rotational axis in case the implant component has a rotational symmetry. The longitudinal axis may also run through the center of the area of each cross-section along the longest extension of an implant component.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The interface part may generally be the part of the implant component which establishes the connection between the implant component and the other implant component.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The interface part is tapered along the longitudinal axis. For example, the interface part may comprise a slanted element having the shape of a cone or truncated cone. The longitudinal axis may pass through the cone apex or through the center of the truncated cone. In this case, the tapering of the interface part may be defined by the full angle of the cone (opening angle of the cone). For example, the full angle may be in the range from 1&#xb0; to 20&#xb0;, preferably from 1&#xb0; to 10&#xb0;, more preferably from 1&#xb0; to 6&#xb0;, even more preferably from 1&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;, most preferably from 1&#xb0; to 4&#xb0;, and in particular from 1&#xb0; to 3&#xb0;. The full angle may also be 2&#xb0; 52&#x2032; (conicity 1:20) or 5&#xb0; 43&#x2032;30&#x2033; (conicity 1:10).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The tapered connection between the implant component and the other implant component may be established by a frictional engagement due to the static friction between the two components, i.e. between the tapered interface part of the implant component and the tapered interface part of the other implant component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The through hole is preferably formed through the entire extension of the implant component from the first end to the second end.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The longitudinal fastener is preferably a screw.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The implant component and/or the other implant components described in this disclosure are made of biocompatible materials and in particular metal and metal alloys. In particular, the implant component and/or the other implant component described in this disclosure may be entirely or partly made of commercially pure Titanium and/or Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V (or other Ti-alloys) and/or CoCr (wherein the term &#x201c;CoCr&#x201d; shall mean the general term for different alloys commonly used for orthopedic implants) and/or Polyethylene.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the through hole comprises a thread for a threaded engagement with the longitudinal fastener. Accordingly, the longitudinal fastener used in this embodiment is a screw.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With this configuration, it is possible to provide a simple engagement mechanism between the through hole of the implant component and the longitudinal fastener. In addition, it is possible to apply a predefined force for tightening or locking the tapered connection by screwing the longitudinal fastener up to a predetermined torque value.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an embodiment, the interface part is one of an inner interface part and an outer interface part.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inner interface part may be a recess formed within the implant component. The outer interface part may constitute a part of the outer shape of the implant component. In particular in case the implant component comprises a substantially rotationally symmetric shape, the inner interface part has a surface, wherein the surface normal vector is directed radially inwards, i.e. pointing in a direction towards the longitudinal axis of the implant component. Accordingly, an outer interface part has a surface, wherein the surface normal vector is directed radially outwards, i.e. pointing in a direction away from the longitudinal axis of the implant component. In other words, the latter surface normal vector points in a direction substantially opposite to the direction of the surface normal vector of the inner interface part.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, the inner interface part of one implant component may form a tapered connection with the outer interface part of another implant component, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this configuration, modular flexibility of the implant component can be increased since the interface part can be either an inner interface part or an outer interface part.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an embodiment, the inner interface part is provided at the second end and the outer interface part is provided at the first end.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, in case the implant component comprises an elongated body, the inner interface part may be provided at one end of the elongated body and the outer interface part may be provided at the other end of the elongated body.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, the inner interface part and the outer interface part preferably overlap along the longitudinal axis. In other words, the inner interface part is at least partly surrounded by the outer interface part.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With this configuration, having an implant component comprising an inner interface part at the second end and another implant component comprising an outer interface part at the first end, wherein the inner interface part of the implant component and the outer interface part of the other implant component may form the tapered connection, it is possible to provide a combined implant component having a different shape than the implant component or the other implant component, thereby increasing modular flexibility.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an embodiment, the implant component further comprises another interface part for connecting the implant component to yet another implant component via another tapered connection, wherein the other interface part is the other one of the inner interface part and the outer interface part.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The yet another implant component described herein is preferably yet another humeral implant component.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, in case the implant component comprises an elongated body, the implant component may comprise both the inner interface part and the outer interface part, wherein the inner interface part may be provided at one end of the elongated body and the outer interface part may be provided at the other end of the elongated body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With this configuration, it is possible to provide an implant component that has two interface parts and thus can be connected, via tapered connections, with two other implant components, thereby even further increasing modular flexibility of the implant component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an embodiment, the implant component further comprises a circumferential groove comprising a tapered groove side wall, wherein the tapered groove side wall is tapered along the longitudinal axis in a direction from the first end to the second end. The tapered groove side wall is engageable with at least one transversal fastener, preferably at least two transversal fasteners, for locking the other tapered connection.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tapered groove side wall is tapered along the longitudinal axis. For example, the tapered groove side wall may comprise a slanted element having the shape of a cone or truncated cone. The longitudinal axis may pass through the cone apex or through the center of the truncated cone. In this case, the tapering of the tapered groove side wall may be defined by an inclination angle between the slanted element of the tapered groove side wall and the longitudinal axis. For example, the inclination angle may be in the range from 1&#xb0; to 89&#xb0;, preferably from 15&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;, more preferably from 20&#xb0; to 55&#xb0;, even more preferably from 30&#xb0; to 50&#xb0;, most preferably from 42&#xb0; to 47&#xb0;, and in particular 45&#xb0;. Generally, the larger the inclination angle, the higher are the compressive forces that can be applied when fastening the transversal fastener using a fixed torque.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transversal fastener is preferably a screw and more preferably a stud screw. If being a screw, the transversal fastener preferably has a chamfered tip, wherein the chamfered tip even more preferably corresponds to the inclination angle of above-noted tapered sidewall. The tip may also be curved or have a round shape. The transversal fastener has a longitudinal axis and preferably engages the tapered groove side wall such that the longitudinal axis of the transversal fastener and the longitudinal axis of the implant component are substantially perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The tip of the transversal fastener may engage with the tapered groove side wall in such a way that a preload is generated in the tapered connection, i.e. the other tapered connection according to the embodiment. According to the principle of the inclined plane, the tip of the transversal fastener may generate a preload in the tapered connection by moving into the direction of the longitudinal axis of the transversal fastener (usually by turning the transversal fastener) and interacting with the tapered groove side wall, thereby locking the two implant components forming the other tapered connection according to the embodiment and thus preventing relative movement of the two implant components. In other words, the movement of the transversal fastener along its longitudinal axis during fastening is converted into a movement along the longitudinal axis of the tapered connection due to the inclination of the tapered groove side wall in relation to these axes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The other groove side wall, i.e. the groove side wall opposite to aforementioned tapered groove side wall, may not be tapered. In particular, the other groove side wall may well have a surface extending substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the implant component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an example, the circumferential groove and the interface part of the implant component may be provided at the first end of the implant component, wherein the circumferential groove may be located closer to the first end than the interface part. The implant component may form a tapered connection with the other implant component by relatively moving the implant component towards the other implant component in a direction from the second end to the first end. In the example, the tapered interface part of the other implant component may define a recess in the other implant component and the interface part of the implant component may have an outer shape of a truncated cone. Hence, the tapered connection is formed by inserting the implant component into the other implant component.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">After having established the tapered connection, i.e. the other tapered connection according to the embodiment, the tapered connection may be locked by engaging the tapered groove side wall of the implant component with at least one transversal fastener. Since the circumferential groove is tapered in the opposite direction or in the opposite way in relation to the interface part and is located closer to the first end than the interface part, engaging the tapered groove side wall with the transversal fastener causes the implant component to be pulled further into the other implant component.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With this configuration, it is possible to provide a more reliable tapered connection. This is due to the tapered connection between the implant component and the other implant component being tightened by the transversal fastener. With this configuration, unintentional loosening and micromotions leading to fretting, wear and/or instability can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Moreover, with this configuration, it is possible to provide an implant component, i.e. one single implant component, that has two interface parts (in particular at opposite ends along its longitudinal axis) and, thus, can be connected, via two tapered connections, with two other implant components, wherein each of the two tapered connections can be locked and thereby secured individually. One of the two tapered connections may be locked by the longitudinal fastener, whereas the other one of the two tapered connections may be locked by the at least one transversal fastener. In other words, both the longitudinal fastener and the transversal fastener interact with the same implant component (but at different interface parts) in order to lock the two tapered connections with the two other implant components. Hence, the implant component according to the embodiment not only provides for a higher modularity, but also for a more reliable tapered connection with each of the other implant components.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, it is possible to apply a defined force for locking or tightening the tapered connection between the implant components by applying a predetermined torque to the transversal fastener.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, in the example described above, the tapered connection is locked even more reliably since the implant component is pulled into the other implant component and pulling the interface part into the recess of the other interface part results in a better alignment than pushing it.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment, at least two of the transversal fastener are provided, wherein the transversal fasteners are provided at equal intervals in the circumferential direction of the circumferential groove. For example, in case two transversal fasteners are provided, the two transversal fasteners may be arranged at an angle of 180&#xb0; in the circumferential direction of the circumferential groove (i. e. on opposite sides) such that the two transversal fasteners have the same longitudinal axis and are arranged opposite to each other. This allows for a controlled and reliable locking of the tapered connection, i.e. the other tapered connection according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, the tapered groove side wall is preferably integrally formed with the implant component. In other words, the tapered groove side wall is an integral part of the implant component. With this configuration, not only less pieces need to be handled during assembly and surgery, it is also possible to fasten and lock the tapered connection, i.e. the other tapered connection according to the embodiment, by means of the transversal fastener more reliably without the danger that upon interaction between the transversal fastener and the tapered groove side wall the configuration of the circumferential groove is modified. Further, stress concentrations are avoided as well as a wrong assembly or an unintended loosening that may occur with a section having the tapered groove side wall being modularly configured.
