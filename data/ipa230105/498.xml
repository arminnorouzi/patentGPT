The drawback of these solutions is a large number of elements used in the surgical set, which frequently remain unused during the procedure. The currently used tools do not allow for a controlled removal of the products of cutting out of the operating field.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Units are known for the reaming of internal surfaces of joints, in particular of the hip joint, and so: in the US patent description US2006217730 an improved spring-loaded expandable acetabular reamer is described, which comprises a number of convex reaming segments symmetrically located by pair around a central core of the Reamer tool. It is also a goal of the present invention to provide and improve a spring-loaded reaming segment, which expands faster and requires less manipulation by the operating surgeon and staff, therefore minimizing the risk of infection and of tissue damage. Furthermore, introducing large size conventional acetabular reamers with rough and sharp edges through small surgical incisions will undoubtedly cause damage to the edge of the incision and to the surrounding soft tissues, which may ultimately result in delayed wound healing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The U.S. Pat. No. 6,918,914 demonstrates an acetabular reamer including a reaming head having arcuately-shaped segments generally symmetrically distributed about a center point. The arcuately-shaped segments are extendable or retractable about the center point to create a variable dimensioned recess in an acetabular region. The reamer may also include an actuator for selectively extending or retracting the segments so that the segments remain generally symmetrically distributed about the center point as the segments are expanded or retracted. The segments may further include cutting surfaces having a shape corresponding to a portion of a surface of a hemisphere. In one form, the segments may be configured in a narrow symmetrical &#x201c;slice&#x201d; of a hemispherical surface that provides an adjustable hemispherically shaped cutting arc, whereas the U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,264 describes reamer for reaming of a acetabulum during a minimally invasive procedure. Generally, the reamer, particularly the reamer head, can be inserted and removed through a substantially small incision without trauma to the tissue surrounding the incision. The reamer, generally includes a reaming or scraping portion, which are aligned substantially along a single meridian of a hemisphere. The reamer further includes stabilizing portions to assist in ensuring a selected reaming orientation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the US2006264958/U.S. Pat. No. 7,608,076 the use of a surgical reamer for the cutting of cartilaginous and bone tissue is demonstrated. The reamer further includes a fixed support portion aligned with the drive axis and having at least one radial cutting blade, a pivoting portion aligned with the drive axis and pivotable about this axis, the pivoting portion supporting at least one radial cutting blade and a pivoting joint wherein the pivoting portion may be pivoted toward and away from the fixed portion so as to expand or contract the reamer in relative overall size.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the US2005203525(A1) patent an acetabular reamer was described with a cutting structure rotatable about a longitudinal axis with a domed shell portion. The shell has an outer surface presenting multiple cutting sites and an inner surface for accumulation of debris. The tool shape is defined by a pair of first curved portions generated about a first radius with a center that lies on the axis and a pair of second curved portions generated about a center that is spaced apart from the axis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the US2006276797 (A1) patent discusses an expanding reamer for reaming or cutting a concave surface, for example, for reaming an acetabulum in preparation for implanting a prosthetic component, such as an acetabular cup or socket, during a hip arthroplasty. The reamer includes a rotating shaft cooperating with a surgical drill or other power source at one end and rotating a reamer head at the other end, and a system adapted to expand one or more blades on the reamer head. In a preferred version, the reamer head comprises a plurality of generally circular, preferably substantially flat and parallel blades, the outer blades of which are radially expandable as segments of a cutting sphere to enlarge the effective diameter of the reamer head. The US2007016211(A1) patent discusses an expanding reamer for reaming or cutting a concave surface, for example, for reaming an acetabulum in preparation for implanting a prosthetic component during a hip arthroplasty. A rotating shaft cooperates with a surgical drill or other power source at one end and rotates a reamer head at the other end, and an actuation system expands one or more blades on the reamer head. The reamer head comprises one or more cutting blades, which act as segments of a cutting sphere, wherein the blades are expandable in directions non-parallel to the plane of the respective blades in order to enlarge the cutting sphere. Upon rotation of the reamer head, the blade(s) form a portion of an effective cutting sphere that is preferably greater-than-180-degrees; this allows greater flexibility in placement of the shaft of the reamer relative to the surface being reamed, for example, relative to the center of axis of the acetabulum. In the US2011202060 (A1) patent a disposable acetabular reamer designed to improve tissue removal efficiency is described. The reamer device comprises a reamer cutting shell and a reamer driver interface. The reamer cutting shell has a hemispherical structure with a plurality of spaced apart rib portions that extend from a central region located about an apex of the shell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The essence of the invention is a unit for reaming of the surface of joint cartilage and of periarticular bone of an acetabulum and femoral head, characterised by that it has at least two burrs with a slanting end of the cutting blade and an arc shape, ending with a ball-shaped pivot, placed in the guides of a matrix, whereas each of the burrs is placed in a channel of a shaped body, whereas the body is connected by a joint with the unit's drive mechanism, whereas the matrix is placed on a shank, which is connected with the shaft by a threaded connection with a stop, and the body has a threaded joint to the shaft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is advantageous when the body has a chamber for securing the reamed bone and when the body has an external supporting surface for inserting into the acetabulum of the reamed bone and protecting the bone tissue against damage.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also advantageous when each burr is placed at the same angular distance from a circular plane perpendicular to its lengthwise axis and when the burrs are bevelled at an angle &#x3b2;

Each of the burrs <b>2</b> is placed in a channel <b>12</b> of the shaped body <b>1</b>. The body <b>1</b> is connected by a joint with a drive mechanism <b>6</b> of the unit, whereas the matrix <b>3</b> is placed on a shank <b>13</b> having a threaded connection <b>18</b> with a stop <b>8</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>, and the body <b>1</b> has a threaded joint <b>17</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> is placed at the same angular distance from a circular plane perpendicular to its lengthwise axis. Burrs <b>2</b> are bevelled at an angle &#x3b2; 45&#xb0;, whereas the a angle of application of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burrs <b>2</b> to the machined surface <b>26</b> has a value of 10&#xb0;. The cutting blade <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> has a cutting tongue <b>19</b> for breaking the matter being cut. There are versions where the burr <b>2</b> is a tube, there are also versions where the burr <b>2</b> is an open element, there are also versions where the burr <b>2</b> is a partially open element. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> in the first version has an outlet opening <b>23</b> of the burr duct <b>24</b> used to clean the inside of the burr <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">The drive mechanism <b>6</b> is permanently connected with the matrix <b>3</b> by the shaft <b>4</b> which transfers the rotational drive. The matrix <b>3</b> is moved in a reciprocating and rotational manner by a threaded connection <b>14</b> with the shaft <b>4</b>. In the matrix <b>3</b> the burrs <b>2</b> with the cutting blades <b>16</b> move inside the ducts <b>12</b> of the body <b>1</b>. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> moves through the ducts <b>12</b>, which force it to move solely over a specific trajectory. The cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> are connected to the matrix <b>3</b> using a movable connection through a ball-shaped pivot <b>10</b> and guide <b>11</b> which ensure their minimal movement in relation to the matrix <b>3</b> and body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">The drive mechanism <b>6</b> is connected to an external rotating drive. By connecting the drive mechanism <b>6</b> with the shaft <b>4</b> the rotating movement is transferred to the entire tool. During work the tool is rotating around the axis of the shaft <b>4</b>&#x2014;a stipulated axis of symmetry of the tool. The movement is either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the angular setting of cutting blades <b>16</b>. The shaft <b>4</b> is connected by the threaded connection <b>18</b> to the body <b>1</b>. Both connections with the body <b>1</b> and the drive mechanism <b>6</b> have a thread that is in agreement with the tool's direction of rotation, which prevents the possible disconnection of the parts. On the shaft <b>4</b> the matrix <b>3</b> is screwed on, moving over a thread with a high pitch, which ensures high linear displacement and low angular displacement. The movement of the matrix <b>3</b> is locked by the stop <b>8</b>&#x2014;wedge <b>9</b> system. After setting the matrix <b>3</b> to the dimension of the cutting area <b>25</b> of the joint by turning it around the tool's axis of symmetry with the widened part of the shaft <b>4</b> with incisions facilitating gripping, its movement is locked by screwing in the stop <b>8</b> into the threaded hole <b>15</b> located in the matrix <b>3</b>. Screwing in the stop <b>8</b> results in the gradual driving of the bottom surface of the wedge <b>9</b> into the non-threaded surface of the shaft <b>4</b>. Gradual screwing in of the stop <b>8</b> at some point becomes impossible, which means that the wedge <b>9</b> resting against the surface of the shaft <b>4</b> has completely locked the movement of the system of the stop <b>8</b> with the matrix <b>3</b> In order to release the movement of the matrix <b>3</b> the stop <b>8</b> should be screwed out of it. The matrix <b>3</b> moves within the chamber of the body <b>1</b> limited by the walls of the body <b>1</b> and two parts of the cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b>. The cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b> restricts the maximum external protraction of the matrix <b>3</b>, additionally stabilising the position of the matrix <b>3</b> in relation to the tool's axis of symmetry. The cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b> is bolted to the body <b>1</b> with a set of four mounting bolts <b>7</b>. The rotational and linear movement of the matrix <b>3</b> in relation to the shaft <b>4</b> causes the head of the matrix <b>3</b> to press on the spherical ends of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b>. The ends of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> in the shape of the ball-shaped pivot <b>10</b> set on the threader rod and screwed into the body <b>1</b> move within the channels <b>12</b> cut in the surface of the head of the matrix <b>3</b>. The guides <b>11</b> are cut symmetrically or asymmetrically in relation to the tool's axis of rotation&#x2014;this depends, among others, on the number of cutting blades <b>16</b>. The guides <b>11</b> restrict the movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b>. Screwing the matrix <b>3</b> out of the body <b>1</b> in relation to the shaft <b>4</b> results in the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> sliding into the closed chamber of the body <b>1</b> at an angle of 45&#xb0;. Screwing the matrix <b>3</b> in has a reverse effect. The cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> slide out, making the cutting edges closer to each other, which results in the decrease of the final diameter of the machined spherical surface. The movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> outside of the guides <b>11</b> cut in the head of the matrix <b>3</b> takes place within the space restricted by the openings <b>15</b> in the body <b>1</b>. Channels <b>12</b> ensure the movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> over an arc-shape trajectory with a defined radius.

The angle of application &#x3b1; of the cutting blade <b>16</b> of the matrix <b>3</b> has a value of 10&#xb0;, and the angle of attack &#x3b2; 45&#xb0;.

Along the shaft <b>4</b> and through the drive mechanism <b>6</b> a duct for a medium <b>20</b> (e.g. water) passes, which enables the delivery of a medium to the internal space of the body <b>1</b>, diluting the cuttings and aiding in their removal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">After establishing the position (cutting diameter) of the matrix <b>3</b>, the matrix <b>3</b> is locked by screwing in the stop <b>8</b> with the wedge <b>9</b>, after which the drive is started. Afterwards, the tool is applied to the machined surface, e.g. the hip joint, and the medium is fed through the duct <b>20</b> located along the shaft <b>4</b> and in the drive mechanism <b>6</b>, after which the surface is cut with the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b>. The cuttings with the medium fall out through the outlet openings <b>23</b> of the burr ducts <b>24</b>. Bigger pieces of the cuttings are broken by the cutting tongue <b>19</b>. After removing a specified amount of matter from the hip joint the position of the matrix <b>3</b> is corrected by unlocking the clamp of the drive mechanism <b>6</b>. After making the changes, inspecting the machined surface, e.g. the hip joint after removing another layer of the hip joint tissue, the matrix <b>3</b> is locked again and the material is again removed until required hip joint surface is obtained. The cutting area is limited by the external edges of the tool.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">A unit for the machining of external surfaces of joint bones, being the acetabulum, has at least two burrs <b>2</b> with a slanting end of the cutting blade <b>16</b> and an arc shape, ending with a ball-shaped pivot <b>10</b>, placed in the guides <b>11</b> of a matrix <b>3</b>. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> is placed in a channel <b>12</b> of the shaped body <b>1</b>. The body <b>1</b> is connected by a joint with a drive mechanism <b>6</b> of the unit, whereas the matrix <b>3</b> is placed on a shank <b>13</b> having a threaded connection <b>18</b> with a stop <b>8</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>, and the body <b>1</b> has a threaded joint <b>17</b> to the shaft <b>4</b>. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> is placed at the same angular distance from a circular plane perpendicular to its lengthwise axis. Burrs <b>2</b> are bevelled at an angle &#x3b2; <b>49</b>, whereas the angle of application &#x3b1; of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burrs <b>2</b> to the machined surface <b>26</b> has a value of 10&#xb0;. The cutting blade <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> has a cutting tongue <b>19</b> for breaking the matter being cut. There are versions where the burr <b>2</b> is a tube, there are also versions where the burr <b>2</b> is an open element, there are also versions where the burr <b>2</b> is a partially open element. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> in the first version has an outlet opening <b>23</b> of the burr duct <b>24</b> used to clean the inside of the burr <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">The drive mechanism <b>6</b> is permanently connected with the matrix <b>3</b> by the shaft <b>4</b> which transfers the rotational drive. The matrix <b>3</b> is moved in a reciprocating and rotational manner by a threaded connection <b>14</b> with the shaft <b>4</b>. In the matrix <b>3</b> the burrs <b>2</b> with the cutting blades <b>16</b> move inside the channels <b>12</b> of the body <b>1</b>. Each of the burrs <b>2</b> moves through the channels <b>12</b>, which force it to move solely over a specific trajectory. The cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> are connected to the matrix <b>3</b> using a movable connection through a ball-shaped pivot <b>10</b> and guide <b>11</b> which ensure their minimal movement in relation to the matrix <b>3</b> and body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">The drive mechanism <b>6</b> is connected to an external rotating drive. By connecting the drive mechanism <b>6</b> with the shaft <b>4</b> the rotating movement is transferred to the entire tool. During work the tool is rotating around the axis of the shaft <b>4</b>&#x2014;a stipulated axis of symmetry of the tool. The movement is either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the angular setting of cutting blades <b>16</b>. The shaft <b>4</b> is connected by the threaded connection <b>18</b> to the body <b>1</b>. Both connections with the body <b>1</b> and the drive mechanism <b>6</b> have a thread that is in agreement with the tool's direction of rotation, which prevents the possible disconnection of the parts. On the shaft <b>4</b> the matrix <b>3</b> is screwed on, moving over a thread with a high pitch, which ensures high linear displacement and low angular displacement. The movement of the matrix <b>3</b> is locked by the stop <b>8</b>-wedge <b>9</b> system. After setting the matrix <b>3</b> to the dimension of the cutting area <b>25</b> of the joint by turning it around the tool's axis of symmetry with the widened part of the shaft <b>4</b> with incisions facilitating gripping, its movement is locked by screwing in the stop <b>8</b> into the threaded hole <b>15</b> located in the matrix <b>3</b>. Screwing in the stop <b>8</b> results in the gradual driving of the bottom surface of the wedge <b>9</b> into the non-threaded surface of the shaft <b>4</b>. Gradual screwing in of the stop <b>8</b> at some point becomes impossible, which means that the wedge <b>9</b> resting against the surface of the shaft <b>4</b> has completely locked the movement of the system of the stop <b>8</b> with the matrix <b>3</b> In order to release the movement of the matrix <b>3</b> the stop <b>8</b> should be screwed out of it. The matrix <b>3</b> moves within the chamber of the body <b>1</b> limited by the walls of the body <b>1</b> and two parts of the cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b>. The cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b> restricts the maximum external protraction of the matrix <b>3</b>, additionally stabilising the position of the matrix <b>3</b> in relation to the tool's axis of symmetry. The cover <b>5</b> of the body <b>1</b> is bolted to the body <b>1</b> with a set of four mounting bolts <b>7</b>. The rotational and linear movement of the matrix <b>3</b> in relation to the shaft <b>4</b> causes the head of the matrix <b>3</b> to press on the spherical ends of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b>. The ends of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> in the shape of the ball-shaped pivot <b>10</b> set on the threader rod and screwed into the body <b>1</b> move within the channels <b>12</b> cut in the surface of the head of the matrix <b>3</b>. The guides <b>11</b> are cut symmetrically or asymmetrically in relation to the tool's axis of rotation&#x2014;this depends, among others, on the number of cutting blades <b>16</b>. The guides <b>11</b> restrict the movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b>. Screwing the matrix <b>3</b> out of the body <b>1</b> in relation to the shaft <b>4</b> results in the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> sliding into the closed chamber of the body <b>1</b> at an angle of 45&#xb0;. Screwing the matrix <b>3</b> in has a reverse effect. The cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> slide out, making the cutting blades <b>16</b> closer to each other, which results in the decrease of the final diameter of the machined spherical surface <b>26</b>. The movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> outside of the guides <b>11</b> cut in the head of the matrix <b>3</b> takes place within the space restricted by the openings <b>15</b> in the body <b>1</b>. Channels <b>12</b> ensure the movement of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> over an arc-shape trajectory with a defined radius.

The cutting edges <b>16</b> of the burr <b>2</b> penetrate the material to the set diameter. The angle of application &#x3b1; of the cutting surface <b>25</b> of the cutting blades <b>16</b> of the matrix <b>3</b> has a value of 10&#xb0;, and the bevel angle &#x3b2; 45&#xb0;. The cuttings fall into the ducts <b>24</b> of the burr, falling out between the internal chamber <b>21</b> and the supporting surface <b>27</b> of the body <b>1</b> through the outlet opening <b>23</b> used to clean the inside of the burr <b>2</b>. Along the shaft <b>4</b> and through the drive mechanism <b>6</b> a duct for a medium <b>20</b> (e.g. water) passes, which enables the delivery of a medium to the internal space of the body <b>1</b>, diluting the cuttings and aiding in their removal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">After establishing the position (cutting diameter) of the matrix <b>3</b>, the matrix <b>3</b> is locked by screwing in the stop <b>8</b> with the wedge <b>9</b>, after which the drive is started.

The cutting area is limited on the outside by the cutting edges of the tool, and on the inside by the supporting surface <b>27</b>, protecting against cortical tissue damage during the cutting process.
