More particularly, the disclosure relates to an oral care composition comprising a star-shaped polymer and an orally acceptable carrier for use in inhibiting bacterial attachment to teeth.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Oral hygiene is one of the most important aspects of personal care among consumers. Consumers all over the world use different types of products for oral care as a part of maintaining dental hygiene. People routinely brush their teeth with a toothbrush and a dentifrice which includes toothpaste or toothpowder or mouthwash at least two times a day. Use of such brushing ensures maintaining good oral hygiene by minimizing oral bacteria that accumulate in the mouth over the course of sleeping in the night or during the course of the day when people eat their food and consume beverages. Brushing regularly thus minimizes problems like cavities, tartar, gingivitis, caries, and bad breath, also known as halitosis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">In spite of brushing teeth twice a day, many people suffer from various forms of one or more of the above named diseases associated with dental hygiene and this is believed to be caused, in part, by the formation of oral biofilms, or dental plaque, on tooth surfaces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer hard enamel layer that is the protective layer of the tooth. The enamel layer is composed of hydroxyapatite (HAP) mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface. Dental plaque occurs in the form of a film, on virtually all dental surfaces, such as the HAP-containing enamel layer. Dental plaque is a byproduct of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque itself adheres firmly to dental surfaces, for example, tooth enamel, and is removed only with difficulty even through a rigorous brushing regimen. Moreover, plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel, and on the surface of dental calculus. The danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Provided herein are oral care compositions comprising a star-shaped polymer and an orally acceptable carrier, wherein the star-shaped polymer has a structure according to Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="92.71mm" wi="72.22mm" file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">wherein each R<sup>1 </sup>independently comprises H or an acrylate polymer, each n independently is 5 to 500, for example, 10 to 400, or 15 to 300, each X is independently O, NR<sup>4</sup>, or S, wherein R<sup>4 </sup>comprises H or C<sub>1-6</sub>alkyl, R<sup>2 </sup>comprises H, C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl, or a functionalized acrylate polymer, and each R<sup>3 </sup>independently comprises H, C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl, or C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl phosphate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0006">The disclosure further provides methods of inhibiting bacterial attachment to teeth comprising administering to the subject an oral care composition comprising a star-shaped polymer having the structure according to Formula (I) and an orally acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">Also provided is a star-shaped polymer having a structure according to Formula (I).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">Further provided are methods of forming a layer on a tooth surface comprising administering to the subject an oral care composition comprising a star-shaped polymer having the structure according to Formula (I) and an orally acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">Further aspects and advantages will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description.

Accordingly, an &#x201c;acrylate polymer&#x201d; can refer to a homopolymer formed from the polymerization of a single type of acrylate monomer (e.g. polyacrylic acid), or a copolymer formed from the polymerization of two or more types of monomers, wherein at least one type of monomer is an acrylate monomer. The acrylate polymer can be a linear homopolymer, a linear copolymer, a branched homopolymer, or a branched copolymer. Suitable acrylate monomers that can be used in preparation of the acrylate polymer can include, for example, acrylic acid or its derivatives, methacrylic acid or its derivatives, and combinations of the foregoing. Acrylic acid derivatives include, but are not limited to, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, sec-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. Methacrylic acid derivatives include, but are not limited to methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, sec-butyl methacrylate, tert-butyl methacrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate. Additional suitable acrylic acid derivatives include phosphates of acrylic acid or its derivatives and phosphates of methacrylic acid and its derivatives including but not limited to ethylene methacrylate phosphate (also known as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphate) and other alkyl acrylate phosphates and alkyl methacrylate phosphates. Other monomers suitable for use in an acrylate copolymer include, but are not limited to, other phosphate-bearing monomers, phosphonate-bearing monomers, acrylamide, methacrylamide, and styrene monomers. In embodiments, the R<sup>1 </sup>comprises a linear acrylate polymer. In embodiments, R<sup>1 </sup>comprises a branched acrylate polymer. In embodiments, the acrylate polymer is selected from the group consisting of polymethacrylate, poly(ethyl acrylate), poly(propyl acrylate), poly(butyl acrylate), and poly(C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl phosphate acrylate). In some embodiments, R<sup>1 </sup>comprises an acrylate copolymer, wherein said copolymer is prepared from the polymerization of a reaction mixture comprising methacrylate in combination with any one or more monomers, as provided above. For example, in some cases, the mole percentage of methacrylate in the star-shaped polymer of the oral care composition according to the disclosure ranges from about 5 to about 70 mol. %, from about 25 to about 65 mol. %, or about 40 to about 60 mol. %, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 56, 57, 60, 65 or 70 mol. %. The mole percentage of methacrylate, or any other monomer used in the preparation of the star-shaped polymer, can be determined by analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the polymers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0028">In embodiments, R<sup>1 </sup>can be selected in view of the other formula parameters such that the star-shaped polymer, as a whole, remains substantially soluble in water. The ability of the polymer to bind to HAP, thereby repelling or preventing bacterial attachment while maintaining water-solubility is particularly advantageous for use in oral care compositions, as provided herein, as it allows for ease in formulation of the composition, as well as in application of the composition to an oral cavity of a human or mammalian subject.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0029">As provided herein, each R<sup>3 </sup>independently comprises H, C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl, or C<sub>1-8</sub>alkyl phosphate.

Without intending to be bound by theory, this was likely due to the larger molecular sizes of star-shaped polymers, which occupy larger areas on the hydroxyapatite surface than the comparative linear polymer, so that fewer star-shaped polymers could be bound to the hydroxyapatite surface. In contrast, however, the dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, values of star-shaped polymers were significantly smaller than that of the comparative linear polymer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), indicating that the star-shaped polymers adsorbed on the hydroxyapatite surface more strongly than the comparative linear polymer. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed this is due to the larger polymer sizes of star-shaped polymers which have more contact points on the hydroxyapatite surface for binding. The 4- and 6-arm star-shaped polymers showed the similar q<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>d</sub>, indicating that these polymers occupy similar areas on the HAP surfaces and have similar binding affinity.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0098">The q<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>d </sub>values of the 4-star and comparative linear polymers appeared to decrease and level off at large DPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D</figref>). These results suggest that the maximum number of adhered polymers and their binding affinity did not increase once the size of polymers became sufficiently large. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that this leveling-off of HAP binding behavior of the polymers occurs due to the anionic carboxylic groups of the polymer side chains binding ligand to HAP surfaces through electrostatic interactions. Therefore, as the polymer chains becomes longer, having more carboxylic side chains, the binding affinity of polymers for HAP increases. However, the binding of carboxylic side chains to HAP surfaces requires the polymer chains to be flattened and/or stretched on the HAP surface, which is not favorable due to large entropic penalty. Therefore, the binding of polymers is determined by the balance between the two driving forces to maximize the number of binding sites by carboxylic groups on the HAP surface (enthalpy gain) and minimize the strain on polymer chains (entropic penalty). As the DP of polymers increases, the number of carboxylic side chain groups increases, thus increasing their binding. However, once the polymers are long enough, it becomes difficult to constrain the polymer chains on the HAP surface due to entropic penalty, resulting in the leveling of q<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>d</sub>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0099">Furthermore, the random copolymers with hydrophobic monomer MA (which is relatively more hydrophobic than acrylates, even alkylated acrylates such as t-butyl acrylate) showed variation in binding as the composition of MA was increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Without intending to be bound by theory, this binding behavior may be explained by the interplay between the electrostatic binding of carboxylate groups to HAP and the intramolecular and intermolecular associations of MA groups. Increasing the MA composition reduces the number of carboxylic side chains, which may in turn reduce the binding affinity of polymers to HAP (higher K<sub>d</sub>). On the other hand, the hydrophobic groups may associate intramolecularly (within the same star-shaped polymer), which may prevent the extension of polymer chains for binding, also resulting in low binding affinity (higher K<sub>d</sub>). Therefore, the increase in the K<sub>d </sub>values for the low percentage of MA may indicate that the intramolecular association and/or reduced number of acidic groups are dominant. However, high affinity (low K<sub>d</sub>) value for the polymer with 55% MA indicates the intermolecular hydrophobic association between star-shaped polymers may play an important role to stabilize the polymer layer. On the other hand, the q<sub>max </sub>also slightly increased, indicating the conformation of bound polymer chains are more compact (smaller occupied surface area). The polymers with 55% MA showed lower q<sub>max</sub>, indicating the polymer chains are more expanded likely due to increased intermolecular associations of MA groups between star-shaped polymers, which is in good agreement with the low K<sub>d </sub>value. These results demonstrate that the binding behaviors of polymers to HAP surfaces can be controlled by their hydrophobicity.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0100">Example 2 demonstrates that the star-shaped polymers of the disclosure can bind to HAP surfaces and have higher binding affinity as compared to comparative linear polymers.

Following treatment, excess polymer solution was removed from the MBEC&#x2122; lids by submerging in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) for 10-15 sec for three cycles, replacing the TSB broth for each new cycle. Both untreated and polymer-treated MBEC&#x2122; lids were then incubated with freshly prepared overnight cultures of mixed <i>Actinomyces viscosus </i>(ATCC #43146) and <i>Streptococcus oralis </i>(ATCC #35037) for 3 h at 37&#xb0; C. After incubation the MBEC&#x2122; lids were submerged in TSB and sonicated two times for 2 min each time in order to detach the HAP bound bacteria into the TSB. The BacTiter-Glo Microbial Cell Viability Assay was utilized on the re-suspended TSB to determine the percent reduction. The percent reduction was calculated by the following equation: % reduction=100&#xd7;(bacteria attached on untreated surface&#x2212;bacteria attached on polymer-treated surface)/bacteria on untreated surface. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the treatment effect. A Tukey multiple comparison test was used to assess pairwise treatment differences.

A multi-arm star-shaped polymer had significantly better binding to HAP. Similarly, hydrophobicity of the polymer significantly decreased bacteria attachment, even though it did not significantly affect the K<sub>d</sub>. Therefore, the data of Examples 2 and 3 suggest that a hydrophobic star-shaped polymer would provide the most effective oral composition, because such a star-shaped polymer demonstrates significantly improved binding to HAP as well as improved anti-bacterial properties.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 4: Contact Angle Measurements</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0107">Contact angle was performed on an Attension Theta instrument from Biolin Scientific. Data was analyzed using One Attension software v 2.9. Briefly, 1.0 wt % polymer solutions were prepared, and their pH adjusted to 6.5 with concentrated NaOH or HCl. Due to the immediate absorption of solution droplets into hydroxyapatite, surface modification was required prior to treatment with polymer solutions in order to obtain stable droplets for comparison. Sintered HAP was first treated with modified artificial saliva<sup>47 </sup>for 1 hour (see Supporting Information). After this time, the discs were soaked in 2 mL of polymer solution for three hours on an orbital shaker. The discs were removed and rinsed slightly to remove excess or loosely bound material, and then dried overnight. Contact angle measurements were collected and averaged using four separate measurements of a 3 &#x3bc;L droplet.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an increase in contact angle of greater than 7&#xb0; was observed for most polymer samples, indicating that most of the polymer-treated surfaces were more hydrophobic than the untreated control. The magnitude of this difference also reflected the compositional changes within the polymers themselves. 4StarMA<sub>56</sub>-171, for example, had the highest contact angle of 87.6&#xb0;, an effect attributed to the 56% MA concentration within the polymer.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0109">Example 4 illustrates that the star-shaped polymers of the disclosure are effective at modulating the properties and functions of HAP surfaces, even in the presence of a protein layer, which can lead to the prevention of attachment of oral bacteria.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0110">The results of the foregoing examples suggest that the surface attachment may be more dependent on polymer shape (e.g., linear vs. star-shaped), while the anti-bacterial attachment, may be more dependent on the composition of the polymer (e.g., hydrophobicity).</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00016" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00016.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00016.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00017" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00017.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00017.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00018" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00018.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00018.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00019" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00019.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00019.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00020" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00020.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00020.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00021" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00021.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00021.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00022" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00022.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00022.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00023" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00023.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00023.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00024" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00024.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00024.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00025" cdx-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00025.CDX" mol-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-C00025.MOL"/><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="6.35mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230000755A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
