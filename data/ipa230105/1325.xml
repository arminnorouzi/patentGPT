The plant extracts are extracted from plant materials such as flowers, leaves, bark, stems, roots, peels, trichomes using various extraction processes to obtain bioactive compounds for its medicinal, wellness and nutritional benefits. The bioactive compounds are also called phytochemicals or plant derived compounds and can be extracted using a liquid extraction process. The presently well known liquid extraction processes involve either polar or nonpolar solvent extraction to isolate specific bioactive compounds from the plant extract. Due to the larger and uneven surface area of powdered particles of the plant material, the high amount of the solvent may be used in these solvent extraction methods which further requires expensive operations to recover bioactive compounds. Combining the different plant extracts also requires separate extraction processes to achieve combine extract to avoid losing bioactive compounds during the process.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The accompanying figures, where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, together with the detailed description below, are incorporated in and form part of the specification, and serve to further illustrate embodiments of concepts that include the claimed disclosure, and explain various principles and advantages of those embodiments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of a process of an extraction in accordance with some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

As illustrated, at operation <b>101</b> a plant material is isolated by grinding or cutting to a predetermined size, where the plant material can be selected from the plants including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica </i>and <i>Cannabis ruderalis, Tabernaemontana divaricata, Withania somnifera, Euphausia pacifica, Euphausia superba, Haematococcus pluvialis, Pandalus borealis , Astragalus propinuus, Bacopa monnieri, Beta vulgaris, Berberis vulgaris, Brown algae, Curcuma longa, Camellia sinensis, Centella asiatica, Sambucus nigra, Crataegus monogyna, Reynoutria japonica, Panax ginseng, Melissa officinalis, Hericium erinaceus, Pinus tabuliformis, Punica granatum, Serenoa repens, Eurycoma longifolia, Valeriana officinalis </i>and <i>Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum </i>and combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect, at operation <b>101</b>, a first plant material can be selected from a cannabis plant and isolating a second plant material from a second plant from the group consisting of <i>Tabernaemontana divaricata, Withania somnifera, Euphausia pacifica, Euphausia superba, Haematococcus pluvialis, Pandalus borealis , Astragalus propinuus, Bacopa monnieri, Beta vulgaris, Berberis vulgaris, Brown algae, Curcuma longa, Camellia sinensis, Centella asiatica, Sambucus nigra, Crataegus monogyna, Reynoutria japonica, Panax ginseng, Melissa officinalis, Hericium erinaceus, Pinus tabuliformis, Punica granatum, Serenoa repens, Eurycoma longifolia, Valeriana officinalis </i>and <i>Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum </i>and combination thereof. <b>291</b>-<b>1</b>-USUTIL</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plant materials can be selected from various parts of the plant including the group consisting of roots, flowers, seeds, leaves, stem, trichomes, bark and roots of the cannabis plant. Once harvested, the plant material may be dried and powdered having an average particle size of about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 1 mm. The drying process reduces moisture content of the plant, typically around 75% moisture when harvested, to a resultant moisture content of 10-15%. Some of the bioactive compounds from cannabis plants can easily decompose when subjected to heat and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, hence natural drying processes may be used. The plant material can be powered by a grinding process. The operation <b>101</b> also includes verification of powdered material for presence of hazardous microbes and presence of dangerous levels of toxic metals. These tests are designed to be performed in order to assure that the material is accurate for identity and foreign particles and microorganisms will not affect the extraction process.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At operation <b>102</b>, the powdered plant material is agitated in presence of piperine and palmitoylethanolamide powder(s) in order to create a more viable surface area of particles for the extraction process. The agitation with piperine and palmitoylethanolamide can be carried out in a ribbon blender for at least 20 minutes to produce a powder blend. Piperine is typically extracted from <i>Piper nigrum</i>, and can also be found in <i>Piper longum </i>and <i>Piper officinarum </i>and obtained in a powder form. Upon consumption piperine activates the heat- and acidity-sensing transient receptor potential channel ion channels, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member <b>1</b> and A member <b>1</b> (TRPV<b>1</b> and TRPA<b>1</b>), on nociceptors, the pain-sensing nerve cells. Palmitoylethanolamide is well known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and can be combined to achieve synergistic effects. The powder blend is then removed from the ribbon blender and can be placed into a sanitized, approved container for transport to a tincture batching room(s) in a way so as to avoid adulteration or cross contamination per good manufacturing practices standards.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">At operation <b>103</b>, the polar solvent can be added to the powder blend. The operation can be carried in a brew kettle placed on a hydraulic lift, wherein the powder blend is fed through a conveyor into a brew kettle placed and sprayed with the polar solvent. The brew kettle is subject to rigorous sanitization process prior to beginning the assembly of components in the following order: The disinfecting wipes can be used to wipe the interior and exterior of the brew kettle and lid in order to eliminate any errant microbials that could be present and to remove more visible potential adulterants.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The polar solvent can be selected form the group consisting of food grade 200 proof ethyl alcohol, water, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, acetonitrile, formaldehyde, ether, methanol, glacial acetic acid, dimethylformamide, hydrochloric acid, ethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and combination thereof to the powder blend and allow to infuse for at least 24 hours thereby dissolving piperine and palmitoylethanolamide.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">At operation <b>104</b>, the nonpolar solvent can be added to the powder blend. The nonpolar solvent can be selected from the group consisting of d-limonene, hexane, toluene, xylene, heptane, pentane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, isopropyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol <b>400</b>, and combination thereof, wherein a quantity ratio of the polar solvent to nonpolar solvent is 1:9. The higher concentration of ethyl alcohol may destroy bioactive compounds hence a strict quantity ratio of 1:9 is to provide enough to slightly accelerate the extraction process and maintain the plant material's chemical integrity. The ethyl alcohol is also used in the pharmaceutical formulation to assist with absorption as it promotes quicker access through the mucous membrane when consumed and into the blood brain barrier, thereby allowing the active compounds to work more quickly. In addition, the piperine and palmitoylethanolamide are soluble in ethyl alcohol, hence the two components can be extracted prior to adding nonpolar solvents.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The non-polar solvents are less likely to affect the chemical structure of the plant material. Additionally, the nonpolar solvents like d-limonene are a derivative of citrus fruits, this solvent provides a pleasant flavor to the extracted liquid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At operation <b>105</b>, the powder blend, polar solvent and nonpolar solvent are agitated for at least 48 hours to produce a slurry. The agitation can be carried out to achieve a consistent and effective environment for extraction by allowing the surface area of the powder particles to be covered with the solvents. This can be achieved by agitating the solution until a homogeneous slurry is formed. Once the slurry is achieved a lid can be replaced atop the brew kettle in order to create a sealed environment for the extraction to take place. The slurry is left undisturbed for at least 24 hours before filtration. The lid is placed in a manner so as to avoid adulteration and contamination and left undisturbed for at least 24 total hours, and not more than 120 hours. This combined time frame of at least 48 hours can be utilized for the broad-spectrum dual solvent liquid extraction of bioactive compounds from the powder blend in order to achieve the proper efficacy and concentrations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">At operation <b>106</b>, the slurry can be filtered to produce a liquid extract with a pH of about 7.0 to about 7.4. The filtration can be carried out using a siphoning of</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">the liquid extract from the brew kettle into a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic container. The Siphoning can include but not limited to a 13.25&#x2033; sifting pan with mesh size of 1/100th&#x2033; or (0.01)&#x2033; affixed atop the plastic container. This filtration process allows the liquid extract to be separated from the undissolved powder blend.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">This extraction process can also be referred to as a broad-spectrum dual solvent extraction process to extract possible bioactive compounds from the plant material. The bioactive compounds can include cannabidiol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinola identified in <i>cannabis </i>plants. There are more than 550 chemical compounds in <i>cannabis</i>, with more than 100 phytocannabinoids being identified, including &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bioactive compounds can include conolidine and indole alkaloids, showing analgesic effects can be isolated from bark of the Tabernaemontana divaricata.
