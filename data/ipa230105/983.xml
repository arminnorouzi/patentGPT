Cancer is caused by gene mutation in normal cells. Cancer indicates a malignant tumor among tumors which do not follow normal path of cell differentiation, cell growth and cell apoptosis. Methods of treating cancer include surgical operation, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of chemotherapy, a drug is administered systemically, and the drug not only kills cancer cells but also spreads to normal tissues to cause toxicity in normal cells as well. Accordingly, serious side effects such as gastrointestinal side effects, thrombocytopenia and hair loss are caused.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chemotherapy based anticancer treatment is limited in the case of tumors resistant to chemotherapy by expressing p-glycoproteins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, a solid tumor has heterogeneity in tumor tissue, indicating that both the tumor cells having sensibility to chemotherapeutic agents and the other tumor cells showing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents exist together in the tissue so that the elimination of the resistant tumor cells alone is very difficult even after the administration of chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the problem above, it is necessary to develop a novel anticancer agent based on a novel anticancer mechanism which can be applied locally to tumor tissues and overcome different sensibility among tumor cells. Thus, studies reflecting such necessity have been actively going on.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, photothermal therapy is one of the most popular anticancer treatment methods. This method uses the weakness of cancer cells on heat, compared with normal cells, so that a photoresponsive material is located in a local area where cancer cells are located and then heat is generated by a stimulus given from outside to kill cancer cells selectively.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, methods using gold nanoparticles, nanoporous silica or carbon nanotubes as a photoresponsive material or using organic polymer nanoparticles have been developed (Patent Reference 1, Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2012-0107686).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventors have been tried to develop an anticancer agent that can overcome side effects according to systemic administration and difficulty in eliminating tumor cells having resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. In the course of our study, the present inventors developed a biocompatible photothermal composition capable of acting selectively on a local site, and confirmed its photothermal effect and photothermal therapeutic effect on cancer cells, leading to the completion of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present inventors also confirmed the antimicrobial effect of the said photothermal composition and thereafter applied the composition to the treatment of skin disease and extended the use of the composition for accelerating absorption of functional materials for cosmetics.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a photothermal composition comprising a metal salt and a benzene ring compound derivative containing two or more hydroxy groups.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a photothermal composition comprising a metal salt; and a catechol derivative.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effect</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The composition of the present invention displays a remarkable effect on photothermal therapy since the temperature of the applied area can be raised at least 50&#xb0; C. by near infrared ray irradiation, after the injection. The composition can be combined with a biocompatible material to have biocompatibility and can act selectively on a local site to minimize side effects. The composition also has an effect of continuous photothermal treatment because it is present in the administration site for a few days after injection. Therefore, the composition of the present invention can be used for anticancer treatment. In addition, the composition of the present invention exhibits an antibacterial effect, so that it can be used for treating skin disease and for increasing skin absorption of functional materials for cosmetics through photothermal effect.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the temperature changes according to the irradiation of infrared ray laser to catechol or a coordination complex of catechol and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the temperature changes according to the irradiation of infrared ray laser to dopamine or a coordination complex of dopamine and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the temperature changes according to the irradiation of infrared ray laser to epigallocatechin gallate or a coordination complex of epigallocatechin and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the temperature changes according to the irradiation of infrared ray laser to gallic acid or a coordination complex of gallic acid and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the temperature changes according to the irradiation of infrared ray laser to tannic acid or a coordination complex of tannic acid and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the cell survival rate in photothermal therapy using a coordination complex of catechol and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the cell survival rate in photothermal therapy using a coordination complex of dopamine and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the cell survival rate in photothermal therapy using a coordination complex of epigallocatechin gallate and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the cell survival rate in photothermal therapy using a coordination complex of gallic acid and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the cell survival rate in photothermal therapy using a coordination complex of tannic acid and iron ions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the synthesis process of a hyaluronic acid-gallic acid conjugate according to an example of the present invention.
