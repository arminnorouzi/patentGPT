The inner layer of hair known as cortex is made-up cortical cells of macrofibrils and contributes to the strength, color and texture of the hair.<sup>4 </sup>The cortex forms about 75% of the hair volume.<sup>6 </sup>The outer layer of hair, cuticle, consists of scales which act as a preventive barrier for the cortex and, thus, protects the hair.<sup>4-5 </sup></p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are a variety of treatments for hair straightening offered at present. Alteration of the cortex is important for straightening of hair.<sup>5, 7-8 </sup>The most common method used for hair straightening is by using a flat iron.<sup>6 </sup>Flat ironing process involves alterations of hydrogen bonds and salt linkages through heat and mechanical stress.<sup>6 </sup>However, flat ironing manages to straighten the hair only temporarily as it can return back to its original state when exposed to high humidity or washing. Hair rebonding or chemical straightening are some of the other methods used to obtain more permanent straightening. In these processes strong chemical relaxers or reducing agents are used to break the disulfide bonds in the hair structure and then neutralizers or oxidizing agents are used to rebond the structure again.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Permanent straightening is achieved through the modification of covalent bonds. The relaxers used for breaking the bond are generally strong and alkaline in nature and can be hydroxide based (pH 13) or thio-based (pH 10).<sup>9 </sup>3.5% Sodium hydroxide (lye-based) or guanidine hydroxide activated with 4-7% calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide (non-lye based) alkaline straighteners are commonly used by which the sulfur atom from a disulfide bond is removed and converted into a lanthionine bond creating a permanent non-reversible straightness.<sup>6 </sup>Thio-based chemicals such as ammonium or ethanolamine thioglycolate and sulfites are commonly used reducing agents for hair which convert the disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl groups (chemical reduction) and further oxidized to reform the disulfide bonds at desired (straighter) conformation.<sup>10-11 </sup></p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Both hydroxide based lanthionization and thio-based reduction and oxidation techniques weaken and damage the hair permanently as it alters the cystine content or the disulfide bonds in the cortex and hydrolysis the peptide bonds.<sup>6, 9 </sup>It also requires great amount of after-hair-care measures and results in hair thinning and dullness in the long run. These chemicals have a strong odor and can be irritating to skull skin or eyes during application. Thioglycolate and ammonium thioglycolate which are toxic and carcinogenic can be harmful if they get in contact with the skin.<sup>9-10 </sup></p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Besides the hydroxide and thio-based straighteners, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have been actively used for hair straightening, despite of being banned due to their toxicity, simply because they are inexpensive and result in shiny, straight hair by crosslinking the amine groups in the keratin peptide.<sup>6 </sup>Formaldehyde is more dangerous as compared to glutaraldehyde as it causes serious damage to tissues and respiratory tracts of the users as well as the hairdressers working in salons and has been classified as a carcinogen.<sup>6, 9, 12 </sup></p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There have been some attempts to use non-toxic reducing agents to break the disulfide bond in the keratin and reform them to attain straightness. The use of cysteine as a &#x2018;green&#x2019; reducing agent and use of polycarboxylic acids such as citric acid, butane tetra carboxylic acid (BTCA), malic acid and others to crosslink the hair have been studied.<sup>2, 13-15 </sup>However, all these are two-step processes that still involve the reduction step (breaking of the disulfide bonds) which affects the strength of the hair permanently.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need for new and improved technologies for enhancing and improving hair styling performance, including without limitation hair stabilizing attributes, of hair and other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure relates to, inter alia, a green technology involving the use of sugar-based crosslinkers for enhancing or improving physical appearance, straightening or curling efficiency, or hair styling durability of hair and other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a method of crosslinking hair or other keratin fibers.

The sugar-based crosslinkers of the present disclosure are particularly useful in treating human hair, although the present disclosure is not meant to be limited to human hair, but can also apply to other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0072">The present disclosure relates to, inter alia, a green technology for crosslinking protein molecules for various uses, where the protein molecules can be contained in protein fibers such as, but not limited to, human hair, animal fibers, and mixtures thereof. The green technology of the present disclosure provides crosslinking agents, formulations, and methods of making and using such crosslinking agents and formulations. In regard to one particular advantage of the green technology of the present disclosure over the existing art of treating hair or animal fibers, the presently disclosed green technology does not require the use of harsh chemicals or harmfully high temperatures to achieve permanent or substantially improved permanence of the desired structural changes from the hair or animal fiber treatments. Provided below is a more detailed description of the various aspects of the green technology of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0073">As used herein, the term &#x201c;protein fibers&#x201d; refers to any fiber material that includes protein as a component of the fiber. Protein fibers of the present disclosure include, without limitation, any fibers that contain protein molecules, and particularly protein molecules that have amino acids with functional groups (e.g., amine groups) that can react with an aldehyde group (e.g., to form a bond or link). Non-limiting examples of amino acids with such suitable functional groups include amino acids such as arginine and lysine. Non-limiting examples of particular types of protein fibers of the present disclosure are keratin-containing fibers.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0074">As provided herein, &#x201c;keratin-containing fibers&#x201d; can include, without limitation, human hair, animal fibers, or a mixture thereof.

This method involves the steps of: (i) providing a crosslinking agent comprising an oxidized sugar having at least two aldehyde groups; and (ii) infiltrating a plurality of non-crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers with the crosslinking agent under conditions effective to cause protein molecules contained in the non-crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers to become crosslinked, thereby yielding a population of crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers. The protein molecules of the non-crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers comprise amine groups that react with the aldehyde groups of the oxidized sugar to achieve the crosslinking of the protein molecules to yield the crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0077">As used herein, the term &#x201c;infiltrating&#x201d; generally refers to a process by which a crosslinking agent infiltrates hair or other keratin fibers so as to allow the crosslinking agent to react with the protein molecules contained in the hair or other keratin fibers. Once the crosslinking agent reacts with the protein molecules, the protein molecules can then be crosslinked, thereby resulting in hair or other keratin fibers that are then considered crosslinked. The term &#x201c;diffusion&#x201d; can also be used to describe this infiltrating or infiltration of the crosslinking agent into the hair or other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0078">In one embodiment, the infiltrating step is carried out at room temperature. In other embodiments, the infiltrating steps is carried out at temperatures ranging from between about 21&#xb0; C. and about 220&#xb0; C. In a particular embodiment, the infiltrating step is carried about at about 180&#xb0; C. In a particular embodiment of this method, the infiltrating step is carried out at a temperature selected from the group consisting of less than, 220&#xb0; C., less than 200&#xb0; C., less than 190&#xb0; C., less than 180&#xb0; C., less than 170&#xb0; C., less than 160&#xb0; C., less than 150&#xb0; C., less than 140&#xb0; C., less than 130&#xb0; C., and less than 120&#xb0; C., less than 110&#xb0; C., less than 100&#xb0; C., less than 90&#xb0; C., less than 80&#xb0; C., less than 70&#xb0; C., less than 60&#xb0; C., less than 50&#xb0; C., less than 40&#xb0; C., less than 30&#xb0; C., and less than 20&#xb0; C., and for a length of time sufficient to yield the population of crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers at said temperature used for carrying out the infiltrating step. Generally, the lower the temperature, the longer the time is needed for infiltration or diffusion to occur.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0079">In certain embodiments, the length of time the infiltrating step can be at least 1 minute, at least 5 minutes, at least 10 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 30 minutes, and at least 60 minutes. Non-limiting examples of suitable infiltration times can range from seconds to hours, including, for example, a range of less than a minute to less than 10 minutes, as well as a range of about 10 minutes to 4 hours or more, depending on the temperature used. In a particular embodiment, the infiltrating step is carried out at about 180&#xb0; C. for about 8 minutes.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0080">In a particular embodiment of this method, the heating step is carried out by applying a source of heat to the population of crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers. As used herein, the concept of &#x201c;heating&#x201d; the hair or other keratin fibers is meant to refer to the process of subjecting the hair or other keratin fibers to a particular raised temperature. Therefore, when describing the temperature of the heating step, reference is made to the &#x201c;ambient temperature&#x201d; and not the temperature of the hair or other keratin fibers themselves (e.g., human hair or animal fibers).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0081">Non-limiting examples of the source of heat is for the heating step include sources such as a flat iron, hot rollers, a hot plate, a curling iron, a hair dryer, an iron, a clothes dryer, an oven, etc.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0082">In another embodiment, this method further comprises washing the population of crosslinked hair or other keratin fibers to remove residual crosslinking agent or to remove crosslinking agent adhering to the hair or other keratin fibers, thereby substantially removing the crosslinking agent. In one particular embodiment, the washing is carried out using water or soap water. The soap water can include, without limitation, detergents, shampoo, and any other solution containing an agent effective to remove the residual crosslinking agent from the hair or other keratin fiber mixture or to remove crosslinking agent adhering to the hair or other keratin fibers.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0083">In accordance with the present disclosure, examples of hair or other keratin fibers can include, without limitation, human hair, animal fibers, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0084">Various types of human hair can be used with the methods and formulations of the present disclosure.

Abstract</heading><p id="p-0164" num="0144">A major drawback of the current hair styling treatments is that it involves the use of toxic carcinogens such as thioglycolates, sulfites, formaldehyde and others. Constant exposure to such chemicals is harmful for the person getting the hair treatment and certainly to the hairstylists performing the treatment. A new &#x2018;green&#x2019; sugar-based hair styling treatment was developed in the present research. The chemical composition of the sugar-based crosslinker, studied using ATR-FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR showed the presence of multiple aldehyde groups on sugar, which were then used to chemically react with the amine groups present in keratin protein in hair. The chemical crosslinking of keratin molecules was carried out using a flat iron which can be readily adopted for practical applications in hair styling treatments. The crosslinked hair swatches were hung at high humidity condition (65%) as well as repeatedly washed with shampoo to characterize the permanency of the treatment. The hair straightening treatment was found to be durable to high humidity and several shampoo washings. In addition, the tensile characteristics of the hair such tensile stress, strain and Young's modulus showed that the properties remained unaffected after the treatment. SEM images showed no surface damage to the scales. The natural sugar-based green crosslinker may also be used to create curls in the straight hair.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">2.

Remington&#xa9; flat iron with settings from 10 to 30 and Pantene&#xa9; shampoo were purchased from local Target Store. Sodium periodate (NaIO<sub>4</sub>)&#x2265;99% was bought from Acros Organics, Bound Brook, N.J. Barium dichloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) was purchased from VWR, Rochester, N.Y. Sucrose powder and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Allentown, Pa.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0146">Preparation of Sucrose Tetraaldehyde (ST) Solution for Hair Treatment. Five g of sucrose was dissolved in 100 ml of DI water. Six g of NaIO<sub>4 </sub>was added to the sucrose solution. Oxidation was carried out in complete dark at room temperature (RT) for 16 h with gentle stirring at 200 rpm. At the end of 16 h, 4 g of BaCl<sub>2 </sub>was added to the solution to stop further oxidation. BaCl<sub>2 </sub>reacts with NaIO<sub>3 </sub>to form Ba(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>which is insoluble in water at lower temperatures. After addition of BaCl<sub>2</sub>, the solution was stirred for 5 min and placed in a refrigerator for 1 h to allow precipitation of Ba(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. After 1 h, the solution was filtered to separate the insolubilized Ba(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>from the ST. At this time the pH of ST solution was observed to be around 3.5.

A swatch of hair (7.5&#x2033; in curly length and weighing 1.2 g) was washed with shampoo and air dried before the treatment. The washed swatch of hair was clamped onto an aluminum foil using a clip and the prepared ST solution was applied onto the curls of the hair using a hair dye brush. The hair dye brush was dipped in the prepared ST solution and smaller sections of hair were individually coated with the ST solution from top to bottom, using 3-4 strokes of brush of about 2 inches length. The brush was dipped in the ST solution multiple times to ensure that all the hair in the swatch were well coated or wetted with ST solution from all sides. The hair swatch was then allowed to dry for about 8 min and flat ironed for about 8 passes at the flat iron setting 25 which corresponded to 180&#xb0; C. (the flat iron had 30 settings with highest temperature at 30 of 215&#xb0; C.). ST solution was applied to the hair again and dried and flat ironed, as mentioned above. The straightened hair swatch was set aside for 10 min at room temperature (RT) before washing it off with tap water at RT and flat ironed again for another 4-5 passes, if the hair curls after washing. This ST solution treated hair was termed as STA.

The hair specimens were also conditioned at 21&#xb0; C. and 65% prior to testing. The tests were also conducted at 65&#xb1;3% RH and 21&#xb1;1&#xb0; C. using a gauge length of 30 mm and a strain rate of 0.6 min-. Thirty single hair specimens were randomly chosen from top, middle and bottom parts of the swatches of each type (C, FI and STA) for testing and statistical analysis. For the FI and STA hair, 10 specimens were chosen from each of the three different swatches treated at different times using ST solutions prepared at different times to ensure reproducibility of the results.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0153">The surface characterization of the C, FI and STA hair was performed using Zeiss Gemini 500 scanning electron microscope (Germany), and at 1 kV.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">3.

The peak at 907 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>corresponds to the C&#x2014;H bending in sucrose. The peaks at 1049 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1237 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>corresponds to the C&#x2014;O stretch as well as C&#x2014;C stretch in sucrose from C&#x2014;OH groups while the peak at 1003 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>corresponds to the stretching if C&#x2014;O band of the C&#x2014;O&#x2014;C linkage.<sup>16 </sup>The peaks at 1322 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1411 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>are due to 0-H bending of C&#x2014;OH groups in sucrose. The ATR-FTIR spectra of the ST shows an additional peak at 1712 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This peak corresponds to carbonyl groups formed as a result of oxidation of sucrose.<sup>16-17 </sup>Similar peak at 1718 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>was seen by Jalaja and James after oxidizing sucrose using NaIO<sub>4</sub>.<sup>18 </sup>As seen in the spectrum of ST in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the peak 1237 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>disappeared and the peak intensity of the one at 1411 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>reduced. Both of these peaks correspond to the C&#x2014;OH bending in sucrose and the reduction in the peak intensity is the result of oxidation of hydroxyls to aldehyde groups. In both spectra (sucrose and ST), a peak around 3360 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>corresponds to the hydroxyl groups in the sucrose and the peaks between 2900 and 2700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>correspond to the C&#x2014;H stretch.

The protons associated with sucrose are seen at 5.4 ppm and between 4.2 ppm and 3.2 ppm. The proton shift seen at 4.7 ppm in both spectra is a result of the D20 used as solvent. The proton shifts at 4 ppm and 4.2 ppm in sucrose are due to the protons from secondary hydroxyl groups present on the fructose ring in the sucrose. The three proton shifts associated with the three secondary hydroxyl groups on the glucose are seen between 3.5 and 3.75 ppm in sucrose. Fructose and glucose have two and three vicinal hydroxyl groups or secondary hydroxyl groups, respectively, which are cleaved due by NaIO<sub>4 </sub>and oxidized to form two aldehyde groups on each fructose and glucose. This can be seen from the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR of ST where an additional proton shift is clearly observed at 8.3 ppm due to the protons associated with the aldehyde groups created by oxidation.<sup>17 </sup>The additional proton shifts between 4.8 and 5.5 ppm indicate the intermolecular acetal protons due to the hemiacetal formation.<sup>17-20 </sup></p><p id="p-0177" num="0156">Characterization of Hair. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>H</figref> show pictures of C, FI and STA hair swatches, from left to right, respectively, taken from day 0 to day 15 exposure in conditioning room (65% RH), after the treatments. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the control hair swatch showed 5 curls (each curl is counted as a z from top to bottom). Flat iron helps to straighten the curls as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> (0 day) and so does the STA treatment. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the FI hair showed at least 1 curl at the bottom of the swatch after 1 day in the conditioning room at 21&#xb0; C. and 65% RH while the STA hair maintained its straightness. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows pictures of hair after 2 days in the conditioning room. It is clear that for the curl formed on after 1 day on the FI hair got enhanced and is now accompanied by 2 additional distinct curls. The STA hair, however, retained most of its straightness except for the bottom tip of the swatch after 2 days in conditioning room. The hair near the bottom of the swatch are fewer in number because of their unequal lengths and probably slip through the flat iron gap. As a result, it is possible that the fibers at the bottom of the swatch do not get adequate treatment as in the top and middle of the swatch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>D, <b>2</b>E, <b>2</b>F, and <b>2</b>G</figref> show the pictures of hair swatches after 3, 5, 7, and 10 days, respectively. It was observed that the FI hair got fluffed-up showing at least 3 distinct curls while only the bottom tip of STA hair showed signs of curling. Most of the top hair of the STA hair showed perfect straightness. Similar effect was observed at the end of 15 days in the conditioning room (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>). It was observed that the STA hair maintains its straightness for up to 45 days at 21&#xb0; C. and 65% RH while the FI has the tendency to curl and frizz after just 2 days in the conditioning room. As mentioned earlier, the STA hair is well crosslinked due to the reaction of aldehyde groups from the ST solution and the amine groups from the keratin in hair. The amine groups from hair and aldehyde groups from sugar react to form a covalent bond via imine (Schiff base) formation.<sup>17 </sup>Since the crosslinked molecules are unable to move, this provides the hair significant stabilization against the humidity. The FI hair on the other hand is just straightened due to the mechanical force and the heat applied due to flat ironing which involves rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. However, the newly formed hydrogen bonds from using a flat iron (heat and mechanical treatment) are susceptible to humid conditions and the hair tries reverts back to its original state over time.<sup>21 </sup>Moisture from the conditioning room tends to easily plasticize the FI hair causing them to curl and fluff-up.<sup>22 </sup>As four aldehyde groups are present on ST, it increases the potential crosslinking opportunities with the amine groups present in the keratin as compared to formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde which consists of one and two aldehyde groups respectively. Multiple intra and interfibrillar crosslinks can be formed with and within the cortex after ST treatment forming a dense 3D network which stabilizes the hair and helps retain its desired shape.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0157">The C, FI and STA hair swatches were repeatedly washed using a warm 2% shampoo solution for 5 min and rinsed thoroughly under running water at RT until the lather was gone. The wet hair swatches were placed on a paper and hung on a wall in the conditioning room for 2 days before washing again. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the pictures of C, FI and STA hair swatches after 4 shampoo washes. Pictures of wet hair were taken immediately after washing. The second set of pictures in all of the shampoo washes were taken after 2 hours of drying in the conditioning room and the third one after 2 days in the conditioning room. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the control wet hair show 5 distinct curls when washed with shampoo. Upon drying for 2 hours in the conditioning room, the hair fluffs-up causing reduction in the length of the hair swatch and enhancing the curvature of the curls. The FI hair also immediately curled-up during the first shampoo wash while the STA hair remained straight after the first shampoo wash. Upon drying in the conditioning room after shampoo wash, the wet FI hair fluffed-up and the curvature of the curls increased. As a result, the length of the FI swatch reduced. The FI hair looked similar to the C hair as it regains all its original curls after the 1<sup>st </sup>shampoo wash. As mentioned earlier, flat ironing only straightens the hair temporarily as it only involves alterations of hydrogen bonds and salt linkages.<sup>21 </sup>The FI hair regained most of its original curl and the length decreased close to control hair. It was, however, observed that the STA hair maintained its straightness for 2 shampoo washes because of the covalent crosslinks formed which are more durable. As mentioned earlier, the 3D network formed within the cortex after crosslinking restricts the molecular movement or slippage and helps retain its shape. The STA hair was straight even after the third shampoo wash. It, however, started to curl around the bottom of the swatch while drying in the conditioning room. As mentioned earlier, the bottom part of the swatch is sparse and probably does not come in complete contact with the plates of the flat iron causing inadequate treatment. Because of the insufficient crosslinking, the moisture in the conditioning room causes the STA hair to begin to curl. At least 1 curl, with low curvature, was observed after the third and fourth shampoo wash while drying with negligible reduction in the overall length of hair swatch.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0158">The straightening efficiency (SE) values were calculated for FI and STA hair swatches for up to 45 days of exposure to 65% RH and on C, FI and STA hair swatches after repeated shampoo washings for up to 4 washes, using Equation 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows SE of FI and STA hair as a function of days the hair swatches were hung on a wall in conditioning room at 65% RH for up to 45 days. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, SE of FI and STA hair was 100% on day 0. After 1 day in the conditioning room, SE of the FI hair reduced to 66.7% while SE of STA hair was still 100%. At least 1 curl was observed in the FI hair after 1 day at 65% RH while the STA hair was fully straight (SE 100%). This can be clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. SE of FI hair further reduced to 60.3% after 2 days in the at 65% RH when 3 curls developed on FI swatch while a slight curl in the bottom part of the STA hair was observed bringing down the efficiency of the STA hair to 86.8% after 2 days in the conditioning room. SE of the FI hair further reduced to 58.3% and 57.6% as the intensity of the curvature of the curls and the number of curls increased after 3 and 5 days in the conditioning room respectively. No additional curls were observed on the STA hair and its SE remained constant at 86.8% for up to 5 days in the conditioning room. SE of the FI hair further reduced to 56.9% after 7 days in the conditioning room and remained constant at 56.9% over time for up to 45 days. SE of STA hair was found to be 86.6% after 7 days in the conditioning room after which it remained unchanged for up to 45 days. Overall, SE of the STA hair was found to be much higher and more permanent compared to the FI hair.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows the SE (%) of C, FI and STA hair as a function of number of shampoo washes. It should be noted that each shampoo wash is accompanied by 2-day exposure to 65% RH at 21&#xb0; C. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the SE of FI hair reduced to 22.44% after the very 1<sup>st </sup>shampoo wash. This implies that the FI hair regains most of it curls upon washing with shampoo. Again, this is because flat ironing is only a temporary way of hair straightening. Hair straightening using a flat iron only involves breaking and reforming of few hydrogen bonds in the keratin. These hydrogen bonds are weak and easily disrupted by water and, as a result, the FI hair reverts back to its original curly state after washing.<sup>6 </sup>SE of the FI hair was found to decrease to 12.8% after 2<sup>nd </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>shampoo washes and down to just 8% after 4<sup>th </sup>shampoo wash. This implies that the FI hair is as close to the original state or C hair after shampoo wash. It was also found that shampoo washing of the C hair introduces slight additional curls onto the swatch. Thus, SE of the C hair was negative. It was found to be &#x2212;4.2% after 2 shampoo washes after which it remained constant at &#x2212;13.6% after 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>shampoo washes. The SE of STA hair was maintained at 100% for up to 2 shampoo washes after which it reduced to 86.6% after the 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>shampoo washing. Overall, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows that the SE of FI hair reduces significantly (as close to control) as the hair regains most of its curls after washing, while the SE of STA only reduces to 86.56% after 4 shampoo washes. This shows that the STA treatment is more durable than FI hair and can be used to attain permanent hair styling.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the typical stress-strain plots for C, FI and STA hair specimens. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the typical stress-strain plots of the all hair show three distinct regions: initial Hookean region, yield region and post yield region.<sup>23 </sup>The tensile properties of the C, FI and STA hair are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the Hookean region lies between 0%-5% tensile strain. The average tensile stress value of the C hair specimen at the end of the Hookean region was 103 MPa. In comparison, the average tensile stress value of the FI and STA hair specimens were observed to be 99.8 MPa and 99.7 MPa, respectively, indicating that the tensile stress of the FI and STA hair specimens in the Hookean region remained unchanged after treatments. The tensile strain of C, FI and STA hair specimens in the Hookean region was found to be 4.1%, 4.7%, 4.3%, respectively, which suggests that the properties of the FI and STA hair remained unchanged compared to C hair. The strain in the Hookean region comes from extension of weaker bonds such as hydrogen bonding within the amino acids, Van der Waals forces and coulombic interactions.<sup>17 </sup>Immediately following the Hookean region the hair shows yielding behavior where large amount of strain is accompanied by very small rise in stress signifying very low modulus or high compliance. This yield region extends from 5% to 30% strain for all the hair specimens. It involves unfolding of the &#x3b1;-keratin into &#x3b2;-keratin configuration allowing larger deformation in the hair before breaking.<sup>17, 23 </sup>Strain-hardening phenomenon was observed beyond the yield region for all fibers.<sup>17, 23 </sup>Strain-hardening region extends from 30%-50% strain and ends upon the rupture of the hair. The breaking or ultimate fracture stress values for C, FI and STA hair specimens were found to be 164 MPa, 171 MPa, 166 MPa, respectively. These fracture stress values were found to be statistically insignificant, using an unpaired t-test, at a significance level of 0.05. This implies that the tensile stress of the hair strands was unaffected after flat ironing and the ST treatment. It is known that the keratin-based peptide in the hair is susceptible to thermal degradation after flat ironing which results in weakening the hair strands.<sup>6 </sup>Continual heat treatments especially flat ironing in wet conditions increases the hair damage.<sup>24 </sup>In the present study, flat ironing in the wet state was intentionally avoided, and the ST solution was allowed to dry before flat ironing the hair. While the pH of most commercial hair straightening products is highly alkaline (above 10), the pH of ST solution was adjusted to 7 to avoid alkaline denaturation of keratin peptides and retain tensile properties. Overall, the tensile results suggest that the tensile properties of the hair remained unchanged after the ST treatment and hence, could be a viable healthy alternative to currently used toxic hair crosslinkers. It is also clear from table 1 that the FI treatment reduces the initial modulus (Young's modulus) to 2.3 GPa compared to 2.6 GPa for C hair. However, after the STA treatment the modulus recovers back to 2.6 GPa as a result of the crosslinking.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Tensile properties of the C, FI and STA hair strands.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Initial Hookean Region</entry><entry>Post Yield Region</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Stress</entry><entry>Strain</entry><entry>Young's</entry><entry>Stress</entry><entry>Strain</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(&#x3bc;m)</entry><entry>(MPa)</entry><entry>(%)</entry><entry>Modulus (GPa)</entry><entry>(MPa)</entry><entry>(%)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>C</entry><entry>68.2 &#xb1; 11.9</entry><entry>&#x2009;103 &#xb1; 36.9</entry><entry>4.1 &#xb1; 0.6</entry><entry>2.6 &#xb1; 1.1</entry><entry>163.8 &#xb1; 54.8</entry><entry>49.3 &#xb1; 7.5</entry></row><row><entry>FI</entry><entry>73.3 &#xb1; 07.9</entry><entry>99.8 &#xb1; 34.3</entry><entry>4.7 &#xb1; 1.1</entry><entry>2.3 &#xb1; 1.0</entry><entry>171.0 &#xb1; 35.6</entry><entry>51.8 &#xb1; 8.6</entry></row><row><entry>STA</entry><entry>74.0 &#xb1; 16.0</entry><entry>99.7 &#xb1; 28.1</entry><entry>4.3 &#xb1; 1.4</entry><entry>2.6 &#xb1; 1.2</entry><entry>166.1 &#xb1; 44.0</entry><entry>49.7 &#xb1; 5.8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0183" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> show SEM images of C, FI and STA hair, respectively.

Since excess heat from the flat iron can damage the hair, especially the scales, if done in the wet condition, care was taken to ensure that the hair was dry enough after treating with STA (by leaving them to air dry at RT for 10 min) before flat ironing. Most of the keratin crosslinking by ST solution occurs inside the hair as the ST molecule is small enough to penetrate the hair, leaving the surface of the hair undamaged after STA treatment.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">4. Conclusions</heading><p id="p-0184" num="0162">The present study has successfully demonstrated that hair can be crosslinked using a &#x2018;green&#x2019; sugar-based crosslinker. Sucrose was oxidized using NaIO<sub>4 </sub>to convert the secondary hydroxyl groups to the aldehyde groups leading to a product with four aldehyde groups on sucrose (sucrose tetraaldehyde). Crosslinking of hair was carried out using chemical and mechanical treatment which involved diffusion of sucrose tetraaldehyde into the hair cortex along with flat ironing. The chemical crosslinking via covalent bond formation (imine) from the reaction of amine groups from keratin and aldehyde groups from sucrose resulted in a stable crosslinked 3D network within the hair cortex. The hair straightening process was optimized to achieve maximum straightening efficiency with the least damage to the tensile properties or the surface scales of the hair. The straightening was found to be stable up to 4 shampoo washings. These promising results open up a new &#x2018;green&#x2019; innovative alternative of chemical treatment for hair styling without being exposed to currently used toxic, carcinogenic chemicals.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0185" num="0163">Citation of a reference herein shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present invention.
