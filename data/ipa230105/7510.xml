JP2019-509693A proposes that when the ID node A detects an advertising message from the ID node B, indicating that the ID node B has data (sensor data) for upload, the ID node A operates in a query (scan) mode of listening for the ID node B, and records a scan result in a log. Further, JP2019-509693A proposes that when the ID node A is next connected to the master node, the ID node A uploads the acquired scan log information to the server.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the above-described collection of the communication device information has issues (1) to (4) exemplified below.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(1) Increase in Statistical Information Collection Time and Network Bandwidth Usage</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the NMS that manages the NEs collects the statistical information from each NE, the collection time increases as the number of NEs increases. In addition, when collection destination NEs are connected in multiple stages, the number of hops to a collection target NE increases. Since the NMS is connected point-to-point for each NE in the network, a larger amount of bandwidth in the network are consumed as the number of hops to the collection target NE increases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(2) Transfer of Configuration Information</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">At the time of device replacement, configuration data to be set disappears, and periodic collection from the NMS is required.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(3) Collection of Failure Analysis Information</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When a problem event occurs in the NE and data for failure analysis is collected, if it is difficult to access the target NE due to loss of volatile memory information due to occurrence of device restart or a communication path failure, the NMS cannot collect data for failure analysis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(4) Collection of Detailed Information</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Detailed information having a large amount of information, such as reception sensitivity, temperature information, and flow information, is not included in the data to be acquired due to limitation of the storage capacity of the NE or collection time limitation of the NMS.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, as the number of NEs to be monitored increases, the amount of device information to be collected increases, and there is a concern about an increase in collection time and an increase in load on the user network. In addition, when the collection destination NEs are connected in multiple stages via another NE, the number of hops connected to the collection target NE increases, and a large amount of wireless bandwidth is used in proportion to the number of passing NEs. In addition, when a failure occurs in an NE, a log including debugging information to be analyzed by a device development department is collected, but depending on the failure, the central processing unit (CPU) may be reset, and the data stored in the volatile memory may be lost.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the technique in which the ID node A pulls up data from the ID node B by the query (scan) mode in which the ID node A listens for the ID node B as disclosed in JP2019-509693A, there is an issue that a large amount of bandwidth in the network is consumed and data cannot be collected when a problem event occurs in the ID node.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to provide a wireless network device and an information collection method for the wireless network device, which are suitable for collecting large-capacity device information.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to achieve the above object, a wireless network device according to the present invention is a wireless network device to be connected to a master node, the wireless network device including:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a storage device that stores information on the subject device;
