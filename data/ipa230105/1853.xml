Operators are often required to carefully navigate such work vehicles, while performing various tasks and avoiding surrounding structures, neighboring work vehicles, and other obstacles. A given work vehicle may be a sizable and complex machine, requiring a relatively high level of operator skill to control the various functions of the work vehicle, in many instances including the movement of boom-mounted implements or other end effectors. Concurrently, visibility from the operator station or cabin of the work vehicle may be limited by the chassis of the work vehicle, by the positioning of a bucket or other end effector relative to the cabin, and other visual hinderances. For this reason, certain work vehicles are now equipped with camera-based display systems providing operators with relatively unobstructed contextual views of a work vehicle's exterior environment. As a specific example, a work vehicle may be equipped with a camera-based display system providing an operator with a view (live camera feed) of the environment generally to the rear of the work vehicle, as presented on a display screen within the cabin of the work vehicle. This not only improves operator efficiency and situational or contextual awareness by providing an unobstructed rear view of the work vehicle's surrounding environment, but may also improve operator comfort by enabling the operator to remain seated in a forwarding-facing position, while viewing the display screen and operating the work vehicle in reverse.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of a work vehicle display system, which generates a visually-manipulated context view for presentation on a display device, are disclosed. In embodiments, the work vehicle display system includes a display device having a display screen, a context camera mounted to the work vehicle and positioned to capture a context camera feed of the work vehicle's exterior environment, and a controller architecture coupled to the display device and the context camera. The controller architecture is configured to: (i) receive the context camera feed from the context camera; (ii) generate a visually-manipulated context view utilizing the context camera feed; and (iii) output the visually-manipulated context view to the display device for presentation on the display screen. In the process of generating the visually-manipulated context view, the controller architecture applies a dynamic distortion-perspective (D/P) modification effect to the context camera feed, while gradually adjusting a parameter of the dynamic D/P modification effect in response to changes in operator viewing preferences or in response to changes in a current operating condition of the work vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of a method, which is carried-out by a controller architecture of a work vehicle display system, are further disclosed.

Various modifications to the example embodiments may be contemplated by one of skill in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention, as set-forth the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As appearing herein, the term &#x201c;exterior environment&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;surrounding environment&#x201d; are utilized interchangeably to refer to a work environment or spatial region exterior to a work vehicle, whether generally located to the front, to a side, or to the rear of the work vehicle, or any combination thereof. Further, the term &#x201c;display&#x201d; refers the imagery or &#x201c;picture&#x201d; generated on the screen of a display device, while the term &#x201c;display device&#x201d; refers to an image-generating device on which a display is presented. The term &#x201c;view&#x201d; is also utilized in reference to imagery derived from a camera feed, which is captured by a vehicle-mounted context camera and generated on a display device for viewing by a work vehicle operator, to present the operator with imagery seen from the viewpoint of the context camera.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As previously mentioned, work vehicles are commonly equipped with display systems including one or more vehicle-mounted cameras positioned to capture imagery of the work vehicle's surrounding environment. Such cameras are referred to herein as &#x201c;context cameras,&#x201d; while the imagery or video feeds captured by the context cameras are referred to as &#x201c;context camera feeds,&#x201d; given that such vehicle-mounted cameras enable a given work vehicle operator to establish an improved situational or contextual awareness of the work vehicle's surrounding environment. By viewing imagery captured by one or more context cameras, a work vehicle operator can quickly maintain an increasingly comprehensive and timely mental model of a work vehicle's surrounding environment. This is of significant importance in the context of work vehicles employed in construction, agriculture, mining, and forestry industries given the relatively large size of many work vehicles, the complexities involved in piloting work vehicles, and the dynamic environments within which many work vehicles operate. For example, in the case of loaders, excavators, dozers, motor graders, dump trucks, and other work vehicles utilized within the construction industry, it is common for several work vehicles to operate within a shared work space populated with various obstacles, both moving and stationary, and often possessing uneven topologies and other visual hinderances. Consequently, in such situations, work vehicle operators may be required to maintain an acute awareness of the 360 degree spatial region surrounding a given work vehicle, while efficiently performing any number of work tasks assigned to the work vehicle operator.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Existing work vehicle display systems beneficially aid an operator in maintaining an enhanced situational awareness of obstacles and objects within the work vehicle's surrounding environment by presenting live camera feeds or &#x201c;context views,&#x201d; which are captured by vehicle-mounted context cameras, on an in-cabin display device readily viewable by an operator piloting the work vehicle. Additionally, through the incorporation of context cameras having wide-angle or ultrawide-angle lenses, or perhaps through the usage of multiple context cameras having partially-overlapping fields of view (FOVs), relatively expansive, panoramic context camera views can be presented to the work vehicle operator, which may permit the operator to quickly scan and monitor a greater portion of the environment exterior to the work vehicle. For example, in this regard, certain work vehicles may be equipped with an ultrawide-angle backup camera having an angle of view approaching or exceeding 180 degrees. The imagery captured by such an ultrawide-angle backup camera can be presented on a display screen located within the work vehicle to provide a relatively expansive view of the environment located immediately behind the work vehicle, while further capturing spatial regions located to either side of the work vehicle to increase operator awareness of peripheral obstacles, including potential cross-traffic events.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While beneficial for the reasons just described, conventional approaches for furnishing an operator with a panoramic context camera feed captured utilizing a wide-angle or ultrawide-angle context camera, such as a 180 degree backup camera, are associated with certain tradeoffs. Due to the convexity of the camera lens, wide angle cameras often impart significant visual distortion or warping to the captured panoramic (hemispherical) imagery. By conventional practice, such hemispherical distortion is entirely corrected utilizing distortion correction algorithms to yield a fully undistorted image or context camera view, which is then presented for operator viewing. Beneficially, such a fully undistorted image matches a typical camera view and is thus readily comprehended by work vehicle operators. However, the fully undistorted image also inherently omits a certain amount of the peripheral imagery captured by a given context camera, which may be undesirable in at least some work vehicle operating scenarios. For this reason, certain existing display systems enable an operator to deactivate the above-described distortion correction function and view the fully distorted imagery captured by a wide-angle or ultrawide-angle camera. Such a fully distorted view, however, is visually confusing to many operators and can obscure operationally-significant objects located in the periphery of the camera FOV. More generally, panoramic context views, whether generated by correcting a distorted image captured by a wide-angle context camera or produced by compiling camera feeds from multiple context cameras having partially overlapping FOVs, can deemphasize or visually obscure operationally-significant objects due to the breadth of the panoramic view when scaled to fit the in-cabin display screen in at least some instances.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">There thus exists an ongoing demand for work vehicle display systems capable of generating context camera feeds in situationally-intelligent and operator-customizable manners. In satisfaction of this demand, the following discloses work vehicle display systems, which generate so-called &#x201c;visually manipulated context views&#x201d; through the application of dynamic visual effects to imagery captured by one or more vehicle-mounted context cameras. Such visually-manipulated context views are generated utilizing at least one context camera feed, which is captured by one or more context camera mounted to a work vehicle. A controller architecture (e.g., one or more interconnected processors) included in the display system generates the visually-manipulated context view by applying a dynamic distortion-perspective (D/P) modification effect to the context camera feed from which the visually-manipulated context view is derived. While applying such a dynamic D/P effect, the controller architecture gradually or incrementally adjusts at least one parameter of the dynamic D/P modification effect in response to changes in operator viewing preferences or in response to changes in a current operating condition of the work vehicle. The controller architecture then outputs the visually-manipulated context view to a suitable display device for operator viewing. The display device will commonly be located within the cabin of the work vehicle, but may also be located offboard the work vehicle in certain instances, such as when the work vehicle is remotely piloted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As appearing throughout this document, the term &#x201c;dynamic distortion-perspective modification effect&#x201d; or &#x201c;dynamic D/P modification effect&#x201d; refers to a visual effect involving distortion (warping) effects and/or perspective adjustment effects (e.g., simulated horizontal or vertical focal length variations), which vary over time in a gradual, non-abrupt manner in conjunction with operator input specifying operator viewing preferences or in conjunction with monitored operating conditions of a work vehicle. In embodiments, the controller architecture of the work vehicle display system may apply the dynamic D/P modification effect, at in part, by manipulating imagery within a particular context camera feed utilizing a barrel distortion effect to yield a partially-distorted image derived from the context camera feed, with the intensity of the applied distortion gradually increasing or decreasing in conjunction with pertinent data inputs. In addition to or in lieu of such barrel distortion effects, the dynamic D/P modification may also entail simulated focal length adjustments (essentially, varying degrees of vertical and/or horizontal stretching of imagery within the context camera feed), which are applied by the work vehicle display system in generating the visually-manipulated context view. For example, in one approach, the controller architecture of the display system may repeatedly establish the location and dimensions of a crop window bounding an area-of-interest within the context camera feed. The controller architecture then resizes the imagery within the area-of-interest bounded by the crop window to fit the display screen. This process is repeated while adjusting one or more aspects of the crop window (e.g., the crop window length, height, aspect ratio, and/or location) in response to the relevant data input or inputs to yield the visually-manipulated context view. Various other D/P modification effects can also be applied by the controller architecture of the work vehicle display in generating the visually-manipulated context view, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As indicated by the term &#x201c;dynamic,&#x201d; the dynamic D/P modification effect is applied in a reactive manner during which the controller architecture gradually adjusts at least one parameter of the dynamic D/P modification effect in response to changes in operator viewing preferences or to changes in a current operating condition of the work vehicle. As a specific example, in embodiments in which a barrel distortion effect is applied to the context camera feed to generate the visually-manipulated context view, the controller architecture may gradually adjust an intensity of the barrel distortion effect over a particular value range in a gradual, incremental, or visually non-abrupt manner. Such gradual adjustments can be performed as an operator interacts with a graphic user interface (GUI) or physical controls onboard the work vehicle to set the intensity of the barrel distortion effect to preference. Additionally or alternatively, such gradual adjustments in the intensity of the barrel distortion effect may occur in response to a monitored condition of the work vehicle, such as a ground speed of the work vehicle or the proximity of the work vehicle to an obstacle detected by an obstacle detection system onboard the work vehicle. So too may the controller architecture repeatedly adjust the center location of the barrel effect in embodiments (or otherwise adjust the perspective and distortion effects applied when generating the visually-manipulated context view) as appropriate to, for example, generally track a region or item of interest within the context camera feed, such as obstacles detected by the obstacle detection system and posing a potential collision risk to the work vehicle.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In at least some implementations of the work vehicle display system, and as briefly indicated above, the controller architecture may generate the visually-manipulated context view by initially establishing a crop window bounding an area-of-interest within the context camera feed. The controller architecture may then resize imagery within the area-of-interest to fit the display screen, while excluding imagery outside of the crop window to yield the visually-manipulated context view. In this case, the controller architecture may further gradually adjust at least one D/P modification parameter (whether in response to operator input or in response in changes to a monitored operating condition of the work vehicle) by incrementally modifying at least one dimension of the crop window, an aspect ratio of the crop window, or a location of the crop window within the context camera feed. Adjustments to the aspect ratio of the crop window may effectively simulate modifications to a horizontal focal length, a vertical focal length, or another perspective parameter of the visually-manipulated context view relative to the context camera feed; noting that, while the crop window will often possess a generally rectangular geometry, length adjustments to the individual sides of the crop window are possible in embodiments to impart the crop window with a trapezoidal shape or other shape in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Continuing the description above, aspects of the crop window can be adjusted in response to operator input and/or changes in a monitored operating condition of the work vehicle. For example, in certain embodiments, the controller architecture may monitor a ground speed of the work vehicle utilizing a positioning system, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) module or other satellite-based positioning system onboard the work vehicle. The controller architecture may then widen the crop window as the ground speed of the work vehicle increases to impart the operator with an enhanced view of the work vehicle's exterior environment at higher vehicle speeds, particularly the spatial regions of the exterior environment toward which the work vehicle is generally traveling. Again, such changes are applied in a gradual manner such that, as the work vehicle ground speed increases, the crop window gradually widens in a visually non-abrupt manner; noting that, in embodiments, such a function may be selectively activated and deactivated by an operator, or an operator may be permitted to control the rate at which the crop window (and the resulting visually-manipulated context view) varies in width in such circumstances. Further, in such embodiments, the controller architecture may increase height of the crop window at a rate matching the rate of width increase to generally preserve the aspect ratio of the crop window, the controller architecture may increase height of the crop window at a rate different than (e.g., less than) the rate of width increase, or the controller architecture may not alter the height of the crop window, thereby effectively creating a horizontal distortion or stretch effect in conjunction with increasing vehicle ground speed. For example, in embodiments, such effects can be applied to create the impression, as perceived by an operator viewing the visually-manipulated context view, that objects appear increasingly closer to the work vehicle as the ground speed of the work vehicle increases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Aspects of the crop window can be adjusted in relation to other operating conditions of the work vehicle in addition to or in lieu of changes in the work vehicle ground speed. For example, in certain embodiments, the controller architecture may monitor a trajectory of the work vehicle or, perhaps, the trajectory of an implement attached to the work vehicle, such as a bucket or other end effector mounted to a loader through a front end loader assembly or to an excavator through a boom assembly. The controller architecture may then adjust one or more aspects of the crop window in response to changes in the monitored trajectory of the work vehicle or the work vehicle implement. In this regard, the controller architecture may be configured to adjust the one or more aspects of the crop window such that visually-manipulated context view captures a greater portion of a spatial region toward which the work vehicle or the work vehicle implement is presently traveling. Consider, for example, a scenario in which the work vehicle is turning toward a specific spatial region of the geographical region surrounding the work vehicle. Here, the controller architecture may gradually move the crop window within the context camera feed to repeatedly center the crop window on the spatial region toward which the work vehicle is presently headed and/or the controller architecture may gradually widen the crop window to provide an enhanced view of this spatial region. Somewhat similarly, in embodiments in which the work vehicle is equipped with an obstacle detection system, the controller architecture may adjust one or more aspects of the crop window to visually emphasize obstacles detected by the obstacle detection system and posing a potential collision risk to the work vehicle; e.g., in effect, creating the visual impression, as perceived by an operator viewing the visually-manipulated context view, that a detected obstacle appears closer to work vehicle than the obstacle is in actuality when, for example, the detected obstacle poses a collision risk to the work vehicle. As a still more specific example in this regard, the controller architecture may monitor for cross-traffic collision risks utilizing the obstacle detection system; and when detecting a cross-traffic collision risk, adjust the at least one parameter of the dynamic D/P modification effect to reveal a greater portion of a spatial region in which the cross-traffic collision risk is located.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In embodiments of the work vehicle display system, the controller architecture of the work vehicle display system may also to generate the visually-manipulated context view to include perspective-drawn overlay images or graphics, while applying a commensurate dynamic D/P modification effect to the perspective-drawn overlay images. Such perspective-drawn overlay images may be, for example, projected path graphics representing a projected (forecast) path of the work vehicle or, perhaps, visually denoting the project path of an implement attached to the work vehicle. Regardless of whether the visually-manipulated context view is or is not generated as a composite image including such perspective-drawn overlay images, embodiments of the work vehicle display system intelligently provide dynamic, visually non-abrupt D/P adjustments to the visually-manipulated context view in response to variations in monitored operating conditions of the work vehicle and/or in response to tailored adjustments in operator viewing preferences. In so doing, embodiments of the work vehicle display system provide a higher level of customizability to better suit operator preferences and different operational scenarios, while further enhancing operator situational awareness to improve safety and work vehicle efficiency in an intuitive, visually seamless manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An example embodiment of the work vehicle display system will now be discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.

The provision of the side-view context cameras <b>56</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>56</b>-<b>3</b> may be particularly useful when, for example, it is desirable to monitor cross-traffic conditions within the work environment in which the wheel loader <b>20</b> operates.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In alternative implementations, the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> can include a greater or lesser number of context cameras, which can be positioned at various mount locations about the wheel loader <b>20</b> and oriented to capture any region exterior to the loader <b>20</b>. For example, in certain cases, a forward-facing context camera may be mounted to the FEL assembly <b>24</b>, to the bucket <b>26</b>, or to the roof of the cabin <b>30</b> to provide a forward-facing view unobstructed (or less obstructed) by the bucket <b>26</b> when raised to a height at which the bucket <b>26</b> partially blocks the operator's view from the loader cabin <b>30</b>. When the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> contains multiple context cameras, an operator may be permitted to switch between the live camera feeds or context views captured by the cameras by, for example, interacting with GUI elements generated on the display device <b>54</b> or otherwise interacting with the display system <b>22</b> utilizing the operator interface <b>52</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may automatically switch between different cameras views based upon a monitored operating condition of the wheel loader <b>20</b> in at least some instances. For example, in certain cases, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may automatically (that is, without requiring additional operator input) generate a visually-manipulated context view from the camera feed provided by the context camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b> (if not presently generated) when the wheel loader <b>20</b> is placed in reverse. Similarly, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may automatically switch between different camera views in embodiments to, for example, better show obstacles detected by the obstacle detection system <b>70</b> within close proximity of the wheel loader <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Advancing to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a flowchart of a display process <b>80</b>, which is suitably carried-out by the controller architecture <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to generate a visually-manipulated context view on a display device (e.g., the display device <b>54</b> of the wheel loader <b>20</b>), is depicted in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure.

In still other instances, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may commence context view manipulation process <b>80</b> in response to a different trigger event, such the receipt of operator input via the operator interface <b>52</b> indicating that the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> is desirably executed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">After commencing the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> (STEP <b>82</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the controller architecture <b>48</b> receives the live camera imagery or &#x201c;context camera feed&#x201d; captured by one or more vehicle-mounted context cameras, such as one or more of the context cameras <b>56</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>56</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>56</b>-<b>3</b> mounted to the wheel loader <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As noted above, the context camera feeds may be provided over wired or wireless connections and availed to the controller architecture <b>48</b> in any manner. Subsequently, at STEP <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the controller architecture <b>48</b> generates a visually-manipulated context view from at least one of the context camera feeds. In embodiments in which a work vehicle is equipped with a single context camera, the controller architecture <b>48</b> generates the visually-manipulated context view from the camera feed provided by this context camera during STEP <b>86</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b>.

As a further possibility, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may concurrently generate multiple visually-manipulated context views from different context camera feeds when the visually-manipulated context views are simultaneously presented on different display devices or when the visually-manipulated context views are simultaneously presented on a single display device (e.g., the in-cabin display device <b>54</b>) in, for example, a side-by-side or picture-in-picture format. In still other instances, the controller architecture <b>48</b> to visually combine, compile, or stitch together imagery from multiple context camera feeds to yield the visually-manipulated context view.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As previously indicated, when multiple context camera feeds are received during STEP <b>84</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> will typically select a single context camera for image processing (e.g., selective application of the below-described distortion and perspective modification effects) to thereby yield the desired visually-manipulated context view for presentation to an operator of the wheel loader <b>20</b> (or other work vehicle). For example, in this case, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may simply select the context camera feed presently-selected by an operator of the wheel loader <b>20</b> through control commands entered via operator interface <b>52</b>; e.g., a GUI may be generated on the display screen <b>66</b> enabling an operator to navigate or switch between the context camera feeds provided by the context cameras <b>56</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>60</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>60</b>-<b>3</b>, as desired. In other instances, and as noted above, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may automatically select a context camera feed for processing based upon a current operating condition of the wheel loader <b>20</b>, such as whether the wheel loader <b>20</b> is presented traveling in a rearward direction (in which case the controller architecture <b>48</b> may select the camera feed provided by the rear-facing context camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b> for processing during STEP <b>86</b>) or whether a nearby obstacle is detected to the right, left, or rear of the work vehicle (in which case the controller architecture <b>48</b> may select the context camera feed most clearly showing the detected obstacle for processing during STEP <b>86</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At STEP <b>86</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> generates the visually-manipulated context view from the selected context camera feed. Examples of manners in which the controller architecture. Generally, the controller architecture <b>48</b> accomplishes this by applying a dynamic D/P modification effect to imagery within the selected context camera feed, while adjusting certain aspects or parameters of the D/P modification effect in response to variations in operator viewing preferences or a monitored operating condition of the wheel loader <b>20</b>. Such adjustments are applied in an essentially continual or gradual manner such that, considered over a period time, the perspective or distortion characteristics of the visually-manipulated context view gradually change in a visually non-abrupt manner; e.g., the visually-manipulated context view may appear to gradually stretch or compress in horizontal or vertical dimensions, or appear to gradually become more or less distorted, depending upon the dynamic D/P modification effect applied. Additional description of one manner in which the controller architecture <b>48</b> may generate the visually-manipulated context view from the selected context camera feed is provided below in connection with the SUBPROCESS <b>94</b> shown on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">After generating the visually-manipulated context view (STEP <b>86</b>), the controller architecture <b>48</b> outputs the visually-manipulated context view to a display device for presentation to an operator piloting or, perhaps, overseeing the piloting of the wheel loader <b>20</b> (STEP <b>88</b>). As noted above, the visually-manipulated context view will often be presented on a display device located within the loader cabin <b>30</b>, such as the in-cabin display device <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, in instances in which the wheel loader <b>20</b> is remotely piloted, or in instances in which a remotely-located operator oversees the piloting of the wheel loader <b>20</b> (including when the wheel loader <b>20</b> is piloted with varying degrees of autonomy), the visually-manipulated context view may be generated on a display device located remotely from the wheel loader <b>20</b> (again, generally represented by the box <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and transmitted from the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> via the wireless datalink <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Lastly, the controller architecture <b>48</b> of the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> progresses to STEP <b>90</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). During STEP <b>90</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> determines whether termination of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> is warranted; e.g., due to operator input requesting termination of the process <b>80</b> or due to shutdown of the wheel loader <b>20</b>. If determining that the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> should be terminated, the controller architecture <b>48</b> progresses to STEP <b>92</b> and terminates the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> accordingly. Otherwise, the controller architecture <b>48</b> returns to the STEP <b>84</b> and the above-described process steps of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> repeat. By performing the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> in this manner, the controller architecture <b>48</b> repeatedly updates the visually-manipulated context view in accordance with variations in the D/P parameters. Thus, through gradual adjustments in the applicable D/P effects (e.g., gradual changes in simulated focal lengths or barrel distortion effects, as described below), the visually-manipulated context view may adapt to changes in one or more monitored operating conditions of the work vehicle to provide a tailored display increasing operator situational or contextual awareness in a variety of scenarios when piloting the wheel loader <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an example SUBPROCESS <b>94</b> suitably carried-out by the controller architecture <b>48</b> in generating the visually-manipulated context view from the selected context camera feed is presented on the right side of this drawing figure. During the SUBPROCESS <b>94</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> generates the visually-manipulated context view by applying at least one dynamic D/P modification effect to the selected context camera view, as received during STEP <b>84</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b>, while gradually adjusting at least one parameter of the dynamic D/P modification effect in response to certain changes in operator viewing preferences or in response to changes in a current operating condition of the work vehicle. To this end, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may initially recall default values for the applicable D/P parameters during SUBSTEP <b>96</b> from the memory <b>64</b>. The default values may specify, for example, a default location and dimensions of a crop window bounding an area-of-interest within the context camera feed in embodiments. Additionally, in embodiments in which a barrel distortion or warping effect is applied, a default center location and intensity of the barrel distortion effect may be recalled from the memory <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, during SUBSTEP <b>96</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> determines when, and to what degree, to implement gradual or incremental adjustments to the D/P parameters based on one or more input variables. As previously noted, and as indicated by labeled box <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, such gradual adjustment to the D/P parameters may be performed in response operator input entered into the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> utilizing the operator interface <b>52</b>. In one approach, an operator may interact with certain GUI elements, such as virtual sliders, generated as part of a GUI produced on the display screen <b>66</b> of the in-cabin display device <b>54</b> to adjust to preference one or more of the D/P parameters utilized in generating the visually-manipulated context view, with an example of such a GUI shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Additionally or alternatively, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may implement gradual adjustments to the D/P parameters based on sensor input received from one or more of the onboard sensors <b>50</b>, as indicated by labeled box <b>108</b>. Again, such sensor input can include data provided the obstacle detection system <b>70</b> indicating the location and movement characteristics of nearby obstacles, data describing the location and movement of the wheel loader <b>20</b> (e.g., as determined from GPS data received via GPS model included in the additional sensors <b>72</b>), or any other data monitored by the onboard sensors <b>72</b> and usefully considered in dynamically adjusting the D/P effect applied to the context camera feed to yield the visually-manipulated context view. The controller architecture <b>48</b> then applies the dynamic D/P effect to the context camera feed utilizing the current values of the D/P parameters (SUBSTEP <b>100</b>); and, when appropriate, further applies a matching dynamic D/P effect to any perspective-drawn overlay graphics or images (SUBSTEP <b>102</b>), such projected path graphics visually demarcating a projected path of the wheel loader <b>20</b> or an implement attached thereto (in the present example, the projected path of the bucket <b>26</b>). Following this, the controller architecture <b>48</b> advances to STEP <b>88</b> and outputs the visually-manipulated context view to at least one display device (e.g., the in-cabin display device <b>54</b>) for operator presentation, as previously described.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an example manner in which the above-described context view manipulation process <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may be performed by the controller architecture <b>48</b> to generate a visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b> from a context camera feed <b>112</b> is schematically presented. In this particular example, and as shown in an upper left panel <b>114</b>, the context camera feed <b>112</b> is received from a 180&#xb0; backup camera, which may correspond to the rear-facing context camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b> of the wheel loader <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. As can be seen, the captured imagery is highly distorted due to the ultrawide angle lens of the rear-facing context camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b>. As discussed above in connection with the context view manipulation process <b>80</b>, and as briefly summarized in a function block <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> applies a dynamic D/P modification effect to the context camera feed <b>112</b>, varying the parameters of the D/P modification effect in response to operator input and/or sensor input as appropriate, and outputs the resulting visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b> to the display device <b>54</b> for presentation on the screen thereof. In this particular example, the controller architecture <b>48</b> applies the D/P modification effect as variable barrel distortion effect, which may partially offset or help correct the distortion of the ultrawide angle lens of the rear-facing context camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b>, although it should be noted that this distortion may be only partially corrected to varying extents as discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. Further, varying degrees of simulated vertical and horizontal focal length adjustments may be applied to the source imagery (the context camera feed <b>112</b>) in applying the D/P modification effect and generating the visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b>, as further discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. Finally, as shown in the lower right corner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> also applies the dynamic D/P modification effect to any perspective-drawn overlay graphics, such as projected path lines <b>118</b> shown in the visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b> and visually indicating the projected path of the wheel loader <b>20</b> when traveling in a rearward direction.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In embodiments in which the D/P modification effect is operator-adjustable or customizable, various different interfaces, whether virtual and physical in nature, may be provided to enable an operator to vary the adjustable D/P parameters to preference. An example of a GUI window <b>120</b> suitably generated on the display screen of the in-cabin display device <b>54</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and includes a number of virtual sliders <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> for adjusting different D/P parameters. Specifically, in the illustrated example, a first slider <b>122</b> is generated as part of the GUI window <b>120</b> enabling the work vehicle operator to adjust the simulated vertical focal length of the visually-manipulated context view over a first range, a second slider <b>124</b> is generated enabling the operator to adjust the simulated vertical focal length of the visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b> over a second range, and a third slider <b>126</b> is generated enabling the operator to adjust the simulated vertical focal length of the visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b> over a third range. As indicated by a touch icon <b>128</b>, in embodiments where the display device <b>54</b> has touchscreen capabilities, the operator may interact with the slidable markers <b>130</b> to drag or slide the markers <b>130</b> in a manner setting the indicated D/P parameters to preference. In other embodiments, an operator may adjust such D/P parameters in another manner; or the D/P parameters may not be operator adjustable and may be varied exclusively by the controller architecture <b>48</b> in response to variations in one or more monitored operating conditions of the wheel loader <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Finally, as further indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the D/P parameters may also be varied in response to other forms of operator input, which can be utilized to infer desired visual adjustments to the visually-manipulated context view <b>110</b>. For example, in implementations in which certain work vehicle functions (e.g., FEL assembly or boom assembly movements) are controlled via one or more joysticks or control levers located within the work vehicle cabin, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may vary one or more D/P parameters in response to the characteristics (e.g., speed, displacement, and direction) of the joystick movements. As a more specific example, in an alternative implementation in which the display system <b>22</b> is integrated into an excavator, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may adjust certain aspects of the D/P parameters (e.g., widen the below-described crop window) in response to increasingly pronounced joystick movements rotating the excavator boom assembly, bucket (or another implement), and cabin relative to the tracked undercarriage of the excavator.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In at least some implementations of the work vehicle display system <b>22</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may generate the visually-manipulated context view by initially establishing a crop window bounding an area-of-interest within a context camera feed received during STEP <b>84</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b>. In one approach, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may then resize imagery within the area-of-interest to fit the display screen, while excluding imagery outside of the crop window to yield the visually-manipulated context view for presentation on the in-cabin display device <b>54</b> (or another display device associated with the wheel loader <b>20</b>). In this case, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may further gradually adjust at least one D/P modification parameter (whether in response to operator input received via the operator interface <b>52</b> or in response in changes to a monitored operating condition of the wheel loader <b>20</b>) by incrementally modifying at least one dimension of the crop window, an aspect ratio of the crop window, or a center location of the crop window within the context camera feed. When such an approach is employed, adjustments to the aspect ratio of the crop window may, in effect, simulate modifications to a horizontal focal length, a vertical focal length, or another perspective parameter of the visually-manipulated context view relative to the context camera feed from which the context view is derived. Further description in this regard will now be provided in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">An example of one manner in which the controller architecture <b>48</b> may utilize the above-mentioned image modification technique to simulate vertical focal length adjustments in generating the visually-manipulated context view during STEP <b>86</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As indicated in an upper panel <b>132</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> receives the selected context camera feed <b>134</b>. In this particular example, the context camera feed <b>134</b> is again depicted as a back-up camera feed, which is shown in an undistorted state for clarity. Additionally, perspective-drawn overlay graphics in the form of projected path graphics or lines <b>136</b> are superimposed onto the context camera feed <b>134</b> in the upper panel <b>132</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for clarity. In conjunction with receiving the selected context camera feed <b>134</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> determines the appropriate D/P modifications based upon operator input or a monitored operating condition of the work vehicle at issue; e.g., in the case of the wheel loader <b>20</b>, the current ground speed of the wheel loader <b>20</b>, the current trajectory or steering angle of the wheel loader <b>20</b>, or the proximity of any nearby obstacles detected by the obstacle detection system <b>70</b>. In this example, the adjustable parameters of the D/P modification effect may define the boundaries and location of a crop window <b>104</b>, an example of which is shown in a middle panel <b>138</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As further indicated by arrows <b>140</b>, the imagery within the crop window <b>104</b> is then resized (here, effectively stretching the area-of-interest in vertical directions) to yield the visually-manipulated context view <b>142</b> shown in the lower panel <b>144</b>, which is then presented on the in-cabin display device <b>54</b> (or another display device) for operator viewing. Further, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> by a box <b>146</b>, a matching D/P modification (here, a perspective modification) is also applied to the projected path lines <b>136</b> in yielding the composite imagery shown in the lower panel <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Similarly, as indicated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and with like numbers carried-over to identify the context camera feed <b>134</b> and the projected path lines <b>136</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> of the work vehicle display system <b>22</b> receives the context camera feed (upper panel <b>148</b>) and applies the appropriate D/P modification (middle panel <b>150</b>) to generate a visually-manipulated context view <b>152</b> (lower panel <b>154</b>). However, in this particular example, the D/P modification effect applied by the controller architecture <b>48</b> entails a simulated horizontal focal length adjustment. According, a crop window <b>156</b> is established having a width, which may be varied by the controller architecture <b>48</b> over an essentially continuous range in accordance with operator input and/or one or more monitored work vehicle operating condition. As indicated by a number of arrows <b>158</b> in the middle panel <b>160</b>, the crop window <b>156</b> is then resized (here, vertically stretched) by the controller architecture <b>48</b> in arriving at the visually-manipulated context view <b>152</b> shown in the lower panel <b>154</b>.

Once again, the controller architecture <b>48</b> receives the context camera feed (upper panel <b>162</b>) from a vehicle-mounted context camera (e.g., the back-up camera <b>56</b>-<b>1</b> mounted to the wheel loader <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>) and applies the appropriate D/P modification (middle panel <b>164</b>) to generate a visually-manipulated context view, such as the visually-manipulated context view <b>166</b> shown in the lower panel <b>168</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In this particular example, both the height and width of a crop window <b>170</b> are adjusted dynamically in response to changes in user input and/or one or more monitored operating conditions of the work vehicle, with the crop window <b>170</b> then resized or stretched as appropriate to fit the display screen <b>66</b> of the display device <b>54</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>172</b>. The controller architecture <b>48</b> may vary the height and width of the crop window <b>156</b> to preserve the aspect ratio of the window <b>156</b> in embodiments, while this may not be the case in other embodiments. Additionally, and as indicated by a labeled box <b>174</b>, a matching D/P effect is also applied to the projected path lines <b>136</b> (or any other perspective-drawn graphics), which are generated in conjunction with or as part of the visually-manipulated context view <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The above-described manner, the adjustments to the width and/or length of the crop windows <b>104</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>170</b> may effectively simulate modifications to a horizontal focal length, a vertical focal length, or another perspective parameter of the visually-manipulated context view relative to the context camera feed. Such aspects the crop windows <b>104</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>170</b> can be adjusted in response to operator input and/or changes in a monitored operating condition of the work vehicle, as described throughout this document. For example, in embodiments, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may widen the crop window as the ground speed of the work vehicle (e.g., the wheel loader <b>20</b>) increases to impart the operator with an enhanced view of the work vehicle's exterior environment at higher vehicle speeds. Such changes are applied in a gradual manner such that, as the work vehicle ground speed increases, the crop window gradually widens in a visually non-abrupt manner. Further, in such embodiments, the controller architecture may increase height of the crop window at a rate matching the rate of width increase to generally preserve the aspect ratio of the crop window, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may increase height of the crop window at a rate different than (e.g., less than) the rate of width increase, or the controller architecture <b>48</b> may not alter the height of the crop window, thereby effectively creating a horizontal distortion or stretch effect in conjunction with increasing vehicle ground speed. In embodiments, such gradual changes in the dimension of the crop window may be applied to create the false impression, as perceived by a work vehicle operator viewing the visually-manipulated context view, that distances between the work vehicle and nearby objects are increasingly reduced with increasing work vehicle ground speeds. In this manner, the visually-manipulated context view may be generated such objects may appear increasingly closer to the work vehicle as higher work vehicle higher speeds and increasingly further from the work vehicle at lower work vehicle speeds.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Aspects of the crop windows <b>104</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>170</b> can be adjusted in relation to other operating conditions of the work vehicle in addition to or in lieu of changes in the work vehicle ground speed. For example, in certain embodiments, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may monitor a trajectory of the work vehicle or, perhaps, an implement attached to the work vehicle, such as the bucket <b>26</b> mounted to the wheel loader <b>20</b>. The controller architecture <b>48</b> may then adjust one or more aspects of the crop window in response to changes in the monitored trajectory of the wheel loader <b>20</b> or the bucket <b>26</b>. Specifically, in at least some realizations, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may be configured to adjust the one or more aspects of the crop window such that visually-manipulated context view captures a greater portion of a spatial region toward which the work vehicle or the work vehicle implement is presently traveling. For example, when the wheel loader <b>20</b> is turning in a particular direction, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may gradually move the crop window within the context camera feed to generally center the crop window on the spatial region toward which the work vehicle is headed and/or the controller architecture <b>48</b> may gradually widen the crop window to provide an enhanced view of this spatial region. In an analogous manner, in embodiments in which the work vehicle is equipped with an obstacle detection system, such as the obstacle detection system <b>70</b> of the wheel loader <b>20</b>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may adjust one or more aspects of the crop window to visually emphasize obstacles detected by the obstacle detection system <b>70</b> and posing a potential collision risk to the work vehicle.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may apply other dynamic D/P effects in generating the visually-manipulated context view in addition to or in lieu of the above-described simulated horizontal and/or vertical focal length adjustments. For example, in at least some implementations, the controller architecture <b>48</b> may apply a barrel distortion effect to the context camera feed received at STEP <b>84</b> of the context view manipulation process <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) in generating the visually-manipulated context view, while varying the center and/or the intensity of the barrel distortion effect in conjunction operator preferences or monitored operating conditions of the wheel loader <b>20</b>. An example in which the controller architecture <b>48</b> applies a barrel distortion effect having a relatively low intensity (yielding a slightly distorted image) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Again carrying-over the reference numerals as appropriate, the controller architecture <b>48</b> receives the selected context camera feed (upper panel <b>176</b>) and determines the current severity or intensity of the barrel distortion effect based upon the relevant input factors, which may include operator input specifying operator viewing preferences or sensor input indicative of a current operating condition (e.g., ground speed, heading, or relative positioning to nearby obstacles) of the wheel loader <b>20</b>. The controller architecture <b>48</b> then generates a distortion window <b>178</b> (middle panel <b>180</b>) utilizing a suitable barrel distortion formula or algorithm. Different barrel distortion formulae are known and suitable for usage in embodiments of the work vehicle display system <b>22</b>. An example of one such formula (also set-forth in a box <b>182</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) is set-forth below:</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>x</i><sub>distorted</sub><i>=x</i><sub>undistorted</sub>*(1+<i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>*k</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">wherein the variable x is the x (or y) pixel location in the image (with the distorted image corresponding to the visually-manipulated context view), the variable r is the distance from optical center, and the variable k is a coefficient determining the severity or intensity of the distortion (warping) effect. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, only a mild or slight distortion effect is applied such that k=0.1.

It is also possible for the controller architecture <b>48</b> to vary the center location of the barrel distortion effect in at least some instances to, for example, to generally track movement of a detected obstacle relative to the work vehicle.
