The copper-clad laminates are materials produced by impregnating a glass cloth fabricated of glass fibers with a vanish containing a resin such as epoxy as a main component, and thereafter laminating copper foils on both sides thereof, and having a lamination structure. In recent years, with an advance in the capacity increase of signals for electric devices, resin materials to be used for copper-clad laminates are required to have dielectric characteristics such as low dielectric constants and low dielectric loss tangents, which are necessary for high-speed communication. The resin materials also need high adhesion with copper foils and high solder heat resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">As resin compositions which may be used for copper-clad laminates, various resin compositions are proposed. For example, Patent Document 1 proposes a thermosetting resin composition containing (A) a copolymer resin having a structural unit originated from an aromatic vinyl compound and a structural unit originated from maleic anhydride, (B) a both-molecular terminal hydroxyl group-terminated epoxy-modified polybutadiene, (C) an active ester compound and (D) one or more selected from the group consisting of maleimide compounds and modified substances thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Patent Document 2 proposes a thermosetting resin composition containing (A) a copolymer resin having a structural unit originated from an aromatic vinyl compound and a structural unit originated from maleic anhydride, (B) an epoxy-modified polybutadiene having hydroxyl groups and (C) a maleimide compound.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Patent Document 3 proposes a flame-retardant epoxy resin composition containing (A) an epoxidized polybutadiene compound as an essential component, and containing, for example, a polyfunctional cresol novolac epoxy resin, a polyfunctional brominated epoxy resin, and a triazine-modified cresol novolac resin and further a large amount of flame-retardant inorganic fillers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Patent Document 4 proposes a resin composition having excellent heat resistance, dielectric characteristics and water absorption, by using the resin composition containing a cyanate resin and an epoxy-modified polybutadiene resin in combination.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Patent Document 5 proposes a heat-resistant resin composition containing, as essential components, (A) a specific benzocyclobutene resin or a prepolymer thereof, (B) an epoxy-modified polybutadiene resin, (C) a halogenated epoxy resin and (D) a curing agent having a reaction group reactive with the epoxy group.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Patent Document 6 proposes a heat-resistant resin composition containing, as essential components, (A) a specific benzocyclobutene resin or a prepolymer thereof, (B) an epoxy-modified polybutadiene resin and (C) an aromatic amine compound containing one or more halogen atoms in the molecule.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Patent Document 7 proposes a curable resin composition having a low thermal expansion coefficient, and containing a copolymer constituted of a conjugated dienic polymer block and an N-substituted maleimide polymer block, a thermosetting resin and a silicon-modified polybutadiene.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Patent Document 8 proposes an adhesive for a copper foil for a copper-clad laminate, comprising a resin composition containing a polyvinyl butyral resin, an epoxy resin and a curing agent thereof, and an amino resin, and comprising an acidic curing agent for crosslinking these components.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">Meanwhile, polymers modified with a structure containing Si atoms are known.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">For example, Patent Document 9 describes a linear modified dienic polymer having a functional group of the following formula (1) only on one terminal thereof wherein the average number of the functional groups per one molecule is 0.8 to 1.

A glass cloth was dipped in the vanish to impregnate the glass cloth with the resin. Thereafter, the vanish-impregnated glass cloth was dried at 150&#xb0; C. for 10 min to thereby obtain a prepreg. The mat surface of a copper foil of 18 &#x3bc;m in thickness was laminated on one surface of the prepreg. Thereafter, the resultant was heated at 195&#xb0; C. for 120 min under a pressure of 3 MPa to thereby obtain a metal-clad laminate.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Example</entry><entry>Comparative Example</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Terminally modified polybutadiene A</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>Terminally modified polybutadiene B</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>Terminally modified polybutadiene C</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>B-1000</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>B-3000</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>1,4-Polybutadiene</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry>Toluene</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry>Dicumyl peroxide</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">(Dielectric Constant, Dielectric Loss Tangent)</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0075">The dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent were measured for the resin alone.
