particularly, to an electronic component having a capacitor and its manufacturing method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Patent Documents 1 and 2 disclose an electronic component having a capacitor and an inductor formed on a substrate. The capacitor described in Patent Documents 1 and 2 includes a lower electrode, a dielectric film covering the lower electrode, and an upper electrode that faces the lower electrode through the dielectric film. In electronic components of such a type, a good conductor such as copper is used for the material of the upper and lower electrodes, and an inorganic insulating material such as silicon nitride is used for the dielectric film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">[Patent Document 1] JP 2007-142109A</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">[Patent Document 2] JP 2008-034626A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, an inorganic insulating material such as silicon nitride has high stress, so that when it is formed over the entire surface of a substrate, peeling may occur due to stress. Such peeling is most conspicuous at the corner portion which is the terminal edge between the top and side surfaces of a lower electrode and may propagate from the corner portion. The peeling of the dielectric film not only deteriorates reliability of a product but also may make a capacitance deviate from a designed value. Such a problem occurs not only for the inorganic insulating material but also for materials having high stress.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an electronic component having a capacitor and capable of preventing peeling at the interface between the lower electrode and the dielectric film by relaxing the stress of the dielectric film.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An electronic component according to the present invention includes: a lower electrode provided on the main surface of a substrate; a dielectric film that covers at least the top and side surfaces of the lower electrode; and an upper electrode stacked on the top surface of the lower electrode through the dielectric film, wherein a part of the dielectric film that is parallel to the main surface of the substrate is removed at least partly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, a part of the dielectric film that is parallel to the main surface of the substrate is removed at least partly, so that stress is relaxed due to the removal of the dielectric film. This can prevent peeling at the interface between the lower electrode and the dielectric film.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the present invention, a part of the dielectric film that covers the corner part that is a terminal edge between the top and side surfaces of the lower electrode may be removed at least partly. This can prevent peeling at the corner part on which stress is likely to concentrate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present invention, the dielectric film may include a first part that covers the top surface of the lower electrode not through the upper electrode, and the first part may be removed at least partly. This can effectively prevent peeling at the interface between the upper surface of the lower electrode and the dielectric film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present invention, the dielectric film may include a second part that covers the main surface of the substrate not through the lower electrode, and the second part may be removed at least partly. The second part of the dielectric film has a large area, so that by removing the second part at least partly, stress can be effectively relaxed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The electronic component according to the present invention may further include a passivation film that covers the upper electrode in a region where the upper electrode is present and covers the dielectric film in a region where the upper electrode is absent, and a part of a laminated film of the dielectric film and passivation film that is parallel to the main surface of the substrate may be removed at least partly. The laminated film of the dielectric film and passivation film has higher stress, so that by removing at least partly a part of the laminated film that is parallel to the main surface of the substrate, stress can be relaxed. In this case, the dielectric film and passivation film may be both made of an inorganic insulating material. When both the dielectric film and passivation film are made of an inorganic material, the laminated film has higher stress; however, even in this case, peeling can be prevented due to stress relaxation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electronic component according to the present invention may further include an inductor pattern positioned in the same conductive layer as the lower electrode, and a part of the dielectric film positioned on the top surface of the inductor pattern may be removed at least partly. This can provide an LC filter having high reliability.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An electronic component manufacturing method according to the present invention includes the steps of: forming a lower electrode on the main surface of a substrate; forming a dielectric film on the main surface of the substrate and the top and side surfaces of the lower electrode; forming a upper electrode that faces the top surface of the lower electrode through the dielectric film; and removing at least partly a part of the dielectric film that is positioned on the main surface of the substrate or on the top surface of the lower electrode.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, a part of the dielectric film that is positioned on the main surface of the substrate or on the top surface of the lower electrode is removed at least partly, so that stress of the dielectric film is relaxed.

This can relax the stress of the laminated film having higher stress.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above,

The capacitor C is constituted by the conductive pattern <b>15</b> as the lower electrode, the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode, and the dielectric film <b>4</b> positioned between the conductive patterns <b>15</b> and <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the capacitor C.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, assuming that, in a plan view, the width of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> as the lower electrode is W<b>1</b>, the widths of the dielectric film <b>4</b> and passivation film <b>5</b> are each W<b>2</b>, and the width of the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode is W<b>3</b>, W<b>1</b>&#x3e;W<b>2</b>&#x3e;W<b>3</b> is satisfied in the present embodiment. Accordingly, a part of the top surface <b>15</b><i>t </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> that overlaps the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is covered with the dielectric film <b>4</b>, whereas a part thereof that does not overlap the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is partly not covered with the laminated film <b>7</b> of the dielectric film <b>4</b> and passivation film <b>5</b>, i.e., partly exposed. In particular, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the entire corner part <b>15</b><i>c</i>, which is the terminal edge between the top and side surfaces <b>15</b><i>t </i>and <b>15</b><i>s </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is not covered with the laminated film <b>7</b> of the dielectric film <b>4</b> and passivation film <b>5</b> but exposed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, stress is relaxed due to removal of the laminated film <b>7</b>, making peeling at the interface between the conductive pattern <b>15</b> and the dielectric film <b>4</b> less likely to occur. In particular, stress concentrates on a part of the laminated film <b>7</b> that covers the corner part <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b>, so that peeling is likely to occur starting from this part; however, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the entire corner part <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is exposed, thereby preventing peeling starting from the corer part.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the laminated film <b>7</b> is also removed from a part parallel to the main surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, i.e., the surface of the planarizing layer <b>3</b> and the top surface <b>16</b><i>t </i>of the conductive pattern <b>16</b> constituting the inductor pattern, whereby deterioration in reliability due to peeling of the dielectric film <b>4</b> is prevented.

The slit SL<b>1</b> is formed annually so as to surround the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode in a plan view. With such a configuration, stress can be relaxed due to the presence of the slit SL<b>1</b>. In particular, the slit SL<b>1</b> is formed in the vicinity of the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode, so that even when peeling occurs at, for example, a part that covers the corner part <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b>, it does not propagate to a part functioning as the capacitor C.

Although many pieces of the electronic components <b>1</b> are obtained from an aggregate substrate in the manufacturing process of the electronic component <b>1</b>, the following explanation will be given focusing on the manufacturing process of one electrode component <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the planarizing layer <b>3</b> is formed by sputtering or the like on the substrate (aggregate substrate) <b>2</b>, and the surface of the planarizing layer <b>3</b> is subjected to grinding or mirror finishing such as CMP for planarization. Thereafter, the seed layer S is formed by sputtering or the like on the surface of the planarizing layer <b>3</b>. Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a resist layer R<b>1</b> is spin-coated on the seed layer S and then patterned so as to expose a part of the seed layer S on which the conductive layer M<b>1</b> is to be formed. In this state, electrolyte plating is performed using the seed layer S as a feed to form a plating layer P on the seed layer S as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. A laminated body of the seed layer S and plating layer P constitutes the conductive layer M<b>1</b>. In the cross section illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the conductive layer M<b>1</b> includes the conductive patterns <b>11</b> and <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, after removal of the resist layer R<b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, wet etching is performed using an acid to remove the seed layer S covered with the resist layer R<b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the dielectric film <b>4</b> is formed on the entire surface of the conductive layer M<b>1</b> including the top and side surfaces thereof. The dielectric film <b>4</b> may be formed of a paraelectric material such as silicon nitride (SiNx) or silicon oxide (SiOx) and other known ferroelectric material. The dielectric film <b>4</b> can be formed by sputtering, plasma CVD, MOCVD, sol-gel, electron beam vapor deposition, or the like. As a result, the top surface <b>15</b><i>t</i>, side surface <b>15</b><i>s</i>, and corner part <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> are all completely covered with the dielectric film <b>4</b>. Similarly, the top surface <b>16</b><i>t</i>, side surface <b>16</b><i>s</i>, and corner part <b>16</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>16</b> are also all completely covered with the dielectric film <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the same method as that for the conductive layer M<b>1</b> is used to form the conductive pattern <b>18</b> on the top surface of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> through the dielectric film <b>4</b>. The conductive pattern <b>18</b> is also formed of a laminated body of the seed layer S and plating layer P. This completes the conductive layer MM to thereby form a capacitor having the conductive pattern <b>15</b> as the lower electrode and the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode. Although not particularly limited, it is preferable to make the film thickness of the conductive layer MM smaller than that of the conductive layer M<b>1</b>. This increases processing accuracy of the conductive layer MM to reduce a variation in capacitance due to the processing accuracy.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the passivation film <b>5</b> that covers the conductive layers M<b>1</b> and MM is formed over the entire exposed surface. As a result, the conductive pattern <b>18</b> as the upper electrode is directly covered with the passivation film <b>5</b>, and a region where the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is absent is covered with the laminated film <b>7</b> of the dielectric film <b>4</b> and passivation film <b>5</b>. Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, a resist layer R<b>2</b> that covers the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is formed, and the laminated film <b>7</b> is etched in this state. At this time, a part of the top surface <b>15</b><i>t </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> that is not covered with the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is partly exposed from the resist layer R<b>2</b>, whereby the laminated film <b>7</b> that covers the top surface <b>15</b><i>t </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is partly removed, with the result that the top surface <b>15</b><i>t </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is exposed at this part. Further, the corner part <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is also made to be exposed from the resist layer R<b>2</b> and is thereby exposed in the same manner as the top surface <b>15</b><i>t</i>. On the other hand, a large part of the side surface <b>15</b><i>s </i>of the conductive pattern <b>15</b> is kept being covered with the laminated film <b>7</b> excluding the vicinity of the corner part <b>15</b><i>c</i>. For the conductive pattern <b>16</b> constituting the inductor pattern as well, the laminated film <b>7</b> covering the top surface <b>16</b><i>t </i>and corner part <b>16</b><i>c </i>is removed, while the side surface <b>16</b><i>s </i>is kept being covered with the laminated film <b>7</b>. Further, the surface of the planarizing layer <b>3</b> on which the conductive layer M<b>1</b> is not formed is subjected to the removal of the laminated film <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Then, after the removal of the resist layer R<b>2</b>, the insulating layer <b>6</b> is formed over the entire exposed surface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. Subsequently, the insulating layer <b>6</b> is patterned to form the vias <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>a </i>in the insulating layer <b>6</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The passivation film <b>5</b> that covers the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is exposed to the bottom of the via <b>25</b><i>a</i>, and the conductive pattern <b>16</b> is exposed to the bottom of the via <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a resist layer R<b>3</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>6</b>, and an opening <b>31</b> that overlaps the via <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed in the resist layer R<b>3</b>. As a result, the passivation film <b>5</b> that covers the top surface of the conductive pattern <b>18</b> is exposed through the opening <b>31</b>. In this state, ion milling or the like is applied to remove the passivation film <b>5</b> exposed to the opening <b>31</b> to expose the top surface of the conductive pattern <b>18</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Then, the resist layer R<b>3</b> is removed, and then the conductive layer M<b>2</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>6</b> using the same method as the formation method for the conductive layer M<b>1</b>, whereby the electronic component <b>1</b> having the cross-section illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is completed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, in the electronic component <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, a part of the laminated film <b>7</b> of the dielectric film <b>4</b> and passivation film <b>5</b> that is parallel to the main surface of the substrate <b>2</b> is removed at least partly, so that the stress of the laminated film <b>7</b> is relaxed.
