The invention further relates to a layer construction comprising the film according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For the field of security documents, in particular identification documents, the embedding of a plurality of security features is mandatory, in particular to ensure the originality of these security documents. Such security documents, in particular identification documents, increasingly comprise polycarbonate. Documents based on polycarbonate are particularly durable and exhibit a high level of security against counterfeiting. Popular security features are transparent regions in, for example, identification cards or in data pages of passports. These transparent regions are also called &#x201c;windows&#x201d;. Holograms, security marks and other elements which are identifiable as an original or a counterfeit by visual inspection may be introduced into these windows. The functioning of the security feature is based on the high transparency of polycarbonate. If the transparency of the document in the window is impaired then said document may be a counterfeit. The reason for this is as follows: When a further transparent film, for example containing false personal information, is stuck over the document, the change in the window is clearly apparent. The window appears less clear when looking through it. The clarity of the window is likewise disturbed by attempts to open and re-bond the document.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A problem in the manufacture of security documents may firstly be the deformation of the film in production, but also the trapping of air bubbles. Frequently, waves are formed in the individual layers, which are firstly unsightly, but can secondly also have the effect that the data in the security elements cannot always be seen or read out correctly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, this invention is concerned with the reduction of at least one of these problems. More particularly, it is an object of the invention to provide very smooth films for security documents, wherein the printed data should have maximum sharpness. It is a further object of the invention to provide smooth films for use in security documents. In addition, it is an object of the invention to provide materials for use in security documents that enable a low level of deformation of the security documents formed therefrom.

The final shaping and cooling of the film was effected on the smoothing calender (consisting of three rolls). Structuring of the film surfaces was accomplished using a rubber roll (no. 4 or surface), polished chromium roll (no. 1 surface) or structured steel roll (no. 2 and 6 surface). The rubber roll used for texturing the film surface is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,368,240 to Nauta Roll Corporation. Subsequently, the film was transported through a takeoff.

However, the crucial feature for films to be printed is the sharpness of the print. It should be noted here that there are regions of gloss and of roughness that produce a poor printed image, whereas the films of the invention will show a good to very good printed image, as can be
