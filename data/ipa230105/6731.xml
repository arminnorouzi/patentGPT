In order to avoid the interference to GEO satellites caused by the uplink signals of LEO satellite terminals, the LEO satellites near the equatorial region generally use a beam tilt technology to adjust the antenna coverage area of the satellites. The ground terminal in the equatorial region will adjust the antenna direction to adapt to the beam adjustment of the satellites, so as to prevent the uplink signal from falling into the reception range of GEO satellites as much as possible, thereby achieving the purpose of interference avoidance and elimination.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the normal beam coverage mode of LEO satellites, the satellite beam is perpendicular to the ground and the beam angle is fixed. The satellite coverage is determined by system design, and there is no need to additionally indicate the satellite beam angle and other information to the terminals in the system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, in the beam offset mode, even though the position of the ground terminal relative to the satellite does not change, the beam coverage area of the satellite changes. The position of the terminal relative to the satellite alone is not sufficient to calculate the satellite coverage area, which affects the normal operation of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, because LEO satellites adjust the antenna beam direction in a specific region, it will alter the way terminals operate in that region. For example, this will have an impact on the inter-satellite handover of the terminal. If the terminal does not know the beam offset status of the satellite and performs the handover according to the original method, the terminal will not find the corresponding satellite in the target position of the handover, resulting in handover failure and link interruption. Therefore, there is a need to solve the problem of how to operate the terminal in the case that the satellite beam is offset.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It can be seen that the satellite communication system in the related art does not consider how to indicate the satellite beam offset information and cannot guarantee the normal operation of the terminal in the beam offset region. In view of this, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a technical analysis of the LEO satellite beam offset problem, and propose a solution for indicating satellite beam offset information by using a broadcast message. The specific implementations of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The solution provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure is an offset information indication solution in a one-dimensional satellite beam offset mode, that is, the beam offset of the satellite beam in the plane defined jointly by the satellite movement direction and a line connecting the satellite and the centre of the earth. However, those skilled in the art can easily understand that in the case of two-dimensional offset or three-dimensional offset, the indication solution of the beam offset angle only needs to be consistent with the solution provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure, and the difference only lies in that the beam offset angle parameters in other dimensions are added.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The implementations on the terminal side and the network side will be described respectively, and then an example of their coordinated implementation will be given to better understand the implementation of the solution given in the embodiments of the present disclosure. The manner of description does not mean that the two must be implemented in conjunction or separately. In fact, when the terminal and the network side device are implemented separately, they also solve the problems on the terminal side and the network side respectively, and when the two are used in combination, better technical results are obtained.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of the satellite beam offset processing method on the network side.

Definition of beam offset angle.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The satellite beam offset parameter includes a beam offset angle &#x3b1; of a satellite, the beam offset angle &#x3b1; being an angle between a central axis of a beam of the satellite and a line connecting a centre of mass of the satellite to a centre of the earth.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Specifically, it is assumed that only the one-dimensional offset of the beam is considered in the solution, that is, the satellite beam is offset in only one direction. The direction of this offset can be a direction consistent with the direction of the satellite movement, or a direction perpendicular to the direction of the satellite movement.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Take the offset direction being the direction consistent with the direction of the satellite movement direction as an example.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The beam offset angle &#x3b1; of the satellite is defined as the angle between a central axis of a beam of the satellite and a line connecting a centre of mass of the satellite to a centre of the earth. At this time, the angle between the satellite movement direction and the central axis of the beam of the satellite is 90&#xb0;-&#x3b1;. In normal mode, the satellite beam is directed vertically to the ground, and the a angle is 0&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">2. Implementation of notifying the terminal of the satellite beam offset parameter.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the network side device indicates the satellite beam offset parameter to the terminal via a broadcast message and/or a dedicated signalling, there are at least the following two manners for notifying the terminal of the satellite beam offset parameter.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Manner 1:</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">using the broadcast message system information block (SIB) for indication.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The network side device may indicate to following terminals via the broadcast message: a terminal during initial access, a terminal in an idle state, or a terminal during cell reselection.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The terminal may receive the satellite beam offset parameter indicated by the network side device via the broadcast message in one of following ways or a combination of the following ways:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">receiving the indicated parameter via the broadcast message during initial access;</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">receiving the indicated parameter via the broadcast message in an idle state;</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">receiving the indicated parameter via the broadcast message in the idle state;</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">receiving the indicated parameter via the broadcast message during cell reselection.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">This manner indicates the satellite beam offset parameters of current and neighbouring cells to the terminal in the initial access phase, in the idle state or during cell reselection, etc.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Manner 2:</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">using the dedicated signalling, including RRC information, downlink control indicator (DCI) indication information or MAC CE (media access control control element) indication information.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The network side device may indicate to following terminals via the dedicated signalling: a terminal to be handed over to a target cell, or a terminal to be handed over to a target satellite.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The terminal may receive the satellite beam offset parameter indicated by the network side device via the dedicated signalling in one of following ways or a combination of the following ways:</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">receiving the indicated parameter via the dedicated signalling while waiting for a handover to a target cell;</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">receiving the indicated parameter via the dedicated signalling while waiting for a handover to a target satellite.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">This manner can be used when the terminal is already connected to the network, especially when during the beam handover, and the network needs to indicate the beam offset parameter of the target cell or target satellite to be handed over to and help the terminal to quickly point to the new cell. During radio resource management (RRM) measurement of a neighbouring cell, learning the beam offset information of the neighbouring cell can speed up the terminal's direction tracking process.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">3. Implementation of the signalling indication format of the satellite beam offset angle.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In order to effectively indicate the satellite beam offset angle, the angle range needs to include [0, 180&#xb0;], and a maximum of 8-bit indication information is required.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The network side device may indicate the beam offset angle &#x3b1; to the terminal with information less than or equal to 8 bits in a broadcast message and/or a dedicated signalling.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The indicated parameter received by the terminal includes information of the beam offset angle &#x3b1; which is less than or equal to 8 bits.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">4. The implementation of the terminal using satellite beam offset information.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">For the terminal's adjustment of its communication process according to the satellite beam offset parameter, the following takes the terminal inter-satellite handover as an example to introduce how the terminal uses the satellite beam offset information.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the beam offset mode, the satellite ground coverage is deformed, so that the terminal located directly under the satellite beam may not be able to access the satellite; in the normal coverage mode, the terminal in the handover area may not need to start handover. Therefore, the satellite beam offset has significant impact on ground coverage, terminal handover, etc.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">According to the beam offset, the network side device transmits the beam offset angle in the form of a broadcast message.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">After the terminal is connected to the network, the terminal obtains the beam offset data from the broadcast message, and uses the satellite beam offset indication parameter, the satellite ephemeris information, and the terminal geographic location to jointly calculate the terminal pointing parameter in the cell. When the terminal needs to be handed over, it calculates the handover parameters of the target satellite according to the beam offset data, and then implements the handover.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Based on the same inventive concept, embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a network side device, a terminal, a satellite beam offset processing apparatus, and a computer-readable storage medium.
