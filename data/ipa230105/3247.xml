For example, a data center or telecommunication rack or enclosure, which is typically a metal structure, may be coated with a non-conductive material to provide such protection. Often, local electrical codes require such metal structures to be bonded as a safety measure. To bond such metal structure, the non-conductive coating has to be removed in order to create an electrically conductive path between the electrical conductor and the metal structure. Typically, a technician would have to remove the non-conductive coating by sanding or grinding the non-conductive coating until bare metal is exposed. However, it is a time-consuming process to carefully remove such coating. Further, if an insufficient amount of coating is removed, an electrically conductive path may not be created. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that there may be large numbers of racks or enclosures as is the case in a data center. As a result, the cost and time taken to bond and ground each rack or enclosure can be significant since it would be time consuming to manually remove the non-conductive coating from enclosure or rack.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides descriptions of embodiments for bonding washers used to facilitate electrical bonding of metal structures without the need to grind or sand non-conductive coatings to expose bare metal. In one exemplary embodiment, the bonding washer includes an electrically conductive body having a top surface, a bottom surface, a fastener receiving member, e.g., an aperture, for receiving a mounting fastener, at least one electrically conductive piercing member extending from the bottom surface of the body, and an extended member extending from the electrically conductive body in a direction opposite the at least one piercing member. The electrically conductive body can be substantially planar. In another exemplary embodiment, the bonding washer includes an electrically conductive body having a top surface and a bottom surface, a plurality of electrically conductive piercing members extending from the bottom surface of the body, a plurality of electrically conductive gripping members extending from the top surface of the body, and an extended member extending from the electrically conductive body in a direction away opposite the plurality of piercing members.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one exemplary embodiment, the extended member extends from one end of the electrically conductive body. In another exemplary embodiment, each of the plurality of piercing members is a single tooth. In some embodiments, the single tooth has a serrated distal end.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The figures depict embodiments for purposes of illustration only.

Various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a bonding washer according to the present disclosure is shown. In this exemplary embodiment, the bonding washer <b>10</b> includes an electrically conductive body <b>12</b> having a top surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>, a bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b</i>, an aperture <b>14</b> for receiving a mounting fastener, and one or more piercing members <b>16</b> and one or more extending members <b>18</b>. The body <b>12</b> can be in any shape or size. For example, the body <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> may be substantially planar with a predetermined thickness &#x201c;T<b>1</b>&#x201d; which can vary for each bonding washer <b>10</b>. The predetermined thickness &#x201c;T<b>1</b>&#x201d; depends at least in part on the size of the wire termination, the coating thickness and/or the anticipated or rated current the electrically conductive path is to carry. As a non-limiting example, the thickness &#x201c;T<b>1</b>&#x201d; may be in the range from about 0.125 mm to about 1.0 mm. The body <b>12</b> is made of a material that provides sufficient structural rigidity to establish and maintain an electrically conductive path between a wire termination, e.g., wire termination <b>100</b> and a structure, e.g., structure <b>300</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Non-limiting examples of the body material include stainless steel or other conductive steel, aluminum and/or aluminum alloy.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, each piercing member <b>16</b> forms a tooth like structure or what is sometimes called in the industry a &#x201c;volcano.&#x201d; Each piercing member <b>16</b> is capable of cutting through or piercing non-conductive coatings on the structure <b>300</b>. For example, the piercing member <b>16</b> can be a raised surface <b>16</b><i>a </i>extending from the bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>12</b>. Such raised surface <b>16</b><i>a </i>that includes an aperture <b>16</b><i>b </i>having sharp edges surrounding the aperture <b>16</b><i>b </i>enables each piercing member <b>16</b> to be capable of cutting through or piercing non-conductive coatings on the structure <b>300</b>. Each piercing member <b>16</b> can be a unitary circular or other shaped tooth or structure, seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, that is capable of cutting through or piercing the non-conductive coating on the structure <b>300</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, each piercing member <b>16</b> can be a unitary circular or other shaped tooth or structure having a serrated distal edge <b>17</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, that is also capable of cutting through or piercing the non-conductive coatings on the structure <b>300</b>. The piercing members <b>16</b> can be extruded from the body <b>12</b>, or piercing members <b>16</b> can be secured to the body <b>12</b> by for example a welded joint. In another exemplary embodiment, the piercing members <b>16</b> are also capable of limiting and possibly preventing the wire termination <b>100</b> and/or bonding washer <b>10</b> from rotating relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to ensure that the piercing members <b>16</b> pierce or cut through the coating on the structure <b>300</b> to establish or create a sufficient electrically conductive path between the wire termination <b>100</b> and the structure <b>300</b> to facilitate electrically bonding to the structure <b>300</b>. For example, as the piercing member <b>16</b> pierces the coating on the structure <b>300</b> to contact and engage the metal surface of the structure <b>300</b>, the piercing members <b>16</b> partially or entirely burrow into the metal surface of the structure <b>300</b> causing the bonding washer <b>10</b> to be fixed to the metal structure <b>300</b> so as to limit or possibly preventing rotation of the bonding washer <b>10</b> relative to the metal structure <b>300</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the one or more piercing members <b>16</b> are disposed at each corner of the body <b>12</b> and extend from the bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>12</b>. However, the piercing members <b>16</b> may be disposed, placed or arranged on the body <b>12</b> in any position suitable to pierce the coating on the structure <b>300</b>, and establish and maintain an electrically conductive path between the piercing members <b>16</b> and the metal of the structure <b>300</b>. While the above described embodiment shows more than one piercing member <b>16</b> used to cut through or pierce the coating on the outer surface of the structure, one skilled in the art would readily recognize the one piercing member <b>16</b> may be positioned to pierce the non-conductive coating <b>302</b><i>b</i>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, on the mounting portion <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The one or more extending members <b>18</b> extend from one or more ends of the body <b>12</b> and are provided to limit and possibly prevent rotation of the wire termination <b>100</b> and/or the bonding washer <b>10</b> relative to the structure <b>300</b> when securing the wire termination <b>100</b> and bonding washer <b>10</b> to the structure <b>300</b>. In the embodiment shown, there is one extending member <b>18</b> extending from one end of the body <b>12</b>. However, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that a second extending member <b>18</b> may extend from another end of the body <b>12</b>. Limiting the rotation of the wire termination <b>100</b> and/or the bonding washer <b>10</b> relative to the structure <b>300</b> helps to ensure that the piercing members <b>16</b> pierce or cut through the coating on the structure <b>300</b> to establish or create a sufficient electrically conductive path between the wire termination <b>100</b> and the metal of the structure <b>300</b> to facilitate electrically bonding the structure <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, the extended member <b>18</b> extends outward from the body <b>12</b> in a direction that is substantially opposite from the direction the piercing members <b>16</b> extend from the body <b>12</b>. The extended member <b>18</b> may be any shape or size. For example, the extended member <b>18</b> may be substantially rectangular in shape. The extended member <b>18</b> can have a height &#x201c;H&#x201d; seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which is the length that extended member <b>18</b> extends away from the body <b>12</b>.

The extended member <b>18</b> can be integrally or monolithically formed to the body <b>12</b>, or the extended member <b>18</b> can be secured to the body <b>12</b> by for example a welded joint. The extended member <b>18</b> may include a bend <b>18</b><i>a</i>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bend angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the bend <b>18</b><i>a </i>may be in the range of about 30 degrees and about 90 degrees, but other bend angle may be used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, connecting the bonding washer <b>10</b> of the present disclosure to a wire termination <b>100</b> and structure <b>300</b> to establish an electrically conductive path therebetween will be described. In this exemplary embodiment, the wire termination <b>100</b> is a lug. To establish the electrically conductive path to facilitate electrical bonding of the structure <b>300</b>, an electrical conductor <b>200</b> is crimped or otherwise secured to a barrel of wire termination <b>100</b> or lug as is known. Examples of electrical conductors include stranded wire, solid wire, wire braids and bus bars. The blade portion <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the lug <b>100</b>, which includes an aperture <b>100</b><i>a </i>configured to receive a mounting fastener, e.g., nut and bolt, rivets, etc., is used to secure the wire termination <b>100</b> or lug and the bonding washer <b>10</b> to the structure <b>300</b>. The conductor or wire <b>200</b> can be of different gauges depending upon the anticipated or rated current the electrically conductive path is to carry. As such, conductors <b>200</b> having a smaller gauge may permit the use of a smaller wire termination <b>100</b>, while conductors <b>200</b> having a greater gauge may necessitate the use of a larger wire termination <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this exemplary embodiment, the structure <b>300</b> includes a mounting portion <b>302</b> on which the bonding washer <b>10</b> rests. The mounting portion <b>302</b> includes an aperture <b>302</b><i>a </i>configured to receive a mounting fastener, e.g., nut and bolt, rivets, etc., used to secure the wire termination <b>100</b> and bonding washer <b>10</b> to the mounting portion <b>302</b>. The metal portion or the electrically conductive portion <b>302</b><i>c </i>of the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b> is covered by a non-conductive coating <b>302</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To secure the wire termination <b>100</b>, here a lug, and the bonding washer <b>10</b> to the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b>, a bolt <b>406</b> is passed through the aperture <b>302</b><i>a </i>in the mounting portion <b>302</b>, through the aperture <b>14</b> in the body <b>12</b> of the bonding washer <b>10</b>, and through the aperture <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the lug <b>100</b>. A nut <b>400</b> is then attached to the bolt <b>406</b> and tightened to secure the lug <b>100</b> and the bonding washer <b>10</b> to the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, a first washer <b>402</b>, e.g., a flat washer, and/or a second washer <b>404</b>, e.g., a lock washer, can be placed between the nut <b>400</b> and the lug <b>100</b> to provide a better connection between the lug <b>100</b> and the structure <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, when the nut <b>400</b> and bolt <b>406</b> are tightened, each piercing member <b>16</b> cuts through or pierces the non-conductive coating <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the outer surface of the mounting portion <b>302</b> so that an electrically conductive path is established between the conductive metal <b>302</b><i>c </i>of the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b> and the bonding washer <b>10</b>. As a result, an electrically conductive path is also established between the conductive metal <b>302</b><i>c </i>of the mounting portion <b>302</b> and the lug <b>100</b> such that current may flow from the structure <b>300</b> through the bonding washer <b>10</b>, through the lug <b>100</b> to the conductor <b>200</b>. As noted above, when tightening the nut <b>400</b> to the bolt <b>406</b>, an edge of the lug <b>100</b> may contact the extending member <b>18</b> of the bonding washer <b>10</b> which then limits or possibly prevents the lug <b>100</b> and/or bonding washer <b>10</b> from rotating relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to ensure that the piercing members <b>16</b> pierce or cut through the coating on the structure <b>300</b> to establish or create a sufficient electrically conductive path between the wire termination, here the lug <b>100</b>, and the structure <b>300</b>. As discussed previously, the piercing members <b>16</b> may also limit and possibly prevent rotation of the bonding washer <b>10</b> relative to the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b>. More specifically, as the piercing members <b>16</b> cut through or pierce the non-conductive coating <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the outer surface of the mounting portion <b>302</b>, the piercing members <b>16</b> partially or entirely burrow into the conductive metal <b>302</b><i>c </i>causing the bonding washer <b>10</b> to be fixed in position relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to limit or possibly prevent rotation of the bonding washer <b>10</b> relative to the mounting portion <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, another exemplary embodiment of a bonding washer according to the present disclosure is shown.

More specifically, as the piercing members <b>56</b> cut through or pierce the non-conductive coating <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the outer surface of the mounting portion <b>302</b>, the piercing members <b>56</b> partially or entirely burrow into the conductive metal <b>302</b><i>c </i>causing the bonding washer <b>50</b> to be fixed in position relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to limit or possibly prevent rotation of the bonding washer <b>50</b> relative to the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, another exemplary embodiment of a bonding washer according to the present disclosure is shown. In this exemplary embodiment, the bonding washer <b>60</b> is substantially the same as the bonding washer <b>50</b> described above, except that gripping members are added to the top surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>52</b> as described below. More specifically, the body portion <b>52</b> includes one or more gripping members <b>57</b> extending from the top surface <b>52</b><i>a</i>. Each gripping member <b>57</b> is capable of cutting into or burrowing into the wire termination <b>100</b> to limit or possibly prevent the wire termination <b>100</b> and/or the bonding washer <b>60</b> from rotating relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to ensure that the piercing members <b>56</b> pierce or cut through the coating on the structure <b>300</b> to establish or create a sufficient electrically conductive path between the wire termination <b>100</b> and the structure <b>300</b> to facilitate electrically bonding the structure <b>300</b>. Each gripping member <b>57</b> may also pierce through any non-conductive coatings on the wire termination <b>100</b> similar to how the piercing members <b>56</b> pierce through the non-conductive coatings <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the structure <b>300</b>. Each gripping member <b>57</b> can be a unitary circular or other shaped tooth or structure, seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, that is capable of capable of cutting into or burrowing into the wire termination <b>100</b>, and cutting through or piercing the non-conductive coating on the wire termination <b>100</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, each gripping member <b>57</b> can be a unitary circular or other shaped tooth <b>57</b><i>a </i>or structure having a serrated distal edge, similar to the distal edge <b>17</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, that is also capable of capable of cutting into or burrowing into the wire termination <b>100</b> and cutting through or piercing the non-conductive coating on the wire termination <b>100</b>. The gripping members <b>57</b> can be extruded from the body <b>52</b>, or the gripping members <b>57</b> can be secured to the body <b>52</b> by for example a welded joint. It is noted that in the embodiment shown, the apertures <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the piercing members <b>56</b> are aligned with respective apertures <b>57</b><i>b </i>of the gripping members <b>57</b>. However, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the apertures <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the piercing members <b>56</b> may not be aligned with the apertures <b>57</b><i>b </i>of the gripping members <b>57</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the gripping members <b>57</b> are disposed around the aperture <b>54</b> in the body <b>52</b>. However, the gripping members <b>57</b> may be disposed, placed or arranged on the body <b>52</b> in any position suitable to burrow into the wire termination <b>100</b>, e.g., lug and limit and possibly prevent rotational movement of the wire termination <b>100</b> and/or bonding washer <b>60</b> relative to the structure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, connecting the bonding washer <b>60</b> of the present disclosure to a wire termination <b>100</b> and structure <b>300</b> to establish an electrically conductive path therebetween is similar to that described above for bonding washer <b>50</b> and for ease of description is not repeated. However, in this exemplary embodiment, when the nut <b>400</b> and bolt <b>406</b> are tightened, each gripping member <b>57</b> cuts into or burrows into the blade portion <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the lug <b>100</b> to limit or possibly prevent the wire termination, e.g., the lug <b>100</b>, and/or the bonding washer <b>60</b> from rotating relative to the structure <b>300</b> so as to ensure that the piercing members <b>56</b> pierce or cut through the coating <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the mounting portion <b>302</b> of the structure <b>300</b> to establish or create a sufficient electrically conductive path between the wire termination <b>100</b> and the structure <b>300</b> to facilitate electrically bonding the structure <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">While illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure have been described and illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the disclosure and are not to be considered as limiting.
