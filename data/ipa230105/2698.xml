Improperly mixed additive components, or inadequately mixed components, can lead to compositions that are hazy and/or affect the performance of the additives in the lubricant or fuel additive mixture. Thus, there is always a need for improved mixing capabilities of additives, especially when it relates to compatibility of the additive with the base oil or fuel and the compatibility of a mixture of additives. Continuous acoustic mixing, as described herein, allows for, at least, large-scale mixing of combination of additives or mixing the additive(s) with a lubricant base oil or fuel to form lubricants and fuel additive mixtures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The instant disclosure provides for a process of mixing a lubricant or fuel mixture. The process includes mixing in an acoustic mixer one or more of an additive selected from a dispersant, an antioxidant, a performance polymer, a detergent, an antiwear agent, a friction modifier, a demulsifier, an antifoam additive, a rust inhibitor, a metal deactivator, a seal swell agent and combinations thereof to form a final product where the final product can include an additive concentrate. The mixing may further include mixing with an oil of lubricating viscosity to form a fully-formulated lubricant. The instant disclosure further provides a process for preparing a fuel mixture including mixing in an acoustic mixer a fuel with one or more of an additive selected from a dispersant, an antioxidant, a performance polymer, a detergent, an antiwear agent, a friction modifier, a demulsifier, an antifoam additive, a metal deactivator and combinations thereof to form a final product.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an acoustic mixer according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of an acoustic mixer according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a manifold according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a mandrel according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The instant disclosure relates to a process for preparing lubricant-based compositions and fuel additives.

The grease may have a composition comprising an oil of lubricating viscosity, a grease thickener, and an additive package. The additive package comprises the seal swell agent of the invention (the compound of formula (I)) and, optionally, other performance additives.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0242">The grease thickening agent, or thickener, may include a metal salt of one or more carboxylic acids that is known in the art of grease formulation. Often the metal is an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, aluminum, or mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable metals include lithium, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, barium, titanium, aluminum, and mixtures thereof. The metal may include lithium, calcium, aluminum, or mixtures thereof (typically lithium).</p><p id="p-0259" num="0243">The carboxylic acid used in the thickener is often a fatty acid and may include a mono-hydroxycarboxylic acid, a di-hydroxycarboxylic acid, a poly-hydroxycarboxylic acid or mixtures thereof. The carboxylic acid may have 4 to 30, 8 to 27, 19 to 24 or 10 to 20 carbon atoms and may include derivatives thereof such as esters, half esters, salts, anhydrides, or mixtures thereof. A particularly useful hydroxy-substituted fatty acid is hydroxystearic acid, wherein one or more hydroxy groups are often located at positions 10-, 11-, 12-, 13&#x2212;or 14- on the alkyl group. Suitable examples may include 10-hydroxy stearic acid, 11-hy- droxystearic acid, 12-hydroxy stearic acid, 13 -hydroxystearic acid, 14-hydroxystearic acid and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the hydroxy-substituted fatty acid is 12-hy- droxystearic acid. Examples of other suitable fatty acids include capric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, behenic acid, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0244">In one embodiment, the carboxylic acid thickener is supplemented with a dicarboxylic acid, a polycarboxylic acid, or mixtures thereof. Suitable examples include hexanedioic acid (adipic), isooctanedioic acid, octanedioic acid, nonanedioic acid (azelaic acid), decanedioic acid (sebacic acid), undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid, tridecanedioic acid, tetradecanedioic acid, pentadecanoic acid and mixtures thereof. The dicarboxylic acid and polycarboxylic acid tend to be more expensive than monocarboxylic acid and as a consequence, most industrial processes using mixtures typically use a molar ratio of dicarboxylic and/or polycarboxylic acid to monocarboxylic acid in the range 1:10 to 1:2, including 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, or 1:2 as possible values or upper or lower limits. The actual ratio of acids used depends on the desired properties of the grease for the actual application. In one embodiment the dicarboxylic acid thickener is nonanedioic acid (azelaic acid) and in another decanedioic acid (sebacic acid), or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0245">The grease thickener may include simple metal soap grease thickeners, mixed alkali soaps, complex soaps, non-soap grease thickeners, metal salts of such acid-functional-ized oils, polyurea and diurea grease thickeners, calcium sulfonate grease thickeners or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0246">The grease thickener may also include or be used with other known polymer thickening agents such polytetrafluoroethylene (commonly known as PTFE), styrene-buta- diene rubber, styrene-isoprene polymers, olefin polymers such as polyethylene or polypropylene or olefin co-polymers such as ethylene-propylene or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0247">In one embodiment the thickener may also include or be used with other known thickening agents such as inorganic powders including clay, organo-clays, bentonite, mont- morillonite, fumed and acid modified silicas, calcium carbonate as calcite, carbon black, pigments, copper phthalocyanine or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0248">The grease may also be a sulfonate grease. Sulfonate greases are disclosed in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,308,514. The calcium sulfonate grease may be prepared from overbasing a neutral calcium sulfonate such that the calcium hydroxide is carbonated to form amorphous calcium carbonate and subsequently converted into either calcite, or vaterite or mixtures thereof, but typically calcite.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0249">The grease thickener may be a urea derivative such as a polyurea or a diurea.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0250">Polyurea grease may include tri-urea, tetra-urea or higher homologues, or mixtures thereof. The urea derivatives may include urea-urethane compounds and the urethane compounds, diurea compounds, triurea compounds, tetraurea compounds, polyurea compounds, urea- urethane compounds, diurethane compounds and mixtures thereof. The urea derivative may for instance be a diurea compound such as, urea-urethane compounds, diurethane compounds or mixtures thereof. A more detailed description of urea compounds of this type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,188 column 2, line 24 to column 23, line 36.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0251">In one embodiment, the grease thickener may be polyurea or diurea. The grease thickener may be a lithium soap or lithium complex thickener. The grease thickener may be an aluminum soap, calcium soap, aluminum complex or calcium complex thickener.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0252">The amount of grease thickener present in the grease composition includes those in the range from 1 wt % to 50 wt %, 1 wt % to 45 wt %, or 2 wt % to 40 wt %, or 3 wt % to 20 or 25 wt % of the grease composition.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0253">The lubricating grease composition comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity as is described above. A lubricating grease composition may be prepared by nixing one or more additives described above, or, alternatively, a concentrate of additives, to an oil of lubricating viscosity, a grease thickener, and the like to form the final grease product.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0254">In preparing the lubricant and/or fuel additive mixture, any of the foregoing additives including those disclosed in the Tables can be mixed in the acoustic mixer prior to introduction of the oil of lubricating viscosity and or fuel. In an alternative, all of the formulation components can be metered and mixed simultaneously to prepare the final lubricant and/or fuel additive mixture.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0255">Components mixed according to the instant process have unexpectedly shown improved product integrity. Product integrity can include one or more of a clear product, no precipitation, storage stable, improve shelf life, and the like. The instant process allows for better mixing of additives, and, for example, better antifoam stability to blends. The process enables troublesome products to be mixed with better stability, product integrity, improved clarity, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0272" num="0256">At present, it has been demonstrated that three components can be pumped via a manifold into a single stream that flows from the bottom of coil to the top and exits a fully mixed product from an acoustic mixer disclosed herein. The use of independent peristaltic pumps allows for the control of ratios of each of the three components entering the manifold. Total residence time in the resonating coil is less than 20 seconds.
