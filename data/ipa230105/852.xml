It was mainly used for urinary system infections, and had a safe history of use before being replaced due to discovery and use of new antibiotics.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, new studies have found that nitroxoline can simultaneously inhibit the methionine aminopeptidase MetAP2 and the silence information regulator 2-related enzyme SIRT1 in vascular endothelial cells, and exert a synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis, as well as an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of tumor cells. Therefore, nitroxoline can be developed to treat tumors including bladder cancer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As discussed above, nitroxoline can be used for various clinical indications, such as urinary tract infection and bladder cancer. When oral administration is applied to treat diseases, different clinical indications have different requirements for drug dissolution rate. For example, the treatment of urinary tract infection involves a short-term administration that requires the drug to take effect as soon as possible, so a relatively fast drug dissolution rate is ideal to better achieve an effective anti-infective effect; while the treatment of bladder cancer involves a long-term administration that requires a narrow variation range of blood drug concentration, so a relatively moderate drug dissolution rate is ideal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present, there is no pharmaceutical composition containing nitroxoline with a moderate dissolution rate in the prior art. Therefore, the development of pharmaceutical composition containing nitroxoline with a moderate dissolution rate is an urgent technical problem to be solved at present.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a phamaceutical composition containing nitroxoline, a nitroxoline tablet, a method for preparing the same, and a use thereof, so as to overcome the defect that there is no pharmaceutical composition containing nitroxoline with a moderate dissolution rate in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors found in the research that nitroxoline has low solubility and slow dissolution in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid, water and phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at 37&#xb0; C., and the properties of nitroxoline itself will have an adverse effect on obtaining a pharmaceutical composition containing nitroxoline with a moderate dissolution rate. After extensive research, the inventors found that pharmaceutical compositions containing nitroxoline with different dissolution rates can be obtained by controlling the particle size of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). After further research, the inventors found that nitroxoline tablets with a moderate dissolution rate (the dissolution rate within 60 min is more than 75%) can be prepared when the particle size D<sub>90 </sub>of nitroxoline is 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the resulting nitroxoline tablets have uniform content, narrow variation range in hardness, and good fluidity and compressibility.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention solves the above technical problem through the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the pharmaceutical composition comprises an active pharmaceutical ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the active pharmaceutical ingredient is nitroxoline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the particle size D<sub>90 </sub>of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some preferred embodiments, the active pharmaceutical ingredient is nitroxoline.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of nitroxoline is a base addition salt formed by nitroxoline and an inorganic base or an organic base, an acid addition salt formed by nitroxoline and an inorganic acid or an organic acid, or a salt formed by nitroxoline and an alkaline or acidic amino acid, and preferably nitroxoline hydrochloride or lysine salt.

The operation was conducted in accordance with the test method of dissolution rate and release rate (general rule 0931 of volume IV of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition), 1000 mL of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution was used as the dissolution medium, the rotation speed was 60 revolutions per minute. At 60 minutes, the solution was taken and filtered through a membrane filter. 2 mL of the resulting filtrate was added into a 10 mL volumetric flask, and diluted with 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution until the liquid level reached the mark. The resulting solution was shaked well, and used as the test solution. An appropriate amount of nitroxoline reference substance was accurately weighed, dissolved in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution, and quantitatively diluted to prepare a solution containing about 10 &#x3bc;g of nitroxoline per milliliter, as the reference substance solution. According to UV-visible spectrophotometry (general rule 0401 of volume IV of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition) (UV-2700, Shimadzu), the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 369 nm, and the dissolution rate of each tablet was calculated.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0145">The dissolution profile of the nitroxoline tablets prepared in Examples 1 to 4 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The dissolution rates at 60 min were 103%, 97%, 98% and 76%, respectively. The above dissolution rates are moderate, and the specific explanations are as follows: The relatively rapid dissolution of an immediate-release formulation generally means that the dissolution rate at 15 min, 30 min or 45 min is more than 75%. The relatively slow dissolution of an immediate-release preparation generally means that the dissolution rate at 90 min or 120 min is more than 75%. The dissolution rate of the nitroxoline tablets obtained in the present invention at 60 min is more than 75%, that is, the nitroxoline tablets prepared from the phamaceutical composition of the present invention is an immediate-release preparation having a moderate dissolution rate.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0146">Nitroxoline belongs to BCS class II drugs, which have low solubility and high permeability. Generally, in formulations containing this type of drugs, the smaller the particle size of the drug, the faster the dissolution of the formulation. However, the inventors unexpectedly found that the smaller the particle size of nitroxoline, the slower the dissolution of the formulation. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, along with the reduction of the particle size of nitroxoline, the overall dissolution of the nitroxoline tablets of the present invention is slowed down. This is inconsistent with the dissolution profiles exhibited by conventional formulations containing such drugs. As for Examples 2 and 3, since the particle sizes of the two are relatively close, the two show relatively similar dissolution.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0147">Experimental Example 3 Hardness test of the nitroxoline tablets of the present invention</p><p id="p-0157" num="0148">The drug was placed into a hardness tester (SY-3, Yellow Sea) according to the operation requirements, and subjected to hardness test. 10 tablets were measured each time, that is, serial numbers 1 to 10.
