These conjugates are useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases, conditions which responds to activation of a neurotrophin receptor, and for stimulating neuronal survival, growth, repair or regeneration.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The interaction of neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, NT3 and NT4) with their cognate Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC) protects neurons from naturally occurring cell death during development. The neurotrophins' ability to nurture developing neurons spawned numerous studies to determine if they can promote the survival of adult neurons, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative disease or acute brain injury. In this context promising results have been found with BDNF, which by activating the TrkB receptor, has been shown to protect neurons from death in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease and in ischemic lesions. In addition, BDNF can promote functional recovery of injured neurons following spinal cord injury and stimulate the production of new neurons in the adult brain. Loss of BDNF has also been suggested as a contributory factor to the progression of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as conditions such as depression.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the therapeutic potential of BDNF in neurodegenerative diseases, acute brain injury and other neurological conditions has not been realized in the clinical setting, in part due to its relatively short in vivo half-life and to its exclusion from the brain parenchyma following systemic administration. While the identification of agonist antibodies that directly bind the TrkB receptor and mimic the neurotrophic activity of BDNF provides a pathway for the development of reagents with a long in vivo half-life, the challenge of poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration remains, making the systemic delivery of TrkB agonist antibodies limited for treatment of peripheral disorders such as obesity and peripheral neuropathy. Nonetheless, when delivered directly across the BBB by intracerebroventricular (icy) injection prior to an ischemic injury, the TrkB agonist antibody 29D7 enhanced neuronal survival and promoted functional recovery (U.S. Pat. No. 7,750,122).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, numerous TrkB-selective agonist antibodies and small molecule agonists have been described and characterized for effects in signaling pathways and downstream, in neuronal survival, repair and regeneration (reviewed in Josephy-Hernandez 2017; see also, e.g., Qian 2006; Hu 2010; Xu 2010; Bai 2010; Sahenk 2010; Fouad 2010; Cazorla 2011; Vugmeyster 2013; Perreault 2013; Todd 2014; Kim 2014; Rosenthal 2014; and Merkouris 2018).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the TrkB-selective monoclonal antibody agonist 29D7 has been shown to enhance neuronal survival after optic nerve injury (Hu 2010), to promote neuronal plasticity following cervical spinal cord injury (Fouad 2010) and to increase neuronal survival and behavioral recovery following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Kim 2014). More recently, four TrkB-selective monoclonal antibodies (M3-M6) that activate Trk receptors (i.e., act as antibody agonists) have been generated, and one (M3) shown to have beneficial effects on neuronal survival, neurite extension and synapse restoration (Szobota 2019). Another TrkB agonistic antibody (Ab4B19) has been reported to provide therapeutic benefits in ischemic brain injury models (Han 2019).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nonetheless, delivery issues persist so considerable interest exists in &#x201c;high-jacking&#x201d; receptor-mediated transcytosis pathways found on the BBB endothelial cells to carry therapeutic antibodies or enzymes from the periphery to the brain parenchyma, with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR-1) being the most widely studied of such receptors (Johnsen 2019). However, for a variety of reasons, conventional antibodies have not realized this potential.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Single domain antibodies that occur naturally in the shark are particularly attractive for the development of next generation biotherapeutics, and particularly to act as trojan horses for delivering (bio)therapeutics across the BBB and into the brain. IgNARs (Immunoglobulin New Antigen Receptors) are heavy chain-only Ig-like molecules that have been identified in all species of sharks studied so far. They are disulphide-linked homodimeric molecules composed of two polypeptide chains containing five constant domains and one variable region (VNAR) which binds antigens (Greenberg 1995).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">VNARs are small (12 kDa), stable, soluble, monomeric antigen-binding domains that can be configured into many different therapeutic modalities. Owing to their elongated CDR3 structures that potentially extend into antigen clefts and cavities, VNARs are well suited to recognize epitopes on the external, apical domain of receptors on BBB endothelium that are conserved across species and do not interfere with endogenous ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Using a variety of in vitro and in vivo selection approaches, VNARs to TfR-1 have been identified that can shuttle therapeutic molecules across the brain capillary endothelium, which forms an impermeable blood-brain barrier (WO2016/077840; WO2018/031424; WO2019/089395; WO2020/056327). For example, VNARs to TfR-1 that function in vivo as effective BBB shuttles have remarkably different pharmacokinetic, potency and side-effect profiles than found with monoclonal antibodies to the same receptor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hence, there is a need for providing BBB shuttles that can deliver neuroprotective therapeutics, such as Trk agonist antibodies, into the brain at therapeutically efficacious doses. It would be desirable to combine a potent and selective BBB-shuttling VNAR domain, such as a human TfR-1 BBB shuttle, with one or more neurotrophic agonist antibodies (NAAb), such as Trk-selective antibodies, to produce a conjugate capable of uptake across a mammalian blood brain barrier (BBB) in a neuroprotective dose. This would be especially beneficial for a NAAb having one or more advantageous biological properties with therapeutic and/or diagnostic benefit in the BBB but which cannot to date be delivered across the BBB.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">VNAR domains against BBB endothelial cell transporters, permits construction of potent and selective conjugates with TrkB agonist antibodies (TrkB-AAb).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention solves the problems described above by providing at least one BBB-shuttling VNAR domain operably linked to a neurotrophic agonist antibody (NAAb), said conjugate being capable of uptake across a mammalian blood brain barrier (BBB) in a neuroprotective effective amount. As exemplified herein, using VNAR domains against BBB endothelial cell transporters permits construction of potent and selective conjugates with NAAbs, including but not limited to, TrkA, TrkB and TrkC agonist antibodies (which are also referred to herein as TrkA-AAb, TrkB-AAb, and TrkC-AAb, respectively, and collectively referred to as &#x201c;Trk agonist antibodies&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides a conjugate comprising at least one BBB-shuttling VNAR domain operably linked to a neurotrophic agonist antibody (NAAb), wherein the conjugate is capable of uptake across a mammalian blood brain barrier (BBB) in a therapeutically-effective amount.

Additional definitions may be found within the detailed description of the invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Throughout this specification, the word &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; or variations such as &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; or &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer (or components) or group of integers (or components), but not the exclusion of any other integer (or components) or group of integers (or components).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plurals unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;including&#x201d; is used to mean &#x201c;including but not limited to.&#x201d; &#x201c;Including&#x201d; and &#x201c;including but not limited to&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terms &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;subject,&#x201d; and &#x201c;individual&#x201d; may be used interchangeably and refer to either a human or a non-human animal. These terms include mammals such as humans, primates, livestock animals (e.g., cows, pigs), companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;non-human mammal&#x201d; means a mammal which is not a human and includes, but is not limited to, a mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, cow, sheep, goat, dog, primate, or other non-human mammals typically used in research. As used herein, &#x201c;mammals&#x201d; includes the foregoing non-human mammals and humans.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; and grammatical variants thereof refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. The term may refer to slowing the onset or rate of development of a condition, disorder or disease, reducing or alleviating symptoms associated with it, generating a complete or partial regression of the condition, or some combination of any of the above. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, reduction or alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilization (i.e., not worsening) of state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. &#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; can also mean prolonging survival relative to expected survival time if not receiving treatment. A subject (e.g., a human) in need of treatment may thus be a subject already afflicted with the disease or disorder in question. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; includes inhibition or reduction of an increase in severity of a pathological state or symptoms relative to the absence of treatment, and is not necessarily meant to imply complete cessation of the relevant disease, disorder or condition.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; and grammatical variants thereof refer to an approach for preventing the development of, or altering the pathology of, a condition, disease or disorder. Accordingly, &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; may refer to prophylactic or preventive measures. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, prevention or slowing of symptoms, progression or development of a disease, whether detectable or undetectable. A subject (e.g., a human) in need of prevention may thus be a subject not yet afflicted with the disease or disorder in question. The term &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; includes slowing the onset of disease relative to the absence of treatment, and is not necessarily meant to imply permanent prevention of the relevant disease, disorder or condition. Thus &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; of a condition may in certain contexts refer to reducing the risk of developing the condition, or preventing or delaying the development of symptoms associated with the condition.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, an &#x201c;effective amount,&#x201d; &#x201c;therapeutically-effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;effective dose&#x201d; is an amount of a composition (e.g., a therapeutic composition or agent) that produces at least one desired therapeutic effect in a subject, such as preventing or treating a target condition or beneficially alleviating a symptom associated with the condition.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A physiologically-acceptable solution for use in an amount and for a time sufficient to effectively reduce a circulating concentration of the plurality of polypeptides is also referred to herein as a perfusate. The amount of perfusate and time of perfusion depends on the non-human mammal and can be readily determined by those of skill in the art. For example, with a mouse, using a volume of perfusate approximately 10x the blood volume of the mouse is effective at reducing the circulating concentration of polypeptides. Likewise, any volume of perfusate that reduces the circulating concentration of the plurality of polypeptides by about 10%, 25%, 50% or more (relative to the theoretical concentration of the plurality of polypeptides) being delivered is considered effective at reducing the circulating concentration of that plurality.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, a &#x201c;VNAR domain&#x201d; has the general structure, from N to C terminus, given by the formula FW1-CDR1-FW2-HV2-FW2&#x2032;-HV4-FW3-CDR3-FW4, wherein the FWs are framework regions, CDRs are complementarity determining regions and HVs are hypervariable regions that form the variable domain of a shark IgNAR (&#x201c;VNAR&#x201d;). The CDR3 region in naturally-occurring VNARs is of heterogeneous size, ranging from about 7 to about 32 amino acid residues in length. The VNAR domains of the invention can optionally have a His-Tag (or other convenient tag for purification purposes). In some cases, such tags are removable. Typical VNAR domains have amino acid residues (aa) 1-25 of the framework 1 (FW1) region; aa 26-32 of the complimentary determining region 1 (CDR1); aa 33-43 of FW2; aa 44-52 of the hypervariable 2 region (HV2); aa 53-85 of FW3; aa 61-65 of HV4; the CDR3 region (of variable length) and FW4 (11 residues starting at XGXG).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, binding to the target of interest is called specific binding, while binding to other sites is called nonspecific binding. As used herein, a binding moiety, specific binding moiety, antibody or VNAR domain that &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; to its target does so selectively or preferentially. Such moieties, antibodies and VNARS can exhibit specific binding to multiple targets such as occurs when one of these entities exhibits species cross reactivity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;TfR,&#x201d; &#x201c;TfR1&#x201d; or &#x201c;TfR-1&#x201d; refers to a mammalian transferrin receptor-1 (in context as a protein or a nucleic acid), unless the context indicates that it refers specifically to human TfR-1 (see, e.g., UniProt P02786 TFR1_Human) or mouse TfR-1.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term &#x201c;CD98 heavy chain&#x201d; or &#x201c;CD98hc&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any native CD98hc from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g., humans) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. CD98hc is also known by the names, inter alia, SLC3A2, 4F2, 4F2hc, Mdu1, Ly1O, Mdv1, Frp1, Mgp2, Mgp2hc, NACAE, 4T2, 4T2hc, and TROP4.

Such conjugates are useful for treating neurological diseases and conditions responsive to modulation of neurotrophins.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, one aspect of the invention is directed to conjugates comprising at least one BBB-shuttling VNAR domain operably linked to a neurotrophic agonist antibody (NAAb), with the conjugate being capable of uptake across the BBB in therapeutically-effective amounts. As used herein, a &#x201c;BBB-shuttling VNAR domain&#x201d; is a VNAR domain with binding specificity for a membrane transporter found on the endothelial or other cells of the BBB and which are capable of being endocytosed or transcytosed across the BBB in a manner that does not generally interfere with or impair the transport of the ligand binding and/or ligand transport properties of the transporter. Additionally, these VNAR domains can act as shuttles to transport other molecules (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;cargo&#x201d;) across the BBB and into the brain. Many such VNAR domains have been isolated and characterized which are further capable of delivering therapeutic levels of such cargo into the brain, including VNAR domains with specificity for TfR-1 and CD98, and many of those are more fully described below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, in some embodiments, the domains of the invention are BBB-shuttling VNAR domains that are independently one or more of (a) TfR-binding VNAR domains capable of specifically binding to a human TfR-1 without substantially interfering with transferrin binding to and/or transport by said human TfR-1, (b) TfR-binding VNAR domains capable of specifically binding to a human TfR-1 without substantially interfering with transferrin binding to and/or transport by said human TfR-1 and capable of cross reacting with mouse TfR 1, or (c) TfR-binding VNAR domains capable of binding human TfR-1 with an EC50 ranging from about 1 nM to about 800 nM.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the domains of the invention are BBB-shuttling VNAR domains that are independently one or more of (a) the TfR-binding VNAR domains designated as Clone C or one of its variants described in WO2018/031424 and WO2019/089395, respectively; (b) the TfR-binding VNAR domains designated as Clone H or one of its variants described in WO2018/031424 and WO2019/089395, respectively; (c) the TfR-binding VNAR domains designated as Clone 8 or one of its variants described in WO2020/056327; (d) TXB4 (also known as Clone 18 and described in WO2020/056327; (e) the CD98-binding VNAR domains described in WO2020/246288; (0 the TfR-binding VNAR domains described in WO2016/077840 as capable of BBB shuttling; (g) the TfR-binding VNAR domain variants of Clone C specifically designated as variants 7, 13, 14, 16, 18, 25, 30, 31, and 34 in WO2019/089395; and (h) the VNAR-txp1 domain described in U.S. provisional application U.S. Ser.

Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0117">Sterile injectable solutions may be prepared by incorporating a conjugate of the invention in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients described above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Dispersions may be prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains dispersion medium and other ingredients, such as those described above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient in addition to any additional desired ingredient from a sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0118">When a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate of the invention is administered by, e.g., intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, the binding agent will be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. Methods for preparing parenterally acceptable protein solutions, taking into consideration appropriate pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, are within the skill in the art. A preferred pharmaceutical composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection will contain, in addition to binding agents, an isotonic vehicle such as sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose injection, dextrose and sodium chloride injection, lactated Ringer's injection, or other vehicle as known in the art. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also contain stabilizers, preservatives, buffers, antioxidants, or other additives well known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0119">The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. In general, it will be an amount of the composition that produces an appropriate therapeutic effect under the particular circumstances. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, from about 0.1 percent to about 70 percent, or from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0120">Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time, or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the particular circumstances of the therapeutic situation, on a case by case basis. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit forms for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage when administered to the subject or patient. As used herein, a dosage unit form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce a desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention depend on the specific characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect(s) to be achieved, taking into consideration and the treatment and sensitivity of any individual patient.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0121">For administration of a conjugate of the invention, the dosage range will generally be from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. Exemplary dosages may be 0.25 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime is a once or twice daily administration, or a once or twice weekly administration, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every two or three months or once every three to 6 months. Dosages may be selected and readjusted by the skilled health care professional as required to maximize therapeutic benefit for a particular subject, e.g., patient. Conjugates will typically be administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, 2-5 days, weekly, monthly, every two or three months, every six months, or yearly. Intervals between administrations can also be irregular, based on monitoring blood levels of conjugates of the invention in a subject or patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma concentration known to give suitable brain concentrations of the conjugate. Such a plasma level may range from about 1-1000 &#x3bc;g/ml and in some methods about 25-300 &#x3bc;g/ml. Dosage regimens for a conjugates of the invention include intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg body weight with the compound administered every two to four weeks for six dosages, then every three months at 3 mg/kg body weight or 1 mg/kg body weight.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0122">In certain embodiments, two or more conjugates of the invention with different binding properties may be administered simultaneously or sequentially, in which case the dosage of each administered compound may be adjusted to fall within the ranges described herein.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0123">In certain embodiments, a conjugate of the invention may be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the conjugate in the subject or patient. The dosage and frequency of administration may vary depending on whether the treatment is therapeutic or prophylactic (e.g., preventative), and may be adjusted during the course of treatment. In certain prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a relatively long period of time. Some subjects may continue to receive treatment over their lifetime. In certain therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient may be switched to a suitable prophylactic dosing regimen.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0124">Actual dosage levels of the conjugate alone or in combination with one or more other active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without causing deleterious side effects to the subject or patient. A selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors, such as pharmacokinetic factors, including the activity of the particular conjugate or composition employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the subject or patient being treated, and similar factors well known in the medical arts.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0125">Administration of a &#x201c;therapeutically effective dosage&#x201d; of a conjugate of the invention may result in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0126">A conjugate or composition of the present invention may be administered via one or more routes of administration, using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled worker, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Routes of administration for conjugates of the invention include, e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or infusion.

Construction and Purification of TfR-binding VNAR Conjugates with TrkB-AAbs</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0136">Construct Design. A mouse-human chimeric TrkB-AAb was prepared by inserting the antigen binding regions of mouse TrkB 29D7 Mab into a human IgG1 backbone to generate a humanized TrkB-AAb. To construct the chimeric antibody, mouse hybridoma cell line (PTA-6949), which expresses the 29D7 Mab, was obtained from the ATCC and its antibody genes were sequenced. The VH and VL domains of 29D7 were then genetically fused to the constant regions of the human kappa light chain and IgG1, respectively. Additionally, the Fc domain was modified to contain a LALA mutation to attenuate effector function of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0137">Two conjugates were constructed by genetically fusing the BBB shuttle TXB4 VNAR to different sites on the chimeric TrkB-AAb. The TrkB(HC2N) conjugate was prepared by attaching the TXB4 to the N-terminal end of the TrkB antibody heavy chain via a GlyGlyGlyGlySerGlyGlyGlyGlySerGlyGlyGlyGlySer linkage (3&#xd7;G4S linker; SEQ ID NO. 8). The TrkB(HV2N) conjugate was prepared by inserting TXB4 VNAR between the CH1 and Fc domains of the TrkB heavy chain via a 3&#xd7;G4S linker on the N-terminal end and 1&#xd7;G4S linker on C-terminal end of TXB4. A control conjugate was constructed with TXB4 fused to the N-terminal end of the Fc domain (VNAR-Fc). The various conjugates are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> while the sequences of the light and heavy chains for TrkB 29D7 and the various constructs are provided in Table
