The methods include emitting an electrical impulse near a vagus nerve within the patient sufficient to inhibit or reduce an inflammatory or allergic response in the patient, provide relief for bronchoconstriction that results in the tightening of airways and the inability to breath without ventilator support and/or lessen the abnormal blot clotting that develops in some patients. The systems and methods are particularly useful for treating post-COVID conditions or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 that develop in &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; or COVID

Recently, certain viruses, such as those in the coronaviridae family (i.e., coronavirus), have created significant challenges for the health care community in limiting their spread and limiting their adverse consequences to patients, which can lead to hospitalization and death.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named &#x201c;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#x201d; (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes has been named &#x201c;Coronavirus Disease 2019&#x201d; (COVID-19). On Jan. 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, on March <b>13</b>, <b>2020</b>, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to critical multisystem failure. The majority of COVID-19 patients infected with the virus experience mild flu-like symptoms. However, a significant minority experience moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation. These patients typically require hospitalization, and progress to being intubated and/or ventilator dependent. The percentage of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization, and progress to being intubated and/or ventilator dependence climbs significantly with age, the presence of underlying diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood. Fatality is highest in the elderly, ranging from 3% to 27%, among persons aged 65&#x2212;&#x3c;84 years, respectively. Given the aggressive rate of spread of COVID-19, significant concern exists that the US healthcare system does not have the number of ventilators and/or ICU beds to meet the expected demand in the coming months.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or compromised immune systems, may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The most critically afflicted can experience pneumonia and/or ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Physiologically, ARDS is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2;, among others. It is believed that the mortality of ARDS may be the result of an overactivity of the patient's immune system. This is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;cytokine storm&#x201d;. Other cytokines, including chemokines, such as IL-8 or some T-cell derived cytokines, such as lymphotoxin-a are also involved in the cytokine cascade.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain cases, patients infected with COVID-19 develop abnormal blood clotting. Early evidence suggests that these blood clots are caused by autoimmune antibodies generated by the immune system of the body in response to the infection. Blood clots can cause problems ranging from mild to life threatening. If a clot blocks flow in a vein or artery, the tissue normally nourished by that blood vessel can be deprived of oxygen and cells in that area can die. These blood clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impair oxygen exchange and cause life-threatening events, such as strokes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Young healthy individuals can also develop these severe conditions, which appears to be triggered by an unexplained allergic or inflammatory response to the virus. This response is similar to that seen in patients with sepsis or anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therapies that could inhibit inflammatory or allergic responses and thereby block the cytokine cascade may help improve survival and decrease the need for ventilator use and prolonged respiratory support. Therapies that can block the generation of antibodies in the blood and reduce blood clotting would also be beneficial. Unfortunately, known therapies for immune suppression, such as steroids, and many other known therapies for bronchodilation, such as nebulized corticosteroids and other bronchodilators, are contraindicated for the treatment of replicating pathogens, such as coronaviridae or coronaviruses, because they increase viral spread within the body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another challenge facing care providers with COVID-19 is that while most patients with COVID-19 eventually get better, some people experience post-COVID conditions, such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty thinking (&#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;), cough, chest or stomach pain, headache, heart palpitations, joint or muscle pain, diarrhea, sleep problems, fever, dizziness, rash, mood changes, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and others. These post-COVID conditions or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) are a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that can be experienced four to five weeks (sometimes 4 to 6 months) after first being infected with the virus that caused COVID-19 and after the virus has been eliminated from the patient's body. Even individuals who were asymptomatic during the acute phase of COVID-19 can develop post-COVID symptoms and may even account for greater than 30% of patients with PASC. The post-COVID conditions may also be known as long COVID, &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; COVID, post-acute COVID-19 or chronic COVID.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The causes of PASC in some patients are still largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that PASC may be caused by a residual virus sequestered in certain organs, chronic inflammation caused by an aberrant immune response to the virus, end organ damage from the acute phase and/or an autoimmune response induced by the virus. Chronic inflammation is a failure to return to a quiescent state and has been implicated in many serious medical conditions, such as neurological diseases, pulmonary diseases, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Regardless of the cause, symptoms of PASC have proven very difficult to treat by healthcare professionals. This challenge has arisen at least in part because, in many cases, the virus has already been eliminated from the patient's body. Thus, it is often difficult to pinpoint the causes of PASC symptoms and, therefore, challenging to ascertain an appropriate treatment regimen.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">What is needed, therefore, are new systems and methods for treating viruses, such as COVID 19, that can inhibit or reduce the overactive inflammatory or allergic response, provide relief for bronchoconstriction that results in the tightening of airways and the inability to breath without ventilator support and/or lessen the abnormal blot clotting that develops in some patients. It would also be desirable to provide new systems and methods for treating the symptoms of PASC that develop in &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; COVID patients.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This description relates generally to the delivery of electrical impulses to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes, and more specifically to vagal nerve stimulation devices for treating conditions associated with replicating pathogens. The replicating pathogen may include a bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worm, infectious protein (e.g., prion) or a virus, such as an RNA virus. In one particular embodiment, the description relates to treating conditions associated with viruses, such as a virus in the coronaviridae or coronavirus family (e.g., COVID 19).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, a method of treating an inflammatory or allergic response associated with a replicating pathogen in a patient comprises positioning a contact surface of a device in contact with an outer skin surface of the patient. An electrical impulse is applied by the device transcutaneously, via the contact surface, through the outer skin surface of the patient to a vagus nerve of the patient. The electrical impulse is sufficient to reduce a level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a blood of the patient. The electrical impulse is preferably sufficient to reduce the level of CRP in the blood by at least 10 mg/L, more preferably by at least 25 mg/L.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">CRP levels in the blood often increase when there is a condition causing inflammation somewhere in the body. Thus, a CRP test measures the amount of CRP in the blood to detect inflammation due to acute conditions, such as the inflammatory response to a replicating pathogen. This biomarker indicates that the therapy has inhibited an inflammatory or allergic response in the patient, thereby reducing overactivity of the immune system that may threaten the survival of the patient.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is also sufficient to reduce a level of procalcitonin in a blood of the patient, preferably by at least 2 mcg/L and more preferably by at least 5 mcg/L. Procalcitonin is a substance produced by many types of cells in the body, often in response to bacterial or viral infections. The level of procalcitonin in the blood can increase significantly in systemic bacterial or viral infections and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The methods described herein reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators that are elevated in ARDS and other inflammatory or allergic disorders, thereby ameliorating the overactivity of the immune reaction in patient's suffering from certain diseases associated with replicating pathogens. Moreover, this therapy provides potent anti-inflammatory activity without the negative side effect of conventional immune suppression techniques and drugs, such as steroids.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The replicating pathogen may be a bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worm, infectious protein (e.g., prion) or a virus, such as an RNA virus. In certain embodiments, the replicating pathogen is a virus that contains a sensitizing and/or allergenic protein or other molecule that triggers an allergic or inflammatory response in the patient. In one particular embodiment, the virus comprises a virus in the coronaviridae or coronavirus family, such as COVID 19.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The systems and methods described herein decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and consequently mitigate the inflammatory response. These cytokines are believed to play a role in the acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms presenting in patients affected by COVID-19. In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to suppress inflammatory cytokine levels via activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). The CAP is believed to be the efferent vagus nerve-based arm of the inflammatory reflex, mediated through vagal efferent fibers that synapse onto enteric neurons, which release acetylcholine (Ach) at the synaptic junction with macrophages. Stimulation of the CAP leads to Ach binding to &#x3b1;-7-nicotinic ACh receptors (&#x3b1;7nAChR), resulting in reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1b, and IL-6, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to directly inhibit a release of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha and IL-1&#x3b2;. These cytokines are typically elevated in certain patients suffering from replicating pathogens, such as COVID 19, leading to ARDS.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to increase the anti-inflammatory competence of certain cytokines to thereby offset or reduce the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, the device comprises one or more electrodes. The electrodes may be positioned on the outer skin surface of the patient's neck in a suitable location for stimulating the vagus nerve within the neck. The electrodes may be coupled wirelessly, or via wired connections, to an energy source and a signal generator. In other embodiments, the energy source and the signal generator are housed within a handheld device and the electrodes may be attached to the device, or incorporated into the device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an exemplary embodiment, the electrical impulse comprises bursts of 2-20 pulses with each of the bursts having a frequency of about 5 Hz to about 100 Hz. Each of the pulses may have a duration of about 50 to 100 microseconds. Each of the pulses may have a frequency of about 1 kHz to about 20 kHz.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect, the electrical impulse is applied to the patient according to a treatment paradigm based at least in part on an application of the electrical impulse as a single dose from 1 to 24 times per day, preferably about 2 to 5 times per day. The single dose may be from about 30 seconds to about five minutes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another aspect, a method for preventing formation of blood clots in a patient comprises positioning a contact surface of a device in contact with an outer skin surface of the patient. An electrical impulse is applied by the device transcutaneously, via the contact surface, through the outer skin surface of the patient to a vagus nerve of the patient. The electrical impulse is sufficient to reduce a level of blood clotting in the patient.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to reduce a number of antibodies associated with blood clotting in the patient. The antibodies may include autoantibodies associated with blood clotting, such as phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Patients suffering from COVID-19 may have blood dotting abnormalities similar to those with an autoimmune clotting condition, known as antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. These patients produce autoantibodies to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Higher aPL antibody levels have been associated with more severe respiratory disease, lower kidney function, and immune system hyperactivity, including the release of inflammatory cell remnants called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils release NETs to contain infections, but the traps can promote excessive inflammation and clotting when not properly regulated.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">in certain embodiments, the electrical impulses is sufficient to reduce a level of D-dimer in a blood of the patient. The level of D-dimer is preferably reduced by at least 200 mcg/mL and more preferably by at least 500 mcg/mL.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">D-dimer is a protein fragment made when a blood clot dissolves in the blood and is associated with the presence of an antibody in the blood. It has now been shown that certain replicating pathogens, such as Covid-19, may cause a significant increase in the level of blood clotting. Early evidence suggests that this is caused by an autoimmune antibody that circulates through the blood in response to Covid-19. This antibody attacks the cells and triggers clots in arteries, veins and microscopic vessels. These blood clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impair oxygen exchange and cause life-threatening events, such as strokes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method may further include testing the patient for certain biomarkers that indicate that the patient's immune system is overactive. In one particular embodiment, the biomarker(s) are CRP, procalcitonin and/or D-dimer. In this embodiment, the method includes testing the patient for such biomarkers, determining if the patient is suffering from an overactive immune response and/or abnormal blood clotting, and then emitting an electrical impulse to the patient's vagal nerve sufficient to reduce or inhibit the immune response.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another aspect, systems and methods are provided for regulating an immune system of a patient. The method includes measuring a biomarker in the patient associated with an inflammatory response, determining that the inflammatory response exists in the patient and emitting a first series of electrical impulses near a vagus nerve within the patient sufficient to inhibit the inflammatory response in the patient. After the first series of electrical impulses are delivered, the method further includes measuring the biomarker again and determining if the inflammatory response still exists in the patient. If so, a second series of electrical impulses are delivered to the vagus nerve. This process may be continued until the biomarker indicates that the inflammatory response has been sufficiently inhibited or reduced. This feedback mechanism allows the health care practitioner to deliver an optimal level of nerve stimulation to reduce or inhibit the inflammatory response without oversuppressing the immune system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The feedback systems and methods described herein may be applied to treat patients with a replicating pathogen, such as COVID-19, by reducing or eliminating the cytokine storm while still allowing the patient's immune system to effectively fight the pathogen. In certain embodiments, the relevant biomarkers may include interleukin 6 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-2, IL-6, II-8, IL-12, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IFN-&#x3b3;. In other embodiments, the relevant biomarkers may include CRP, procalcitonin and/or D-dimer. These and other biomarkers provide an indication as to whether the immune system is overactive (i.e., activity levels higher than necessary to fight the pathogen and therefore potentially harmful to the patient, such as a cytokine cascade or storm). If these biomarkers indicate overactivity of the immune system after delivery of the electrical impulse, additional electrical impulses are delivered and the biomarkers are measured again. Once the biomarkers indicate that the immune system is no longer overactive, the electrical impulse delivery is halted. This ensures that the immune suppression is not oversuppressed, allowing it to continue to fight the pathogen.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is also sufficient to reduce the magnitude of constriction of smooth bronchial muscle, thereby improving the patient's breathing in situations involving shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation, such as ARDS caused by certain replicating pathogens (e.g., COVID 19). This obviates the need for steroids or other nebulized drugs to treat the patient's respiratory symptoms. These steroids and drugs can often increase the spread of the virus within the patient.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one particular embodiment, the electrical impulse is sufficient to trigger an efferent sympathetic signal that stimulates the release of catecholamines (comprising beta-agonists, epinephrine and/or norepinephrine) from the adrenal glands and/or from nerve endings that are distributed throughout the body. In another embodiment, the method includes stimulating, inhibiting, blocking or otherwise modulating other nerves that release systemic bronchodilators or nerves that directly modulate parasympathetic ganglia transmission (by stimulation or inhibition of preganglionic to postganglionic transmissions).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another aspect, a method of treating a patient exhibiting symptoms associated with a virus comprises positioning a contact surface of a device in contact with an outer skin surface of the patient. The electrical impulse is applied through the outer skin surface of the patient to a vagus nerve of the patient according to a treatment paradigm. The treatment paradigm is based at least in part on an application of the electrical impulse as a single dose from about 30 seconds to about 5 minutes, wherein the treatment paradigm further includes administering about 1 to 24 times per day, preferably for about 2 to about 5 single doses per day, for a plurality of days. In certain embodiments, the single doses may be applied for 1 to 3 months, or up to 6 months depending on the duration of the patient's symptoms.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The virus may be a virus in the coronaviridae family, such as COVID-19. The symptoms may include post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty thinking (&#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;), cough, chest or stomach pain, headache, heart palpitations, joint or muscle pain, diarrhea, sleep problems, fever, dizziness, rash, mood changes, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and others. The post-COVID symptoms or conditions may also be known as long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19 or chronic COVID.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain embodiments a processor coupled to the medical device causes a memory to store a first content and a reader to read a second content from a storage medium. The medical device is configured to switch from a first mode to a second mode based on the first content corresponding to the second content. In this manner, the medical device may be &#x201c;filled&#x201d; with an initial number of doses or an active time period for a patient. The medical device will automatically become deactivated when the patient has completed the prescribed number of doses or time period.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the medical device can be capable of being &#x201c;refilled&#x201d; with an additional number of doses or an additional amount of active time by switching the device back to the first or activated mode. This allows the physician or caregiver to control the level of treatment that a patient receives with the medical device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a contact surface of a housing on a handheld device is positioned in contact with or near an outer skin surface of a neck of the patient and the electric current is transmitted transcutaneously and non-invasively through the outer skin surface of the neck of the patient to generate an electrical impulse at or near a selected nerve, such as the vagus nerve, within the patient. The housing comprises an energy source for generating an electric current. However, the energy source may be located remotely to the housing in certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various technologies for preventing, diagnosing, monitoring, ameliorating, or treating medical conditions, diseases, or disorders, such as replicating pathogens, are more completely described in the following detailed description, with reference to the drawings provided herewith, and in claims appended hereto.

description relates to the delivery of electrical impulses (and/or fields) to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes, and more specifically to vagal nerve stimulation devices for treating conditions associated with replicating pathogens. The replicating pathogen may include a bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worm, infectious protein (e.g., prion) or a virus, such as an RNA virus. In one particular embodiment, the description relates to treating conditions associated with viruses. The virus may comprise a virus that contains a sensitizing and/or allergenic protein or other molecule that triggers an allergic or inflammatory response in the patient, such as a virus in the coronaviridae or coronavirus family (e.g., COVID 19).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The methods and systems reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators that are elevated in ARDS and other inflammatory disorders, thereby ameliorating the overactivity of the immune reaction in patient's suffering from certain disorders associated with replicating pathogen. This therapy provides potent anti-inflammatory activity without the negative side effect of conventional immune suppression techniques and drugs, such as steroids.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The methods and system may also serve to limit the level of blood clotting in a patient. It has now been shown that certain replicating pathogens, such as Covid-19, may cause a significant increase in the level of blood clotting. Early evidence suggests that this is caused by an autoimmune antibody that circulates through the blood in response to Covid-19. This antibody attacks the cells and triggers clots in arteries, veins and microscopic vessels. These blood clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impair oxygen exchange and cause life-threatening events, such as strokes.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Applicant has discovered that the electrical impulses described herein may help to reduce a level of blood clotting in the patient by reducing a number of antibodies associated with blood clotting in the patient. The antibodies may include autoantibodies associated with blood clotting, such as phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Patients suffering from COVID-19 may have blood clotting abnormalities similar to those with an autoimmune clotting condition, known as antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. These patients produce autoantibodies to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Higher aPL antibody levels have been associated with more severe respiratory disease, lower kidney function, and immune system hyperactivity, including the release of inflammatory cell remnants called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS). Neutrophils release NETs to contain infections, but the traps can promote excessive inflammation and clotting when not properly regulated.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, the methods and systems decrease the magnitude of constriction of bronchial smooth muscle, thereby improving the patient's breathing in situations involving shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation, such as ARDS caused by certain replicating pathogens (e.g., COVID 19).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has at least two mechanisms of action that may profoundly affect respiratory function in patients with respiratory distress due to COVID 19. First, as discussed in many of applicant's patents and patent applications referenced above, vagus nerve stimulation modulates bronchoconstriction. Acute stimulation has demonstrated a marked improvement in Work of Breathing (WOB) as well as FEV1 in patients with severe respiratory distress due to airway reactivity. This effect appears to occur via an afferent response to stimulation of the vagus nerve.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Animal models, including swine and guinea pig models, have demonstrated that vagal nerve stimulation can reduce bronchoconstriction by as much as 70%. The effect of VNS on airway reactivity can be blocked by the non-specific 13-blocker, propranolol, suggesting a sympathetically mediated mechanism. Blocking efferent neural transmission has no effect on stimulation effects, whereas blocking afferent conduction abolishes it. This indicates that there is a central component to airway reactivity. This suggests that VNS inhibits airway constriction through a parasympathetic-sympathetic reflex arc, whereby stimulation of an afferent vagal nerve causes an efferent, sympathetically mediated release of catecholamines, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation. In a feasibility study using a percutaneous VNS device, vagus nerve stimulation was associated with improvements in FEV1 and perceived work of breathing in patients undergoing treatment for moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbations in the ED who did not respond to initial standard care therapy.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Second, VNS has been shown to be a potent moderator of pathologic immune reactions, specifically suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels via activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). The CAP is believed to be the efferent vagus nerve-based arm of the inflammatory reflex, mediated through vagal efferent fibers that synapse onto enteric neurons, which release acetylcholine (Ach) at the synaptic junction with macrophages. Stimulation of the CAP leads to Ach binding to &#x3b1;-7-nicotinic ACh receptors (&#x3b1;7nAChR), resulting in reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1b, and IL-6, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. VNS appears to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and consequently mitigate the inflammatory response. These cytokines are believed to play a role in the acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms presenting in patients affected by COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Applicant has also discovered that the systems and methods described herein may be particularly useful for the longer term treatment of patients suffering from chronic diseases or disorders. In particular, the treatment paradigms described below provide a sustained effect on the mechanisms described above, i.e., inhibiting the inflammatory response and/or autoimmune antibodies that may cause or sustain an inflammatory cascade or abnormal blood clotting. In one such example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure are particularly useful in treating patients exhibiting long-term symptoms associated with a virus in the coronaviridae family, such as COVID-19. These symptoms may include post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty thinking (&#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;), cough, chest or stomach pain, headache, heart palpitations, joint or muscle pain, diarrhea, sleep problems, fever, dizziness, rash, mood changes, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and others. The post-COVID symptoms or conditions may also be known as long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19 or chronic COVID.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Note though that this disclosure is now described more fully with reference to the set of accompanying illustrative drawings, in which example embodiments of this disclosure are shown. This disclosure can be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as necessarily being limited to the example embodiments disclosed herein. Rather, the example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete, and fully conveys various concepts of this disclosure to those skilled in a relevant art. For example, the energy impulses (and/or fields) that are used to treat those conditions comprise electrical and/or electromagnetic energy, can be delivered invasively or non-invasively to the patient, particularly to a vagus nerve of the patient.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the devices and methods described herein stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non-invasively. A medical procedure can be understood as being non-invasive when no break in the skin (or other surface of the body, such as a wound bed) is created through use of the method, and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice (e.g., beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear). In some ways, such non-invasive procedures can be distinguished from some invasive procedures (including minimally invasive procedures) in that the invasive procedures insert a substance or device into or through the skin (or other surface of the body, such as a wound bed) or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, transcutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve can be non-invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the skin, or otherwise stimulating at or beyond the surface of the skin or using a form-fitting conductive garment, without breaking the skin [Thierry KELLER and Andreas Kuhn. Electrodes for transcutaneous (surface) electrical stimulation. Journal of Automatic Control, University of Belgrade 18(2,2008):35-45, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein; Mark R. PRAUSNITZ. The effects of electric current applied to skin: A review for transdermal drug delivery. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 18 (1996) 395-425, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. In contrast, percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve can be minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin, via needle-puncture of the skin.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Another form of non-invasive electrical stimulation is magnetic stimulation. It involves the induction, by a time-varying magnetic field, of electrical fields and current within tissue, in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. Magnetic stimulation can be non-invasive because the magnetic field is produced by passing a time-varying current through a coil positioned outside the body. An electric field is induced at a distance, causing electric current to flow within electrically conducting bodily tissue. The electrical circuits for magnetic stimulators can be generally complex and expensive and use a high current impulse generator that may produce discharge currents of 5,000 amps or more, which is passed through the stimulator coil to produce a magnetic pulse. Some principles of electrical nerve stimulation using a magnetic stimulator, along with descriptions of medical applications of magnetic stimulation, are reviewed in: Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous, The Guide to Magnetic Stimulation, The Magstim Company Ltd, Spring Gardens, Whitland, Carmarthenshire, SA34 OHR, United Kingdom, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein. In contrast, the magnetic stimulators that are disclosed herein are relatively simpler devices that can use considerably smaller currents within the stimulator coils. Accordingly, they are intended to satisfy a need for simple-to-use and less expensive non-invasive magnetic stimulation devices.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Some advantages of some of such non-invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non-invasive and may therefore be more cooperative, resulting in a better outcome. Non-invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues, such as that due to bleeding, infection, skin or internal organ injury, blood vessel injury, and vein or lung blood clotting. Non-invasive procedures can be generally measurably painless and may be performed without some of the dangers and costs of surgery. They are ordinarily performed even without the need for local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non-invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non-invasive procedures, some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first-responders at home or at a workplace. Furthermore, the cost of non-invasive procedures may be significantly reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In co-pending, commonly assigned patent applications, the Applicant disclosed some noninvasive electrical vagus nerve stimulation devices, which are adapted, and for certain applications improved, in the present disclosure [application Ser.

At least some of the present disclosure elaborates on the electrical stimulation device, rather than the magnetic stimulation device that has similar functionality, with the understanding that unless it is otherwise indicated, the elaboration could apply to either the electrical or the magnetic nerve stimulation device. Because some properties of some of the earlier devices have already been disclosed, the present disclosure focuses on what is new with respect to the earlier disclosures.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The patient can apply the stimulator without the benefit of having a trained healthcare provider nearby. An advantage of the self-stimulation therapy is that it can be administered more or less immediately when symptoms occur, rather than having to visit the healthcare provider at a clinic or emergency room. A need for such a visit would only compound the aggravation that the patient is already experiencing. Another advantage of the self-stimulation therapy is the convenience of providing the therapy in the patient's home or workplace, which eliminates scheduling difficulties, for example, when the nerve stimulation is being administered for prophylactic reasons at odd hours of the day. Furthermore, the cost of the treatment may be reduced by not requiring the involvement of a trained healthcare provider.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The present disclosure discloses methods and devices for the non-invasive treatment of diseases and disorders, utilizing an energy source that transmits energy non-invasively to nervous tissue. In particular, the devices can transmit energy to, or in close proximity to, a nerve of the patient, such as the vagus nerve, in order to temporarily stimulate, block and/or modulate electrophysiological signals in that nerve. In some embodiments, some electrodes applied to the skin of the patient generate currents within the tissue of the patient. This may enable production and application of the electrical impulses so as to interact with the signals of one or more nerves, in order to achieve the therapeutic result. Some of the disclosure is directed specifically to treatment of a patient by stimulation in or around a vagus nerve, with devices positioned non-invasively on or near a patient's neck to treat conditions associated with replicating pathogens. The replicating pathogen may include a bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worm, infectious protein (e.g., prion) or a virus, such as an RNA virus.

A fact that electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve can be used to treat many disorders may be understood as follows. The vagus nerve is composed of motor and sensory fibers. The vagus nerve leaves the cranium, passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck, then passes to the chest and abdomen, where it contributes to the innervation of the viscera. A human vagus nerve (tenth cranial nerve, paired left and right) comprises of over <b>100</b>,<b>000</b> nerve fibers (axons), mostly organized into groups. The groups are contained within fascicles of varying sizes, which branch and converge along the nerve. Under normal physiological conditions, each fiber conducts electrical impulses only in one direction, which is defined to be the orthodromic direction, and which is opposite the antidromic direction. However, external electrical stimulation of the nerve may produce action potentials that propagate in orthodromic and antidromic directions. Besides efferent output fibers that convey signals to the various organs in the body from the central nervous system, the vagus nerve conveys sensory (afferent) information about the state of the body's organs back to the central nervous system. Some <b>80</b>-<b>90</b>% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent (sensory) nerves, communicating the state of the viscera to the central nervous system.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The largest nerve fibers within a left or right vagus nerve are approximately 20 &#x3bc;m in diameter and are heavily myelinated, whereas only the smallest nerve fibers of less than about 1 &#x3bc;m in diameter are completely unmyelinated. When the distal part of a nerve is electrically stimulated, a compound action potential may be recorded by an electrode located more proximally. A compound action potential contains several peaks or waves of activity that represent the summated response of multiple fibers having similar conduction velocities. The waves in a compound action potential represent different types of nerve fibers that are classified into corresponding functional categories, with approximate diameters as follows: A-alpha fibers (afferent or efferent fibers, 12-20 &#x3bc;m diameter), A-beta fibers (afferent or efferent fibers, 5-12 &#x3bc;m), A-gamma fibers (efferent fibers, 3-7 &#x3bc;m), A-delta fibers (afferent fibers, 2-5 &#x3bc;m), B fibers (1-3 &#x3bc;m) and C fibers (unmyelinated, 0.4-1.2 &#x3bc;m). The diameters of group A and group B fibers include the thickness of the myelin sheaths.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The vagus (or vagal) afferent nerve fibers arise from cell bodies located in the vagal sensory ganglia, which take the form of swellings near the base of the skull. Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract, with some eighty percent of the terminating synapses being located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (or nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus tractus solitarius, or NTS). The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures in the central nervous system, such as the amygdala, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, nucleus paragigantocellurlais, olfactory tubercule, locus ceruleus, nucleus ambiguus and the hypothalamus. The NTS also projects to the parabrachial nucleus, which in turn projects to the hypothalamus, the thalamus, the amygdala, the anterior insula, and infralimbic cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and other cortical regions [JEAN A. The nucleus tractus solitarius: neuroanatomic, neurochemical and functional aspects. Arch Int Physiol Biochim Biophys 99(5,1991):A3-A52 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. Thus, stimulation of vagal afferents can modulate the activity of many structures of the brain and brainstem through these projections.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">With regard to vagal efferent nerve fibers, two vagal components have evolved in the brainstem to regulate peripheral parasympathetic functions. The dorsal vagal complex, consisting of the dorsal motor nucleus and its connections controls parasympathetic function primarily below the level of the diaphragm, while the ventral vagal complex, comprised of nucleus ambiguus and nucleus retrofacial, controls functions primarily above the diaphragm in organs such as the heart, thymus and lungs, as well as other glands and tissues of the neck and upper chest, and specialized muscles such as those of the esophageal complex. For example, the cell bodies for the preganglionic parasympathetic vagal neurons that innervate the heart reside in the nucleus ambiguus, which is relevant to potential cardiovascular side effects that may be produced by vagus nerve stimulation.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The vagus efferent fibers innervate parasympathetic ganglionic neurons that are located in or adjacent to each target organ. The vagal parasympathetic tone resulting from the activity of these fibers is balanced reflexively in part by sympathetic innervations. Consequently, electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve may result not only in modulation of parasympathetic activity in postganglionic nerve fibers, but also a reflex modulation of sympathetic activity. The ability of a vagus nerve to bring about widespread changes in autonomic activity, either directly through modulation of vagal efferent nerves, or indirectly via activation of brainstem and brain functions that are brought about by electrical stimulation of vagal afferent nerves, accounts for the fact that vagus nerve stimulation can treat many different medical conditions in many end organs. Selective treatment of particular conditions is possible because the parameters of the electrical stimulation (e.g. frequency, amplitude, pulse width, etc.) may selectively activate or modulate the activity of particular afferent or efferent A, B, and/or C fibers that result in a particular physiological response in each individual.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The electrodes used to stimulate a vagus nerve can be implanted about the nerve during open neck surgery. For many patients, this may be done with an objective of implanting permanent electrodes to treat epilepsy, depression, or other conditions [Arun Paul AMAR, Michael L. Levy, Charles Y.

In other patients, a vagus nerve can be electrically stimulated during an open-neck thyroid surgery in order to confirm that the nerve has not been accidentally damaged during the surgery. In that case, a vagus nerve in the neck is surgically exposed, and a temporary stimulation electrode is clipped about the nerve [SCHNEIDER R, Randolph G W, Sekulla C, Phelan E, Thanh P N, Bucher M, Machens A, Dralle H, Lorenz K.

In that procedure, a pair of electrodes (an active and a return electrode) are introduced through the skin of a patient's neck to the vicinity of a vagus nerve, and wires connected to the electrodes extend out of the patient's skin to a pulse generator [Publication number US20100241188, entitled Percutaneous electrical treatment of tissue, to J.

Once in position, electrical impulses are applied through the electrodes of the stimulation device to one or more selected nerves (e.g., vagus nerve or one of its branches) to stimulate, block or otherwise modulate the nerve(s) and treat the patient's condition or a symptom of that condition. For some conditions, the treatment may be acute, meaning that the electrical impulse immediately begins to interact with one or more nerves to produce a response in the patient. In some cases, the electrical impulse will produce a response in the nerve(s) to improve the patient's condition or symptom in less than 3 hours, preferably less than 1 hour and more preferably less than 15 minutes. For other conditions, intermittently scheduled or as-needed stimulation of the nerve may produce improvements in the patient over the course of several hours, days, weeks, months or years. A more complete description of a suitable percutaneous procedure for vagal nerve stimulation can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending US Patent Application titled &#x201c;Percutaneous Electrical Treatment of Tissue&#x201d;, filed Apr. 13, 2009 (Ser. No. 12/422,483), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, a time-varying magnetic field, originating and confined to the outside of a patient, generates an electromagnetic field and/or induces eddy currents within tissue of the patient.

In some embodiments, an objective may include an ability to produce and apply the electrical impulses so as to interact with the signals of one or more nerves, in order to prevent or avert a stroke and/or transient ischemic attack, to ameliorate or limit the effects of an acute stroke or transient ischemic attack, and/or to rehabilitate a stroke patient.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Some of the disclosure is directed specifically to treatment of a patient by electromagnetic stimulation in or around a vagus nerve, with devices positioned non-invasively on or near a patient's neck. However, it will also be appreciated that some the devices and methods can be applied to other tissues and nerves of the body, including but not limited to other parasympathetic nerves, sympathetic nerves, spinal or cranial nerves. As recognized by those having skill in the art, the methods should be carefully evaluated prior to use in patients known to have preexisting cardiac issues. In addition, it will be recognized that some of the treatment paradigms can be used with a variety of different vagal nerve stimulators, including implantable and/or percutaneous stimulation devices, such as the ones described herein.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some embodiments, broadly speaking, the Applicant has determined that there are several components to the effects of nVNS on the brain. For example, the strongest effect occurs during the acute stimulation and results in significant changes in brain function that can be clearly seen as acute changes in autonomic function (e.g. measured using pupillometry, heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, or evoked potential) and activation and inhibition of various brain regions as shown in fMRI imaging studies. For example, the second effect of moderate intensity, lasts for 15 to 180 minutes after stimulation. Animal studies have shown changes in neurotransmitter levels in various parts of the brain that persist for several hours. For example, the third effect of mild intensity, lasts up to <b>8</b> hours and is responsible for the long lasting alleviation of symptoms seen clinically and, for example, in animal models of migraine headache and autoimmune diseases, such as SjOgren's syndrome and Rheumatoid arthritis or RA.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Treatment Paradigms</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Thus, depending on the medical indication, whether it is a chronic or acute usage, such as treatment, and the natural history of the disease, different usage, such as treatment, protocols may be used. In particular, the Applicant has discovered that it is not necessary to &#x201c;continuously stimulate&#x201d; the vagus nerve (or to in order to provide clinically efficacious benefits to patients with certain disorders. In some embodiments, a term &#x201c;continuously stimulate&#x201d; can be understood to mean stimulation that follows a certain On/Off pattern continuously 24 hours/day. For example, some implantable vagal nerve stimulators &#x201c;continuously stimulate&#x201d; the vagus nerve with a pattern of 30 seconds ON/5 minutes OFF (or the like) for 24 hours/day and seven days/week. The Applicant has determined that this continuous stimulation is not necessary to provide the desired clinical benefit for many disorders. For example, in the treatment of conditions associated with replicating pathogens, such as a coronavirus, the treatment paradigm may comprise 1 to 20 single dose stimulations per day, with about 2 to 5 stimulations per day optimal. Each single dose or stimulation may last from about 30 seconds to about 3 minutes, with 90 seconds to 2 minutes considered optimal.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The present description contemplates three types of interventions involving stimulation of a vagus nerve: prophylactic or chronic, acute and compensatory (rehabilitative). Among these, the acute treatment involves the fewest administrations of vagus nerve stimulations, which begin upon the appearance of symptoms. It is intended primarily to enlist and engage the autonomic nervous system to inhibit excitatory neurotransmissions that accompany the symptoms. The prophylactic or chronic treatments resembles the acute treatment in the sense that it is administered as though acute symptoms had just occurred (even though they have not) and is repeated at regular intervals, as though the symptoms were reoccurring (even though they are not). The rehabilitative or compensatory treatments, on the other hand, seek to promote long-term adjustments in the central nervous system, compensating for deficiencies that arose as the result of the patient's disease by making new neural circuits.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">A vagus nerve stimulation treatment is conducted for a continuous period of thirty seconds to five minutes, preferably about <b>90</b> seconds to about three minutes and more preferably about two minutes (each defined as a single dose). After a dose has been completed, the therapy is stopped for a period of time (depending on the treatment as described below). For chronic or prophylactic treatments, such as a treatment for &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; COVID, the therapy preferably comprises multiple doses/day over a period of time that may last from one week to a number of years. In certain embodiments, the treatment will comprise multiple doses at predetermined times during the day and/or at predetermined intervals throughout the day. In exemplary embodiments, the treatment comprises one of the following: (1) 3 doses/day at predetermined intervals or times; (2) two doses, either consecutively, or separated by 5 min at predetermined intervals or times, preferably two or three times/day; (3) 3 doses, either consecutively or separated by 5 min again at predetermined intervals or times, such as 2 or 3 times/day; or (4) 1-3 doses, either consecutively or separated by 5 min, 4-6 times per day.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">For certain disorders, the time of day can be more important than the time interval between treatments. For example, the locus correleus has periods of time during a 24 hour day wherein it has inactive periods and active periods. Typically, the inactive periods can occur in the late afternoon or in the middle of the night when the patient is asleep. It is during the inactive periods that the levels of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain that are generated by the locus correleus are reduced. This may have an impact on certain disorders. For example, patients suffering from migraines or cluster headaches often receive these headaches after an inactive period of the locus correleus. For these types of disorders, the prophylactic treatment is optimal during the inactive periods such that the amounts of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain can remain at a higher enough level to mitigate or abort an acute attack of the disorder.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In these embodiments, the chronic or treatment may comprise multiple doses/day timed for periods of inactivity of the locus correleus. In one embodiment, a treatment comprises one or more doses administered 2-3 times per day or 2-3 &#x201c;treatment sessions&#x201d; per day. The treatment sessions preferably occur during the late afternoon or late evening, in the middle of the night and again in the morning when the patient wakes up. In an exemplary embodiment, each treatment session comprises 1-4 doses, preferably 2-3 doses, with each dose lasting for about 90 seconds to about three minutes.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">For other disorders, the intervals between treatment sessions may be the most important as applicant has determined that stimulation of the vagus nerve can have a prolonged effect on the inhibitor neurotransmitters levels in the brain, e.g., at least one hour, up to 3 hours and sometimes up to 8 hours. In one embodiment, a treatment comprises one or more doses (i.e., treatment sessions) administered at intervals during a 24 hour period. In a preferred embodiment, there are 1-5 such treatment sessions, preferably 2-4 treatment sessions. Each treatment session preferably comprises 1-3 doses, each &#x201c;dose&#x201d; lasting between about 30 seconds to about three minutes, preferably about 90 seconds to about 150 seconds, more preferably about 2 minutes.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">For an acute treatment of patients suffering from, for example, the acute respiratory effects of a virus, such as COVID-19, the therapy comprises at least 1 &#x201c;dose&#x201d; administered within about 6 hours, preferably about 5 hours and more preferably about 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Alternatively, the therapy may include at least a first dose immediately followed by a second dose, with both the first and second doses administered within about 6 hours, preferably about 5 hours and more preferably about 4 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The treatment regimen or stimulation protocol may further include follow-on doses after the initial dose or doses discussed above. Applicant has further discovered that follow-on doses administered for at least one hour, preferably at least two hours and more preferably about 3 hours, results in improved symptoms. The doses may be administered continuously for these time periods, more preferably, they may be administered after certain time intervals. In an exemplary embodiment, the time intervals are about 5 to 30 minutes between each dose or doses, preferably between about 10 to 20 minutes and more preferably every 15 minutes.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Applicant has also discovered that the treatment can be further optimized with additional doses being administered with longer time intervals after the first 1-3 hours. In an exemplary embodiment, the additional doses are administered between about 6 to 10 hours apart, preferably about 8 hours, for at least two days, preferably between about 2-5 days or until the patient is discharged from the hospital.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">For long term treatment such as the treatment of long-haul or chronic COVID patients the therapy may consist of: (1) 3 treatments/day; (2) 2 treatments, either consecutively or separated by 5 min, 3&#xd7;/day; (3) 3 treatments, either consecutively or separated by 5 min, 2&#xd7;/day; (4) 2 or 3 treatments, either consecutively or separated by 5 min, up to 10&#xd7;/day; or (5) 1, 2 or 3 treatments, either consecutively or separated by 5 min, every 15, 30, 60 or 120 min. In an exemplary embodiment, each treatment session comprises 1-3 doses administered to the patient either consecutively or separated by 5 minutes. The treatment sessions are administered every 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes during the day such that the patient could receive 2 doses every hour throughout a 24 hour day. The treatment sessions last for a plurality of days, for example 1-3 months, up to 6 months, or until the patient's symptoms have resolved.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For some, many, most, or all of the treatments listed above, one may alternate treatment between left and right sides, or in the case of diseases that occur in particular brain hemispheres, one may treat ipsilateral or contralateral to the stroke-hemisphere or headache side, respectively. Or for a single treatment, one may treat one minute on one side followed by one minute on the opposite side. Variations of these treatment paradigms may be chosen on a patient-by-patient basis. For treating conditions associated with replicating pathogens, it has been found that both sides of the neck can be treated during each does or stimulation session. However, it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the symptoms of patients. Different stimulation parameters may also be selected as the course of the patient's condition changes. In some embodiments, some methods and devices do not produce clinically significant side effects, such as agitation or anxiety, or changes in heart rate or blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Description Of Various Nerve Stimulating/Modulating Devices</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Some devices that are used to stimulate a vagus nerve are now described. An embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram of an electrode-based nerve stimulating and/or modulating device <b>302</b> for delivering impulses of energy to nerves for the treatment of medical conditions. As shown, device <b>302</b> may include an impulse generator <b>310</b>; a power source <b>320</b> coupled to the impulse generator <b>310</b>; a control unit <b>330</b> in communication with the impulse generator <b>310</b> and coupled to the power source <b>320</b>; and electrodes <b>340</b> coupled via wires <b>345</b> to impulse generator <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, the same impulse generator <b>310</b>, power source <b>320</b>, and control unit <b>330</b> may be used for either a magnetic stimulator or the electrode-based stimulator <b>302</b>, allowing the user to change parameter settings depending on whether magnetic coils or the electrodes <b>340</b> are attached.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Although a pair of electrodes <b>340</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, in practice the electrodes may also comprise three or more distinct electrode elements, each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator <b>310</b>. Thus, the electrodes <b>340</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> represent some, most, many, or all electrodes of the device collectively.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In certain embodiments, device <b>302</b> may also include is a volume, contiguous with an electrode <b>340</b>, that is filled with electrically conducting medium <b>350</b>. The conducting medium in which the electrode <b>340</b> is embedded need not completely surround or extend about an electrode. The volume <b>350</b> is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to shape the current density passed through an electrode <b>340</b> that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient's nerve or tissue. The electrical connection to the patient's skin surface is through an interface <b>351</b>. In some embodiments, the interface is made of an electrically insulating (dielectric) material, such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In that case, electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is capacitive. In some embodiments, the interface comprises electrically conducting material, such as the electrically conducting medium <b>350</b> itself, an electrically conducting or permeable membrane, or a metal piece. In that case, electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is ohmic. As shown, the interface may be deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus, the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the interface <b>351</b> corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body, against which the interface <b>351</b> is applied, so as to make the interface and body surface contiguous.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The control unit <b>330</b> controls the impulse generator <b>310</b> to generate a signal for each of the device's electrodes (or magnetic coils). The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non-invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the electrodes <b>340</b>. It is noted that nerve stimulating/modulating device <b>302</b> may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005/0075701 and US2005/0075702, both to SHAFER, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein, contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to this disclosure. By way of example, a pulse generator is also commercially available, such as Agilent 33522A Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator, Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The control unit <b>330</b> may comprise a general purpose computer, comprising one or more CPU, computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs (including the system's operating system) and the storage and retrieval of data, disk storage devices, communication devices (such as serial and USB ports) for accepting external signals from a keyboard, computer mouse, and touchscreen, as well as any externally supplied physiological signals, analog-to-digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals, communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system, hardware for generating the display of information on monitors or display screens that comprise part of the system, and busses to interconnect the above-mentioned components. Thus, the user may operate the system by typing or otherwise providing instructions for the control unit <b>330</b> at a device such as a keyboard or touch-screen and view the results on a device such as the system's computer monitor or display screen, or direct the results to a printer, modem, and/or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals. Alternatively, the control unit <b>330</b> may have a compact and simple structure, for example, wherein the user may operate the system using only an on/off switch and power control wheel or knob, or their touchscreen equivalent. In a section below, an embodiment is also described wherein the stimulator housing has a simple structure, but other components of the control unit <b>330</b> are distributed into other devices (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level, frequency and train duration (or pulse number). The stimulation characteristics of each pulse, such as depth of penetration, strength and selectivity, depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes, as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes, as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In some embodiments, pulse parameters are set in such a way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated [Bartosz SAWICKI, Robert Szmurlo, Przemyslaw Plonecki, Jacek Starzyriski, Stanislaw Wincenciak, Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92-97 in: Krawczyk, A. Electromagnetic Field, Health and Environment: Proceedings of EHE'07. Amsterdam, IOS Press, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. Pulses may be monophasic, biphasic or polyphasic. In some embodiments, some devices include those that are fixed frequency, where each pulse in a train has the same inter-stimulus interval, and those that have modulated frequency, where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of an electrical voltage / current profile for a stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse applied to a portion or portions of selected nerves in accordance with an embodiment of this disclosure. For some embodiments, the voltage and current refer to those that are non-invasively produced within the patient by the electrodes (or magnetic coils). As shown, a suitable electrical voltage/current profile <b>400</b> for the blocking and/or modulating impulse <b>410</b> to the portion or portions of a nerve may be achieved using pulse generator <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, the pulse generator <b>310</b> may be implemented using a power source <b>320</b> and a control unit <b>330</b> having, for instance, a processor, a clock, a memory, etc., to produce a pulse train <b>420</b> to the electrodes <b>340</b> that deliver the stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse <b>410</b> to the nerve. Nerve stimulating/modulating device <b>302</b> may be externally powered and/or recharged or may have its own power source <b>320</b>. The parameters of the modulation signal <b>400</b>, such as the frequency, amplitude, duty cycle, pulse width, pulse shape, etc., can be programmable, non-programmable, modifiable, locally or remotely updateable, or others. An external communication device may modify the pulse generator programming to improve treatment.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In addition, or as an alternative to some of the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage/current profile of the stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse to the electrodes, the device disclosed in US Patent Application Publication No. US2005/0216062, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein, may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation (ES) system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications, which produce an electric field pulse in order to non-invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators, each producing a signal having a distinct shape, such as a sine wave, a square or a saw-tooth wave, or simple or complex pulse, the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude, duration, repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF [A.R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies: a primer. pp. 17-37 in: Bioelectromagnetic Medicine (Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov, eds.). New York: Marcel Dekker (2004), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated, as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense prevailing conditions prevailing in this substance, whereby the user of the system can manually adjust the signal, or have it automatically adjusted by feedback, to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes, who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The stimulating and/or modulating impulse signal <b>410</b> preferably has a frequency, an amplitude, a duty cycle, a pulse width, a pulse shape, etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result, namely, stimulating and/or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example, the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater, such as between about 15 Hz to 100 Hz, preferably between about 15-50 Hz and more preferably between about 15-35 Hz. In some embodiments, the frequency is 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result, such as about 1 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds, preferably about 100-400 microseconds and more preferably about 200-400 microseconds. For example, the electric field induced or produced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve may be about 5 to 600 V/m, preferably less than 100 V/m, and even more preferably less than 30 V/m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V/m/mm. More generally, the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation, which is approximately 8 V/m at 1000 Hz. The modulation signal may have a peak voltage amplitude selected to influence the therapeutic result, such as about 0.2 volts or greater, such as about 0.2 volts to about 40 volts, preferably between about 1-20 volts and more preferably between about 2-12 volts.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In an exemplary embodiment, the waveform comprises bursts of sinusoidal pulses, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>. As seen there, individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of T, and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal (the inter-burst period). The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter-burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example, the sinusoidal period <smallcaps>T </smallcaps>may be between about 50-1000 microseconds with a frequency of about 1-20 kHz), preferably between about 100-400 microseconds with a frequency of about 2.5-10 kHz, more preferably about 133-400 microseconds with a frequency of about 2.5-7.5 kHz and even more preferably about 200 microseconds with a frequency of about 5 kHz; the number of pulses per burst may be N=1-20, preferably about 2-10 and more preferably about 5; and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter-burst period may have a period T comparable to about 5-100 Hz, preferably about 15-50 Hz, more preferably about 25-35 Hz and even more preferably about 25 Hz (a much smaller value of T is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> to make the bursts discernable). When these exemplary values are used for T and <smallcaps>T</smallcaps>, the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies (1/200 microseconds=5000/sec), as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms, as currently practiced.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The above waveform is essentially a 1-20 kHz signal that includes bursts of pulses with each burst having a frequency of about 5-100 Hz and each pulse having a frequency of about 1-20 kHz. Another way of thinking about the waveform is that it is a 1-20 kHz waveform that repeats itself at a frequency of about 5-100 Hz.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, an objective of some of the disclosed stimulators is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode (or magnetic coil) configuration, and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform, but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because, for example, a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not, obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves [GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 (1995): 375-385, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. These methods complement others that are used to achieve selective nerve stimulation, such as the use of local anesthetic, application of pressure, inducement of ischemia, cooling, use of ultrasound, graded increases in stimulus intensity, exploiting the absolute refractory period of axons, and the application of stimulus blocks [John E. SWETT and Charles M. Bourassa. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. In: Electrical Stimulation Research Techniques, Michael M. Patterson and Raymond P. Kesner, eds. Academic Press.

A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the anatomical regions that one is attempting stimulate indirectly, in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform, as suggested in patent number U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,953, entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses, to THOMAS et al. , the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein, and application number US20090299435, entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and/or efficacy, to GLINER et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein.

No. 7,869,885, entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy, to BEGNAUD et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. However, some stimulation waveforms, such as those described herein, are discovered by trial and error, and then deliberately improved upon.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Invasive nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. However, Applicant found that square waveforms are not ideal for non-invasive stimulation, as they produce excessive pain, but still can be used. Prepulses and similar waveform modifications have been suggested as methods to improve selectivity of nerve stimulation waveforms, but Applicant also did not find them ideal, although they still can be used [Aleksandra VUCKOVIC, Marco Tosato and Johannes J Struijk.

In fact, the absence of significant fluctuation in naturally occurring physiological signals from a patient is ordinarily considered to be an indication that the patient is in ill health. This is because a pathological control system that regulates the patient's physiological variables may have become trapped around only one of two or more possible steady states and is therefore unable to respond normally to external and internal stresses. Accordingly, even if feedback is not used to generate the modulation signal <b>400</b>, it may be useful to artificially modulate the signal in an aperiodic fashion, in such a way as to simulate fluctuations that would occur naturally in a healthy individual. Thus, the noisy modulation of the stimulation signal may cause a pathological physiological control system to be reset or undergo a non-linear phase transition, through a mechanism known as stochastic resonance [B.

The head-cup (<b>744</b>) and body of the stimulator are made of a non-conducting material, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head-cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head-cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geomety that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions that determine the electric field strength.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In certain embodiments, the disc interface <b>743</b> actually functions as the electrode and the screw <b>745</b> is simply the output connection to the signal generator electronics. In this embodiment, electrically conductive fluid or gel is positioned between the signal generator and the interface or electrode <b>745</b> . In this embodiment, the conductive fluid filters out or eliminates high frequency components from the signal to smooth out the signal before it reaches the electrode(s) <b>745</b>. When the signal is generated, power switching and electrical noise typically add unwanted high frequency spikes back into the signal. In addition, the pulsing of the sinusoidal bursts may induce high frequency components in the signal. By filtering the signal just before it reaches the electrodes <b>745</b> with the conductive fluid, a smoother, cleaner signal is applied to the patient, thereby reducing the pain and discomfort felt by the patient and allowing a higher amplitude to be applied to the patient. This allows a sufficiently strong signal to be applied to reach a deeper nerve, such as the vagus nerve, without causing too much pain and discomfort to the patient at the surface of their skin.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In other embodiments, a low-pass filter may be used instead of the electrically conductive fluid to filter out the undesirable high frequency components of the signal. The low-pass filter may comprise a digital or analog filter or simply a capacitor placed in series between the signal generator and the electrode/interface.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">If an outer membrane is used and is made of conducting materials, and the disc (<b>743</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is made of solid conducting materials such as stainless steel, then the membrane becomes optional , in which case the disc may serve as the interface <b>351</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus, an embodiment without the membrane is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>. This version of the device comprises a solid (but possibly flexible in some embodiments) conducting disc that cannot absorb fluid, the non-conducting stimulator head (<b>744</b>) into or onto which the disc is placed, and the electrode (<b>745</b>), which is also a screw. It is understood that the disc (<b>743</b>) may have an anisotropic material or electrical structure, for example, wherein a disc of stainless steel has a grain, such that the grain of the disc should be rotated about its location on the stimulator head, in order to achieve optimal electrical stimulation of the patient. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, these items are assembled to become a sealed stimulator head that is attached to the body of the stimulator (<b>747</b>). The disc (<b>743</b>) may screw into the stimulator head (<b>744</b>), it may be attached to the head with adhesive, or it may be attached by other methods that are known in the art. The chamber of the stimulator head-cup is filled with a conducting gel, fluid, or paste, and because the disc (<b>743</b>) and electrode (<b>745</b>) are tightly sealed against the stimulator head-cup (<b>744</b>), the conducting material within the stimulator head cannot leak out. In addition, this feature allows the user to easily clean the outer surface of the device (e.g., with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant), avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the interface comprises a fluid permeable material that allows for passage of current through the permeable portions of the material. In these embodiments, a conductive medium (such as a gel) is preferably situated between the electrode(s) and the permeable interface. The conductive medium provides a conductive pathway for electrons to pass through the permeable interface to the outer surface of the interface and to the patient's skin.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In other embodiments, the interface is made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant, such as material used to make capacitors. For example, it may be Mylar having a submicron thickness (preferably in the range about <b>0</b>.<b>5</b> to about <b>1</b>.<b>5</b> microns) having a dielectric constant of about <b>3</b>. Because one side of Mylar is slick, and the other side is microscopically rough, two different configurations: one in which the slick side is oriented towards the patient's skin, and the other in which the rough side is so-oriented. Thus, at stimulation Fourier frequencies of several kilohertz or greater, the dielectric interface will capacitively couple the signal through itself, because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin. Thus, the dielectric interface will isolate the stimulator's electrode from the tissue, yet allow current to pass. In one embodiment, non-invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is accomplished essentially substantially capacitively, which reduces the amount of ohmic stimulation, thereby reducing the sensation the patient feels on the tissue surface. This would correspond to a situation, for example, in which at least <b>30</b>%, preferably at least <b>50</b>%, of the energy stimulating the nerve comes from capacitive coupling through the stimulator interface, rather than from ohmic coupling. In other words, a substantial portion (e.g., <b>50</b>%) of the voltage drop is across the dielectric interface, while the remaining portion is through the tissue.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In certain exemplary embodiments, the interface and/or its underlying mechanical support comprise materials that will also provide a substantial or complete seal of the interior of the device. This inhibits any leakage of conducting material, such as gel, from the interior of the device and also inhibits any fluids from entering the device. In addition, this feature allows the user to easily clean the surface of the dielectric material (e.g., with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant), avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device. One such material is a thin sheet of Mylar, supported by a stainless steel disc, as described above.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The selection of the material for the dielectric constant involves at least two important variables: (1) the thickness of the interface; and (2) the dielectric constant of the material. The thinner the interface and/or the higher the dielectric constant of the material, the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric interface (and thus the lower the driving voltage required). For example, with Mylar, the thickness could be about 0.5 to about 5 microns (preferably about 1 micron) with a dielectric constant of about <b>3</b>. For a piezoelectric material like barium titanate or PZT (lead zirconate titanate), the thickness could be about 100-400 microns (preferably about 200 microns or 0.2 mm) because the dielectric constant is &#x3e;1000.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Another embodiment of the electrode-based stimulator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient's skin. In this embodiment, the interface (<b>351</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) is the conducting material itself. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> provides a bottom view of the stimulator <b>50</b>, after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> show a mesh <b>51</b> with openings that permit a conducting gel to pass from inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient's skin at the position of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus, the mesh with openings <b>51</b> is the part of the stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient, through which conducting material may be dispensed. In any given stimulator, the distance between the two mesh openings <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is constant, but it is understood that different stimulators may be built with different inter-mesh distances, in order to accommodate the anatomy and physiology of individual patients. Alternatively, the inter-mesh distance may be made variable as in the eyepieces of a pair of binoculars. A covering cap (not shown) is also provided to fit snugly over the top of the stimulator housing and the mesh openings <b>51</b>, in order to keep the housing's conducting medium from leaking or drying when the device is not in use.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">FIGD. <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D show the bottom of the self-contained stimulator <b>50</b>. An on/off switch <b>52</b> is attached through a port <b>54</b>, and a power-level controller <b>53</b> is attached through another port <b>54</b>. The switch is connected to a battery power source (<b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and the power-level controller is attached to the control unit (<b>330</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the device. The power source battery and power-level controller, as well as the impulse generator (<b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are located (but not shown) in the rear compartment <b>55</b> of the housing of the stimulator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Individual wires (not shown) connect the impulse generator <b>310</b> to the stimulator's electrodes <b>56</b>. The two electrodes <b>56</b> are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment <b>57</b> and rear compartment <b>55</b> of the stimulator <b>50</b>. A partition <b>58</b> separates each of the two head compartments <b>57</b> from one another and from the single rear compartment <b>55</b>. Each partition <b>58</b> also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However, each electrode <b>56</b> may be removed to add electrically conducting gel <b>350</b> to each head compartment <b>57</b>. An optional non-conducting variable-aperture iris diaphragm may be placed in front of each of the electrodes within the head compartment <b>57</b>, in order to vary the effective surface area of each of the electrodes. Each partition <b>58</b> may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures <b>51</b>. The position of each partition <b>58</b> therefore determines the distance <b>59</b> between its electrode <b>56</b> and mesh openings <b>51</b>, which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings <b>51</b>. The outside housing of the stimulator <b>50</b>, as well as each head compartment <b>57</b> housing and its partition <b>58</b>, are made of electrically insulating material, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another. Although the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is shown to be a non-capacitive stimulator, it is understood that it may be converted into a capacitive stimulator by replacing the mesh openings <b>51</b> with a dielectric material, such as a sheet of Mylar, or by covering the mesh openings <b>51</b> with a sheet of such dielectric material.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In preferred embodiments of the electrode-based stimulator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, electrodes are made of a metal, such as stainless steel, platinum, or a platinum-iridium alloy.

As another example, there may be more than two electrodes; the electrodes may comprise multiple concentric rings; and the electrodes may be disc-shaped or have a non-planar geometry. They may be made of other metals or resistive materials such as silicon-rubber impregnated with carbon that have different conductive properties [Stuart F. COGAN.

Portable stimulators are also known in the art, for example, patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,171,266, entitled Electro-acupuncture device with stimulation electrode assembly, to Gruzdowich. One of the novelties of the designs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> is that the stimulator, along with a correspondingly suitable stimulation waveform, shapes the electric field, producing a selective physiological response by stimulating that nerve, but avoiding substantial stimulation of nerves and tissue other than the target nerve, particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain. The shaping of the electric field is described in terms of the corresponding field equations in commonly assigned application US20210230938 (application Ser. No. 13/075746) entitled Devices and methods for non-invasive electrical stimulation and their use for vagal nerve stimulation on the neck of a patient, to SIMON et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, a mesh <b>531</b> has openings that permit a conducting gel within <b>351</b> to pass from the inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient's skin at the location of nerve or tissue stimulation.

As shown, the stimulator comprises a smartphone (<b>31</b>) with its back cover removed and and joined to a housing (<b>32</b>) that comprises a pair of electrode surfaces (<b>33</b>) along with circuitry to control and power the electrodes and interconnect with the smartphone. The electrode surface (<b>33</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> corresponds to item <b>351</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows the side of the smartphone (<b>31</b>) with a touch-screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows the housing of the stimulator (<b>32</b>) joined to the back of the smartphone. Portions of the housing lie flush with the back of the smartphone, with windows to accommodate smartphone components that are found on the original back of the smartphone. Such components may also be used with the stimulator, e.g., the smartphone's rear camera (<b>34</b>), flash (<b>35</b>) and speaker (<b>36</b>). Other original components of the smartphone may also be used, such as the audio headset jack socket (<b>37</b>) and multi-purpose jack (<b>38</b>). Note that the original components of the smartphone shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> correspond to a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, and their locations may be different for embodiments that use different smartphone models by different smartphone manufacturers. Note that tablets can be used as well.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows that several portions of the housing (<b>32</b>) protrude towards the back. The two electrode surfaces (<b>33</b>) protrude so that they may be applied to the skin of the patient. The stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames or collars, or the stimulator may be held against the patient's body by hand. In some embodiments, the neurostimulator may comprise a single such electrode surface or more than two electrode surfaces.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">A dome (<b>39</b>) also protrudes from the housing, so as to allow the device to lie more or less flat on a table when supported also by the electrode surfaces. The dome also accommodates a relatively tall component that may lie underneath it, such as a battery. Alternatively, the stimuluation device may be powered by the smartphone's battery. If the battery under the dome is rechargeable, the dome may contain a socket (<b>41</b>) through which the battery is recharged using a jack that is inserted into it, which is, for example, attached to a power cable from a base station (described below). The belly (<b>40</b>) of the housing protrudes to a lesser extent than the electrodes and dome. The belly accommodates a printed circuit board that contains electronic components within the housing (not shown), as described below.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Electronics And Software Of The Stimulator</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In some embodiments, the signal waveform (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that is to be applied to electrodes of the stimulator is initially generated in a component of the impulse generator <b>310</b> that is exterior to, and remote from, the mobile phone housing. The mobile phone preferably includes a software application that can be downloaded (e.g., mobile app store, USB cable, memory stick, Bluetooth connection) into the phone to receive, from the external control component, a wirelessly transmitted waveform, or to receive a waveform that is transmitted by cable, e.g., via the multi-purpose jack <b>38</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. If the waveforms are transmitted in compressed form, they are preferably compressed in a lossless manner, e.g., making use of FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). Alternatively, the downloaded software application may itself be coded to generate a particular waveform that is to be applied to the electrodes (<b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) and subsequently conveyed to the external interface of the electrode assembly (<b>351</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C and <b>33</b></figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the software application is not downloaded from outside the device, but is instead available internally, for example, within read-only-memory that is present within the housing of the stimulator (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments, the waveform is first conveyed by the software application to contacts within the phone's speaker output or the earphone jack socket (<b>37</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), as though the waveform signal were a generic audio waveform. That pseudo-audio waveform will generally be a stereo waveform, representing signals that are to be applied to the &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; electrodes. The waveform will then be conveyed to the housing of the stimulator (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>), as follows. The housing of the stimulator may have an attached dangling audio jack that is plugged into the speaker output or the earphone jack socket <b>37</b> whenever electrical stimulation is to be performed, or the electrical connection between the contacts of the speaker output or the earphone jack socket and the housing of the stimulator may be hard-wired. In either case, electrical circuits on a printed circuit board located under the belly of the housing (<b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) of the stimulator may then shape, filter, and/or amplify the pseudo-audio signal that is received via the speaker output or earphone jack socket. A power amplifier within the housing of the stimulator may then drive the signal onto the electrodes, in a fashion that is analogous to the use of an audio power amplifier to drive loudspeakers. Alternatively, the signal processing and amplification may be implemented in a separate device that can be plugged into sockets on the phone and/or housing of the stimulator (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>), to couple the software application and the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition to passing the stimulation waveform from the smartphone to the stimulator housing as described herein, the smartphone may also pass control signals to the stimulator housing. Thus, the stimulation waveform may generally be regarded as a type of analog, pseudo-audio signal, but if the signal contains a signature series of pulses signifying that a digital control signal is about to be sent, logic circuitry in the stimulator housing may then be set to decode the series of digital pulses that follows the signature series of pulses, analogous to the operation of a modem.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Many of the steps that direct the waveform to the electrodes, including steps that may be controlled by the user via the touchscreen (<b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), are implemented in the above-mentioned software application. By way of example, the software application may be written for a phone that uses the Android operating system. Such applications are typically developed in the Java programming language using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), in an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Eclipse [Mike WOLFSON.

Preferably, the switch will automatically disable some, many, most, or all smartphone functions when the stimulator is enabled (and vice versa). This ensures that the medical device functionality of the smartphone is completely segregated from the rest of the phone's functionality. In some embodiments, the switch will be password-controlled such that only the patient/owner of the stimulator/phone will be able to enable the stimulator functionality. In one such embodiment, the switch will be controlled by a biometric scan (e.g., fingerprint, optical scan or the like) such that the stimulator functionality can only be used by the patient. This ensures that only the patient will be able to use the prescribed therapy in the event the phone is lost or stolen.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The stimulator and/or phone can also include software that allows the patient to order more therapy doses over the internet (discussed in more detail below in connection with the docking station). The purchase of such therapy doses will require physician authorization through a prescription or the like. To that end, the software can include an authorization code for entry in order for the patient to download authorization for more therapies. In some embodiments, without such authorization, the stimulator will be disabled and will not deliver therapy.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Although the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an adapted commercially available smartphone, it is understood that in some embodiments, the housing of the stimulator may also be joined to and/or powered by a wireless device that is not a phone (e.g., Wi-Fi enabled device, wearable, tablet). Alternatively, the stimulator may be coupled to a phone or other Wi-Fi enabled device through a wireless connection for exchanging data at short distances, such as Bluetooth or the like. In this embodiment, the stimulator housing is not attached to the smartphone and, therefore, may comprise a variety of other shapes and sizes that are convenient for the patient to carry in his or her purse, wallet or pocket.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In some embodiments, the stimulator housing may be designed as part of a protective or decorative case for the phone that can be attached to the phone, similar to standard phone cases. In one such embodiment, the stimulator/case may also include additional battery life for the phone and may include an electrical connection to the phone's battery to recharge the battery (e.g., part of a Mophie&#xae; or the like). This electrical connection may also be used to couple the smartphone to the stimulator.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Embodiments With Distributed Controllers</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments, significant portions of the control of the vagus nerve stimulation reside in controller components that are physically separate from the housing of the stimulator. In these embodiment, separate components of the controller and stimulator housing generally communicate with one another wirelessly, although wired or waveguide communication is possible. Thus, the use of wireless technology avoids the inconvenience and distance limitations of interconnecting cables. Additional reasons in the present disclosure for physically separating many components of the controller from the stimulator housing are as follows.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">First, the stimulator may be constructed with the minimum number of components needed to generate the stimulation pulses, with the remaining components placed in parts of the controller that reside outside the stimulator housing, resulting in a lighter and smaller stimulator housing. In fact, the stimulator housing may be made so small that it could be difficult to place, on the stimulator housing's exterior, switches and knobs that are large enough to be operated easily. Instead, for the present disclosure, the user may generally operate the device using the smartphone touchscreen.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Second, the controller <b>330</b> may be given additional functions when free from the limitation of being situated within or near the stimulator housing. For example, one may add to the controller a data logging component that records when and how stimulation has been applied to the patient, for purposes of medical recordkeeping and billing. The complete electronic medical record database for the patient may be located far from the stimulator (e.g., somewhere on the internet), and the billing system for the stimulation services that are provided may also be elsewhere, so it would be useful to integrate the controller into that recordkeeping and billing system, using a communication system that includes access to the internet or telephone networks.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Third, communication from the databases to the controller would also be useful for purposes of metering electrical stimulation of the patient, when the stimulation is self-administered. For example, if the prescription for the patient only permits only a specified amount of stimulation energy to be delivered during a single session of vagus nerve stimulation, followed by a wait-time before allowing the next stimulation, the controller can query the database and then permit the stimulation only when the prescribed wait-time has passed. Similarly, the controller can query the billing system to assure that the patient's account is in order, and withhold the stimulation if there is a problem with the account.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Fourth, as a corollary of the previous considerations, the controller may be constructed to include a computer program separate from the stimulating device, in which the databases are accessed via cell phone or internet connections.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Fifth, in some applications, it may be desired that the stimulator housing and parts of the controller be physically separate. For example, when the patient is a child, one wants to make it impossible for the child to control or adjust the vagus nerve stimulation. The best arrangement in that case is for the stimulator housing to have no touchscreen elements, control switches or adjustment knobs that could be activated by the child. Alternatively, any touchscreen elements, switches and knobs on the stimulator can be disabled, and control of the stimulation then resides only in a remote controller with a child-proof operation, which would be maintained under the control of a parent or healthcare provider.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Sixth, in some applications, the particular control signal that is transmitted to the stimulator by the controller will depend on physiological and environmental signals that are themselves transmitted to and analyzed by the controller. In such applications, many of the physiological and environmental signals may already be transmitted wirelessly, in which case it is most convenient to design an external part of the controller as the hub of all such wireless activity, including any wireless signals that are sent to and from the stimulator housing.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">With these considerations in mind, an embodiment of can include a base station <b>332</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) that may send/receive data to/from the stimulator, and may send/receive data to/from databases and other components of the system, including those that are accessible via the internet (or another network such as local area, wide area, satellite, cellular). Typically, the base station will be a laptop computer attached to additional components needed for it to accomplish its function. Thus, prior to any particular stimulation session, the base station may load into the stimulator parameters of the session, including waveform parameters, or the actual waveform.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In some embodiments, the base station is also used to limit the amount of stimulation energy that may be consumed by the patient during the session, by charging the stimulator's rechargable battery with only a specified amount of releasable electrical energy, which is different than setting a parameter to restrict the duration of a stimulation session. Thus, the base station may comprise a power supply that may be connected to the stimulator's rechargable battery, and the base station meters the recharge. As a practical matter, the stimulator may therefore use two batteries, one for applying stimulation energy to the electrodes (the charge of which may be limited by the base station) and the other for performing other functions. Methods for evaluating a battery's charge or releasable energy can be as disclosed in patent US<b>7751891</b>, entitled Power supply monitoring for an implantable device, to ARMSTRONG et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein. Alternatively, some control components within the stimulator housing may monitor the amount of electrode stimulation energy that has been consumed during a stimulation session and stop the stimulation session when a limit has been reached, irrespective of the time when the limit has been reached.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The communication connections between different components of the stimulator's controller are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which is an expanded representation of the control unit <b>330</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Instead, in the present disclosure, the communication between devices preferably makes use of radio communication within unlicensed ISM frequency bands (260-470 MHz, 902-928 MHz, 2400-2.4835 GHz). Components of the radio frequency system in devices in <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>333</b> typically comprise a system-on-chip transciever with an integrated microcontroller; a crystal; associated balun &#x26; matching circuitry, and an antenna [Dag GRINI.

Furthermore, a 2.4 GHz wireless standard (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee) may be used as the protocol for transmission between devices. Although the ZigBee wireless standard operates at 2.4 GHz in most jurisdictions worldwide, it also operates in the ISM frequencies 868 MHz in Europe, and 915 MHz in the USA and Australia. Data transmission rates vary from 20 to 250 kilobits/second with that standard. Because many commercially available health-related sensors may operate using ZigBee, its use may be recommended for applications in which the controller uses feedback and feedforward methods to adjust the patient's vagus nerve stimulation based on the sensors' values, as described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> [ZigBee Wireless Sensor Applications for Health, Wellness and Fitness. ZigBee Alliance 2400 Camino Ramon Suite 375 San Ramon, Calif. 94583].</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">A 2.4 GHz radio has higher power consumption than radios operating at lower frequencies, due to reduced circuit efficiencies. Furthermore, the 2.4 GHz spectrum is crowded and subject to significant interference from microwave ovens, cordless phones, 802.11b/g wireless local area networks, Bluetooth devices, etc. Sub-GHz radios enable lower power consumption and can operate for years on a single battery. These factors, combined with lower system cost, make sub-GHz transceivers ideal for low data rate applications that need maximum range and multi-year operating life.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The antenna length needed for operating at different frequencies is 17.3 cm at 433 MHz, 8.2 cm at 915 MHz, and 3 cm at 2.4 GHz. Therefore, unless the antenna is included in a neck collar that supports the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the antenna length may be a disadvantage for 433 MHz transmission. The 2.4 GHz band has the advantage of enabling one device to serve in all major markets worldwide since the 2.4 GHz band is a global spectrum standard. However, 433 MHz is a viable alternative to 2.4 GHz for most of the world, and designs based on 868 and 915 MHz radios can serve the US and European markets with a single product.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Range is determined by the sensitivity of the transceiver and its output power. A primary factor affecting radio sensitivity is the data rate. Higher data rates reduce sensitivity, leading to a need for higher output power to achieve sufficient range. For many applications that require only a low data rate, the preferred rate is 40 Kbps where the transceiver can still use a standard off-the-shelf 20 parts per million crystal.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">A signal waveform that might be transmitted wirelessly to the stimulator housing was shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>. As seen there, individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of tau, and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal (the inter-burst period). The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter-burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example, the sinusoidal period tau may be 200 microseconds; the number of pulses per burst may be N=5; and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter-burst period may have a period of T=40000 microseconds, which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation (a much smaller value of T is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> to make the bursts discernable). When these exemplary values are used for T and tau, the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies (1/200 microseconds=5000/sec). Such a signal may be easily transmitted using 40 Kbps radio transmission. Compression of the signal is also possible, by transmitting only the signal parameters tau, N, T, Emax, etc., but in that case the stimulator housing's control electronics would then have to construct the waveform from the transmitted parameters, which would add to the complexity of components of the stimulator housing.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">However, because it is contemplated that sensors attached to the stimulator housing may also be transmitting information, the data transfer requirements may be substantially greater than what is required only to transmit the signal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Therefore, the present disclosure may make use of any frequency band, not limited to the ISM frequency bands, as well as techniques known in the art to suppress or avoid noise and interferences in radio transmission, such as frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Applications Of Stimulators To The Patient</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices, including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient's neck. At that location, the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath, near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retropharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart, but depending on the application, the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Of course, it will be recognized that the vagus nerve may be stimulated through other mechanisms. For example, auricular vagal nerve stimulation involves stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, often termed the Alderman's nerve or Arnold's nerve. This nerve may be stimulated through the transcutaneous systems and methods described herein by transmitting electrical impulses through the outer skin surface of the patient's ear to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery, the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically, the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient (and therefore the location of the vagus nerve) will be ascertained in any manner known in the art, e.g., by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve, a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein, unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case, the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve, missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly, a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non-invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point, at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra shows an embodiment of a location of a stimulation as &#x201c;Vagus Nerve Stimulation,&#x201d; relative to its connections with other anatomical structures that are potentially affected by the stimulation. In some embodiments, various brain and brainstem structures are modulated by the stimulation. These structures are described in sections of the disclosure that follow, along with some rationale for modulating their activity as a prevention, prophylaxis, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, or treatment of various medical conditions, diseases or disorders.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates use of the device <b>50</b> to stimulate the vagus nerve at that location in the neck, in which the stimulator device <b>50</b> is shown to be applied to the target location on the patient's neck as described herein. For reference, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the locations of the following vertebrae: first cervical vertebra <b>71</b>, the fifth cervical vertebra <b>75</b>, the sixth cervical vertebra <b>76</b>, and the seventh cervical vertebra <b>77</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the stimulator <b>30</b> applied to the neck of a child, which is partially immobilized with a foam cervical collar <b>78</b> that is similar to ones used for neck injuries and neck pain.

In such applications, the stimulator may be turned on and off remotely, using a wireless controller that may be used to adjust the stimulation parameters of the controller (e.g., on/off, stimulation amplitude, frequency, etc.).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> provides a more detailed view of use of the electrical stimulator <b>30</b>, when positioned to stimulate the vagus nerve at the neck location. The anatomy shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-section of half of the neck at vertebra level C<b>6</b>. The vagus nerve <b>60</b> is identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, along with the carotid sheath <b>61</b> that is identified there in bold peripheral outline. The carotid sheath encloses not only the vagus nerve, but also the internal jugular vein <b>62</b> and the common carotid artery <b>63</b>. Structures that may be identified near the surface of the neck include the external jugular vein <b>64</b> and the sternocleidomastoid muscle <b>65</b>, which protrudes when the patient turns his or her head. Additional organs in the vicinity of the vagus nerve include the trachea <b>66</b>, thyroid gland <b>67</b>, esophagus <b>68</b>, scalenus anterior muscle <b>69</b>, scalenus medius muscle <b>70</b>, levator scapulae muscle <b>71</b>, splenius colli muscle <b>72</b>, semispinalis capitis muscle <b>73</b>, semispinalis colli muscle <b>74</b>, longus colli muscle and longus capitis muscle <b>75</b>. The sixth cervical vertebra <b>76</b> is shown with bony structure indicated by hatching marks. Additional structures shown in the figure are the phrenic nerve <b>77</b>, sympathetic ganglion <b>78</b>, brachial plexus <b>79</b>, vertebral artery and vein <b>80</b>, prevertebral fascia <b>81</b>, platysma muscle <b>82</b>, omohyoid muscle <b>83</b>, anterior jugular vein <b>84</b>, sternohyoid muscle <b>85</b>, sternothyroid muscle <b>86</b>, and skin with associated fat <b>87</b>.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Stimulation may be performed on the left or right vagus nerve or on both of them simultaneously and alternately. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually, first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased, but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps, harnesses, or frames may be used to maintain the stimulator in position. The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient, i.e., stimulation parameters for each patient are adjusted on an individualized basis. Ordinarily, the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient, and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">The stimulation is then performed with a sinusoidal burst waveform like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As seen there, individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of T, and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal (the inter-burst period). The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter-burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example, the sinusoidal period T may be between about 50-1000 microseconds and a frequency of about 1-20 kHz, preferably between about 100-400 microseconds and a frequency of about 2.5-10 kHz, more preferably about 133-400 microseconds and a frequency of about 2.5-7.5 kHz and even more preferably about 200 microseconds and a frequency of about <b>5</b> kHz; the number of pulses per burst may be N=1-20, preferably about 2-10 and more preferably about 5; and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter-burst period may have a period T comparable to about 5-100 Hz, preferably about 15-50 Hz, more preferably about 25-35 Hz and even more preferably about 25Hz (a much smaller value of T is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> to make the bursts discernable). When these example values are used for T and T, the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies (1/200 microseconds=5000/sec), as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">When a patient is using the stimulation device to perform self-stimulation therapy, e.g., at home or at a workplace, he or she will follow the steps that are now described. It is assumed that the optimal stimulation position has already been marked on the patient's neck, as described above and that a reference image of the fluorescent spots has already been acquired. The previous stimulation session will ordinarily have discharged the rechargeable batteries of the stimulator housing, and between sessions, the base station will have been used to recharge the stimulator at most only up to a minimum level. If the stimulator's batteries had charge remaining from the previous stimulation session, the base station will discharge the stimulator to a minimum level that will not support stimulation of the patient.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The patient can initiate the stimulation session using the mobile phone or base station (e.g., laptop computer) by invoking a computer program (on the laptop computer or through an app on the mobile phone) that is designed to initiate use of the stimulator. The programs in the smartphone and base station may initiate and interact with one another wirelessly, so in what follows, reference to the program (app) in the smartphone may also apply to the program in the base station, because both may be operating in tandem. For security reasons, the program would begin with the request for a user name and a password, and that user's demographic information and any data from previous stimulator experiences would already be associated with it in the login account. The smartphone may also be used to authenticate the patient using a fingerprint or voice recognition app, or other reliable authentication methods. If the patient's physician has not authorized further treatments, the base station will not charge the stimulator's batteries, and instead, the computer program will call or otherwise communicate with the physician's computer requesting authorization. After authorization by the physician is received, the computer program (on the laptop computer or through an app on the mobile phone) may also query a database that is ordinarily located somewhere on the internet to verify that the patient's account is in order. If it is not in order, the program may then request prepayment for one or more stimulation sessions, which would be paid by the patient using a credit card, debit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency, bitcoin, or the like. The computer program will also query its internal database or that of the base station to determine that sufficient time has elapsed between when the stimulator was last used and the present time, to verify that any required wait-time has elapsed.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Having received authorization to perform a nerve stimulation session, the patient interface computer program will then ask the patient questions that are relevant to the selection of parameters that the base station will use to make the stimulator ready for the stimulation session. The questions that the computer program asks are dependent on the condition for which the patient is being treated, which for present purposes is considered to be treatment for an autoimmune disease or disorder. The questions may be things like (1) is this an acute or prophylactic treatment? (2) if acute, then how severe is your pain and in what locations, how long have you had it, (3) has anything unusual or noteworthy occurred since the last stimulation? etc.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Having received such preliminary information from the patient, the computer programs will perform instrument diagnostic tests and make the stimulator ready for the stimulation session. In general, the algorithm for setting the stimulator parameters will have been decided by the physician and will include the extent to which the stimulator batteries should be charged, which the vagus nerve should be stimulated (right or left), and the time that the patient should wait after the stimulation session is ended until initiation of a subsequent stimulation session. The computer will query the physician's computer to ascertain whether there have been any updates to the algorithm, and if not, will use the existing algorithm. The patient will also be advised of the stimulation session parameter values by the interface computer program, so as to know what to expect.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">Once the base station has been used to charge the stimulator's batteries to the requisite charge, the computer program (or smartphone app) will indicate to the patient that the stimulator is ready for use. At that point, the patient would clean the electrode surfaces, and make any other preliminary adjustments to the hardware. The stimulation parameters for the session will be displayed, and any options that the patient is allowed to select may be made. Once the patient is ready to begin, he or she will press a &#x201c;start&#x201d; button on the touchscreen and may begin the vagus nerve stimulation.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Multiple methods may be used to test whether the patient is properly attempting to stimulate the vagus nerve (or another nerve or organ or muscle or bone) on the intended side of the neck (or another portion of a human body). For example, accelerometers and gyroscopes within the smartphone may be used to determine the position and orientation of the smartphone's touch screen relative to the patient's expected view of the screen, and a decision by the stimulator's computer program as to which hand is being used to hold the stimulator may be made by measuring capacitance on the outside of the stimulator body, which may distinguish fingers wrapped around the device versus the ball of a thumb [Raphael WIMMER and Sebastian Boring. HandSense: discriminating different ways of grasping and holding a tangible user interface. Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Tangible and Embedded Interaction, pp. 359-362. ACM New York, N.Y., 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. Pressing of the electrodes against the skin will result in a resistance drop across the electrodes, which can initiate operation of the rear camera. A fluorescent image should appear on the smartphone screen only if the device is applied to the side of the neck in the vicinity of the fluorescent spots that had been applied as a tattoo earlier. If the totality of these data indicates to the computer program that the patient is attempting to stimulate the wrong vagus nerve or that the device is being held improperly, the stimulation will be withheld, and the stimulator may then communicate with the patient via the interface computer program (in the mobile phone or laptop computer) to alert the patient of that fact. The program may then offer suggestions on how to better apply the device to the neck.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">However, if the stimulator is being properly applied, and an image of the fluorescent spots on the patient's neck appears on the screen of the phone, the stimulator begins to stimulate according to predetermined initial stimulus parameters. The patient will then adjust the position and angular orientation of the stimulator about what he or she thinks is the correct neck position, until he or she perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. An attempt is also made to superimpose the currently viewed fluorescence image of the neck spots with the previously acquired reference image. The applied current is increased gradually using keys on the keyboard of the base station or on the smartphone touchscreen, first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The stimulation amplitude is then increased by the patient, but is set to a level that is less than one at which he first senses any discomfort. By trial and error, the stimulation is then optimized by the patient, who tries to find the greatest acceptable sensation with the lowest acceptable stimulation amplitude, with the stimulator aligned using the fluorescent spots. If the stimulator is being held in place by hand, it is likely that there may be inadvertent fluctuating movement of the stimulator, due for example to neck movement during respiration. Such relative movements will affect the effectiveness of the stimulation. However, they may be monitored by accelerometers and gyroscopes within the smartphone, which may be transmitted as movement data from the stimulator to the patient interface computer program (in the mobile phone or laptop computer). The relative movements may also be monitored and measured as fluctuations in the position of the fluorescence spots that are being imaged. By watching a graphical display of the relative movements shown by the patient interface computer program, the patient may use that display in an attempt to deliberately minimize the movements. Otherwise, the patient may attempt to adjust the amplitude of the stimulator as compensation for movement of the stimulator away from its optimum position. In a section that follows, it is described how the stimulator itself may modulate the amplitude of the stimulation in order to make such compensations.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">During the session, the patient may lift the stimulator from his neck, which will be detected as an increase in resistance between the electrodes and a loss of the fluorescent image of the spots on the patient's neck. When that occurs, the device will withhold power to the stimulator for reasons of safety. The patient can then reapply the stimulator to his neck to resume the session, although the interruption of stimulation will be recognized and recorded by the computer program. Stimulation by the patient will then continue until the battery of the stimulator is depleted, or the patient decides to terminate the stimulation session. At that point, the patient will acknowledge that the stimulation session is finished by touching a response button on the smartphone screen, whereupon the stimulator will transfer to the base station data that its microprocessor has caused to be stored regarding the stimulation session (e.g., stimulation amplitude as a function of time and information about movements of the device during the session, duration of the stimulation, the existence of interruptions, etc.). Such information will then be transmitted to and displayed by the patient interface computer program (in the mobile phone or laptop computer), which will subsequently ask the patient questions regarding the effectiveness of the stimulation. Such questions may be in regard to the post-stimulation severity of the headache, whether the severity decreased gradually or abruptly during the course of the stimulation, and whether anything unusual or noteworthy occurred during the stimulation. Some, most, many, or all of such post-stimulation data will also be delivered over the internet by the patient interface computer program to the physician's computer for review and possible adjustment of the algorithm that is used to select stimulation parameters and regimens. It is understood that the physician will adjust the algorithm based not only on the experience of each individual patient, but on the experience of all patients collectively so as to improve effectiveness of the stimulator's use, for example, by identifying characteristics of most and least responsive patients.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Before logging off of the interface computer program, the patient may also review database records and summaries about all previous treatment sessions, so as to make his or her own judgment about treatment progress. If the stimulation was part of a prophylactic treatment regimen that was prescribed by the patient's physician, the patient interface computer program will remind the patient about the schedule for the upcoming self-treatment sessions and allow for a rescheduling if necessary.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">For some patients, the stimulation may be performed for as little as 90 seconds, but it may also be for up to 30 minutes or longer. The treatment is generally performed once or twice daily or several times a week, for 12 weeks or longer before a decision is made as to whether to continue the treatment. For patients experiencing intermittent symptoms, the treatment may be performed only when the patient is symptomatic. However, it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of patients. Different stimulation parameters may also be used as the course of the patient's condition changes.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In some embodiments, pairing of vagus nerve stimulation may be with an additional sensory stimulation. The paired sensory stimulation may be bright light, sound, tactile stimulation, or electrical stimulation of the tongue to simulate odor/taste, e.g., pulsating with the same frequency as the vagus nerve electrical stimulation. The rationale for paired sensory stimulation is the same as simultaneous, paired stimulation of both left and right vagus nerves, namely, that the pair of signals interacting with one another in the brain may result in the formation of larger and more coherent neural ensembles than the neural ensembles associated with the individual signals, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect. This pairing may be considered especially when some such corresponding sensory circuit of the brain is thought to be partly responsible for triggering the migraine headache.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In some embodiments, various methods can use vagal nerve stimulation to suppress inflammation. In some embodiments, some methods and devices involve the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or more specifically, stimulation of the vagus nerve to inhibit and/or block the release of such pro-inflammatory cytokines. In some embodiments, some methods and devices use vagal nerve stimulation to increase the concentration or effectiveness of anti-inflammatory cytokines. TRACEY et al do not consider the modulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines to be part of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that their method of vagal nerve stimulation is intended to activate. Thus, they explain that &#x201c;activation of vagus nerve cholinergic signaling inhibits TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and other proinflammatory cytokine overproduction through &#x2018;immune&#x2019; a7 nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanisms&#x201d; [V.

Biochemical Society Transactions 34, (2006, 6): 1037-1040, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokines are said to be part of a different &#x201c;diffusible anti-inflammatory network, which includes glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and other humoral mediators&#x201d; [CZURA C J, Tracey K J. Autonomic neural regulation of immunity. J Intern Med. 257(2005, 2): 156-66, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein].

However, anti-inflammatory cytokines are inducible as well as constitutive, so that for example, an increase in the concentrations of potentially anti-inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x3b2;) can in fact be accomplished through stimulation of the vagus nerve [RA BAUMGARTNER, V A Deramo and M A Beaven.

TGF-&#x3b2; converts undifferentiated T cells into regulatory T (Treg) cells that block the autoimmunity that causes demyelination in multiple sclerosis. However, in the presence of interleukin-6, TGF-&#x3b2; also causes the differentiation of T lymphocytes into proinflammatory IL-17 cytokine-producing T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which promote autoimmunity and inflammation. Thus, it is conceivable that an increase of TGF-&#x3b2; levels might actually cause or exacerbate inflammation, rather than suppress it. Accordingly, a step in an embodiment of the methods that are disclosed herein is to deter TGF-&#x3b2; from realizing its pro-inflammatory potential, by selecting nerve stimulation parameters that bias the potential of TGF-&#x3b2; towards anti-inflammation, and/or by treating the patient with an agent such as the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid that is known to promote such an anti-inflammatory bias [MUCIDA D, Park Y, Kim G, Turovskaya O, Scott I, Kronenberg M, Cheroutre H.

Retinoic acid is a member of a class of compounds known as retinoids, comprising three generations: (1) retinol, retinal, retinoic acid (tretinoin, Retin-A), isotretinoin and alitretinoin; (2) etretinate and acitretin; (3) tazarotene , bexarotene and Adapalene.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In some embodiments, endogenous retinoic acid that is released by neurons themselves is used to produce the anti-inflammatory bias. Thus, vagal nerve stimulation may induce differentiation through release of retinoic acid that is produced in neurons from retinaldehyde by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, and some embodiments disclosed herein can promote anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation by this type of mechanism [van de PAVERT S A, Olivier B J, Goverse G, Vondenhoff M F, Greuter M, Beke P, Kusser K, Hopken U E, Lipp M, Niederreither K, Blomhoff R, Sitnik K, Agace W W, Randall T D, de Jonge W J, Mebius R E.

Retinoic acid in the development, regeneration and maintenance of the nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8(2007), 755-765, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. However, if the proinflammatory cytokine that is blocked is TNF-alpha, its inhibition in multiple sclerosis patients might be counterproductive. This is because blocking TNF-alpha with the drug lenercept promotes and exacerbates multiple sclerosis attacks rather than delaying them, which might be attributable to the fact that TNF-alpha promotes remyelination and the proliferation of oligodendrocytes that perform the myelination.

The most important mechanism of RA activity is the regulation of gene expression. This is accomplished by its binding to nuclear retinoid receptors that are ligand-activated transcription factors. Thus, RA acts as a transcriptional activator for a large number of other, downstream regulatory molecules, including enzymes, transcription factors, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. Retinoic acid is an essential morphogen in vertebrate development and participates in tissue regeneration in the adult [Jorg MEY and Peter MdCaffery. Retinoic Acid Signaling in the Nervous System of Adult Vertebrates. The Neuroscientist 10(5, 2004): 409-421, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein]. RA also increases synaptic strength in a homeostatic response (synaptic scaling) to neuronal inactivity through a mechanism involving protein synthesis that requires the participation of TNF-alpha. RA is also intimately involved in the control of the rhythmic electrical activity of the brain. More generally, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and 13-cis retinoic acid are some of a very small number of entrainment factors that regulate the natural rhythmicity of metabolic processes in many types of individual cells [Mehdi Tafti, Norbert B.

Neurotrophic factors serve as growth factors for the development, maintenance, repair, and survival of specific neuronal populations, acting via retrograde signaling from target neurons by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Other neurotrophic factors also promote the survival of neurons during neurodegeneration. These include members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) superfamily, the glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, the neurokine superfamily, and non-neuronal growth factors such as the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) family. However, major problems in using such neurotrophic factors for therapy are their inability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, adverse effects resulting from binding to the receptor in other organs of the body and their low diffusion rate [Yossef S. Levy, Yossi Gilgun-Sherki, Eldad Melamed and Daniel Offen. Therapeutic Potential of Neurotrophic Factors in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

However, vagal nerve stimulation to increase levels of neurotrophic factors has not been reported in connection with neurodegenerative diseases. Because BDNF may be modulated by stimulating the vagus nerve, vagal nerve stimulation may likewise promote the expression of other neurotrophic factors in patients with neurodegenerative disease, thereby circumventing the problem of blood-brain barrier blockage [Follesa P, Biggio F, Gorini G, Caria S, Talani G, Dazzi L, Puligheddu M, Marrosu F, Biggio G.

However, because TGF-beta is ordinarily referred to simply as a cytokine, and because its anti-inflammatory competence is known to be influenced by retinoic acid, it was placed in a separate box to avoid undue confusion.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">The role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the regulation of the immune system has been long appreciated through the activity of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and through which corticosteroids (cortisol) and other naturally occurring immunosuppressive compounds are released (Rook, 1999). In parallel with this understanding, beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, it was observed that a splenectomy could provide relief from severe inflammatory conditions such as Rheumatoid arthritis (Bach, 1946). It was a natural extension of these two lines of thinking, therefore, to attempt to modulate the splenic nerve (an element of the SNS) and identify how the immune system was impacted. The effects of stimulating these neural inputs to the spleen began to be reported as early as the 1960s (Davies et al., 1968) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>132</b>.<b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Besedovsky et al. (1979) described the SNS as playing an important role in a feedback loop that coupled lymphoid organ activity to the CNS. In this model, the efferent arm of the SNS projects to immune system organs, releasing NE from sympathetic nerve terminals in these organs (Elenkov et al., 2000). The role of NE in modulating macrophages and other immune cells in an anti-inflammatory direction has been well established (Hu et al., 1991). Both endogenous, tonic expression, and volume transmission through extrasynaptic means, i.e., varicosities, have been proposed as a means for maintaining a baseline level of suppression over immune activity (Straub et al., 1998). With respect to the afferent arm of this feedback loop, it has been suggested that peripheral cytokine levels are able to modulate the CNS to alter sympathetic outflow. In fact, two separate groups reported, in 1989 and 1991, that infusion of IL-1! or IFN-&#x201d; into the ventricles of the brain causes rapid, significant reductions in peripheral and splenic immune cell activity (Sunder et al., 1989; Brown et al., 1991). To facilitate this activation within the CNS, afferent vagal fibers were proposed as a functional pathway for peripheral cytokine modulation of the CNS (Maier et al., 1998).</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Further evidence of VN involvement with splenic immune function came when Bernik et al. (2001) studied the significant peripheral, anti-inflammatory effects of semapimod (a compound formerly known as CNI-1493), which, at one point, was believed to inhibit inflammation through inhibition of p38 MAP kinase. Minute quantities of semapimod, were administered intracerebral- ventricular (ICV), just as IL-1# and IFN-$ had been used previously. However, unlike the prior thesis of sympathetic pathway involvement, Bernik et al. reversed the assumption of efferent signaling from sympathetic to the parasympathetic (vagus), when it was found that severing of the VN abolished the anti-inflammatory effects. Their conclusion was that semapimod was a potent activator of efferent, vagal outflow (Oke et al., 2007). Borovikova et al. (2000) had previously demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the distal remains of the severed VN, i.e., the efferent vagal component, was able to trigger anti-inflammatory effects, even in the absence of ICV administration of semapimod, IL-1#, or IFN-$ . (As will be discussed later, additional studies showed that electrical stimulation of the afferent arms, postvagotomy, were also able to affect the same immune modulation.)</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">A review of the available literature on this subject strongly suggests that there is broad, albeit not universal, agreement that stimulation of the VN (using appropriate stimulation, signal parameters) generates a splenic nerve-mediated, anti-inflammatory effect. Initial proposals to explain the pathway suggest a simple efferent model that is based solely on acetylcholine release (the primary neurotransmitter released by efferent vagal fibers), whereby direct release of acetylcholine and binding to receptors on macrophages suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines. The specific, efferent pathway was hypothesized to be through a binding of acetylcholine to the $ 7-nicotinic, acetylcholine receptor ($ 7nAChR), since the anti-inflammatory effect of efferent (postvagotomy) stimulation was lost in $ 7nAChR knockout animals (de Jonge et al., 2007).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In some embodiments, the systemic anti-inflammatory effects of VNS are believed to result from the activation of sympathetic fibers in the splenic nerve, through a connection at the celiac ganglion. These sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine into the spleen in close proximity to a specialized group of immune cells that release acetylcholine, or ACh. This release of ACh activates a receptor, the alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptor, or 7nAChR, on cytokine-releasing immune cells called macrophages. Activation of these receptors is believed to function by blocking transcription factors that promote inflammatory cytokine expression. Based on the role of ACh in activating this pathway, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> below, it has been termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, or CAP.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Stimulation of the vagus nerve to treat conditions associated with replicating pathogens, such as viruses within the coronavirus family</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Coronaviridae or coronavirus is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that have a lipid envelope studded with club-shaped projections. Coronaviruses infect birds and many mammals including humans and include the causative agents of MERS, SARS and COVID-19. COVID-19 has been particularly virulent and the cause of the recent pandemic around the world. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Most people (about <b>80</b>%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or compromised immune systems), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The most critically afflicted can experience pneumonia and/or ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). A hallmark of ARDS is a dramatic increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1 and IL-1&#x3b2;. This dramatic increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is referred to as a cytokine cascade or cytokine storm. Other cytokines, including chemokines, such as IL-8 or some T-cell derived cytokines, such as lymphotoxin-a are also involved in the cytokine cascade. It is believed that the mortality of ARDS is largely the result of this cytokine cascade caused by over activity of the patient's immune system.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In certain cases, young healthy individuals can also develop these severe conditions. The applicant believes that certain viruses can trigger a septic or anaphylactic reaction to one or more proteins on the virus. In particular, applicant believes that certain replicating pathogens, such as COVID-19 and similar viruses, contain a sensitizing and/or allergenic protein or other molecule that, in some patients, triggers an inflammatory or allergic response similar to that experienced by patients with sepsis and/or anaphylaxis. This may cause an otherwise healthy individual to succumb to the virus.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">In certain cases, patients infected with COVID-19 develop abnormal blood clotting. Early evidence suggests that these blood clots are caused by autoimmune antibodies generated by the immune system of the body in response to the infection. Blood clots can cause problems ranging from mild to life threatening. If a clot blocks flow in a vein or artery, the tissue normally nourished by that blood vessel can be deprived of oxygen and cells in that area can die. These blood clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impair oxygen exchange and cause life-threatening events, such as strokes.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Another challenge facing care providers with COVID-19 is that while most patients with COVID-19 eventually get better, some people experience post-COVID conditions, such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty thinking (&#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;), cough, chest or stomach pain, headache, heart palpitations, joint or muscle pain, diarrhea, sleep problems, fever, dizziness, rash, mood changes, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and others. These post-COVID conditions or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) are a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that can be experienced four to five weeks (sometimes 4 to 6 months) after first being infected with the virus that caused COVID-19 and after the virus has been eliminated from the patient's body. Even individuals who were asymptomatic during the acute phase of COVID-19 can develop post-COVID symptoms and may even account for greater than 30% of patients with PASC. The post-COVID conditions may also be known as long COVID, &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; COVID, post-acute COVID-19 or chronic COVID.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The causes of PASC in some patients are still largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that PASC may be caused by a residual virus sequestered in certain organs, chronic inflammation caused by an aberrant immune response to the virus, end organ damage from the acute phase and/or an autoimmune response induced by the virus. Chronic inflammation is a failure to return to a quiescent state and has been implicated in many serious medical conditions, such as neurological diseases, pulmonary diseases, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In some embodiments, methods are used for vagal nerve stimulation to suppress or inhibit inflammatory and/or allergenic responses to these replicating pathogens. The method stimulates the vagus nerve as described above, using the stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually, first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased, but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to influence the therapeutic result. For example, the power source may deliver an electrical impulse having bursts of pulses, as described above. Preferably, the pulses will have a duration of about 50-1000 microseconds and a frequency of about 1-KHz to about 20 kHz, preferably between about 100-400 microseconds and about 2.5-10 kHz, more preferably about 133-400 microseconds and about 2.5-7.5 kHz and even more preferably about 200 microseconds and about 5 kHz). The number of pulses per burst may be N=2-20, preferably about 2-10 and more preferably about 5.

In this embodiment, the treatment is performed repeatedly, e.g., multiple times per day until the allergic or immune response is reduced or eliminated. For example, the treatment paradigm may comprise 1 to 20 single or double dose stimulations per day, preferably about 2 to 5 double dose stimulations per day with 3 double doses considered optimal. A double dose stimulation refers to two consecutive single doses either on one side of the patient's neck or on both sides. Each single dose may last from about 30 seconds to about 3 minutes, with 90 seconds to 2 minutes considered optimal. However, parameters of the stimulation may be varied in order to obtain a beneficial response, as described above in the various treatment paradigms.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">The treatment may also be used for acute respiratory stress or shortness of breath associated with COVID-19. In this embodiment, the vagus nerve is stimulated with one double dose (i.e., two consecutive single dose stimulations of about <b>30</b> seconds to three minutes, optimally about 2 minutes). If respiratory distress or shortness of breath persists 20 minutes after the start of the first double dose treatment, a second double dose treatment may be administered.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The treatment may also be tailored for an individual patient by delivering an optimal number of doses to reduce or inhibit the inflammatory response without oversuppressing the immune system. In this embodiment, the treatment includes a feedback control mechanism for providing an optimal level of immune suppression. Patient biomarkers in the blood are measured before and after delivery of each single or double dose of electrical stimulation. Alternatively, the biomarkers may be measured at certain times during the day, or once per day or one or more times per week. These biomarkers may include CRP, D-Dimer, procalcitonin, interleukin 6 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-2, IL-6, II-8, IL-12, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IFN-&#x3b3;. Alternatively, the biomarkers may include anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and TGF-&#x3b2;. Low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines may also indicate an overactive immune system or cytokine storm.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Applicant has discovered that the electrical impulses of the present disclosure are sufficient to reduce a level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a blood of the patient. The electrical impulse is preferably sufficient to reduce the level of CRP in the blood by at least 10 mg/L, more preferably by at least 25 mg/L. In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is also sufficient to reduce a level of procalcitonin in a blood of the patient, preferably by at least 2 mcg/L and more preferably by at least 5 mcg/L. Procalcitonin is a substance produced by many types of cells in the body, often in response to bacterial or viral infections. The level of procalcitonin in the blood can increase significantly in systemic bacterial or viral infections and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">The relevant biomarkers provide an indication as to whether the immune system is overactive (i.e., activity levels higher than necessary to fight the pathogen and therefore potentially harmful to the patient, such as a cytokine cascade or storm) or if immune system is working properly to fight the pathogen without causing inadvertent harm to the patient. If these biomarkers indicate overactivity of the immune system after delivery of one or more doses of the electrical impulse, additional electrical impulses are delivered and the biomarkers are measured again. Once the biomarkers indicate that the immune system is no longer overactive, the electrical impulse delivery is halted. This ensures that the immune suppression is not oversuppressed, allowing it to continue to fight the pathogen.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to suppress inflammatory cytokine levels via activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). The CAP is believed to be the efferent vagus nerve-based arm of the inflammatory reflex, mediated through vagal efferent fibers that synapse onto enteric neurons, which release acetylcholine (Ach) at the synaptic junction with macrophages. Stimulation of the CAP leads to Ach binding to &#x3b1;-7-nicotinic ACh receptors (&#x3b1;7nAChR), resulting in reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1b, and IL-6, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. The systems and methods of the present disclosure decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and consequently mitigate the inflammatory response. These cytokines are believed to play a role in the acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms presenting in patients affected by COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">In other embodiments, the electrical impulse is sufficient to inhibit a release of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha and IL-1&#x3b2;. These cytokines are typically elevated in certain patients suffering from replicating pathogens, such as COVID 19, leading to ARDS. In other embodiments, the electrical impulse(s) is sufficient to increase the anti-inflammatory competence of certain cytokines to thereby offset or reduce the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulse is also sufficient to reduce the magnitude of constriction of smooth bronchial muscle, thereby improving the patient's breathing in situations involving shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation, such as ARDS caused by certain replicating pathogens (e.g., COVID 19). In one particular embodiment, the electrical impulse is sufficient to trigger an efferent sympathetic signal that stimulates the release of catecholamines (comprising beta-agonists, epinephrine and/or norepinephrine) from the adrenal glands and/or from nerve endings that are distributed throughout the body. In another embodiment, the method includes stimulating, inhibiting, blocking or otherwise modulating other nerves that release systemic bronchodilators or nerves that directly modulate parasympathetic ganglia transmission (by stimulation or inhibition of preganglionic to postganglionic transmissions).</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">In certain embodiments, the method further includes testing the patient for certain biomarkers that indicate that the patient's immune system is overactive. In one particular embodiment, the biomarker is CRP, D-Dimer, procalcitonin, interleukin 6 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to be a predictor of poor outcomes to certain replicating pathogens, such as coronavirus. In this embodiment, the method includes testing the patient for such biomarkers, determining if the patient is suffering from an overactive immune response to a replicating pathogen, and then emitting an electrical impulse to the patient's vagal nerve sufficient to reduce or inhibit the immune response. Levels and/or activities of CRP, D-Dimer, procalcitonin, ACh, interleukin-1 beta or IL-1&#x3b2; or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, in the patient's peripheral circulation and/or in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid can be measured, before, during and subsequent to each treatment. In addition, activities of the 7nAChR, receptor on cytokine-releasing immune cells or macrophages may also be measured.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">Applicant has also discovered that the electrical impulses of the present disclosure are sufficient to reduce a number of antibodies associated with blood clotting in the patient. The antibodies may include autoantibodies associated with blood clotting, such as phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Patients suffering from COVID-19 may have blood clotting abnormalities similar to those with an autoimrnune clotting condition, known as antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. These patients produce autoantibodies to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Higher aPI., antibody levels have been associated with more severe respiratory disease, lower kidney function, and immune system hyperactivity, including the release of inflammatory cell remnants called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils release NETs to contain infections, but the traps can promote excessive inflammation and clotting when not properly regulated.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In certain embodiments, the electrical impulses are sufficient to reduce a level of D-dimer in a blood of the patient. The level of D-dimer is preferably reduced by at least 200 mcg/mL and more preferably by at least 500 mcg/mL.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Applicant has also discovered that the chronic or prophylactic treatment regimens described above are particularly useful in treating patients exhibiting longer-term symptoms associated with a virus, such as &#x201c;long-haul&#x201d; or chronic COVID-19 patients. The symptoms may include post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty thinking (&#x201c;brain fog&#x201d;), cough, chest or stomach pain, headache, heart palpitations, joint or muscle pain, diarrhea, sleep problems, fever, dizziness, rash, mood changes, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and others. The post-COVID symptoms or conditions may also be known as long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19 or chronic COVID.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">These treatment paradigms may include application of the electrical impulse as a single dose from about 30 seconds to about 5 minutes, wherein the treatment paradigm further includes administering about 1 to 24 times per day, preferably for about 2 to about 5 single doses per day, for a plurality of days. In certain embodiments, the single doses may be applied for 1 to 3 months, or up to 6 months depending on the duration of the patient's symptoms.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p-0257" num="0256">Applicant conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study evaluating non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) using a device described herein in patients admitted to a hospital for treatment of Covid-19. This study was an investigator-initiated trial conducted at the Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia, Spain (the &#x201c;SAVIOR-1 study&#x201d;). The SAVIOR-1 study was submitted to the FDA, which had previously granted emergency use authorization for the use of the devices described herein for the acute treatment of asthma exacerbations in known or suspected Covid-19 patients.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">The SAVIOR-1 study enrolled 210 patients over 18 years of age. A total of 97 patients (47 treatment subjects and 50 control subjects) provided baseline demographic and medical history data. The inclusion criteria included, among other things, patients that had been tested positive or suspected/presumed for COVID-19, patients with cough, shortness of breath or respiratory compromise (RR greater than 24/min, increased work of breathing), and patients with O2 saturation less than or equal to 96% on room air or sensation. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of nVNS in addition to the current standard of care in patients hospitalized with active SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study also assessed the incidence of relevant clinical events and changes in blood chemistry between the group treated with nVNS in addition to the standard of care at the time of admission, compared with standard of care alone.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to receive either the routine standard of care (SoC) alone or treatment with nVNS in addition to the SoC. In the active treatment group, nVNS was administered using one of the devices described herein that delivered a burst of pulse signal having five pulses with a frequency of about 5,000 Hz and bursts with a frequency of about 20 Hz. The hospital staff applied a conductive gel to the electrodes and applied nVNS to the region of the neck skin where the vagus nerve is located (i.e., between the trachea and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the palpable carotid pulse).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">For prophylactic treatment, subject or hospital personnel administered 2 consecutive 2-minute doses of nVNS (1 on each side of the neck) 3 times daily (morning, midday and evening). Subjects who experienced acute respiratory failure or dyspnea could also administer additional stimulations as acute treatment. Acute treatment consisted of 2 consecutive 2-minute doses (1 on each side of the neck) delivered at the onset of symptoms and repeated every 20 minutes while symptoms persisted, for a maximum of 6 stimulation sessions (twelve 2-minute doses).</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">Subject demographics, baseline characteristics, and medical history were summarized for the sample as a whole and by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Treatment groups were compared using chi-square or Fisher exact tests (as appropriate) for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Change from baseline in in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and all laboratory assessments were analyzed using a repeated-measures approach with treatment, day, and treatment-by-day interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline value as a fixed continuous covariate. An unstructured (co)variance structure was used to model within-patient correlation. For FiO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen saturation, systolic BP, and diastolic BP, day <b>0</b> was used as baseline, and day 1 was used as baseline for all laboratory assessments. The least squares mean (LSM) at day 5 and overall (i.e., across all post-baseline data points collected through day 5, combined) was calculated for each treatment group. Differences between treatment groups were compared using F tests. The percentages of patients with c-reactive protein (CRP) levels &#x3c;10 mg/L at days 1, 3, and 5 in each group were compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Length of hospital and intensive care unit stays were compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4. Values of p&#x3c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">The study began on Apr. 20, 2020, and was completed on Feb. 23, 2021. One hundred ten subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned, 55 to each group; among these, 97 (47 in the nVNS group and 50 in the SoC group) had baseline/demographic and medical history data available and comprised the evaluable population. The mean subject age was higher in the SoC group than in the nVNS group, but baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between the groups. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups, although 7 subjects in the nVNS group were severely ill, whereas only 2 participants in the SoC group were severely ill.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">The analyses identified significant treatment differences for certain biomarkers of inflammation. Decreases from baseline in CRP levels were significantly greater for the nVNS group than for the SoC group at day 5 and overall (i.e., all post-baseline data points collected through day 5, combined; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>). At baseline (day 1), CRP levels were normal (&#x3c;10 mg/L) for very few subjects in both treatment groups, but by days 3 and 5 the percentage of subjects with normal CRP levels had increased markedly and was significantly greater in the nVNS group than in the SoC group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>). Compared with the SoC group, the nVNS group had a significantly greater decrease from baseline in procalcitonin level at day 5 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). At day 5 and overall, levels of D-dimer were decreased from baseline for the nVNS group and increased from baseline for the SoC group, although the difference between the treatment groups did not reach statistical significance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>). No significant treatment differences were seen for the other clinical or biochemical markers that were evaluated.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">The patients' clinical and biochemical endpoints were measured over their first five days of therapy and the adjusted means were compared. It was noted that the post-randomized assessment of severity of condition resulted in a 3.5 to 1 bias with more severe patients in the treatment arm. With respect to the clinical endpoint of oxygen saturation, the nVNS treated group showed a modest, but not significant improvement. Among the biomarkers evaluated, the adjusted mean decrease in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) from baseline was significantly greater in the nVNS treated group (&#x2212;59.09 mg/L versus &#x2212;27.83 mg/L; p less than 0.01). Trends toward significance were also observed for decreases in the treatment group for procalcitonin (&#x2212;0.11 ng/L versus &#x2212;0.05 ng/L; p equal to 0.07) and d-dimer (&#x2212;277.53 ng/mL versus 12164.37 ng/mL; p less than 0.01).</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">Increased levels of CRP, procalcitonin and d-dimer have all been reported to be associated with more severe disease. CRP is a protein made by the liver. CRP levels in the blood increase when there is a condition causing inflammation somewhere in the body. Thus, a CRP test measures the amount of CRP in the blood to detect inflammation due to acute conditions, such as the inflammatory response to a replicating pathogen. Similarly, procalcitonin is a substance produced by many types of cells in the body, often in response to bacterial or viral infections. The level of procalcitonin in the blood can increase significantly in systemic bacterial or viral infections and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">In patients with COVID-19, elevated inflammatory biomarker levels predict poor prognoses and clinical outcomes, including respiratory failure and mortality. High CRP levels (&#x3e;40 mg/mL) are predictive of severe disease and mortality, whereas lower CRP levels are associated with less risk of disease progression. Procalcitonin and D-dimer also have been suggested as biomarkers of poor outcomes in COVID-19. Procalcitonin levels have been found to be &#x3e;4 times greater in patients with severe illness and up to 8 times greater in those with critical illness than in patients with moderate illness, and elevated procalcitonin values have been associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation. The current study was the first to systematically evaluate the effects of VNS on inflammation associated with a replicating virus. Although the study was exploratory in nature, its results suggest significant modulation of CRP and procalcitonin by the nVNS devices and methods described herein as early as day 3, with a more robust effect by day 5.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Another problem associated with acute COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state and an accompanying increased risk for stroke, heart attack, and chilblain-like lesions or &#x201c;COVID toes&#x201d; (27-29). Elevated levels of CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer each individually have been shown to be predictive of thrombotic complications, critical illness, and/or death during hospitalization for COVID-19. Together, results from several recent studies suggest that elevations in CRP, procalcitonin, and/or D-dimer levels are associated with more severe disease and greater mortality.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">The study also showed that D-dimer levels appear to decrease with the nVNS devices and methods described herein. D-dimer is a protein fragment made when a blood clot dissolves in the blood. It has now been shown that certain replicating pathogens, such as Covid-19, may cause a significant increase in the level of blood clotting. Early evidence suggests that this is caused by an autoimmune antibody that circulates through the blood in response to Covid-19. This antibody attacks the cells and triggers clots in arteries, veins and microscopic vessels. These blood clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impair oxygen exchange and cause life-threatening events, such as strokes.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Lower levels of CRP, procalcitonin and d-dimer may represent the initial impact of nVNS therapy to potentially reduce the inflammatory response in patients suffering from Covid-19</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">Systems of the Present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a system <b>100</b> for stimulating a nerve in a patient, such as the vagus nerve, according to the present disclosure will not be described is a control theory representation of the disclosed vagus nerve stimulation methods.

Electrodes <b>114</b>, pulse generator <b>116</b> and power source <b>112</b> may all be housed in a single housing, as described in detail above. In an alternative embodiment, electrodes <b>114</b> are disposed separately from power source <b>112</b> and pulse generator <b>116</b>. Electrodes <b>114</b> may be coupled to these components via wired connections or wirelessly. In the latter configuration, electrodes <b>114</b> may include suitable electronic components coupled thereto to receive the electrical impulse(s) from pulse generator <b>116</b> and to apply those electrical impulse(s) through electrodes <b>114</b> to the patient. Such electronic components may include, for example, a wireless receiver or similar component that receives the signal from a wireless transmitter coupled to pulse generator <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">In still another embodiment, pulse generator <b>116</b> and power source <b>112</b> are coupled to each other, either wirelessly, via wired connections, or directly in a housing that contains both components. This housing may, for example, include a wireless transmitter and may be worn by the patient in manners known to those skilled in the art, so that the signal can be transmitted from the housing to electrodes <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">System <b>100</b> further includes a controller <b>118</b> that is coupled to stimulator <b>210</b> and may be used to select or set parameters for the stimulation protocol (amplitude, frequency, pulse width, burst number, electrode positioning etc.), the treatment regimen discussed above (i.e., duration and number of doses, etc.) or alert the patient as to the need to use or adjust the stimulator (i.e., an alarm). Controller <b>118</b> may be directly coupled to stimulator <b>210</b> via wired connectors or within the same housing, or it may be wirelessly coupled to stimulator <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">Significant portions of the control of the vagus nerve stimulation may reside in controller components that are physically separate from stimulator <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, separate components of the controller <b>118</b> and stimulator <b>210</b> generally communicate with one another wirelessly. Thus, the use of wireless technology avoids the inconvenience and distance limitations of interconnecting cables.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">In certain embodiments, system <b>100</b> may further include a mobile device <b>120</b> that either couples controller <b>118</b> to stimulator <b>210</b> or vice versa. Mobile device <b>120</b> may comprise a mobile phone, such as a smartphone, a smartwatch, iPad, laptop computer or any other mobile device having a computing function and wireless transmission technology.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">System <b>100</b> may further include one or more sensors <b>122</b> used for detecting certain physiological parameters of the patient based on the stimulation of the nerve. The preferred sensors will include ones ordinarily used for ambulatory monitoring. For example, the sensors may comprise those used in conventional Holter and bedside monitoring applications, for monitoring heart rate and variability, ECG, respiration depth and rate, core temperature, hydration, blood pressure, brain function, oxygenation, skin impedance, and skin temperature. The sensors may be embedded in garments or placed in sports wristwatches, as currently used in programs that monitor the physiological status of soldiers [G. A. SHAW, A. M. Siegel, G. Zogbi, and T. P. Opar. Warfighter physiological and environmental monitoring: a study for the U.S. Army Research Institute in Environmental Medicine and the Soldier Systems Center. MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington MA. 1 Nov. 2004, pp. 1-141]. The ECG sensors should be adapted to the automatic extraction and analysis of particular features of the ECG, for example, indices of P-wave morphology, as well as heart rate variability indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone. Measurement of respiration using noninvasive inductive plethysmography, mercury in silastic strain gauges or impedance pneumography is particularly advised, in order to account for the effects of respiration on the heart. A noninvasive accelerometer may also be included among the ambulatory sensors, in order to identify motion artifacts. An event marker may also be included in order for the patient to mark relevant circumstances and sensations.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">For brain monitoring, the sensors may comprise ambulatory EEG sensors [CASSON A, Yates D, Smith S, Duncan J, Rodriguez-Villegas E. Wearable electroencephalography. What is it, why is it needed, and what does it entail? IEEE Eng Med Biol Mag. 29(3,2010):44-56] or optical topography systems for mapping prefrontal cortex activation [Atsumori H, Kiguchi M, Obata A, Sato H, Katura T, Funane T, Maki A. Development of wearable optical topography system for mapping the prefrontal cortex activation. Rev Sci Instrum. 2009 Apr;80(4):043704]. Signal processing methods, comprising not only the application of conventional linear filters to the raw EEG data, but also the nearly real-time extraction of non-linear signal features from the data, may be considered to be a part of the EEG monitoring [D. Puthankattil SUBHA, Paul K. Joseph, Rajendra Acharya U, and Choo Min Lim. EEG signal analysis: A survey. J Med Syst 34(2010):195-212]. In the present application, the features would include EEG bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta).</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">For any given position of the stimulator relative to the vagus nerve, it is also possible to infer the amplitude of the electric field that it produces in the vicinity of the vagus nerve. This is done by calculation or by measuring the electric field that is produced by the stimulator as a function of depth and position within a phantom that simulates the relevant bodily tissue [Francis Marion MOORE. Electrical Stimulation for pain suppression: mathematical and physical models. Thesis, School of Engineering, Cornell University, 2007; Bartosz SAWICKI, Robert Szmurlo, Przemyslaw Plonecki, Jacek Starzynski, Stanislaw Wincenciak, Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92-97 in: Krawczyk, A. Electromagnetic Field, Health and Environment: Proceedings of EHE'07. Amsterdam, IOS Press, 2008]. Thus, in order to compensate for movement, the controller may increase or decrease the amplitude of the output from the stimulator (u) in proportion to the inferred deviation of the amplitude of the electric field in the vicinity of the vagus nerve, relative to its desired value.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, another embodiment of the present disclosure includes first and second electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> configured for attachment to an outer skin surface of the patient, such as the neck. Electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may include a suitable adhesive that secured them to a skin surface. Suitable adhesive electrodes for use herein may include electrode pads, self-adhesive electrodes or the like. Electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be coupled to pulse generator <b>116</b> and/or power supply <b>112</b> via wires or wirelessly. In a preferred embodiment, electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> will include a wireless receiver and suitable electronic components (not shown) for receiving a wireless signal from pulse generator <b>116</b> to apply an electrical impulse through the outer skin surface of the patient.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">In this embodiment, electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be placed in a suitable location on the patient's neck and adhered thereto. Electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> receive electrical impulses from pulse generator <b>116</b>. The duration, amplitude, frequency and treatment paradigm for the electrical impulses may be controlled by controller <b>118</b>, mobile device <b>120</b>, or via another electronic device coupled to pulse generator <b>116</b>. This embodiment allows, for example, a physician to secure electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to the patient's neck such that the treatment paradigm may be followed without patient involvement. This is particularly useful for treating stroke or TIA victims soon after onset of the stroke or TIA as these patients may not have suitable mental faculties for self-treatment.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, another embodiment comprises a stimulator (not shown) that may be secured to the outer skin surface of the patient's neck. Stimulator may include an outer covering or patch <b>106</b> to protect stimulator from the environment. The patch <b>106</b> may, for example, also include a suitable adhesive strip or pad on one surface for adhering the patch <b>106</b> and stimulator to the outer skin surface of the patient.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">Alternatively, outer covering <b>106</b> may comprise any wearable material that may include the stimulator. For example, depending on the location of the target nerve on the patient's body, the stimulator may be attached to, or embedded within, a wearable garment, such as a shirt, scarf, watch, hat, gloves, pants, shoes, boots, socks, underwear, belt, dress, jacket, sweater, ear muffs, or the like. The wearable garment may also comprise an accessory, such as a wristband, ankle or wrist bracelet, necklace, earrings, a compression garment, an ankle or knee brace or the like.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">In yet another embodiment, the garment itself is the stimulator. For example, the garment may comprise an electronic textile or e-textile that includes fabrics that enable digital components, such as electrodes, pulse generators, batteries wireless receivers and other electronic components to be embedded therein. Electronic textiles are distinct from wearable garments because the emphasis is placed on the seamless integration of textiles with electronic elements like microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. In one embodiment, the electronic textile may comprise an organic electronics material that is conducting and has insulated electrical components that allows the garment to be washed without damaging the electronic components.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">The stimulator of this embodiment includes one or more electrodes for applying electrical impulses to a nerve within the patient, as discussed above. The electrodes may include a wireless receiver and suitable electronics to receive the electrical impulses from pulse generator <b>116</b>. Alternatively, the stimulator may also include pulse generator <b>116</b> and/or power supply <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, the stimulator may be, for example, wireless coupled to controller <b>118</b>, mobile device <b>120</b> or another suitable control device.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">The stimulator may also include an array of electrodes. The electrode array may include multiple sets of electrodes with each set of electrodes configured to apply electrical impulses through the outer skin surface of the patient, as discussed above. Each of the sets of electrodes may be individually coupled to the pulse generator, either directly, through wires, or wireless as described above. The electrode array may have multiple patterns. For example, the array may be linear, square, circular or any other suitable shape.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">In certain embodiments, the electrode array comprises two or more sets of electrodes, each spaced apart from each other between about <b>2</b> mm to about <b>25</b> mm, preferably between about 4 mm to about 10 mm. The electrode array preferably comprises a shape that substantially corresponds to a target area of the patient's neck. In one embodiment, the target area is the area on the neck that allows for electrical impulses to be passed through the skin to the vagus nerve (discussed in detail below).</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">The electrode sets may each be individually coupled to pulse generator <b>116</b> such that electrical impulses can be applied to all of the electrode sets, some of the electrode sets or only one of the electrode sets.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">In this embodiment, the system may further include one or more sensors <b>122</b>, such as those described above, for detecting whether the nerve has been stimulated, the amplitude of the stimulation, or whether the nerve has been stimulated with sufficient amplitude and other parameters to fire an action potential. The sensors may detect a physiological parameter of the patient. Alternatively, the sensors may be coupled to the electrodes and may sense one or more parameters of the electrodes, such as impedance, amplitude, voltage or the like.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">The sensors may also be coupled to the controller <b>118</b>. In this embodiment, the controller is configured to receive input from the sensors and to direct the pulse generator <b>116</b> to apply electrical impulses to one or more sets of the electrodes <b>114</b> based on this input. For example, the sensors may provide data that suggests that one or more of the sets of electrodes is not positioned properly to stimulate the nerve, or to stimulate the nerve at the optimal signal strength to cause the nerve to fire an action potential. The controller is configured to shift the electrical impulse to the set or sets of electrodes that provide a sufficient electrical impulse to the nerve to cause it to fire an action potential. In this manner, the controller can optimize the application of the electrical impulses to the nerve.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">This embodiment is particularly useful for applying electrical impulses through an outer skin surface of a patient to a deeper nerve, such as the vagus nerve. The optimal positioning of the electrodes can be challenging in such an application. If the electrodes are placed incorrectly on the neck, the electrical signals may not pass through to the nerve, or they may only pass through at limited strength that is not sufficient to cause the nerve to fire an action potential. With this embodiment, an array of electrodes may be placed over a broader area of the outer skin surface. The controller may direct the pulse generator to selectively apply electrical impulses to each set of electrodes. The sensors will then provide feedback to the controller, as discussed above, and the controller will determine the optimal set or sets of electrodes in which to apply the electrical impulses.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">Embodiments Of Reusable Neurostimulators</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>C</figref>, systems and methods for refilling neurostimulator devices, such as the ones portrayed above, will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a stimulator device <b>150</b>.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the medical device <b>208</b> can include a neurostimulator <b>208</b>B, whether invasive, non-invasive, or hybrid. For example, the neurostimulator <b>208</b>B can be embodied as described in US Patent Application Publication 2014/0330336 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,874,205, 9,037,247, 9,174,066, 9,205,258, 9,375,571, and 9,427,581, all of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes as if copied and pasted herein, such as all structures, all functions, and all methods of manufacture and use, as disclosed therein. For example, the neurostimulator can modulate central or peripheral nervous systems. For example, the neurostimulator can be enable spinal cord stimulation to provide therapy for intractable pain and refractory angina; occipital nerve stimulation to provide therapy for occipital neuralgia and transformed migraine; afferent vagus nerve modulation to provide therapy for a host of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, bulemia, anxiety/obsessive compulsive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and neurogenic pain; efferent vagus nerve stimulation for rate control in atrial fibrillation, and to provide therapy for congestive heart failure; gastric nerves or gastric wall stimulation to provide therapy for obesity; sacral nerve stimulation to provide therapy for urinary urge incontinence; deep brain stimulation to provide therapy for Parkinson's disease, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders; cavernous nerve stimulation to provide therapy for erectile dysfunction. However, as explained herein, note that the medical device <b>208</b> can be of any type or modality for at least one of prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, or treatment of a medical condition, disease, or a disorder of a patient. For example, the medical device <b>208</b> can be configured to output a fluid, such as a liquid, a suspension, or a gas. For example, the medical device <b>208</b> can be configured to output a gel, a powder, or a foam. For example, the medical device <b>208</b> can be configured to increase or decrease pressure or provide physical support, whether internal or external to a patient. An example of a device that can be used is a mechanical actuator, vibration device, piezoelectric device, electric motor (e.g., brushed, brushless) or engine (e.g., combustion) or any other force generator, applicator, or output device.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">The medical device <b>208</b> can operate in a first manner during the first mode and in a second manner in the second mode, where the first manner is different from or identical to the second manner, such as in an amount of operation, in an intensity of operation, in a duration of operation, in a modality of operation, in an energy use of operation, or others. For example, when the processor <b>204</b> switches the medical device <b>208</b> from the first mode (e.g., a deactivated mode) to the second mode (e.g., an activate mode), then such switching can activate the medical device <b>208</b> for a specific time period or a number of diagnosis or treatment doses or other parameters or vice versa. For example, the amount of operation includes a number of individual doses of at least one of diagnosis or treatment doses, such as less than or more than 3 doses, 4 doses, 5 doses, 6 doses, 7 doses, 8 doses, 9 doses, 10 doses, 15 doses, 20 doses, 25 doses, 30 doses, 40 doses, 45 doses, 50 doses, 60 doses, 65 doses, 70 doses, 75 doses, 80 doses, 85 doses, 90 doses, 95 doses, 100 doses, 200 doses, 300 doses, 400 doses, 500 doses, 600 doses, 700 doses, 800 doses, 900 doses, 1000 doses, or any other amount of doses from 1 to 1000 or greater, or others, whether a dose is based on a single use or a set of uses within a predefined time period (e.g., milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years). As such, the medical device <b>208</b> can be adjusted where the first mode and the second mode can be equal or unequal in amount of doses.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">Similarly, the intensity of operation includes a degree or type of intensity with which the medical device <b>208</b> at least one of prevents, diagnoses, monitors, ameliorates, or treats the medical condition, disease, or the disorder in the patient. For example, the first mode can be associated with a first prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, or treatment signal/energy output and the second mode can be associated with a second prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, or treatment signal/energy output, wherein the first signal/energy output is identical to or differs from the second signal/energy output in various parameters, such as a content, a format, an amplitude, a frequency, a time period, or others. As such, the medical device <b>208</b> can be adjusted to more intensely or less intensely prevent, diagnose, monitor, ameliorate, or treat based on switching between the first mode and the second mode. Likewise, the duration of operation includes a number of defined time periods during which the medical device can at least one of prevent, diagnose, monitor, ameliorate, or treat, such as a number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or others, whether dependent on usage or independent of usage. As such, the medical device <b>208</b> can be adjusted to a least one of prevent, diagnose, monitor, ameliorate, or treat between a first defined time period and a second defined time period.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">The input device <b>210</b> is configured to obtain, such as via reading, copying, or others, a second content from a storage medium, such as a magnetic card, a radio frequency identification (RFID) card, a chip card, a barcode, a Quick Response (QR) code, or others, such that the processor <b>204</b> switches the medical device <b>208</b> between the first mode and the second mode based on the first content corresponding to the second content, such as logically or others, or vice versa. The second content, such as an activation code, a set of prescription data, a set of dosage/frequency of use data, or others, can be associated with the medical device <b>208</b>, such as uniquely or others, with a specific mode of operation, such as for preventing, diagnosing, monitoring, ameliorating, or treating a specific medical condition, disease, or disorder, or with a particular user, such as based on a user identifier, such as a personal identification number (PIN), a biometric, or others. Note that the particular user can be associated with the medical device <b>208</b>, such as via a primary key of a relational database, as disclosed herein. For example, the primary key can be the PIN or another set of data such that the second content is unique to the particular user. In some embodiments, where the medical device <b>208</b> is shared among a plurality of users, the second content can be unique to one of the users, yet access control or authentication between the users can be controlled via another layer or form of identification, such as passwords, biometrics, or others, such as when the system <b>200</b>A includes a user input device coupled to the processor <b>204</b>. For example, the user input device can include a keyboard or dial, whether physical, virtual (e.g., display), or haptic (e.g., display), a biometric reader, a fob or tag, a barcode, or others.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">The second content can be of any of type, whether identical to or different from the first content, such as an alphanumeric, an image, a barcode, a sound, a data structure, a projection, a depression, a hole, or any others.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, the input device <b>210</b> includes a reader <b>210</b>B, such as a reader terminal, that is configured to read the second content from the storage medium, such as a card, a display, an interface, a chip, a memory dongle, a paper, or others, whether the storage medium is in or out of a line-of-sight of the reader <b>210</b>B. For example, when the storage medium is a card, which can include paper, cardboard, plastic, rubber, metal, wood, or others, and the reader <b>210</b>B is a card reader, then the card can be embedded with at least one of a barcode, a magnetic strip, a computer chip, or another storage medium and the card reader can read the at least one of the barcode, the magnetic strip, the computer chip, or another storage medium. For example, the memory dongle can include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) dongle, a CompactFlash (CF) card, Secure Digital (SD) card, a MultiMediaCard (MMC) card. Therefore, the card can be a dumb card, a smart card, a memory card, a Wiegand card, a proximity card, or others, whether contact or contactless. Correspondingly, the reader <b>210</b>B can be a smart card reader, a memory card reader, a Wiegand card reader, a magnetic stripe reader, a proximity reader, or others, whether the reader <b>210</b>B is a non-intelligent reader, a semi-intelligent reader, or an intelligent reader. The input device <b>210</b> can be distinct from the medical device <b>208</b> or be a component of the medical device <b>208</b>. The memory <b>206</b> can include the storage medium (e.g., removable memory chip) or vice versa. The memory <b>206</b> can exclude the storage medium or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref>, the input device <b>210</b> includes a transceiver <b>210</b>C, which includes a receiver, that is configured to receive, whether over a wired, wireless, or waveguide connection, the second content from the storage medium, such a card, a phone, a tablet, a laptop, a wearable, or others, such via a radio technique, an optical technique, an acoustic technique, or others, whether the storage medium is in or out of a line-of-sight of the transceiver <b>210</b>C. For example, the radio technique can include a RFID interrogation, a Wi-Fi communication, a Bluetooth communication, or other radio communication formats, which can be encrypted or unencrypted. For example, the optical technique can include a laser beam, an infrared beam, a Li-Fi connection, or others. Note that the transceiver can include a transmitter or a receiver.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">The input device <b>210</b> can obtain the second content from the storage medium in various ways. For example, the input device <b>210</b> can obtain the second content electronically, optically, electromagnetically, mechanically, or others, whether the storage medium is in or out of a line-of-sight of the input device <b>210</b>. For example, when the input device <b>210</b> is the reader <b>210</b>B, then the input device <b>210</b> can read the second content from the storage medium based on at least one of a barcode of the storage medium (optically), a QR code of the storage medium (optically), a magnetic material of the storage medium (electromagnetically), a chip of the storage medium (electromagnetically), an integrated circuit of the storage medium (electronically), a non-volatile memory of the storage medium (electronically), a punched hole of the storage medium (mechanically), a tactile surface of the storage medium (mechanically), or others. Likewise, when the input device <b>210</b> is the transceiver <b>210</b>C, then the input device <b>210</b> can read the second content from the storage medium via an RFID technique, such as via interrogation, whether the storage medium is passive or active. Note that in some embodiments, the input device <b>210</b> includes the reader <b>210</b>B and the transceiver <b>210</b>C.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0311">The first content can correspond to the second content in various ways, such as logically, such as via a Boolean logic, or others. For example, the first content can match the second content in content, format, logic, parameters, encryption, or others. For example, the first content can be equal to the second content, whether in format or value. Similarly, the first content can be unequal to the second content, whether in format or value. Likewise, the first content can logically map to the second content, such as via a logical symmetry where the first content is same as the second content or where the first content is different from the second, but related in a relatively quick computational way. For example, such correspondence can be determined based on or via hashing the first content or the second content. In some embodiments, processor <b>204</b> or the input device <b>210</b> can convert the first content or the second content before determining whether the first content corresponds to the second content. For example, such conversion can involve a format or a content of the first content or the second content.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0312">When the first content does not correspond to the second content, such as the first content does not match the second content in value and format or others, as described above, then the medical device <b>208</b> is not switched from the first mode, such as a deactivated mode, to the second mode, such as an activated mode. In some embodiments, when the first content does not correspond to the second content, then the medical device <b>208</b> is switched from the first mode to the second mode, but the second mode is as or less operational than the first mode. For example, the second mode is a default mode of operation, a minimal mode of operation, a demo mode of operation, a disabled mode of operation, a kiosk mode of operation, or others.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0313">In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> includes an output device, such as a signal transmitter, a light, sound, or vibration source, an actuator, a data writer, or others, coupled to the processor <b>204</b>, whether over a wired, wireless, or waveguide connection, where the processor <b>204</b> is configured to instruct the output device to interface with the storage medium in response to the input device <b>210</b> reading the second content. For example, the output device can include a transmitter and the processor <b>204</b> can instruct the transmitter to send a signal to the storage medium such that the storage medium can receive and process the signal, which may involve acting based on such processing. For example, such action can allow deactivating the storage medium based on or after the medical device <b>208</b> is switched from the first mode, such as a deactivated mode, to the second mode, such as an activated mode. For example, the processor <b>204</b> can request the output device to interface with the storage medium such that the storage medium is locked from further reading, when the storage medium is enabled for such locking. Similarly, the processor <b>204</b> can request the output device to interface with the storage medium such that the second content on the storage medium is rendered unusable, when the storage medium is enabled for such data modification rights. Likewise, the processor <b>204</b> can request the output device to interface with the storage medium such that the second content on the storage medium is erased from the storage medium, whether temporarily or permanently, when the storage medium is enabled for such data modification rights. Also, the processor <b>204</b> can request the output device to interface with the storage medium such that the storage medium is reformatted, when the storage medium is enabled for such data modification rights. Additionally, the processor <b>204</b> can request the output device to interface with the storage medium such that the storage medium is modified from a first state to a second state, when the storage medium is enabled for such state modification rights, and where the first state is before the input device <b>210</b> obtains the second content from the storage medium, and where the second state is after the input device <b>210</b> obtains the second content from the storage medium. Note that such interfacing can include electronically or physically modifying the storage medium or a content or data format thereon. Note that the first state and the second state can differ from each other in various ways (e.g., more or less functionality, more or less energy use, more or less data reading or modification or deletion or reformatting rights). As such, the output device can be useful to lock or wipe the storage medium once the input device <b>210</b> reads the second content from the storage medium.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">When the system <b>200</b>A is used to at least one of prevent, diagnose, monitor, ameliorate, or treat the medical condition, disease, or the disorder of the patient, the processor <b>204</b> tracks such use and can take an action when a predetermined threshold is satisfied or not satisfied, such as via the logic stored via the memory <b>206</b>. For example, the logic tracks a use of the medical device <b>208</b> and when a number of uses, as programmed in advance, satisfies or does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, then the processor <b>204</b> can take an action, such as switch the medical device <b>208</b> between the first mode, such as an activated mode, and the second mode, such as a deactivated mode, or vice versa. Note that the logic has access to or can modify the predetermined threshold. Further, note that the predetermined threshold can be based on a number of single uses within a predefined time period (e.g., within a day, a week, a month, a year) or a number of single uses regardless of any time limit. For example, the action can include activating the medical device <b>208</b>, deactivating the medical device <b>208</b>, creating, modifying, or deleting a prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, or treatment parameter of the medical device <b>208</b>, as stored via the medical device <b>208</b> or the memory <b>206</b>, creating, modifying, or deleting a set of treatment instructions of the medical device <b>208</b>, as stored via the medical device <b>208</b> or the memory <b>206</b>, or others.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0315">In one mode of operation, a user of the system <b>200</b>A positions the storage medium in proximity thereof, such as within about ten feet or less. The input device <b>210</b> interfaces with the storage medium such that the processor <b>204</b> switches the medical device <b>208</b> between the first mode and the second mode. If the first mode was a deactivated mode and the second mode was an activated mode, then the user can use the system <b>200</b>A to prevent, diagnose, monitor, ameliorate, or treat the medical condition, disease, or the disorder of the user or another. For example, the input device <b>210</b> can read the second content from the storage medium and pass the second content to the processor <b>204</b>. In response, the processor <b>204</b> can confirm that the first content, which is uniquely associated with the medical device <b>208</b>, matches the second card, such as via value and format. Upon such confirmation, the processor <b>204</b> switches the medical device <b>208</b> from the first mode to the second mode.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a network diagram for initially provisioning and refilling a system containing a medical device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a method for initially provisioning a system containing a medical device.
