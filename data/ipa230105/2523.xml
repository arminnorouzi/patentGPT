INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to recycle content in poly(vinyl acetals), and in particular to recycle content in poly(vinyl acetals) such as poly(vinyl butyral) where such recycle content was obtained directly or indirectly from cracking recycle content pyoil.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Waste materials, especially non-biodegradable waste materials, can negatively impact the environment when disposed of in landfills after a single use. Thus, from an environmental standpoint, it is desirable to recycle as much waste material as possible. However, recycling waste materials can be challenging from an economic standpoint.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While some waste materials are relatively easy and inexpensive to recycle, other waste materials require significant and expensive processing in order to be reused. Further, different types of waste materials often require different types of recycling processes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To maximize recycling efficiency, it would be desirable for large-scale production facilities to be able to process feedstocks having recycle content originating from a variety of waste materials. Commercial facilities involved in the production of non-biodegradable products or products that find their ultimate destination in a landfill could benefit greatly from using recycle content feedstocks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some recycling efforts involve complicated and detailed segregation of waste streams, which contributes to the increased cost of obtaining streams of recycle waste content. For example, conventional methanolysis technologies require a high purity stream of PET. Some downstream products are also quite sensitive to the presence of dyes and inks on waste products, and their pretreatment and removal also contributes to increased costs of feedstocks made from such wastes. It would be desirable to establish a recycle content without the necessity for sorting down to a single type of plastic or waste material, or which can tolerate a variety of impurities in waste streams that flow through to a feedstock.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, it may be difficult to dedicate a product having a recycle content to a particular customer or downstream synthetic process for making a derivate of the product, particularly if the recycle content product is a gas or difficult to isolate. As related to a gas, there is a lack of infrastructure to segregate and distribute a dedicated portion of a gas made exclusively form a recycle content feedstock since the gas infrastructure is continuously fluid and often commingles gas streams from a variety of sources.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, it is recognized that some regions desire to move away from sole dependence on natural gas, ethane, or propane as the sole source for making raw materials products such as ethylene and propylene and their downstream derivatives, and alternative or supplemental feedstocks to crackers would be desirable.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also desirable to synthesize chemical compounds and polymers using existing equipment and processes and without the need to invest in additional and expensive equipment in order to establish a recycle content in the manufacture of the chemical compound or polymer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also desirable to continue sourcing a raw material for making poly(vinyl acetals) from aldehydes made from olefins obtained from cracker facilities that may find themselves stranded as production from a natural gas field or petroleum becomes economically unattractive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, it is desirable for a poly(vinyl acetals) to not be solely dependent on obtaining credits to establish a recycle content in poly(vinyl acetals) and thereby provide the poly(vinyl acetals) manufacturer with a variety of choices to establish recycle content.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would also be desirable for a poly(vinyl acetals) manufacturer to be able to determine the amount and timing of establishing recycle content. The poly(vinyl acetals) manufacturer may, at certain times or for different batches, may desire to establish more or less recycle content or no recycle content. The flexibility in this approach without the need to add significant assets is desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There is now provided a method of obtaining a recycle content poly(vinyl acetal), recycle content aldehydes useful to make poly(vinyl acetal), and articles made from or with or containing recycle content poly(vinyl acetal), uses thereof, compositions thereof, and systems thereof, each as further described in the claims and detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustrate of a process for employing a recycle content pyrolysis oil composition (r-pyoil) to make one or more recycle content compositions into r-compositions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary pyrolysis system to at least partially convert one or more recycled waste, particularly recycled plastic waste, into various useful r-products.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic depiction of pyrolysis treatment through production of olefin containing products.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block flow diagram illustrating steps associated with the cracking furnace and separation zones of a system for producing an r-composition obtained from cracking r-pyoil and non-recycle cracker feed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a cracker furnace suitable for receiving r-pyoil.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a furnace coil configuration having multiple tubes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a variety of feed locations for r-pyoil into a cracker furnace.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a cracker furnace having a vapor-liquid separator.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the treatment of a recycle content furnace effluent.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a fractionation scheme in a Separation section, including a demethanizer, deethanizer, depropanizer, and the fractionation columns to separate and isolate the main r-compositions, including r-propylene, r-ethylene, r-butylene, and others.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates the laboratory scale cracking unit design.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates design features of a plant-based trial feeding r-pyoil to a gas fed cracker furnace.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a graph of the boiling point curve of a r-pyoil having 74.86% C8+, 28.17% C15+, 5.91% aromatics, 59.72% paraffins, and 13.73% unidentified components by gas chromatography analysis.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a graph of the boiling point curve of a r-pyoil obtained by gas chromatography analysis.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a graph of the boiling point curve of a r-pyoil obtained by gas chromatography analysis.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a graph of the boiling point curve of a r-pyoil distilled in a lab and obtained by chromatography analysis.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a graph of the boiling point curve of r-pyoil distilled in lab with at least 90% boiling by 350&#xb0;

In this system, one need not trace the source of a reactant back to the cracking of pyoil or back to any atoms contained in olefin-containing effluent, but rather can use any reactant made by any process and have associated with such reactant a recycle content allotment.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0100">In one embodiment or in combination with any mentioned embodiments, a composition receiving an allotment is used as a feedstock to make downstream derivatives of the composition, and such composition is a product of cracking a cracker feedstock in a cracker furnace.

The process allows for a time lapse between the time an entity or person receiving the r-pyoil and creating the allotment (which can occur upon receipt or ownership of the r-pyoil or deposit into inventory) and the actual processing of the r-pyoil in a cracker furnace.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">As used herein, &#x201c;recycle content inventory&#x201d; and &#x201c;inventory&#x201d; mean a group or collection of allotments (allocations or credits) from which deposits and deductions of allotments in any units can be tracked. The inventory can be in any form (electronic or paper), using any or multiple software programs, or using a variety of modules or applications that together as a whole tracks the deposits and deductions. Desirably, the total amount of recycle content withdrawn (or applied to compositions) does not exceed the total amount of recycle content allotments on deposit in the recycle content inventory (from any source, not only from cracking of r-pyoil). However, if a deficit of recycle content value is realized, the recycle content inventory is rebalanced to achieve a zero or positive recycle content value available. The timing for rebalancing can be either determined and managed in accordance with the rules of a particular system of accreditation adopted by the olefin-containing effluent manufacturer or by one among its Family of Entities, or alternatively, is rebalanced within one (1) year, or within six (6) months, or within three (3) months, or within one (1) month of realizing the deficit. The timing for depositing an allotment into the recycle content inventory, applying an allotment (or credit) to a composition to make a r-composition, and cracking r-pyoil, need not be simultaneous or in any particular order. In one embodiment or in combination with any mentioned embodiments, the step of cracking a particular volume of r-pyoil occurs after the recycle content value or allotment from that volume of r-pyoil is deposited into a recycle content inventory. Further, the allotments or recycle content values withdrawn from the recycle content inventory need not be traceable to r-pyoil or cracking r-pyoil, but rather can be obtained from any waste recycle stream, and from any method of processing the recycle waste stream. Desirably, at least a portion of the recycle content value in the recycle content inventory is obtained from r-pyoil, and optionally at least a portion of r-pyoil, are processed in the one or more cracking processes as described herein, optionally within a year of each other and optionally at least a portion of the volume of r-pyoil from which a recycle content value is deposited into the recycle content inventory is also processed by any or more of the cracking processes described herein.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0109">The determination of whether an r-composition is derived directly or indirectly from recycled waste is not on the basis of whether intermediate steps or entities do or do not exist in the supply chain, but rather whether at least a portion of the r-composition that is fed to the reactor for making an end product such as an olefin or an aldehyde or an oxo alcohol or an oxo plasticizer can be traced to an r-composition made from recycled waste.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0110">The determination of whether a pr-composition is derived directly or indirectly from the pyrolysis of recycled waste (e.g., from the cracking of r-pyoil or from r-pygas) is not on the basis of whether intermediate steps or entities do or do not exist in the supply chain, but rather whether at least a portion of the pr-composition that is fed to the reactor for making an end product such as PVA can be traced to an pr-composition made from the pyrolysis of recycled waste.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0111">As noted above, the end product is considered to be directly derived from recycled waste if at least a portion of the reactant feedstock used to make the product can be traced back, optionally through one or more intermediate steps or entities, to at least a portion of an r-composition produced from recycled waste (e.g., during the cracking of r-pyoil fed to a cracking furnace or as an effluent from the cracking furnace).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0112">The r-composition as an effluent may be in crude form that requires refining to isolate the particular r-composition. The r-composition manufacturer can, typically after refining and/or purification and compression to produce the desired grade of the particular r-composition, sell such r-composition to an intermediary entity who then sells the r-composition, or one or more derivatives thereof, to another intermediary for making an intermediate product or directly to the product manufacturer. Any number of intermediaries and intermediate derivates can be made before the final product is made.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0113">The actual r-composition volume, whether condensed as a liquid, supercritical, or stored as a gas, can remain at the facility where it is made, or can be shipped to a different location, or held at an off-site storage facility before utilized by the intermediary or product manufacturer. For purposes of tracing, once r-composition made from recycled waste (e.g., by cracking r-pyoil or from r-pygas) is mixed with another volume of the composition (e.g. r-propylene mixed with non-recycle propylene), for example in a storage tank, salt dome, or cavern, then the entire tank, dome, or cavern at that point becomes an r-composition source, and for purposes of tracing, withdrawal from such storage facility is withdrawing from an r-composition source until such time as when the entire volume or inventory of the storage facility is turned over or withdrawn and/or replaced with non-recycle compositions after the r-composition feed to the tank stops. Likewise, this applies also to any downstream storage facilities for storing the derivatives of the r-compositions, such as r-A and pr-A compositions.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0114">A r-composition is considered to be indirectly derived from recycled waste or pyrolysis of recycled waste or cracking of r-pyoil if it has associated with it a recycle content allotment and may or may not contain a physical component that is traceable to an r-composition at least a portion of which is obtained from recycled waste/pyrolysis of recycled waste/cracking of r-pyoil. For example, the (i) manufacturer of the product can operate within a legal framework, or an association framework, or an industry recognized framework for making a claim to a recycle content through, for example, a system of credits transferred to the product manufacturer regardless of where or from whom the r-composition, or derivatives thereof, or reactant feedstocks to make the product, is purchased or transferred, or (ii) a supplier of the r-composition or a derivate thereof (&#x201c;supplier&#x201d;) operates within an allotment framework that allows for associating or applying a recycle content value or pr-value to a portion or all of an olefin-containing effluent or a compound within an olefin-containing effluent or derivate thereof to make an r-composition, and to transfer the recycle content value or allotment to the manufacturer of the product or any intermediary who obtains a supply of r-composition, or its derivatives, from the supplier. In this system, one need not trace the source of r-A volume back to the manufacture of r-composition from recycled waste/pyrolyzed recycled waste, but rather can use any aldehyde composition made by any process and have associated with such aldehyde composition a recycle content allotment.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0115">Examples of how an AD composition for making PVA can obtain recycle content include (and propylene is used as an example, but other olefins are also equally applicable such as ethylene):<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0116">(i) a cracker facility in which r-propylene made at the facility, by cracking r-pyoil or obtained from r-pygas, can be in fluid communication, continuously or intermittently and directly or indirectly through intermediate facilities such an AD facility, with an AD formation facility (which can be to a storage vessel at the AD facility or directly to the AD formation reactor) through interconnected pipes, optionally through one or more storage vessels and valves or interlocks, and the r-propylene feedstock is drawn through the interconnected piping:        <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0117">a. from the cracker facility while r-propylene is being made or thereafter within the time for the r-propylene to transport through the piping to the AD formation facility; or</li>            <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0118">b. from the one or more storage tanks at any time provided that at least one of the storage tanks was fed with r-propylene, and continue for so long as the entire volume of the one or more storage tanks is replaced with a feed that does not contain r-propylene; or</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0119">(ii) transporting propylene from a storage vessel, dome, or facility, or in an isotainer via truck or rail or ship or a means other than piping, that contains or has been fed with r-propylene until such time as the entire volume of the vessel, dome or facility has been replaced with an propylene gas feed that does not contain r-propylene; or</li>        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0120">(iii) the manufacturer of the AD certifies, represents to its customers or the public, or advertises that its AD contains recycle content or is obtained from feedstock containing or obtained from recycle content, where such recycle content claim is based in whole or in part on a propylene feedstock associated with an allocation from propylene made from cracking r-pyoil or obtained from r-pygas; or</li>        <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0121">(iv) the manufacturer of the AD has acquired:        <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0122">a. a propylene volume made from r-pyoil under a certification, representation, or as advertised, or</li>            <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0123">b. has transferred credits or allocation with the supply of propylene to the manufacturer of the AD sufficient to allow the manufacturer of the AD to satisfy the certification requirements or to make its representations or advertisements, or</li>            <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0124">c. the propylene has allocated to it a recycle content where such allocation was obtained, through one or more intermediary entities, from a cracked propylene volume at least part of which is obtained by cracking r-pyoil or obtained from r-pygas.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0109" num="0125">As discussed above, the recycle content can be a pyrolysis recycle content that is directly or indirectly derived from the pyrolysis of recycled waste (e.g., from cracking r-pyoil or from r-pygas).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0126">In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the recycle content input or creation (recycle content feedstock or allotments) can be to or at a first Site, and recycle content values from said inputs are transferred to a second Site and applied to one or more compositions made at a second Site. The recycle content values can be applied symmetrically or asymmetrically to the compositions at the second Site. A recycle content value that is directly or indirectly &#x201c;derived from cracking r-pyoil&#x201d;, or a recycle content value that is &#x201c;obtained from cracking r-pyoil&#x201d; or originating in cracking r-pyoil does not imply the timing of when the recycle content value or allotment is taken, captured, deposited into a recycle content inventory, or transferred. The timing of depositing the allotment or recycle content value into a recycle content inventory, or realizing, recognizing, capturing, or transferring it, is flexible and can occur as early as receipt of r-pyoil onto the site within a Family of Entities, possessing it, or bringing the r-pyoil into inventory by the entity or person, or within the Family of Entities, owning or operating the cracker facility. Thus, an allotment or recycle content value on a volume of r-pyoil can be obtained, captured, deposited into an inventory, or transferred to a product without having yet fed that volume to cracker furnace and cracked. The allotment can also be obtained during feeding r-pyoil to a cracker, during cracking, or when an r-composition is made. An allotment taken when r-pyoil is owned, possessed, or received and deposited into a recycle content inventory is an allotment that is associated with, obtained from, or originates from cracking r-pyoil even though, at the time of taking or depositing the allotment, the r-pyoil has not yet been cracked, provided that the r-pyoil is at some future point in time cracked.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0127">The terms &#x201c;recycled waste,&#x201d; &#x201c;waste stream,&#x201d; and &#x201c;recycled waste stream&#x201d; are used interchangeably to mean any type of waste or waste-containing stream that is reused in a production process, rather than being permanently disposed of (e.g., in a landfill or incinerator).

One batch of PVA can contain 5% recycle content by mass, and another batch can contain zero 0% recycle content, even though both volumes are made from the same volume of AD feedstock. In the asymmetric distribution of recycle content, a manufacturer can tailor the recycle content to volumes of PVA sold as needed among customers, thereby providing flexibility among customers some of whom may need more recycle content than others in a PVA volume.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0319">Both the symmetric distribution and the asymmetric distribution of recycle content can be proportional on a Site wide basis, or on a multi-Site basis.

The recycle content values can be applied symmetrically or asymmetrically to the products at the Site.

The circumstance described in (i) allows a PVA manufacturer to obtain a supply of an aldehyde composition that is a non-recycle content AD, yet obtain a recycle content allotment from the AD supplier. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the AD supplier transfers a recycle content allotment to the PVA manufacturer and a supply of AD to the PVA manufacturer, where the recycle content allotment is not associated with the AD supplied, or even not associated with any AD made by the AD supplier. The recycle content allotment does not have to be tied to an amount of recycle content in an aldehyde composition or to any monomer used to make PVA, but rather the recycle content allotment transferred by the AD supplier can be associated with other products derived directly or indirectly from recycled waste, the pyrolysis of recycled waste, pyrolysis gas produced from the pyrolysis of recycled waste, and/or the cracking of r-pyoil produced from the pyrolysis of recycled waste or the recycle content of any downstream compounds obtained from the pyrolysis of recycled waste, such as r-ethylene, r-propylene, r-butadiene, r-aldehydes, r-alcohols, r-benzene, etc. For example, the AD supplier can transfer to the PVA manufacturer a recycle content associated with r-propylene and also supply a quantity of ethylene oxide even though r-propylene was not used in the synthesis of the ethylene oxide. This allows flexibility among the AD supplier and PVA manufacturer to apportion a recycle content among the variety of products they each make.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0335">In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the AD supplier transfers a recycle content allotment to the PVA manufacturer and a supply of AD to the PVA manufacturer, where the recycle content allotment is associated with AD. In this case, the AD transferred does not have to be a r-A (one that is derived directly or indirectly from the pyrolysis of recycled waste); rather the AD supplied by the supplier can be any AD such as a non-recycle content AD, so long as the allocation supplied is associated with a manufacture of AD. Optionally, the AD being supplied can r-A and at least a portion of the recycle content allotment being transferred can be the recycle content in the r-A. The recycle content allotment transferred to the PVA manufacturer can be up front with the AD supplied in installments, or with each AD installment, or apportioned as desired among the parties.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0336">The allotment in (ii) is obtained by the PVA manufacturer (or its Family of Entities) from any person or entity without obtaining a supply of AD from the person or entity. The person or entity can be an AD manufacturer that does not supply AD to the PVA manufacturer or its Family of Entities, or the person or entity can be a manufacturer that does not make AD. In either case, the circumstances of (ii) allows a PVA manufacturer to obtain a recycle content allotment without having to purchase any AD from the entity supplying the recycle content allotment. For example, the person or entity may transfer a recycle content allotment through a buy/sell model or contract to the PVA manufacturer or its Family of Entities without requiring purchase or sale of an allotment (e.g. as a product swap of products that are not AD), or the person or entity may outright sell the allotment to the PVA manufacturer or one among its Family of Entities. Alternatively, the person or entity may transfer a product, other than AD, along with its associated recycle content allotment to the PVA manufacturer. This can be attractive to a PVA manufacturer that has a diversified business making a variety of products other than PVA requiring raw materials other than AD that the person or entity can supply to the PVA manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0337">The PVA manufacturer can deposit the allotment into a recycle inventory. The PVA manufacturer also makes PVA, whether or not a recycle content is applied to the PVA so made and whether or not a recycle content value, if applied to the PVA, is drawn from the recycle inventory. For example, the PVA manufacturer, or any entity among its Family of Entities may:<ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0338">a. deposit the allotment into a recycle inventory and merely store it; or</li>        <li id="ul0021-0002" num="0339">b. deposit the allotment into a recycle inventory and apply a recycle content value from the recycle inventory to products other than PVA made by the PVA manufacturer, or</li>        <li id="ul0021-0003" num="0340">c. sell or transfer an allotment from the recycle inventory into which the allotment obtained as noted above was deposited.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0306" num="0341">If desired, however, from that recycle inventory, any allotment can be deducted and applied to the PVA product in any amount and at any time up to the point of sale or transfer of the PVA to a third party. Thus, the recycle content allotment applied to the PVA can be derived directly or indirectly from pyrolyzing recycled waste, or the recycle content allotment applied to the PVA is not derived directly or indirectly from the pyrolysis of recycled waste. For example, a recycle inventory of allotments can be generated having a variety of sources for creating the allotments. Some recycle content allotments (credits) can have their origin in methanolysis of recycled waste, or from gasification of recycled waste, or from mechanical recycling of waste plastic or metal recycling, and/or from pyrolyzing recycled waste, or from any other chemical or mechanical recycling technology. The recycle inventory may or may not track the origin or basis of obtaining a recycle content, or the recycle inventory may not allow one to associate the origin or basis of an allocation to the allocation applied to PVA. Thus, in this embodiment, it is sufficient that a recycle content value is deducted from recycle inventory and applied to PVA regardless of the source or origin of the recycle content value, provided that an allotment derived from pyrolyzing recycled waste is also obtained by the PVA manufacturer as specified in step (i) or step (ii), whether or not that allotment is actually deposited into the recycle inventory. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the allotment obtained in step (i) or (ii) is deposited into a recycle inventory of allotments. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the recycle content value deducted from the recycle inventory and applied to the PVA originates from pyrolyzing recycled waste.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0342">As used throughout, the recycle inventory of allotments can be owned by the PVA manufacturer, operated by the PVA manufacturer, owned or operated by other than the PVA manufacturer but at least in part for the PVA manufacturer, or licensed by the PVA manufacturer. Also, as used throughout, the PVA manufacturer may also include its Family of Entities. For example, while the PVA manufacturer may not own or operate the recycle inventory, one among its Family of Entities may own such a platform, or license it from an independent vendor, or operate it for the PVA manufacturer. Alternatively, an independent entity may own and/or operate the recycle inventory and for a service fee operate and/or manage at least a portion of the recycle inventory for the PVA manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0343">In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the PVA manufacturer obtains a supply of AD from a supplier, and also obtains an allotment from either (i) the supplier or (ii) from any other person or entity, where such allotment is derived from recycled waste, the pyrolysis of recycled waste, pyrolysis gas produced from the pyrolysis of recycled waste, and/or the cracking of r-pyoil produced from the pyrolysis of recycled waste, and optionally the allotment is obtained from the AD supplier and can even be an allotment by virtue of obtaining a r-A from the supplier.

In another example, the PVA manufacturer or its Family of Entities can have a first facility for making aldehyde within a first Site, and a second facility within the first Site or a second facility within a second Site where the second facility makes PVA, and transfer the aldehyde from the first facility or first Site to the second facility or second Site. The facilities or Sites can be in direct or indirect, continuous or discontinuous, fluid communication or pipe communication with each other. A recycle content value is then applied to (e.g. assigned to, designate to correspond to, attributed to, or associated with) the PVA to make a r-PVA. At least a portion of the recycle content value applied to the PVA is obtained from a recycle inventory.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0355">Optionally, one may communicate to a third party that the r-PVA has recycle content or is obtained or derived from recycled waste. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, one may communicate recycle content information about the PVA to a third party where such recycle content information is based on or derived from at least a portion of the allocation or credit. The third party may be a customer of the PVA manufacturer or supplier, or may be any other person or entity or governmental organization other than the entity owning the PVA. The communication may electronic, by document, by advertisement, or any other means of communication.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0356">In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, a recycle content poly(vinyl acetal) composition is obtained by either making a first r-PVA or by merely possessing (e.g. by way of purchase, transfer, or otherwise) a first r-PVA already having a recycle content, and transferring a recycle content value between a recycle inventory and the first r-PVA to obtain a second r-PVA having different recycle content value than the first r-PVA.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0357">In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the transferred recycle content value described above is deducted from the recycle inventory and applied to the first r-PVA to obtain a second r-PVA having a second recycle content value higher than the first r-PVA contains, to thereby increase the recycle content in first r-PVA.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0358">The recycle content in the first r-PVA need not be obtained from a recycle inventory, but rather can be attributed to PVA by any of the methods described herein (e.g. by virtue of using a r-A as a reactant feed), and the PVA manufacturer may seek to further increase the recycle content in the first r-PVA so made. In another example, a PVA distributor may have r-PVA in its inventory and seek to increase the recycle content value of the first r-PVA in its possession. The recycle content in the first r-PVA can be increased by applying a recycle content value withdrawn from a recycle inventory.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0359">The recycle content value quantity that is deducted from recycle inventory is flexible and will depend on the amount of recycle content applied to the PVA. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, it is at least sufficient to correspond with at least a portion of the recycle content in the r-PVA. This is useful if, as noted above, a portion of the PVA was made with r-A where the recycle content value in the r-A was not deposited into a recycle inventory, resulting in a r-PVA and one desires to increase the recycle content in the r-PVA by applying a recycle content value withdrawn from a recycle inventory; or where one possesses r-PVA (by way of purchase, transfer, or otherwise) and desires to increase its recycle content value. Alternatively, the entire recycle content in the r-PVA can be obtained by applying a recycle content value to the PVA obtained from a recycle inventory.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0360">The method for calculating the recycle content value is not limited, and can include the mass balance approach or the methods of calculation described above. The recycle inventory can be established on any basis and be a mix of basis. Examples of the origin for obtaining allotments deposited into a recycle inventory can be from pyrolyzing recycled waste, gasification of recycled waste, depolymerization of recycled waste such as through hydrolysis or methanolysis, and so on. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, at least a portion of the allocations deposited into the recycle inventory is attributable to pyrolyzing recycled waste (e.g. obtained from cracking r-pyoil or obtained from r-pygas). The recycle inventory may or may not track the origin of recycle content value deposited into the recycle inventory. In one embodiment or in combination with any of the mentioned embodiments, the recycle inventory distinguishes between a recycle content value obtained from pyrolyzing recycled waste (i.e., pyrolysis recycle content value) and recycle content values having their origin in other technologies (i.e., recycle content value). This may be accomplished simply by assigning distinguishing units of measure to the recycle content values having is origin in pyrolyzing recycled waste, or tracking the origin of the allocation by assigning or placing the allocation into a unique module, unique spreadsheet, unique column or row, unique database, unique taggants associated with a unit of measure, and the like to as to distinguish the:</p><p id="p-0319" num="0361">Origin of technology used to create the allotment, or</p><p id="p-0320" num="0362">The type of compound having recycle content from which the allocation is obtained, or</p><p id="p-0321" num="0363">The supplier or Site identity, or</p><p id="p-0322" num="0364">A combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0365">The recycle content value applied to the PVA from the recycle inventory does not have to be obtained from allotments having their origin in pyrolyzing recycled waste.

The deduction also does not mean that the quantity of the deduction disappears or is removed from the inventory logs. A deduction can be an adjustment of an entry, a withdrawal, an addition of an entry as a debit, or any other algorithm that adjusts inputs and outputs based on an amount of recycle content associated with a product and one or a cumulative amount of allocations on deposit in the recycle inventory. For example, a deduction can be a simple step of a reducing/debit entry from one column and an addition/credit to another column within the same program or books, or an algorithm that automates the deductions and entries/additions and/or applications or designations to a product slate. The step of applying a recycle content value to a PVA product also does not require the recycle content value or allocation to be applied physically to a PVA product or to any document issued in association with the PVA product sold. For example, a PVA manufacturer may ship PVA product to a customer and satisfy the &#x201c;application&#x201d; of the recycle content value to the PVA product by electronically transferring a recycle content credit or certification document to the customer, or by applying a recycle content value to a package or container containing the PVA or r-A.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0382">Some PVA manufacturers may be integrated into making downstream products using PVA as a raw material, such as making films or sheets, dispersions, and laminates with or on glass, or sandwiched between layers of glass, or laminated with other polymer sheets which can then be laminated onto glass or between glass layers.

For example, if 1000 kg of r-propylene or r-ethylene is used to make r-A, the AD manufacturer can designate less than 1000 kg of recycle content toward a particular batch of feedstock used to make the AD and may instead spread out the 1000 kg recycle content amount over various productions runs to make aldehyde.

Although any process for converting r-propylene to a (C<sub>4</sub>)-alkanal (e.g. butyraldehyde) can be employed, the rhodium catalyzed process, or the low pressure hydroformylation process, is a desirable synthetic route in view of its high catalyst activity and selectivity, and low pressure and low temperature requirements.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0423">More specifically, the hydroformylation process for making r-(C<sub>4</sub>)-alkanal includes contacting propylene with syn gas (H<sub>2</sub>, CO) and a catalyst complex in a reaction zone at an elevated temperature and elevated pressure for a sufficient period of time to permit reaction of propylene with syn gas to form (C<sub>4</sub>)-alkanal. Suitable methods for making (C<sub>4</sub>)-alkanal include the high and low pressure oxo processes, in which r-propylene is hydroformylated to make (C<sub>4</sub>)-alkanal. The hydroformylation reaction temperature can be any temperature from 50&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C. and the reaction pressure can be from 15 psig to about 5100 psig.

The allotments obtained and stored in recycle inventory can be obtained by any of the methods described above, and need not necessarily be allotments associated with r-aldehyde or the r-olefins. For example, the allotments can be obtained from any facility or source, so long as they originate from the pyrolysis of recycled waste, or the cracking r-pyoil or obtained from r-pygas.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0478">The fluid communication can be gaseous, or liquid if compressed. The fluid communication need not be continuous and can be interrupted by storage tanks, valves, or other purification or treatment facilities, so long as the fluid can be transported from one facility to the subsequent facility through, for example, an interconnecting pipe network and without the use of truck, train, ship, or airplane. For example, one or more storage vessels may be placed in the supply system so that the r-A facility feeds r-A to a storage facility and r-A can be withdrawn from the storage facility as needed by the PVA manufacturing facility, with valving and pumps and compressors utilized an in line with the piping network as needed. Further, the facilities may share the same site, or in other words, one site may contain two or more of the facilities. Additionally, the facilities may also share storage tank sites, or storage tanks for ancillary chemicals, or may also share utilities, steam or other heat sources, etc., yet also be considered as discrete facilities since their unit operations are separate.

For example, during at least a portion of the period of time in which the AD and the PVOH composition are combined, the temperature can be elevated to a first temperature, and subsequently the temperature can be raised to a second temperature higher than the first temperature. During at least 25% or the residence time, the reaction temperature can be maintained to at least about 50&#xb0; C., or at least 60&#xb0; C., and up to 110&#xb0; C., or up to 100&#xb0; C., or up to 95&#xb0; C., or up to 90&#xb0; C., or up to 85&#xb0; C., or up to 80&#xb0; C.

For example, a pr-A stream can be blended with an aldehyde composition that does not contain a recycle content, and in this case, the amount of acetal unit A obtained from pr-A would be proportional to the weight ratio of the aldehyde feedstock blend to make the PVA. For example, if 30 wt. % of the aldehyde feedstock is pr-A, the amount of acetal unit A obtained from a pr-A would also be 30 wt. % based on the weight of the acetal unit A present in the PVA. Based on the weight of the PVA, if the amount of the acetal unit A is, for example, 80 wt. % based on the weight of the PVA, and amount of acetal unit A derived from the pr-A would be 0.3&#xd7;80 wt. %, or 24 wt. % based on the weight of the PVA.

PVA polymers with greater residual hydroxyl content are typically correlated with reduced plasticizer compatibility or capacity, typically due to the hydrophobicity of the plasticizer being more compatible with fewer hydrophilic groups present on the polymer chain. Conversely, polymers with a lower residual hydroxyl content typically will result in increased plasticizer compatibility or capacity. Generally, this correlation between the residual hydroxyl content of a polymer and plasticizer compatibility/capacity can be manipulated and exploited to allow for addition of the proper amount of plasticizer to the polymer resin and to stably maintain differences in plasticizer content between multiple interlayers.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0514">The hydroxyl group content of the r-PVA resin is not particularly limited, but suitable amounts are from at least about 6, or at least about 8, or at least about 10, or at least about 11, or at least about 12, or at least about 13, or at least about 14, or at least about 15, or at least about 16, or at least about 17, and in each case up to about 35 wt. % PVOH.

The r-PVA resin can have a weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) of at least 20,000, or at least 30,000, or at least 40,000, or at least 50,000, or at least 60,000, or at least 70,000, with no particular upper limit, although practically up to 300,000 Daltons is suitable, and in each case as measured by size exclusion chromatography using the low angle laser light scattering (SEC/LALLS) method of Cotts and Ouano in tetra-hydrofuran. The term &#x201c;molecular weight&#x201d; means the weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>). The method for determining the molecular weight as set forth in this description includes using hexafluorisopropanol as the mobile phase (0.8 mL/minute). Each sample is prepared by weighing approximately 20 milligrams of resin into a 25 mL flask and adding 10 mL of the mobile phase. The flask is then placed in an automated shaking device until the polymer is fully dissolved. The analysis is performed using a three-detector system that includes a Viscotek GPCmax (with an autosampler, pump, and degasser), a Viscotek triple detector TDA302 (RALL/LALLS, Viscometer, and DRI combination) with a column oven (commercially available from Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The separation is performed by three Viscotek mixed bed columns, including a type I-MB (one low and two high range molecular weight) maintained at 45&#xb0; C. The complete detector set up is calibrated using a narrow poly(methyl methacrylate) standard (commercially available from Viscotek) with a reported molecular weight of 93.458, an intrinsic viscosity of 0.615, and a differential index of refraction (dn/dc) value of 0.1875. The refractive index of the mobile phase is 1.2649 and a do/dc value of 0.189 is used for PVB.

To remove the acid catalyst and other impurities from the resin particles, the reaction slurry or diluted reaction slurry is neutralized in a washing step. The purpose of the washing process is to extract the non-reacted aldehyde as well as the remains of the acid catalyst. Washing can be carried out in a continuous countercurrent washing process, desirably by using water as the extraction liquid. Alternatively, the neutralization/washing step can occur inside the reaction zone. Desirably the reaction slurry is first withdrawn from the reaction zone followed by neutralizing and washing.

Other water-miscible solvents may be used. The proportion of the water-miscible solvent in the washing liquid will vary under specific conditions but ordinarily will range between 40% and 60%, by weight, for operation at room temperature but may be reduced for operation at higher temperatures. R-PVA resin is removed at suitable intervals and subjected to further washing with water, or by the use of progressively weaker mixtures of the solvent with water, and finally of water. Methanol is a good water-miscible solvent and can be used at a concentration of 50-60%, by weight thereof, at a temperature of 45-55 C. The slurry is can then be cooled to below 40&#xb0; C. and drained. The precipitate can be agitated with fresh water and again drained, and this is repeated until the percentage of water miscible solvent in the wash liquid has been reduced to a satisfactory level, such as be not more than 5% by weight.

When 3 or more layers are employed, at least three of the layers can be referred to as skin layers and one or more one or more core layers.

As noted above, one approach is to correlate the mass of r-A fed as a feedstock to the PVA reactor with the mass of the aldehyde moiety in the resulting PVA taking into account yield. Another approach is to apply a recycle content value deducted from a recycle inventory which can result in a PVA having up to 100% recycle content.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0539">In one embodiment, the Tg of the r-PVA layers can be less than 50&#xb0; C.

The r-PVA sheet is molded into a sample disc of 25 millimeters (mm) in diameter. The r-PVA sample disc is placed between two 25 mm diameter parallel plate test fixtures of a Rheometrics Dynamic Spectrometer II. The r-PVA sample disc is tested in shear mode at an oscillation frequency of 1 Hertz as the temperature of the r-PVA sample is increased from &#x2212;20 to 70&#xb0; C. at a rate of 2&#xb0; C./minute.

Desirably, they are added to the monolithic interlayer or skin layer. Anti-blocking agents are known in the art, and any anti-blocking agent that does not adversely affect the properties of the interlayer may be used. A particularly preferred anti-blocking agent that can be successfully used as in the multilayer interlayer while not affecting optical properties of the interlayer or the adhesive properties of the interlayer to glass is a fatty acid amide (see, for example, U.S. Pat.

further illustrated by the following steam cracking examples. Examples were performed in a laboratory unit to simulate the results obtained in a commercial steam cracker. A drawing of the lab steam cracker is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Lab Steam Cracker <b>910</b> consisted of a section of &#x215c; inch Incoloy&#x2122; tubing <b>912</b> that was heated in a 24-inch Applied Test Systems three zone furnace <b>920</b>. Each zone (Zone 1 <b>922</b><i>a</i>, Zone 2 <b>922</b><i>b</i>, and Zone 3 <b>922</b><i>c</i>) in the furnace was heated by a 7-inch section of electrical coils. Thermocouples <b>924</b><i>a</i>, <b>924</b><i>b</i>, and <b>924</b><i>c </i>were fastened to the external walls at the mid-point of each zone for temperature control of the reactor. Internal reactor thermocouples <b>926</b><i>a </i>and <b>926</b><i>b </i>were also placed at the exit of Zone 1 and the exit of Zone 2, respectively. The r-pyoil source <b>930</b> was fed through line <b>980</b> to Isco syringe pump <b>990</b> and fed to the reactor through line <b>981</b><i>a</i>. The water source <b>940</b> was fed through line <b>982</b> to ICSO syringe pump <b>992</b> and fed to preheater <b>942</b> through line <b>983</b><i>a </i>for conversion to steam prior to entering the reactor in line <b>981</b><i>a </i>with pyoil. A propane cylinder <b>950</b> was attached by line <b>984</b> to mass flow controller <b>994</b>. The plant nitrogen source <b>970</b> was attached by line <b>988</b> to mass flow controller <b>996</b>. The propane or nitrogen stream was fed through line <b>983</b><i>a </i>to preheater <b>942</b> to facilitate even steam generation prior to entering the reactor in line <b>981</b><i>a</i>. Quartz glass wool was placed in the 1-inch space between the three zones of the furnace to reduce temperature gradients between them. In an optional configuration, the top internal thermocouple <b>922</b><i>a </i>was removed for a few examples to feed r-pyoil either at the mid-point of Zone 1 or at the transition between Zone 1 and Zone 2 through a section of &#x215b; inch diameter tubing. The dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> show the optional configurations. A heavier dashed line extends the feed point to the transition between Zone 1 and Zone 2. Steam was also optionally added at these positions in the reactor by feeding water from Isco syringe pump <b>992</b> through the dashed line <b>983</b><i>b</i>. r-Pyoil, and optionally steam, were then fed through dashed line <b>981</b><i>b </i>to the reactor. Thus, the reactor can be operated be feeding various combinations of components and at various locations. Typical operating conditions were heating the first zone to 600&#xb0; C., the second zone to about 700&#xb0; C., and the third zone to 375&#xb0; C. while maintaining 3 psig at the reactor exit. Typical flow rates of hydrocarbon feed and steam resulted in a 0.5 sec residence time in one 7-inch section of the furnace. The first 7-inch section of the furnace <b>922</b><i>a </i>was operated as the convection zone and the second 7-inch section <b>922</b><i>b </i>as the radiant zone of a steam cracker. The gaseous effluent of the reactor exited the reactor through line <b>972</b>. The stream was cooled with shell and tube condenser <b>934</b> and any condensed liquids were collected in glycol cooled sight glass <b>936</b>. The liquid material was removed periodically through line <b>978</b> for weighing and gas chromatography analysis. The gas stream was fed through line <b>976</b><i>a </i>for venting through a back-pressure regulator that maintained about 3 psig on the unit. The flow rate was measured with a Sensidyne Gilian Gilibrator-2 Calibrator. Periodically a portion of the gas stream was sent in line <b>976</b><i>b </i>to a gas chromatography sampling system for analysis. The unit could be was operated in a decoking mode by physically disconnecting propane line <b>984</b> and attaching air cylinder <b>960</b> with line <b>986</b> and flexible tubing line <b>974</b><i>a </i>to mass flow controlled <b>994</b>.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0556">Analysis of reaction feed components and products was done by gas chromatography. All percentages are by weight unless specified otherwise. Liquid samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7890A using a Restek RTX-1 column (30 meters&#xd7;320-micron ID, 0.5-micron film thickness) over a temperature range of 35&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. and a flame ionization detector. Gas samples were analyzed on an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph. This GC was configured to analyze refinery gas up to C<sub>6 </sub>with H<sub>2</sub>S content. The system used four valves, three detectors, 2 packed columns, 3 micro-packed columns, and 2 capillary columns. The columns used were the following: 2 ft&#xd7; 1/16 in, 1 mm i.d. HayeSep A 80/100 mesh UltiMetal Plus 41 mm; 1.7 m&#xd7; 1/16 in, 1 mm i.d. HayeSep A 80/100 mesh UltiMetal Plus 41 mm; 2 m&#xd7; 1/16 in, 1 mm i.d.

Molecular Sieve 5A 60/80 mesh in UltiMetal Plus; 2 m&#xd7;0.32 mm, Sum thickness DB-1 (123-1015, cut); 25 m&#xd7;0.32 mm, 8 um thickness HP-AL/S (19091P-S12). The FID channel was configured to analyze the hydrocarbons with the capillary columns from C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>5</sub>, while C<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>6+</sub> components are backflushed and measured as one peak at the beginning of the analysis. The first channel (reference gas He) was configured to analyze fixed gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O2, N2, and H<sub>2</sub>S). This channel was run isothermally, with all micro-packed columns installed inside a valve oven. The second TCD channel (third detector, reference gas N2) analyzed hydrogen through regular packed columns. The analyses from both chromatographs were combined based on the mass of each stream (gas and liquid where present) to provide an overall assay for the reactor.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0557">A typical run was made as follows:</p><p id="p-0450" num="0000">Nitrogen (130 sccm) was purged through the reactor system, and the reactor was heated (zone 1, zone 2, zone 3 setpoints 300&#xb0; C., 450&#xb0; C., 300&#xb0; C., respectively). Preheaters and cooler for post-reactor liquid collection were powered on. After 15 minutes and the preheater was above 100&#xb0; C., 0.1 mL/min water was added to the preheater to generate steam. The reactor temperature setpoints were raised to 450&#xb0; C., 600&#xb0; C., and 350&#xb0; C. for zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After another 10 minutes, the reactor temperature setpoints were raised to 600&#xb0; C., 700&#xb0; C., and 375&#xb0; C. for zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The N<sub>2 </sub>was decreased to zero as the propane flow was increased to 130 sccm. After 100 min at these conditions either r-pyoil or r-pyoil in naphtha was introduced, and the propane flow was reduced. The propane flow was 104 sccm, and the r-pyoil feed rate was 0.051 g/hr for a run with 80% propane and 20% r-pyoil. This material was steam cracked for 4.5 hr (with gas and liquid sampling). Then, 130 sccm propane flow was reestablished. After 1 hr, the reactor was cooled and purged with nitrogen.<br/>Steam Cracking with r-Pyoil Example 1.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0558">Table 3 contains examples of runs made in the lab steam cracker with propane, r-pyoil from Example 1, and various weight ratios of the two. Steam was fed to the reactor in a 0.4 steam to hydrocarbon ratio in all runs. Nitrogen (5% by weight relative to the hydrocarbon) was fed with steam in the run with only r-pyoil to aid in even steam generation. Comparative Example 1 is an example involving cracking only propane.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup

For example, both r-butadiene and cyclopentadiene increased as more r-pyoil is added to the feed. Additionally, aromatics (C6+) increased considerably with increased r-pyoil in the feed.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0560">Accountability decreased with increasing amounts of r-pyoil in these examples. It was determined that some r-pyoil in the feed was being held up in the preheater section. Due to the short run times, accountability was negatively affected. A slight increase in the slope of the reactor inlet line corrected the issue (see Example 24). Nonetheless, even with an accountability of 86% in Example 15, the trend was clear. The overall yield of r-ethylene and r-propylene decreased from about 50% to less than about 35% as the amount of r-pyoil in the feed increased. Indeed, feeding r-pyoil alone produced about 40% of aromatics (C6+) and unidentified higher boilers (see Example 15 and Example 24).</p><p id="p-0455" num="0561">r-Ethylene Yield&#x2014;r-Ethylene yield showed an increase from 30.7% to &#x3e;32% as 15% r-pyoil was co-cracked with propane. The yield of r-ethylene then remained about 32% until &#x3e;50% r-pyoil was used. With 100% r-pyoil, the yield of r-ethylene decreased to 21.5% due to the large amount of aromatics and unidentified high boilers (&#x3e;40%). Since r-pyoil cracks faster than propane, a feed with an increased amount of r-pyoil will crack faster to more r-propylene. The r-propylene can then react to form r-ethylene, diene and aromatics. When the concentration of r-pyoil was increased the amount of r-propylene cracked products was also increased. Thus, the increased amount of dienes can react with other dienes and olefins (like r-ethylene) leading to even more aromatics formation. So, at 100% r-pyoil in the feed, the amount of r-ethylene and r-propylene recovered was lower due to the high concentration of aromatics that formed. In fact, the olefin/aromatic dropped from 45.4 to 1.4 as r-pyoil was increased to 100% in the feed. Thus, the yield of r-ethylene increased as more r-pyoil was added to the feed mixture, at least to about 50% r-pyoil. Feeding pyoil in propane provides a way to increase the ethylene/propylene ratio on a steam cracker.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0562">r-Propylene Yield&#x2014;r-Propylene yield decreased with more r-pyoil in the feed. It dropped from 17.8% with propane only to 17.4% with 15% r-pyoil and then to 6.8% as 100% r-pyoil was cracked. r-Propylene formation did not decrease in these cases. r-Pyoil cracks at lower temperature than propane. As r-propylene is formed earlier in the reactor it has more time to converted to other materials&#x2014;like dienes and aromatics and r-ethylene. Thus, feeding r-pyoil with propane to a cracker provides a way to increase the yield of ethylene, dienes and aromatics.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0563">The r-ethylene/r-propylene ratio increased as more r-pyoil was added to the feed because an increase concentration of r-pyoil made r-propylene faster, and the r-propylene reacted to other cracked products&#x2014;like dienes, aromatics and r-ethylene.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0564">The ethylene to propylene ratio increased from 1.72 to 3.14 going from 100% propane to 100% r-pyoil cracking. The ratio was lower for 15% r-pyoil (0.54) than 20% r-pyoil (0.55) due to experimental error with the small change in r-pyoil feed and the error from having just one run at each condition.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0565">The olefin/aromatic ratio decreased from 45 with no r-pyoil in the feed to 1.4 with no propane in the feed. The decrease occurred mainly because r-pyoil cracked more readily than propane and thus more r-propylene was produced faster. This gave the r-propylene more time to react further&#x2014;to make more r-ethylene, dienes, and aromatics. Thus, aromatics increased, and r-propylene decreased with the olefin/aromatic ratio decreasing as a result.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0566">r-Butadiene increased as the concentration of r-pyoil in the feed increased, thus providing a way to increase r-butadiene yield. r-Butadiene increased from 1.73% with propane cracking, to about 2.3% with 15-20% r-pyoil in the feed, to 2.63% with 33% r-pyoil, and to 3.02% with 50% r-pyoil. The amount was 2.88% at 100% r-pyoil. Example 24 showed 3.37% r-butadiene observed in another run with 100% r-pyoil. This amount may be a more accurate value based on the accountability problems that occurred in Example 15. The increase in r-butadiene was the result of more severity in cracking as products like r-propylene continued to crack to other materials.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0567">Cyclopentadiene increased with increasing r-pyoil except for the decrease in going from 15%-20% r-pyoil (from 0.85 to 0.81). Again, some experimental error was likely. Thus, cyclopentadiene increased from 0.48% cracking propane only, to about 0.85% at 15-20% r-pyoil in the reactor feed, to 1.01% with 33% r-pyoil, to 1.25 with 50% r-pyoil, and 1.58% with 100% r-pyoil. The increase in cyclopentadiene was also the result of more severity in cracking as products like r-propylene continued to crack to other materials. Thus, cracking r-pyoil with propane provided a way to increase cyclopentadiene production.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0568">Operating with r-pyoil in the feed to the steam cracker resulted in less propane in the reactor effluent. In commercial operation, this would result in a decreased mass flow in the recycle loop. The lower flow would decrease cryogenic energy costs and potentially increase capacity on the plant if it is capacity constrained. Additionally, lower propane in the recycle loop would debottleneck the r-propylene fractionator if it is already capacity limited.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0000">Steam Cracking with r-Pyoil Examples

Both are desirable for cracking to r-ethylene and r-propylene.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0000">Steam Cracking with r-Pyoil Example 2.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0571">Table 5 contains runs made in the lab steam cracker with propane (Comparative Example 2), r-pyoil Example 2, and four runs with a propane/pyrolysis oil weight ratio of 80/20.

And conversely, r-propylene was higher in the higher flow examples with a higher steam to hydrocarbon ratio (Example 21-23) since it has less time to continue reacting.

Decreasing the steam to hydrocarbon ratio decreased the total flow in the reactor. This increased the residence time. As a result, there was an increase in the amount of r-ethylene and r-propylene produced. The r-ethylene to r-propylene ratio was larger which indicated that some r-propylene reacted to other products like r-ethylene.

As a result, the olefins to aromatic ratio was lower for cracking the combined feeds.

Except for that difference, the r-pyoils performed similarly, and any of them can be fed with C-2 to C-4 in a steam cracker. r-Pyoils having high aromatic content like r-pyoil Example 10 may not be the preferred feed for a steam cracker, and a r-pyoil having less than about 20% aromatic content should be considered a more preferred feed for co-cracking with ethane or propane.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0000">Steam Cracking r-Pyoil with Ethane</p><p id="p-0488" num="0583">Table 9 shows the results of cracking ethane and propane alone, and cracking with r-pyoil Example 2.

As can be seen in the Comparative Examples 5-7 and Comparative Example 3, conversion of ethane to products occurred more slowly than with propane. Comparative Example 5 with ethane and Comparative Example 3 with propane were run at the same molar flow rates and temperatures. However, conversion of ethane was only 52% (100%-46% ethane in product) vs 75% for propane. However, the r-ethylene/r-propylene ratio was much higher (67.53 vs 1.65) as ethane cracking produced mainly r-ethylene. The olefin to aromatics ratio for ethane cracking was also much higher for ethane cracking. The Comparative Examples 5-7 and Examples 41-43 compare cracking ethane to an 80/20 mixture of ethane and r-pyoil at 700&#xb0; C., 705&#xb0; C. and 710&#xb0; C. Production of total r-ethylene plus r-propylene increased with both ethane feed and the combined feed when the temperature was increased (an increase from about 46% to about 55% for both). Although the r-ethylene to r-propylene ratio decreased for ethane cracking with increasing temperature (from 67.53 at 700&#xb0; C. to 60.95 at 705&#xb0; C. to 54.13 at 710&#xb0; C.), the ratio increased for the mixed feed (from 20.59 to 24.44 to 28.66). r-Propylene was produced from the r-pyoil and some continued to crack generating more cracked products such as r-ethylene, dienes and aromatics. The amount of aromatics in propane cracking with r-pyoil at 700&#xb0; C. (2.86% in Comparative Example 8) was about the same as cracking ethane and r-pyoil at 710&#xb0; C. (2.79% in Example 43).</p><p id="p-0492" num="0586">Co-cracking ethane and r-pyoil required higher temperature to obtain more conversion to products compared to co-cracking with propane and r-pyoil. Ethane cracking produced mainly r-ethylene. Since a high temperature was required to crack ethane, cracking a mixture of ethane and r-pyoil produced more aromatics and dienes as some r-propylene reacted further. Operation in this mode would be appropriate if aromatics and dienes were desired with minimal production of r-propylene.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 59&#x2014;Plant Test</heading><p id="p-0493" num="0587">About 13,000 gallons from tank <b>1012</b> of r-pyoil were used in the plant test as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.

The r-pyoil contained a small amount of aromatics, less than 8 wt. %, but a lot of alkanes (more than 50%), thus making this material as a preferred feedstock for steam cracking to light olefins.

Temperatures at crossover and coil outlet changed differently depending on how propane flow and steam flow are maintained and how the furnace (the fuel supply to the firebox) was controlled. There were six coils in the testing furnace. There were several ways to control the furnace temperature via the fuel supply to the firebox. One of them was to control the furnace temperature by an individual coil outlet temperature, which was used in the test. Both a testing coil and a non-testing coil were used to control the furnace temperature for different test conditions.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 59.1&#x2014;at Fixed Propane Flow, Steam/HC Ratio and Furnace Fuel Supply (Condition 5A</heading><p id="p-0502" num="0593">In order to check the r-pyoil <b>1052</b><i>a </i>addition effect, propane flow and steam/HC ratio were held constant, and furnace temperature was set to control by a non-testing coil (Coil-C) outlet temperature.

One, there was more total flow in the testing coils due to r-pyoil <b>1052</b><i>a </i>addition, and two, r-pyoil <b>1052</b><i>a </i>evaporation from liquid to vapor in the coils at the convection section needed more heat thus dropping the temperature down. With a lower coil inlet temperature at the radiant section, the COT also dropped.

The propylene concentration increased as did the propylene:ethylene ratio relative to the baseline of no pyoil addition. This was the case even though the propane concentration also increased.
