Moreover, an image scanning unit <b>130</b> is disposed on the upper side of the printer unit <b>100</b>, and the image scanning unit <b>130</b> is provided with a scanner unit <b>10</b> and an automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>120</b> that serves as a document conveyance unit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of the copier <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The printer unit <b>100</b> includes, for example, an image processing unit B, an image memory C, an image drawing unit D, an image recording unit E, and a sheet feeder F.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image recording unit E includes, for example, a photoconductor drum <b>31</b> that serves as a latent-image bearer as well as a charging device <b>32</b>, a development device <b>33</b>, a transfer unit <b>34</b>, a separating unit <b>35</b>, and a cleaning device <b>36</b> that are arranged around the photoconductor drum <b>31</b>. On the downstream side of the separating unit <b>35</b>, a conveyance unit <b>37</b>, a fixing device <b>38</b>, and a sheet ejection unit <b>39</b> are further arranged, and these elements, i.e., the conveyance unit <b>37</b>, the fixing device <b>38</b>, and the sheet ejection unit <b>39</b>, are also included in the image recording unit E.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sheet feeder F includes, for example, a sheet tray <b>41</b> in which transfer paper P that serves as a recording material is stored and a paper feed <b>42</b> that feed the transfer paper P stored in the sheet tray <b>41</b> in a separate manner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The surface of the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> that is driven to rotate is evenly charged by the charging device <b>32</b>. The modulated laser beam is scanned in the axial direction of the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> based on the data obtained as a result of image processing performed by the image processing unit B on the image data scanned by the image scanning unit <b>130</b>, and emitted from the image drawing unit D to the surface of the electrically charged photoconductor drum <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a result, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photoconductor drum <b>31</b>. An electrostatic latent image that is formed on the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> is developed in the developing area facing the developing device <b>33</b> as an electrically charged toner sticks to the electrostatic latent image. As a result, a toner image is formed. In accordance with the above processes, the transfer paper P is fed and conveyed by the sheet feeder F at a prescribed timing to a transferring area in which the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> and the transfer unit <b>34</b> face each other. Then, the transfer paper P is electrically charged by the transfer unit <b>34</b> with reversed polarity to the toner image on the photoconductor drum <b>31</b>. As a result, the toner image that is formed on the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> is transferred onto the transfer paper P. Subsequently, the transfer paper P is separated from the photoconductor drum <b>31</b>, and is conveyed to the fixing device <b>38</b> by the conveyance unit <b>37</b>, and the toner image is fixed by the fixing device <b>38</b>. After that, the transfer paper P is ejected to the outside of the apparatus by the sheet ejection unit <b>39</b>. The surface of the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> from which the toner image has been transferred by the transfer unit <b>34</b> is cleaned by the cleaning device <b>36</b>, and the toner that remains on the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> is removed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The image processing unit B performs predetermined image processing on the image signal sent from the image scanning unit <b>130</b>. The image processing that is performed by the image processing unit B includes, for example, shading correction, brightness-to-density conversion, EE processing, discrimination between character and dot, filtering, scaling, copying, gamma correction, writing density correction, two-beam control, error diffusion processes, and data compression processes. Then, the image data that has been processed by the image processing unit B is stored in the image memory C on a temporary basis. The image data that is stored in the image memory C on a temporary basis is output to the image drawing unit D. In the image drawing unit D, writing light is output from a semiconductor laser based on the received image data. The writing light that is emitted from a semiconductor laser is rotationally scanned by a polygon mirror <b>22</b> that is driven to rotate by a driving motor <b>21</b>. The writing light that has rotationally been scanned passes through a f&#x3b8; lens <b>23</b> first, and then passes through a first mirror <b>24</b>, a second mirror <b>25</b>, a cylindrical lens <b>26</b>, and a third mirror <b>27</b>. Further, the writing light is emitted through a cover glass <b>28</b>, and the photoconductor drum <b>31</b> that is included in the image recording unit E is irradiated with the writing light.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the scanner unit <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>120</b> is mounted on the scanner unit <b>10</b>.
