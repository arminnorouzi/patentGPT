<b>130</b>, an optical system <b>140</b>, a first beam splitter <b>150</b>, a self-interference generating unit <b>160</b>, a first detecting unit <b>170</b>, and an image analysis unit <b>175</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light source unit <b>120</b> may generate and output light. For example, the light source unit <b>120</b> may generate and output a broadband or multi-wavelength light. The broadband light may be a multicolored light including light of a plurality of wavelength bands. The broadband light may have a wide wavelength range, for example, from an ultraviolet wavelength region (e.g., about 100 nm to about 400 nm) to an infrared wavelength region (e.g., about 750 nm to about 1,000 &#x3bc;m). As an example, the light source unit <b>120</b> may generate and output light of the wavelength range of about 150 nm to about 2,100 nm. Terms such as &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; may reflect amounts, sizes, orientations, or layouts that vary only in a small relative manner, and/or in a way that does not significantly alter the operation, functionality, or structure of certain elements. For example, a range from &#x201c;about 0.1 to about 1&#x201d; may encompass a range such as a 0%-5% deviation around 0.1 and a 0% to 5% deviation around 1, especially if such deviation maintains the same effect as the listed range.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light source unit <b>120</b> may be, for example, but is not limited to, a halogen lamp light source or an LED light source that produces a continuous spectrum light.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the light source unit <b>120</b> may include a monochromator. The monochromator may convert and output the broadband light into monochromatic light. Here, the monochromatic light may mean light having a very short wavelength width (i.e., bandwidth) (for example, light having a wavelength bandwidth of about several nm). The monochromator may output a plurality of monochromatic lights, while sweeping with a predetermined wavelength width in a predetermined wavelength range. For example, the monochromator may sweep the broadband light in a predetermined wavelength width unit. The monochromator may include, but is not limited to, a grid or a prism that splits an incident light for each wavelength.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The polarized light generating unit <b>130</b> may polarize and output the light emitted from the light source unit <b>120</b>. The polarization may include, for example, at least one of a linear polarization, a circular polarization, and an elliptical polarization. Accordingly, the polarized light generating unit <b>130</b> may generate and output the polarized light from the light source unit <b>120</b>.
