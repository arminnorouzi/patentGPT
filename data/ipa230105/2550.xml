Antimony trioxide is an inexpensive catalyst having excellent catalytic activity. However, when antimony trioxide is used as a main component, that is, when antimony trioxide is used in an amount sufficient to achieve a practical polymerization rate, metal antimony is deposited during polymerization, so that darkening and foreign matter occur on the polyester resin, which also causes surface defects of a film. Moreover, in the case where antimony trioxide is used as a raw material for a hollow molded product or the like, it is difficult to obtain a hollow molded product having excellent transparency. Due to such circumstances, a polyester resin that does not contain any antimony compound or contains no antimony compound as a catalyst main component is desired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A germanium compound has already been put into practical use as a catalyst that is a catalyst other than an antimony compound, that has excellent catalytic activity, and that provides a polyester resin that does not have the above-described problems. However, this catalyst has a problem that the catalyst is very expensive, and a problem that since the catalyst is easily distilled out of the reaction system during polymerization, the catalyst concentration of the reaction system changes and it becomes difficult to control the polymerization, so that there is a problem when the catalyst is used as a catalyst main component.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Polymerization catalysts that replace antimony-based or germanium-based catalysts have also been studied. Titanium compounds typified by tetraalkoxy titanates have already been proposed, but polyester resins produced using these compounds each have problems that the polyester resin is likely to be thermally deteriorated during melt molding and that the polyester resin is significantly colored.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the above-described circumstances, a polymerization catalyst that contains a metal component other than an antimony-based, germanium-based, and titanium-based components as a main metal component and that has excellent catalytic activity and provides a polyester resin having excellent color tone and thermal stability and providing a molded product having excellent transparency, is desired.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a novel polymerization catalyst, a catalyst system composed of an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound has been disclosed and is attracting attention (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By using the above polymerization catalyst, a polyester resin having good color tone, transparency, and thermal stability can be obtained. However, this method has a problem that the addition amount of the catalyst is large and the cost of the phosphorus compound used is also high, thereby increasing the cost of the catalyst required for polymerization.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, in order to obtain a high-quality polyester resin while maintaining high polymerization activity, it is necessary to increase the amounts of the aluminum compound and the addition phosphorus compound as a catalyst, and as a result, there is a problem that the catalyst cost is increased.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">Patent Document 1: International Publication No. WO2007/032325</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2006-169432</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0013">The present invention has been made to solve such problems of the conventional art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a high-quality polyester resin that is produced by using a polymerization catalyst containing an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound, that can reduce a catalyst cost, for which polymerization activity is high, and in which there is less foreign matter, and a method for producing the polyester resin.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0014">As a result of earnest studies being conducted in order to solve the above problems, the present inventors have found that the object can be achieved by reducing the amount of aluminum atom contained in a polyester resin and setting the mole ratio of phosphorus atom to aluminum atom to be in an appropriate range, and have arrived at the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">With regard to a polymerization catalyst such as an antimony compound and a germanium compound used in polyester polymerization, the polymerization activity is generally proportional to the amount of the catalyst. However, with regard to a polymerization catalyst containing an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound, a complex formation reaction of the aluminum compound and the phosphorus compound affects the polymerization activity, so that the relationship between the polymerization activity and the addition amount of the catalyst cannot be simplified.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">Therefore, the present inventors have analyzed the dominant factors of catalytic activity for a polymerization catalyst containing an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound. As a result, the present inventors have found that, by reducing the amount of aluminum atom in a polyester resin, setting the mole ratio of phosphorus atom to aluminum atom to be in an appropriate range, and further setting the acidity or basicity of an aluminum compound solution, a phosphorus compound solution, or a mixed solution thereof, which are added as a catalyst, to be in a preferable range, the catalyst cost can be reduced, an increase in the amount of aluminum-based foreign matter can be suppressed, and the polymerization activity can be improved.

In addition, generation of aluminum-based foreign matter can also be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0089">The aluminum atom in the aluminum compound which serves as a catalyst remains in almost 100% of the use amount initially added to the system as a catalyst, in the polyester resin produced through polymerization, even when being put in a reduced pressure environment during polymerization of the polyester resin.
