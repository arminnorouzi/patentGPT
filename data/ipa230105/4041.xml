C. and 85 &#xb0; C. due to temperature-dependent properties of the liquid crystal material used. Therefore, displays used in outdoor areas must he designed by performing heat management in order that these can operate at higher and/or lower temperatures. However, surface width and proximity to the external environment complicate this design and worsen other elements such as image quality, brightness. Therefore, it is required to perform heat management without distorting the existing properties of displays.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Chinese patent document No. CN105318636, an application in the state of the art, discloses a liquid crystal display freezer door. The freezer door comprises an aluminum alloy door frame, a hunt panel glass, a back panel glass, a transparent liquid ciystal display, a reflective film, and a light source. The from panel glass is arran,ged at the front end of the aluminum alloy door frame and the back panel glass is arranged at the back end thereof. A hollow and sealed space is formed between the front panel glass and the back panel glass. The transparent liquid crystal display is placed in the gap between these glasses. The display in the freezer door having this structure provides a good heat protection, and mprovement in transparency and image quality of the display.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Chinese patent document No. CN 205548146, an application in the state of the art, discloses a cupboard door body comprising a hollow glass. The door body comprises a transparent glass layer from outside to inside, a transparent display layer and a dimming glass layer. The transparent glass layer is always kept transparent and it is used to see the inner layer structure and protect the inner layer structure. The transparent glass layer is placed between the transparent glass layer and the dimming glass layer, and it does not make contact with both glass layers. Due to the small gap of the hollow structure, power consumption and change in internal temperature of the display cupboard are reduced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An objective of the present invention is to realize a heat insulation barrier and a liquid crystal display comprising it which enable to create image at higher and lower temperatures in comparison to existing displays without distorting image quality and brightness of displays.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another objective of the present invention is to realize a heat insulation barrier and a liquid crystal display comprising it which prevent convection of heat reaching the display by external factors, and provide heat insulation</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">&#x201c;A Heat Insulation Barrier and A Liquid Crystal Display Comprising It&#x201d; realized to fulfil the objectives of the present invention is shown in the figures attached, in which:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional view of the inventive heat insulation barrier wherein it is fixed to liquid crystal displays.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of the inventive heat insulation barrier wherein it is fixed to liquid crystal displays.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The components illustrated in the figure are individually numbered, where the numbers refer to the following:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">1.
