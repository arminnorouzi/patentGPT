and/or packaged hydrophilic catheter assemblies wherein the catheter assemblies include a catheter tube that has an activated or hydrated hydrophilic outer surface and a barrier sleeve or package surrounds the catheter tube.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to coat medical devices, such as urinary catheters, with a hydrophilic coating. When the hydrophilic coating is wetted or hydrated with a hydration medium it becomes extremely lubricous. The hydration medium may be, for example, liquid or vapor water or an aqueous solution. The lubriciousness of the hydrophilic coating eases introduction of the device into the body and aids in reducing pain and discomfort associated with such introduction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some urinary catheter products, the user directly contacts the urinary catheter with the user's fingers to remove the catheter from the package and inserts it into the urethra. In such products there may be a disadvantage in that the handling of the catheter by the user may introduce microorganisms onto the surface of the catheter which can cause infectious problems after being introduced into the body during catheter insertion. To address this issue, manufacturers have devised systems that include a protective or barrier sleeve or package surrounding the catheter. In this type of product, the catheter tube is located in a barrier/package sleeve. The sleeve/package may loosely fit the diameter of the catheter so that the user may grasp the catheter tube through the sleeve to manipulate the catheter, e.g., advance the catheter into the urethra. In some products, the distal end of the sleeve may be attached to the drainage member of the catheter and an insertion aid may be attached to or otherwise associated with the proximal end of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One complication of employing a sleeve over a hydrophilic catheter is how to activate or hydrate the hydrophilic surface of the catheter located within the interior cavity of the sleeve.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are several aspects of the present subject matter which may be embodied separately or together in the devices and systems described and claimed below.

Therefore, specific embodiments and features disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting the subject matter as defined in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure is directed to methods of making a sleeved or packaged hydrophilic urinary catheter product wherein the urinary catheter is ready-to-use right out of the outer package. That is, while in the package, the hydrophilic outer surface of the catheter tube within the interior cavity of the sleeve or package is in a hydrated/activated state, so that the catheter is ready-to-use right out of the package.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a catheter assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with present disclosure. The catheter assembly <b>10</b> includes an elongated catheter tube <b>12</b> having a proximal end portion <b>14</b> and a distal end portion <b>16</b>. The proximal end portion <b>14</b> of the catheter tube <b>12</b> is suitable for insertion into a lumen or a passageway of the body, such as the urethra. The proximal end portion <b>14</b> may include drainage holes or eyelets <b>18</b> for draining urine from the bladder. A drainage member <b>20</b> may be associated with the distal end portion <b>16</b> of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. The catheter tube <b>12</b> includes an outer hydrophilic surface that becomes lubricious when hydrated or activated. The outer surface may be, for example, any suitable hydrophilic coating.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The catheter assembly <b>10</b> also includes a sleeve <b>22</b>, which may be a protective or barrier sleeve that has a proximal end portion <b>24</b> and a distal end portion <b>26</b>. The sleeve <b>22</b> surrounds at least a portion of the catheter tube <b>12</b> to separate and enclose the portion of the catheter tube <b>12</b> from the outside environment. In other words, the protective sleeve <b>22</b> defines an interior cavity in which the catheter tube <b>12</b> may be located. In one embodiment, the sleeve <b>22</b> extends over the length of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. Optionally, an insertion aid <b>28</b> may be located at the proximal end portion <b>24</b> of the sleeve <b>22</b>. When an insertion aid <b>28</b> is present, the proximal end portion <b>24</b> of the sleeve <b>22</b> may be attached to a barrel or stem <b>30</b> of the insertion aid <b>28</b>, by for example, welding or adhesive. The distal end portion <b>26</b> of the sleeve <b>22</b> may be attached to the drainage member <b>20</b> or the distal end of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. An insertion aid may be used with any of the catheter assemblies disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sleeve <b>22</b> and any of the other sleeves disclosed herein may be made of a flexible material which may be vapor permeable or vapor impermeable, depending on the desired use and packaging. The material of the sleeve <b>22</b> may also be liquid impermeable. The sleeve <b>22</b> may be formed of any of a variety of thin, flexible polymeric film materials, such as polyethylene, plasticized PVC, or polypropylene, but elastomeric film materials such as polyurethane, and particularly elastomeric hydrogel materials, may be particularly suitable. The thickness of the film from which the sleeve <b>22</b> is formed may vary considerably depending on factors such as stretchability and flexibility of the material selected but, in general, the thickness may fall within the range of about 10 to 150 microns, preferably about 13 to 50 microns.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, these figures illustrate exemplary embodiments of the insertion aids. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the insertion aid <b>28</b> includes a proximal end portion <b>32</b> that defines an introducer tip <b>34</b>. The introducer tip <b>34</b> has a proximal end aperture or opening <b>36</b> defined by one or more slits between one or more flexible petals <b>38</b>. The petals <b>38</b> may move, bend and/or resiliently deform from the generally closed aperture configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> to an open aperture configuration (not shown) to allow for advancement of the catheter tube <b>12</b> therethrough. The distal end portion of the insertion aid <b>28</b> includes a cylindrical or barrel portion <b>30</b> that has an opening <b>40</b> for receiving the catheter tube <b>12</b>. The insertion aid <b>28</b> may also include an intermediate flange <b>42</b> that may contact the user about the urethra opening and act as a stop to limit the insertion of the introducer tip <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in this embodiment the insertion aid <b>28</b><i>a </i>is a port <b>29</b><i>a </i>that includes a flange <b>42</b><i>a </i>surrounding an aperture or opening <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The catheter tube <b>12</b> advances through opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>for insertion into the urethra. The distal end portion of the port <b>29</b><i>a </i>includes a cylindrical or barrel portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>that has an opening <b>40</b><i>a </i>for receiving the catheter tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the insertion aid <b>28</b>, optionally, may be covered by a removable protective cap <b>44</b>. The removable protective cap <b>44</b> covers the insertion aid <b>28</b> and may protect the insertion aid <b>28</b> from contacting surfaces and objects prior to use.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To use the catheter assembly <b>10</b>, the user opens and removes the catheter assembly <b>10</b> from an outer package (not shown). For example, the user opens the package and grasps the catheter tube <b>12</b> through the protective sleeve <b>22</b> to handle and manipulate the catheter assembly <b>10</b>. The user removes protective cap <b>44</b>, if one is present. If the catheter assembly <b>10</b> includes the insertion aid <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, then the user inserts the introducer tip <b>34</b> into the urethra. If the catheter assembly <b>10</b> includes the insertion aid <b>28</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, then the user aligns the opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the port <b>29</b><i>a </i>with the urethral opening. The user then grasps the catheter tube <b>12</b> through the sleeve <b>22</b> and advances the catheter tube <b>12</b> through the insertion aid <b>28</b>/<b>28</b><i>a </i>and into and through the urethra until the eyelets enter the bladder. If the catheter assembly <b>10</b> does not includes an insertion aid, then the user grasps the catheter tube <b>12</b> through the sleeve <b>22</b> and advances the tip of the catheter tube <b>12</b> out of the open end of the sleeve <b>22</b> and into the urethra. When the eyelets enter the bladder, urine flows through the eyelets and catheter tube <b>12</b> to drain the bladder.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one method of making a sleeved hydrophilic catheter wherein the hydrophilic surface is in an activated or hydrated state, such as those described above, the method includes injecting or delivering a hydration medium into the interior cavity of the sleeve of the catheter assembly. While in the sleeve, the hydration medium contacts the hydrophilic surface of the catheter to at least partially hydrate or activate the hydrophilic surface, and in one embodiment, fully hydrates the hydrophilic surface. Optionally, the hydration medium dwells within the sleeve for a selected time period, which may be sufficient to partially or fully hydrate/activate the hydrophilic surface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The hydration medium may be a liquid, foam or a gel. For example, the hydration medium may be liquid water or an aqueous solution or any other suitable liquid hydration medium. In one embodiment, the hydration medium may be an aqueous solution that includes water, glycerol and, optionally, other additives.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, the hydration medium may be a hydration foam that includes a liquid containing a mass of gas bubbles on or in the liquid. In one embodiment, the hydration foam medium includes, among other components, a liquid, a surfactant and gas. The liquid may be water or an aqueous solution. The surfactant may be any suitable foaming agent or surface tension reducing agent, such as sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, silicone surfactants or the like. The gas may be any suitable gas, such as ambient air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc. The gas may be homogenized with the liquid to form a foam. When the hydration medium is a hydration foam, the hydration medium may be foamed and then delivered into the sleeve. Alternatively, the hydration medium may be foamed at the same time as it is delivered into the sleeve, or may be foamed after it is delivered into the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, the hydration medium may be a water based gel. The gel based hydration medium may have a dual function, firstly hydrates hydrophilic coating and secondly protects retention of water. In one embodiment, the gel may be one that liquefies or becomes less viscous when exposed to radiation and may supplement hydration and lubriciousness of hydrophilic coating. For example, the gel may be a gellan gum based gel that is injected into the sleeve as a gel and then liquefies, breakdowns or becomes less viscous when the catheter assembly is exposed to sterilizing radiation, such as e-beam or gamma radiation. In one embodiment the gel may be a gel that includes 1.5 wt %-2 wt % of gellan gum, 1 wt % glycerol and 97 wt %-97.5 wt % of water.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hydration medium (liquid or gel) may have an elevated temperature during injection into the interior cavity of the sleeve. For example, the hydration medium may be at a temperature between 15&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the hydration medium may be at a temperature between 40&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C. during injection. Injecting the hydration medium at an elevated temperature may assist in the injection process. Additionally, injecting a hydration medium at an elevated temperature may lessen the time it takes for the hydration medium to hydrate/activate the hydrophilic surface of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the hydration medium is a gel, the gel may be injected into the sleeve as a hot gel solution at an elevated temperature, as discussed above. The hot gel solution may partially or substantially hydrate the hydrophilic coating of the catheter tube. Optionally, a selected amount of the hot gel solution may be withdrawn. Alternatively, the method may not include a withdrawal step. The gel in the sleeve or remaining in the sleeve after a withdrawal step may cool to ambient temperatures (e.g., about 23&#xb0; C. or below). When the gel cools, it may form a thin gel coating, such as a hydrogel coating, at least partially covering, and preferably substantially covering, the partially or substantially hydrated hydrophilic surface of the catheter tube. Additionally, there may be surplus deposits of gel located within the sleeve. Such gel deposits may be gel that is in the sleeve but not covering the catheter. Depending on the gel used, the gel may not hydrate the hydrophilic surface of the catheter while in the gel state, at least partially hydrate the hydrophilic surface of the catheter while in the gel state, or fully hydrate the hydrophilic surface of the catheter while in the gel state. Furthermore, the gel may be a gel that liquefies or becomes less viscous when the catheter assembly is exposed to sterilizing radiation. For example, after the gel injection step and optional withdrawal step, the gel may be covering the hydrophilic surface of the catheter and/or may otherwise be located in the sleeve. The catheter assembly is then placed in a package. The package may then be exposed to sterilizing radiation wherein the gel liquefies or becomes less viscous.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, this figure provides a schematic representation of a fill method that includes an injection system <b>52</b> for delivering hydration medium into the sleeve <b>22</b>.

The system also includes a pump or metering valves or other element <b>66</b> for moving/pumping hydration medium <b>56</b> so as to inject hydration medium into the sleeve <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed above, the method of forming the sleeved activated hydrophilic catheter may include, injecting a hydration medium into the interior cavity of the sleeve <b>22</b>, wherein the hydration medium comes into contact with the outer hydrophilic surface of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown and described one exemplary embodiment of forming the sleeved hydrophilic catheter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The nozzle <b>64</b> of the injection system is docked or connected to the drainage member <b>20</b>. It should be understood that catheter assembly <b>10</b> and the injection system <b>52</b> may be in any orientation. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> and the injection system <b>52</b> are shown in an orientation wherein the hydration medium is injected upward through catheter <b>12</b>, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> the hydration medium is injected downward through the catheter <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The outer diameter of the nozzle <b>64</b> may have a size that generally corresponds to the inner diameter of the drainage member <b>20</b>. After the nozzle <b>64</b> is dock, hydration medium <b>56</b> is injected from the nozzle <b>64</b> through the drainage member <b>20</b> and into the lumen of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the hydration medium <b>56</b> flows through the lumen and out of the eyelets <b>18</b> of the catheter tube <b>12</b> and into the sleeve <b>22</b> wherein the hydration medium contacts the hydrophilic surface of the catheter tube <b>12</b>. Optionally, the catheter tube <b>12</b> may also include an opening/eyelet <b>19</b> near or proximate the drainage member <b>20</b> wherein hydration medium is delivered into the sleeve through this opening <b>19</b>. As mentioned above, the hydration medium may be injected at an elevated temperature.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After the hydration medium <b>56</b> is injected into the sleeve, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> is then placed within an outer package (not shown) and the package is sealed. The outer package may then be submitted to sterilizing by e-beam or gamma radiation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the outer package may be made of a gas impermeable and liquid impermeable material, such as a polymer and aluminum laminate. Furthermore, the package may be of the type that has a vapor atmosphere or 100% relative humidity within the seal package. For example, the package may include therein a water compartment that is at least partial defined by a vapor permeable, liquid impermeable material. The water within the compartment may produce a water vapor that permeates through the vapor permeable, liquid impermeable material to create and/or maintain a hydration environment within the package. Additionally, when the catheter assembly is placed in a package having a vapor atmosphere, the sleeve may be vapor permeable to allow vapor to come into contact with the partially or substantially hydrated hydrophilic surface of the catheter tube. This may assist in maintaining the hydrophilic surface in an activated or hydrated state during storage and distribution. Alternatively, when the sleeve is made from a liquid and gas impermeable material and the interior cavity of the sleeve is sealed off, the outer package may be made from a gas permeable material.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates another hydrophilic catheter product <b>100</b> and method of forming the same.
