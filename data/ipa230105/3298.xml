id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rotation locking device for disabling rotation of a rotating member of a power transmission apparatus, and particularly relates to a rotation locking device in an automobile equipped with an automatic transmission and used in a parking locking mechanism or the like that locks rotation of an output shaft of the automatic transmission when a shift lever is shifted to select a parking (P) range.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">An automobile equipped with an automatic transmission includes a parking locking mechanism that locks rotation of the output shaft by engaging a claw-shaped parking locking pole with a parking locking gear provided on the output shaft of the automatic transmission in a case where the shift lever is shifted to select the P range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> illustrates a parking locking mechanism as described in JP 2010-006299A.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The parking locking mechanism <b>100</b> includes an actuator <b>101</b>, a shaft <b>102</b> rotationally driven by the actuator <b>101</b>, a detent plate <b>103</b> that pivots with the rotation of the shaft <b>102</b>, a rod <b>104</b> that moves linearly with the pivoting of the detent plate <b>103</b>, a parking locking gear <b>105</b> fixed to the output shaft of the automatic transmission, a parking locking pole <b>106</b> supported so as to be able to pivot around a pivot shaft parallel to the output shaft, and a detent spring <b>107</b> for

As a result, while the link members <b>45</b> pivot around the pivot support shafts <b>47</b>, the pivot support shafts <b>47</b> are pulled by the input member side engaging portions <b>20</b> via the link members <b>45</b>, which causes the pair of engaging elements <b>16</b> to move in directions away from the pressed surface <b>32</b> (toward the inside in the radial direction). Accordingly, the pressing surfaces <b>46</b> of the pair of engaging elements <b>16</b> are separated from the pressed surface <b>32</b>, and the pair of engaging element side output engaging portions <b>48</b> hold the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> of the output member <b>13</b> from both sides in the radial direction such that the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> and the pair of engaging element side output engaging portions <b>48</b> engage with no looseness.

Therefore, in the structure of this example, it is possible to effectively prevent the engaging elements <b>16</b> from shifting in the width direction and coming into contact with the pressed surface <b>32</b> after the locked state is released. In the structure of this example, guiding the movement of the engaging elements <b>16</b> inward in the radial direction can be performed by using the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b>, and therefore the number of parts can be reduced as compared with a structure incorporating another part used only for performing the guidance.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Moreover, in the structure of this example, the pair of guided surfaces <b>51</b> of the engaging element side output engaging portion <b>48</b> is composed of a pair of concave curved surfaces inclined in a direction in which the distance between the guided surfaces <b>51</b> increases as going toward the inside in the radial direction, and the pair of guide surfaces <b>25</b> of the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> is composed of a pair of convex curved surfaces that match the pair of concave curved surfaces of the pair of guided surfaces <b>51</b>. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>, in a state where the engaging elements <b>16</b> are separated toward the outside in the radial direction from the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b>, a gap is formed between the pair of guided surfaces <b>51</b> and the pair of guide surfaces <b>25</b>, and the size of the gap (dimension in the width direction) increases as going toward the outside in the radial direction. Therefore, in the structure of this example, in a state in which the engaging elements <b>16</b> are separated toward the outside in the radial direction from the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b>, movement of the engaging elements <b>16</b> in the width direction and the rotation direction can be appropriately allowed, and it is possible to effectively prevent an unreasonable force from being applied to the engaging elements <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">On the other hand, when rotational torque is reversely inputted to the output member <b>13</b> from the output side mechanism, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> rotates in the rotation direction of the output member <b>13</b> (clockwise in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) on the inner side of the pair of engaging element side output engaging portions <b>48</b>. Then, the corner portions, which are the connecting portions between the side surfaces <b>24</b> of the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> and one of the guide surfaces <b>25</b> of the pair of guide surfaces <b>25</b>, press the bottom surfaces <b>50</b> of the engaging element side output engaging portions <b>48</b> of the engaging elements <b>16</b> outward in the radial direction, which causes the engaging elements <b>16</b> to move in directions toward the pressed surface <b>32</b> (outward in the radial direction). Due to this, the pressing surfaces <b>46</b> of the pair of engaging elements <b>16</b> are pressed against the pressed surface <b>32</b>, and these pressing surfaces <b>46</b> frictionally engage with the pressed surface <b>32</b>. As a result, by transmitting the rotational torque that is reversely inputted to the output member <b>13</b> to the housing <b>15</b> that is fixed to other members and does not rotate (supported by the housing <b>15</b>), the rotational torque is completely blocked and is not transmitted to the input member <b>12</b>. More specifically, the pair of engaging elements <b>16</b> are pressed tightly (sandwiched) between the output member side engaging portion <b>23</b> and the pressed surface <b>32</b>, and the output member <b>13</b> is locked so that the pressing surfaces <b>46</b> do not slide with respect to (rotate relative to) the pressed surface <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In this example, each of the engaging elements <b>16</b> has pressing surfaces <b>46</b> at two locations on the outer side surface in the radial direction of the engaging element main body <b>44</b> and separated in the circumferential direction, and thus when rotational torque is reversely inputted to the output member <b>13</b>, the frictional engagement force between the pressed surface <b>32</b> and the pressing surfaces <b>46</b> can be increased.
