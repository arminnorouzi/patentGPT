As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a game system <b>10</b> according to this embodiment includes a server device <b>11</b> and one or more terminal devices <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for simplification, although only two terminal devices <b>12</b> are shown, an arbitrary number of terminal devices <b>12</b> may be provided.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The server device <b>11</b> is an information processing device, such as, for example, a server which is managed by a game operator, and may provide a game (game data) to the terminal device <b>12</b> owned by the individual user. The terminal device <b>12</b> may be, for example, an information processing device, such as a mobile phone, a smartphone, a PC, or a game device, and executes the game provided from the server device <b>11</b>. In this way, the server device <b>11</b> and the terminal device <b>12</b> may cooperate to control the game provided to the user of the terminal device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The outline of the game according to this embodiment will be described. The game according to this embodiment may be a game in which the user can play a game part using a game content, for example.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The game content may be electronic data which is used in the game, and may include, for example, an arbitrary medium, such as a card, an item, a ticket, a character, an avatar, or a virtual currency. The game content may be electronic data which may be acquired, possessed, used, managed, exchanged, combined, augmented, sold, discarded, and/or gifted in the game by the user, though the forms of use of the game content are not limited to those explicitly included in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, unless particularly specified, &#x201c;the game content owned by the user&#x201d; may indicate the game content associated with a user ID of the user. &#x201c;Giving the game content to the user&#x201d; indicates associating the game content with the user ID. &#x201c;Discarding the game content owned by the user&#x201d; indicates cancelling the association of the user ID and the game content. &#x201c;Consuming the game content owned by the user&#x201d; indicates cancelling the association of the user ID and the game content and causing any effect or influence to be generated in the game. &#x201c;Selling the game content owned by the user&#x201d; indicates cancelling the association of the user ID and the game content and associating a different game content (for example, a virtual currency, an item, or the like) with the user ID. &#x201c;Assigning a game content owned by a user A to a user B&#x201d; indicates cancelling the association of a user ID of the user A and the game content and associating the game content with a user ID of the user B.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The game part may be a content which is playable by the user in the game, and may include, for example, a quest, a mission, a mini game, an item acquisition event, a dungeon search event, a competition event with a competition opponent (for example, a different user, an enemy character, a building of an enemy, or the like), or the like. For example, in a case where it is determined that predetermined conditions (for example, a game task) set for each game part are successfully attained, a predetermined reward, for example, a game content, such as an item and a virtual currency, and points, such as an experience value, may be given to the user. For the game task, an arbitrary task according to the content of the game part, for example, a task for winning a competition with an enemy character, a task for attaining a goal of a dungeon, or the like is employable. In the following description, when a specific task (complete task) among the game tasks set for the game part is attained, this is referred to as game part complete. In other words, if it is determined that the complete task in the game part is successfully attained, it may be determined to be game part complete and the game part ends.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The game part according to this embodiment may be a game part for a single person in which the user plays alone. Specifically, as described below, the user which plays the game part performs a competition with, for example, an enemy character, such as a non-player character (NPC) using one or more first game contents (for example, a character) owned by the user and a second game content (for example, a character) owned by a different user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The game part according to this embodiment may be, for example, a horizontal scroll type action game. The user may operate a moving character, such as a motorcycle, to acquire a predetermined item while avoiding obstacles and the like. The first game content and the second game content may attack an enemy character according to the number of acquired predetermined items. If the hit points (HP) of the enemy character are decreased to zero by an attack, the user wins the competition with the enemy character, and it is determined to be game part complete. If the total HP of the first game content and the second game content decreases to zero by an attack from the enemy character, the play of the game part may be brought into a state of being unable to be continued (for example, a state of game over). The game part is not limited to the above-described action game, and for example, a game of an arbitrary genre, such as a puzzle game, a quiz game, a fighting game, or a simulation game constructing a virtual space, such as a street or a garden, is constructed, may be performed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the game according to this embodiment, a plurality of modes, which may be, for example, two modes including a &#x201c;normal mode&#x201d; and a &#x201c;practice mode&#x201d; such as are described below, may be provided for one game part. The user can determine a mode of the game part to the &#x201c;normal mode&#x201d; or the &#x201c;practice mode&#x201d;. Then, for example, game part settings, such as conditions required for executing the game part, may be switched according to the determined mode.

The predetermined upper limit value may be defined according to information (for example, user rank) relating to the user or may be a constant.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, the cost may be a parameter which is used for execution of a predetermined command to the first game content. The predetermined command may include, for example, an arbitrary command to the first game content, such as a command which causes the first game content to be provided (appear) on a game field, a command which causes the first game content to attack a competition opponent, or a command which causes the first game content to active a command skill described below. In a case where there are a plurality of commands corresponding to one first game content, the cost may be defined for each command. In a case where the value of the cost is equal to or less than a predetermined upper limit value, the command to the first game content may be executable. The predetermined upper limit value may be, for example, a predetermined points value associated with the user. The points decrease by the cost according to the execution of the command. The points may be increased (recovered), for example, over time, according to the use of a predetermined game content (for example, item), or according to activation of a predetermined command skill.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The experience value may be a parameter which can increase according to the play of the game. For example, the experience value may increase according to game part complete.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The level may be a parameter which increases according to the experience value. For example, if the experience value reaches a predetermined upper limit value, the experience value decreases to zero, and the level is incremented.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The hit points (HP) may be a parameter which is used for the execution of the game part. For example, if the total HP of the first game content included in the game content group decreases to zero during the execution of the game part, gameplay may be brought into a state of being unable to be continued. The total HP may decrease by the amount of damage by an enemy character, for example.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The attack power may be a parameter which is used for the execution of the game part.

In this embodiment, information relating to the game part may include a mode and game part setting in association with a game part ID as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The game part ID may be information capable of uniquely identifying the game part.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The mode may be information indicating the mode of the game part. In this embodiment, there may be two modes of a &#x201c;normal mode (first mode)&#x201d; and a &#x201c;practice mode (second mode)&#x201d;. At least one mode of the normal mode or the practice mode may be provided for one game part. In this embodiment, at least the normal mode maybe provided in the game part. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the normal mode and the practice mode are provided in a game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d;. Only the normal mode is provided in a game part &#x201c;gp002&#x201d;. For example, there may be a game part for which only the practice mode is provided.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The game part setting may be provided for each mode and may include information indicating various settings relating to the game part. When the game part is executed, a game part setting corresponding to a mode determined as described below may be used. In this embodiment, the game part setting may include stamina consumption, a time limit, reward information, or information relating to the continuation of the play.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The stamina consumption may be a parameter which indicates the amount of stamina required for the execution of the game part. As described above, the game part may be executed based on a requirement that the stamina of the user is consumed (subtracted) by the stamina consumption. The value of the stamina consumption may be different according to the mode of the game part. Preferably, the stamina consumption corresponding to the practice mode may be smaller than the stamina consumption corresponding to the normal mode, and may be defined as, for example, zero. With such a configuration, since a requirement for executing the game part in the practice mode is relaxed compared to the normal mode, the convenience of the game is improved.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, in the game part setting corresponding to the normal mode, the stamina consumption is defined to a value greater than zero. In the game part setting corresponding to the practice mode, the stamina consumption is defined to zero. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the stamina consumption corresponding to the normal mode of the game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d; is 25 points, and the stamina consumption corresponding to the practice mode is 0 points.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The time limit may be used for comparison with an elapsed time from the start of the game part during the play of the game part. For example, if the elapsed time reaches the time limit before the game part is completed, the play of the game part may be brought into a state of being unable to be continued (for example, a state of game over). In such a case, if CONTINUE described below is executed, for example, the elapsed time may be reset and the game part can be continuously played. The time limit may be different according to the mode of the game part. Preferably, the time limit corresponding to the practice mode may be longer than the time limit corresponding to the normal mode, and may be defined as, for example, unlimited. In such a configuration, since a possibility that the play of the game part in the practice mode is brought into a state of being unable to be continued is reduced compared to the normal mode, the convenience of the game is improved.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, in the game part setting corresponding to the normal mode, the time limit may be defined as unlimited or to a predetermined value. In the game part setting corresponding to the practice mode, the time limit may be defined as unlimited. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the time limit corresponding to the normal mode of the game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d; is 10 minutes, and the time limit corresponding to the practice mode is unlimited.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The reward information may include arbitrary information relating to a reward to be given to the user in a case where predetermined conditions are attained in the game part. The predetermined conditions may include, for example, a condition that a game task set for the game part is attained, but may include an arbitrary condition relating to the game part. In this embodiment, the reward information may include, for example, the type of reward, a quantity, and information indicating a probability that a reward is given in a case where the predetermined conditions are attained. The type of reward may include, for example, a game content, such as a character or a virtual currency, and points for increasing a parameter, such as the user experience value or the experience value of the first game content. The reward may be given by changing (updating) corresponding information or a parameter in information relating to the user.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The reward information may be different according to the mode of the game part. Preferably, the quantity of the reward or the probability corresponding to the practice mode may be smaller than the quantity of the reward or the probability corresponding to the normal mode, and may be defined to be, for example, zero. With such a configuration, for example, as described above, in a case where the requirement for executing the game part in the practice mode is relaxed compared to the normal mode, since the quantity of the reward or the probability decreases in the practice mode, the game balance may be appropriately adjusted. In a case where the quantity of the reward or the probability corresponding to the practice mode is defined to be zero, it is not necessary to update information relating to the user according to the execution of the game part in the practice mode. For this reason, for example, the game part in the practice mode may be executable on the terminal device <b>12</b> alone without performing communication between the server device <b>11</b> and the terminal device <b>12</b>, and it is possible to suppress a communication frequency and a communication amount.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this embodiment, in the game part setting corresponding to the normal mode, the reward information may be defined such that any reward may be given. In the game part setting corresponding to the practice mode, the reward information may be defined such that no reward is given. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the reward information corresponding to the normal mode of the game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d; is &#x201c;virtual currency.times.5, 10%&#x201d;, and this indicates that five virtual currencies are given with the probability of 10%. The reward information corresponding to the practice mode is &#x201c;null&#x201d;, and this indicates that no reward is given.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Information relating to the continuation of the play may include arbitrary information which is used for processing (for example, processing for performing CONTINUE) for continuing the play to be executed in a case where the play of the game part is brought into a state of being unable to be continued (for example, a state of game over) during the play of the game part. For example, when a condition that the total HP of the game content group decreases to zero during the play of the game part, or the like is attained and the game is over, in a case where CONTINUE is executed, the total HP increases to, for example, the maximum value, and the play of the game part can be continued. When the game is over during the play of the game part, in a case where CONTINUE is not executed, game over is determined and the game part ends.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, although information relating to the continuation of the play includes information indicating the possibility of CONTINUE in a case where the game is over, and information indicating a resource (for example, a game content, a virtual currency, or the like associated with the user) of the user consumed for performing CONTINUE, information relating to the continuation of the play may not be limited thereto. For example, information relating to the continuation of the play may further include information indicating the limited number of times that CONTINUE can be executed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Information relating to the continuation of the play may be different according to the mode of the game part. Preferably, information relating to the continuation of the play corresponding to the practice mode is defined such that CONTINUE is possible at the large number of times with a small number of resources (for example, with no resources) compared to the normal mode. With such a configuration, since CONTINUE can be easily executed in the practice mode compared to the normal mode, the convenience of the game is improved.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment, in the game part setting corresponding to the normal mode, information relating to the continuation of the play may be defined such that CONTINUE is impossible, or may be defined such that CONTINUE is possible by consuming some resources. In the game part setting corresponding to the practice mode, information relating to the continuation of the play may be defined such that CONTINUE is possible without consuming any resources. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, information relating to the continuation of the play corresponding to the normal mode of the game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d; indicates that CONTINUE is possible by consuming five virtual currencies. Information relating to the continuation of the play corresponding to the practice mode of the game part &#x201c;gp001&#x201d; indicates that CONTINUE is possible without consuming any resources. Information relating to the continuation of the play corresponding to the normal mode of the game part &#x201c;gp002&#x201d; indicates that CONTINUE is impossible.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Information relating to the game part is not limited to that described above.

In the following description, the same configurations as those in the first embodiment are represented by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated. The game system <b>10</b> includes a server device <b>11</b> and a plurality of terminal devices <b>12</b>. In summary, the second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that a game part is used for a competition between users. Hereinafter, specific description will be provided.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In a game according to this embodiment, first, if a first user (a user on offense first) selects a second user among a plurality of users, the second user is determined as a competition opponent (a user on offense last). Subsequently, the user on offense first plays a game part (first game part). In the first game part, the user on offense first performs a competition with an enemy character. Result information of the first game part, for example, may include scores that are determined based on a competition result (for example, win/loss) with the enemy character, the time required until the user on offense first defeats the enemy character, and the like. For example, if the user on offense first defeats the enemy character, scores are high. Similarly, for example, the shorter the time required until the user on offense first defeats the enemy character, the higher the scores.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">If the play of the first game part of the user on offense first ends, the user on offense last may play a game part (second game part) corresponding to the first game part. Although the second game part may be, for example, the same game part as the first game part or a game part corresponding to the first game part, other exemplary embodiments may be envisioned in which the second game part may be a game part completely different from the first game part. Similarly to the first game part, in the second game part, the user on offense last performs a competition with the enemy character. Similarly to the first game part, result information of the second game part, for example, scores are determined based on a competition result with the enemy character, the time required until the user on offense last defeats the enemy character, and the like.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">If the play of the second game part of the user on offense last ends, the result of an asynchronous competition may be determined based on the result information of the first game part of the user on offense first and the result information of the second game part of the user on offense last. Specifically, a user who has higher scores is defined as a winning user, and a user who has lower scores is defined as a losing user. In this embodiment, the competition between the users is not limited to the above-described asynchronous competition, and may be, for example, a synchronous competition in which the users simultaneously play one game part.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, each component of the game system <b>10</b> according to this embodiment will be described, primarily focusing on differences from the first embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Configuration of Server Device <b>11</b></heading><p id="p-0131" num="0130">First, the server device <b>11</b> will be described. The server device <b>11</b> may include a server communication unit <b>13</b>, a server storage unit <b>14</b>, and a server control unit <b>15</b>. The server communication unit <b>13</b>, the server storage unit <b>14</b>, and the server control unit <b>15</b> may be the same as those in the first embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In this embodiment, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, information relating to a user stored in the server storage unit <b>14</b> may include login information, a user experience value, a user rank, stamina, information relating to a game content, and a lock flag in association with a user ID. The login information, the user experience value, the user rank, stamina, and information relating to the game content may be the same as those in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The lock flag may be a flag indicating whether the state of the corresponding user is a lock state or a non-lock state. As described below, if a user on offense first and a user on offense last who perform a competition are determined, the states of the user on offense first and the user on offense last may be brought from the non-lock state into the lock state. If an asynchronous competition ends, the lock states of the user on offense first and the user on offense last may be released and the user on offense first and the user on offense last may be brought into the non-lock state. As described below, a user who is in the lock state may not be able to select a candidate user and start an asynchronous competition and is not selected as a candidate user by other users. That is, in this embodiment, control is performed such that two or more asynchronous competitions are not linked to one user simultaneously. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a user with the lock flag of &#x201c;1&#x201d; indicates a user in the lock state, and a user with the lock flag of &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicates a user in the non-lock state.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In this way, since control may be performed such that two or more asynchronous competitions are not linked to one user simultaneously using the lock flag, for example, many asynchronous competitions may be prevented from being linked to a specific user, and delay or obstruction of game progress may be suppressed. For example, the ratio of establishment of an asynchronous competition may be improved compared to a configuration in which many asynchronous competitions are linked to a specific user. Since the number of asynchronous competitions to be processed by the server device <b>11</b> in the entire game system <b>10</b> is suppressed, a processing load of the server device <b>11</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In this embodiment, if an acquisition request of information indicating a candidate user is received from the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first as described below, the server control unit <b>15</b> may extract, as a candidate user, one or more users in the non-lock state other than the user on offense first among a plurality of users. The server control unit <b>15</b> may transmit information indicating one or more extracted candidate users to the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Subsequently, if information indicating one user on offense last selected from among one or more candidate users is received from the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first, the server control unit <b>15</b> may define the user on offense first and the user on offense last to the lock state. The server control unit <b>15</b> may transmit, to the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense last, notification that the user is determined as the user on offense last, that is, a competition opponent in the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Subsequently, if the end of the asynchronous competition of the user on offense first and the user on offense last is detected, the server control unit <b>15</b> may determine the result (win/loss) of the asynchronous competition.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">For example, if the result information (for example, scores) of the first game part is received from the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first and the result information (for example, scores) of the second game part is received from the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense last, the server control unit <b>15</b> may detect the end of the asynchronous competition. In such a case, the server control unit <b>15</b> may define a user who has higher scores indicated in the result information among the user on offense first and the user on offense last as a winning user and defines a user who has lower scores as a losing user.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, in a case where the result information of the game part is not received from at least one of the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first and the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense last until a predetermined time elapses after the user on offense first and the user on offense last are defined to the lock state, the server control unit <b>15</b> may detect the end of the asynchronous competition. In such a case, the server control unit <b>15</b> may define a user regarding the terminal device <b>12</b> transmitting the result information as a winning user, and may define a user regarding the terminal device <b>12</b> not transmitting the result information as a losing user. Alternatively, in a case where the result of the game part is not received from both of the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense first and the terminal device <b>12</b> of the user on offense last, the server control unit <b>15</b> may determine the result to be a tie.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Configuration of Terminal Device <b>12</b></heading><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Next, the terminal device <b>12</b> will be described.
