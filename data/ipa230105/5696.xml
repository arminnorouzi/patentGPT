For example a mandrel with a gas conduit wound around in it in a tilted, helical shape provides a path for a fluid that experiences numerous field reversals that can arrest a gas breakdown from propagating through the conduit. Such a gas delivery system allows for flexible conduit design, which includes length and shape. However, it should be understood that the techniques described herein are generally applicable to a wide range of gas delivery systems and apparatuses, and are not limited to any particular apparatus type disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; means &#x201c;comprises.&#x201d; Further, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; does not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled items.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein should not be construed as limiting in any way. Instead, the present disclosure is directed toward all novel and non-obvious features and aspects of the various disclosed examples, alone and in various combinations and sub-combinations with one another. The disclosed systems, methods, and apparatuses are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combinations thereof, nor do the disclosed systems, methods, and apparatuses require that any one or more specific advantages be present or problems be solved. Any theories of operation are to facilitate explanation, but the disclosed systems, methods, and apparatus are not limited to such theories of operation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various ways in which the disclosed systems, methods, and apparatuses can be used in conjunction with other systems, methods, and apparatuses. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like &#x201c;produce&#x201d; and &#x201c;provide&#x201d; to describe the disclosed methods. These terms are high-level abstractions of the actual operations that are performed. The actual operations that correspond to these terms will vary depending on the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, values, procedures, or apparatuses are referred to as &#x201c;lowest&#x201d;, &#x201c;best&#x201d;, &#x201c;minimum,&#x201d; or the like. It will be appreciated that such descriptions are intended to indicate that a selection among many used functional alternatives can be made, and such selections need not be better, smaller, or otherwise preferable to other selections.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There are many industrial applications that require a gas for establishing a processing medium, such as a plasma or an ion beam, both focused and broad. Such applications may provide gas to a chamber or components that are at a high potential, such as 10's of kilovolts. Such gas, however, is usually at a much lower voltage before arriving at the high voltage regions, and this change in potential can cause problems, such as gas breakdown within the delivery system. If the gas breaks down in transit, the breakdown may cause a cascade effect that allows the breakdown to progress through all the gas within the delivery system. Such breakdown can cause process interruptions, equipment failure and bodily harm to nearby personnel. Gas breakdown is well understood and generally described by the Pachen curves for various gases. It is generally understood by those who practice that the Pachen curves give guidance for the minimum gas conduit length to prevent gas breakdown for a given delivery voltage. Unfortunately, for high voltage applications this requires long delivery lines, especially with gases delivered at low pressures, where such solution provides little flexibility in design&#x2014;both physical and operating parameters. As such, new solutions are desired.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One technique to address this problem is a reentrant gas delivery system where any fluid progressing through the system experiences multiple electric field reversals, which provide an arresting force to any breakdown that occurs. The reentrant gas system may be provided with a conduit that is formed into a tilted helical shape, where each winding of the helix includes both a forward progression and a backward progression. The conduit is formed such that, for a simple analogy, the fluid takes two steps forward and one step back with each winding. Such a system allows for design flexibility since the overall shape of the conduit can be compressed and variable. For example, the shape could be cylindrical or conical. Such flexibility allows designers to design with fewer constraints.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example dual beam microscope <b>100</b> including a reentrant gas delivery system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The microscope <b>100</b> can be used to image and prepare samples using a focused ion beam that is provided a gas by the reentrant gas delivery system. The reentrant gas delivery system reduces or eliminates some gas breakdown mechanisms along with providing flexibility of gas delivery design.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Microscope <b>100</b> includes an electron column <b>104</b>, a plasma-based focused ion beam (PFIB) column <b>106</b>, a moveable stage <b>112</b> and a detector <b>108</b> all encased or coupled to vacuum chamber <b>102</b>. Electron column <b>104</b> is a scanning electron column (SEM) in some examples, but can be omitted in other examples such that microscope <b>100</b> only incudes a PFIB column. The electron column <b>104</b> provides an electron beam <b>114</b> to a sample <b>110</b> disposed on stage <b>112</b> to image a surface of the sample <b>110</b>. Detector <b>108</b> detects secondary and/or backscattered electrons emitter or reflected from sample <b>110</b> in response to electron beam <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">PFIB column <b>106</b> generates and directs ion beam <b>116</b> toward the sample <b>110</b> for imaging and/or processing the sample. For imaging, detector <b>108</b> detects secondary and/or backscattered electrons emitter or reflected from sample <b>110</b> in response to ion beam <b>116</b>. In some examples, ion beam <b>116</b> can interact with precursor gases present at the surface of sample <b>110</b> to etch the sample or deposit materials on the surface of the sample. Such precursor gases may be provided by a gas injection system, not shown, as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">PFIB <b>106</b> includes a plasma-based ion source <b>120</b> that receives one or more gases from gas storage <b>128</b>. The one or more gases interact with a generated plasma to form ion beam <b>116</b>. The one or more gases can be reactive, nonreactive or a mixture thereof. Gas from gas storage <b>138</b> are provided to reentrant gas delivery system <b>122</b> via piping/tubing <b>124</b>. The gas is typically received by the reentrant gas delivery system at a ground potential, but the ion source <b>120</b> is typically at <b>10</b>'s of kilovolts. This change in potential can sometimes cause the gas to breakdown, which can be reduced or eliminated by the reentrant gas system <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reentrant gas system <b>122</b> includes reentrant gas conduit <b>130</b>, conduit <b>130</b> for short, supported by structure <b>126</b> and ion source <b>120</b>. In general, the reentrant gas conduit <b>130</b> includes a conduit formed into a tilted helical shape so that each turn of the helix is tilted such that each turn comes back part of the distance it progresses. As used herein, reentrant implies that fluids delivered by the conduit advance from one end to the other through a path that proceeds forward and backward in voltage by differing amounts or lengths per a winding of the tilted helical shape. As used herein, the fluid advances from low to high voltage via successively advancing an amount in voltage, and re-entering, by a smaller amount in voltage, then advancing to a yet greater amount of voltage, followed by the appropriate smaller re-entrant step, and etc. In some examples, the amount of forward and backward progression may be determined based on the strength of the electrical field the conduit is progressing, where the electric field establishes a gradient of equipotential lines between two electrodes. For example, the path may provide for the fluid to advance through X number of equipotential lines and back Y number of equipotential lines during one turn/winding of the tilted helix, where Y is less than X. In some examples, X is 2 and Y is 1, but other combinations are contemplated herein and covered by this disclosure. In general, the path, which may relate to the angle of the tilt, may be based on the strength of the gradient, where a higher gradient may increase the difference between X and Y, whereas a lower gradient may lessen that difference. By causing the gas to go backward and forward through lines of equipotential, the gas inside experiences at least one field reversal. Another example includes that when equipotential lines are established between two electrical potentials, and where each winding of the fluid delivery conduit advances through at least two equipotential lines and returns by at least one equipotential line progressing via adaptive form along any shape of equipotential lines. The field reversal allows for reduction or elimination of the potential for gas breakdown when progressing from low voltage potential, e.g., ground, to high voltage potential, e.g., &#x2dc;35 kV. Additionally, the tilted helical shape also provides for flexibility in designing and sizing the reentrant gas delivery system <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, conduit <b>130</b> may be wound around a support mandrel or other shaped structure, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> for examples, where the support structure extends between support <b>126</b> and ion source <b>120</b>. The support mandrel can be a rod formed from insulating material with grooves formed on the external surface for holding the conduit <b>130</b>. Besides the rod-shaped mandrel, the support structure can have a conical shape of varying height to radius ratios.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an example reentrant system <b>222</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The reentrant gas system <b>222</b>, or system <b>222</b> for short, is an example of reentrant gas system <b>122</b>. System <b>222</b> provides a fluid, such as a gas, from a low voltage potential to a higher voltage potential while reducing or eliminating the chance of fluid breakdown due to high voltage fields while providing flexibility in design and sizing. Although system <b>222</b> may be used in a microscope setting, system <b>222</b> may be used in any system that uses gases at a high voltage but are provided to the high voltage components from a lower voltage. An example system being a plasma arc-welding system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">System <b>222</b> includes support <b>226</b>, electrode <b>220</b>, and reentrant gas conduit <b>230</b>, or conduit <b>230</b> for short. Support <b>226</b> may provide physical support for conduit <b>230</b>, and may be conductive in some examples such that it may behave as an electrode. Electrode <b>220</b> may be part of a high voltage ion or plasma generation system being provided a gas by conduit <b>230</b>. In some examples, support <b>226</b> may be at a lower voltage, e.g., ground, than electrode <b>220</b>, which may be at <b>10</b>'s of kV. For example electrode <b>220</b> can be at a voltage in the range from 10 kV to 60 kV. Due to the voltage difference between support <b>226</b> and electrode <b>220</b>, an electric field is generated forming equipotential lines <b>236</b>. The rate of change of the electric field and the spacing and potential values of the equipotential lines are established by the distance between support <b>226</b> and electrode <b>220</b> and their relative voltage levels.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conduit <b>230</b> is formed from mandrel <b>234</b> and gas conduit <b>232</b>. Mandrel <b>234</b> is rod-shaped, as the term mandrel suggests, and can be made from insulating materials. Additionally, mandrel <b>234</b> may have grooves formed in the external surface sized to receive conduit <b>232</b>. The grooves are optional and may be used to retain the conduit <b>232</b> in the desired location and shape. Conduit <b>232</b> may be formed from flexible tubing that can be wound around mandrel <b>234</b> in the desired radius of curvature. Additionally, conduit <b>232</b> may be formed from a material that will not degrade from the gas or fluids being delivered therethrough. Alternatively, the grooves formed in mandrel <b>234</b> may be encapsulated so that the grooves themselves form the conduit <b>232</b>, or the conduit <b>232</b> can be cast into the mandrel <b>234</b>. Additionally, conduit <b>232</b>, once formed via mandrel <b>234</b> can be used independently of mandrel <b>234</b>. Further, conduit <b>232</b> used independently of mandrel <b>234</b> can be used to deliver a gas to a moving electrode where for example the spacing between electrode <b>226</b> and electrode <b>220</b> changes dynamically. Any of these options are possible and the use of separate conduit and mandrel is for illustrative purposes only and not limiting to the techniques disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed above regarding reentrant systems, conduit <b>232</b> is wound around mandrel <b>234</b> in a tilted, helical shape so that as a fluid flowing through the conduit <b>232</b> progresses from in to out, the fluid progresses forward a distance then back a portion of that distance in one winding before beginning the next winding. For example, if a fluid enters winding A (in a direction toward the page), then the fluid will come out at location A&#x2032;, which is two pitches behind A. A pitch as used herein is the distance between adjacent grooves in mandrel <b>234</b>. The pitch, or more specifically, the number of pitches the conduit travels in each winding, is based on the distance between adjacent equipotential lines <b>236</b>. To continue the example, fluid entering point B will come out at B&#x2032;, same for C and C&#x2032; and D and D&#x2032;. As such, fluids progressing through conduit <b>232</b> advance through two or more equipotential lines and return by one equipotential line per winding. This process of moving up the potential and back per widening causes the fluid in conduit <b>232</b> to experience an electric field reversal in each winding, which helps arrest or prevent fluid breakdown in high electric field applications. The two to one equipotential change is only an example and other variations are contemplated herein. It should also be noted that conduit <b>232</b> can be used without the mandrel <b>234</b>, which is used to provide physical support to the conduit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an example gas conduit <b>332</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Additionally, as one winding transitions to a subsequent winding, the change from top cell <b>10</b>, for example, to bottom cell <b>11</b> shows that conduit <b>532</b> progresses through three to four equipotential lines before returning through two equipotential lines at top cell <b>11</b>. This repeated forward and backward progression though equipotential lines establishes the field reversal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> in an example plot <b>501</b> showing the change in overall potential and the filed reversals of gas delivery conduit <b>530</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The left axis shows the voltage on cell as the conduit <b>532</b> progresses from 5 kV to &#x2dc;19 kV. As can be seen the voltage change from cell <b>10</b> to cell <b>20</b> shows a stairstep pattern as the cells progress forwards and backwards through the equipotential lines. The right axis shows the electric field reversals as the conduit <b>532</b> progresses between the same potentials.
