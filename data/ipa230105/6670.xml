Therefore, the control terminal of the switch <b>5</b> may be, for example, a base or a gate. In the solution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the switch <b>5</b> is an NMOS transistor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">In a further example, the switch <b>5</b> may have a threshold voltage Vth, which can be specifically understood as a gate-to-source threshold voltage that enables the switch to turn on.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">The first pin <b>1</b> and the second pin <b>2</b> can be any pins for digital signal transmission.

During pull-up, the pull-up can be achieved based on a pull-up resistor, for example, pull-up can be achieved by a 10 k&#x3a9; pull-up resistor.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">An instantaneous short-circuit pull-up unit may include an instantaneous short-circuit part (which can be understood as a one-shoot circuit part) and a pull-up part (which can be understood as a pull-up circuit part). The instantaneous short-circuit part can be understood as a circuit part that implements instantaneous short-circuit, the pull-up part can achieve a pull-up circuit part, and these parts can be connected in parallel and then connected to corresponding pins. For example, an instantaneous short-circuit part and a pull-up part in the first short-circuit pull-up unit can be connected in parallel, with both ends connected between the target pin and the first pin respectively; and an instantaneous short-circuit part and a pull-up part in the second short-circuit pull-up unit can be connected in parallel, and then connected between the second side of the second voltage regulating unit <b>33</b> and the second pin respectively.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0088">Therefore, instantaneous short-circuit between the target pin and the first pin, and instantaneous short-circuit between the second voltage regulating unit and the second pin can be achieved by the instantaneous short-circuit pull-up units. In a circuit, when transmission at a logic high level is detected on one side, the other side pulls up the level quickly through an instantaneous short-circuit circuit part in an instantaneous short-circuit pull-up unit to support signal transmission at a higher speed, and maintain a logic high level state after instantaneous short-circuit through a pull-up part connected in parallel with the instantaneous short-circuit pull-up unit (unless in a logic low level transmission stage). The pull-up part may be a pull-up resistor circuit that is fixed or can be controlled to turn on and off in the circuit, and if controllable, the pull-up part can be controlled by an enabling control unit or other circuits.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the above-mentioned first pin is an IOVH pin, the second pin is an IOVL pin, the target pin is a VCCEN pin, and the ground pin is a GND pin, in which the switch <b>5</b> can be a switch SW, and a threshold voltage of the switch SW is characterized as VTH, the first voltage regulating unit is LDO1, and the second voltage regulating unit is LDO2.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">Therefore, when a voltage of the VCCEN pin is a normal working voltage for the first reference high level VH_Ref, power is supplied to a level conversion circuit chip therein, the first reference high level VH_Ref of the VCCEN pin is input to the LDO1, and an output of the LDO1 is a normal working voltage of the second reference high level VL_Ref. In this case, a voltage at the second reference high level VL_Ref generated inside the chip through the LDO1 assumes the duties of an external second reference high level VL_Ref in the prior art;</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">the VCCEN pin also generates an output voltage through the LDO2, and controls on-off of the switch SW through the enabling control module <b>32</b>. In this case, an output of the LDO2 can be the second reference high level VL_Ref or VL_Ref+VTH.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">If VLDO2 (i.e., the voltage at the second side of the LDO2)=VL_Ref+VTH, signals in a range from GND to the second reference high level VL_Ref transmitted by the level conversion circuit can pass through, thereby accelerating the establishment of higher logic high levels.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0093">Finally, VH_Ref=GND, LDO1=VL_Ref=GND and LDO2=GND when VCCEN=GND, that is, a gate control voltage of the SW is GND, and thus, the whole level conversion circuit is completely turned off.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0094">It is thus learned that in the solution, a function of level conversion is well implemented, and two pins are reduced, so that die area is reduced and it is easier to select a suitable smaller package, thereby reducing the area of a finished chip. In this way, space is saved and costs are reduced for some space-constrained electronic devices such as mobile phones and wireless Bluetooth headsets.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0095">In actual application, considering that signal logic high levels of a receiver and a transmitter in a circuit system with level conversion are fixed, a voltage at the second reference high level VL_Ref can be stabilized in the level conversion circuit by the LDO1 and a control voltage of the SW can be stabilized by the LDO2 in advance. Therefore, voltages that would otherwise be input are now generated internally, so that pins of a chip are simplified.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0096">An embodiment of the present invention further provides an electronic device, including the above-mentioned level conversion circuit.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">Finally, it should be noted that the foregoing embodiments are merely intended for describing the technical solutions of the present invention rather than limiting the present invention.
