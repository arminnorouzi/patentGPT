In terms of technological development, the applications of renewable energy and battery energy storage elements have become more mature, and more and more appliances are changed to dc power. Therefore, the development of dc microgrids (MG) becomes the trend in the future energy systems. It has already been applied in certain applications, such as marine smart ships, [1]-[2], and dc residential grid networks, [3]-[5], and more applications will be developed in the coming future. The system architectures and the system control algorithms are two main research areas to develop dc MG technology. Apart from that, the system protection is another key concern in dc MG, as it is related to the safety and stability of the whole system. Thus, in order to offer safe operations in the dc MG, a high-reliability dc protection circuit is required.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past few years, under the incense in the popularity of dc MG, a variety of hybrid protection solutions, [6]-[20], have recently been proposed to offer high-quality protection features and to overcome the reliability issues in the traditional mechanical breakers. In [6], a typical hybrid circuit breaker solution is demonstrated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, where a fast mechanical switch is paralleling with a pair of high voltage semiconductor devices. The semiconductor pair is used to handle the transient process during the turn-on and turn-off moments, but it cannot enhance the reliability of the circuit breaker, and the galvanic isolation function of the relay is disabled. In [7] and [11], two different types of zero current switching (ZCS) hybrid circuit breaker solutions are presented, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, respectively. In [7], an LC resonant circuit is applied to achieve ZCS. In [11], a pre-charged capacitor is used to guide the current through the system during the turn-off action and to guarantee ZCS behavior. Thus, a highly efficient design is produced. However, similar to [6], these ZCS solutions cannot provide the galvanic isolation function. In [12], another type of hybrid circuit breaker is proposed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. In the circuit structure, an auxiliary semiconductor pair is applied to connect in series with the mechanical switch and a snubber capacitor is applied to connect in parallel with the main circuit, which results in an enhancement in the circuit turn-off capability and an improvement in the system reliability. However, the system conduction loss will be larger since two power semiconductor are turned-on at the same time, and no galvanic isolation function is provided. In [18], an isolated hybrid circuit breaker is presented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>. One more relay is involved in the hybrid circuit breaker solution, so the overall system can function with physical isolation. However, the design is in a single direction and the extra in mechanical switch causes a longer turn-off time and higher conduction losses.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE

In the design, each power line is handled by a mechanical relay to produce a low resistance connection path and the physical isolation feature in the turn-on and turn-off periods, respectively. Also, an auxiliary path is provided to handle the transient process in the dc breaker, which is formed by a mechanical relay and a pair of semiconductors. Based on the designed operational sequence, those power relays are able to operate under either under zero voltage switching (ZVS) or zero current switching (ZCS) during the transient action. As a result, the electrical stress in the mechanical relay is minimized, which results in an increase in the durability of the mechanical relay and provides the possibility of using an ac relay in a dc circuit. At the same time, the requirement on the mechanical relay can be reduced, so that it can be either dc or ac relays. The operation principles of the presented solution are given in this disclosure and describe the operational sequence in detail. A design guideline and selection of combinations are also provided. A 250 V 15 A experimental prototype has been implemented to verify the operation of the proposed circuit, that the system is able to provide a fast response in switching action and to protect the entire system under any system faults. The experimental results and detailed findings were consistent with the theoretical analysis.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0093">Circuit Structure</p><p id="p-0084" num="0094">The proposed solution comprises two main power relays, Relay 1 and 2 (conveniently referred to as R1, R2), and an auxiliary breaker path which is formed by a pair of semiconductor devices, S<sub>A</sub>, and an auxiliary relay, Relay A (conveniently referred to as RA), in series connection. The details of the configuration are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Two protection devices, diodes D<sub>1 </sub>and D<sub>2</sub>, are added to the circuit to protect those switches during the high energy breaking operations. Each of them is parallel to one end of the dc circuit. Two sets of current sensors, CTA and CTO, are applied which are used to measure the power line current and the auxiliary line current, as i<sub>O </sub>and i<sub>A </sub>separately. So that, an accurate fault detection and the general switching action are guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0095">Among those three mechanical relays, two of them are used to provide isolation on the main power path and the third one provides isolation in the auxiliary path. As a result, when a fault appears, both sides of the breaker circuit system can be physically isolated and a safe system environment can be guaranteed in the targeting MG application. Relays 1 and 2 are the two main relays in the circuit, which are used to establish the connection path between both systems ends and are the conduction channel on the general scenario. The turn-on and turn-off transient of Relay 1 and 2 are also under ZVS, therefore, the electrical arc is eliminated. Relay A is the auxiliary relay in the circuit, which is used to establish the connection path for the semiconductor pair during the transient period and are the major conduction channel during the braking action. The turn-on and turn-off transient of Relay A is also under both ZVS and ZCS, thus, the stress of switching transient can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0096">The pair of semiconductor device only functions actively during the turn-on and turn-off transient period and acts as a main breaker of the whole system. The semiconductors are used to compensate for the energy during braking and to offer the ZVS condition for the main mechanical breaker. As a result, the durability of the mechanical breaker system is enhanced. It can be realized by connecting two MOSFETs back-to-back in series or other bidirectional-blocking switch configurations. With this design, the proposed solution can achieve high reliability and high efficiency at the same time.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0097">In order to achieve ZVS in the mechanical relays, a specific operation sequence is required. According to the operating situations, the dc breaker will operate in different scenarios. A detailed operational sequences at the normal and fault situations are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, respectively. Also, a program flow of the turn-off sequence is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0098">Operation Sequence at Turn-on Situation</p><p id="p-0089" num="0099">Stage 1 [t=t<sub>1</sub>]&#x2014;After the start-up signal is given, the circuit begins to operate. Turn-on signals are given to R2 and RA. During this time, R2 becomes conduction and provides a return path for current. At the same time, the physical isolation of the auxiliary path is removed. RA becomes conduction and establishes a path to connect the semiconductor devices to both system terminals. At this period, the main connection channel is not yet established, so no current flows through the circuit. The breaker path in the auxiliary connection is settled and this stage accomplishes when R2 and RA are conducting.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0100">Stage 2 [t=t<sub>2</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-on signal is given to S<sub>A </sub>to release the bidirectional blocking from the semiconductor devices. During this time, S<sub>A </sub>becomes ON and a connection path between both ends of the circuit is established as an auxiliary channel. The dc current starts to flow from one terminal to the other through the auxiliary path. This period of time ends after the semiconductor is fully ON.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0101">Stage 3 [t=t<sub>3</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-on signal is given to R1. During this time, R1 becomes ON and is switched under zero voltage condition. The major connection path between both positive terminals is built up. Due to the lower resistance characteristic, the major dc current will bypass the auxiliary path and start to flow through R1 as I1. The overall output current, IO, remains the same at the last stage, however, the current in the auxiliary path, IA, starts to reduce. This period of time ends after R1 is fully ON in a certain time phase and a current reduction in IA is detected.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0102">Stage 4 [t=t<sub>4</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-off signal is given to S<sub>A </sub>to disable the auxiliary connection path. During this time, S<sub>A </sub>becomes OFF and is switched under zero voltage condition. Afterwards, the auxiliary channel is electrically disconnected from the main circuit. The dc current will only flow through the two main relays, in which I1 becomes the same as IO. This period ends when I1 becomes zero. And the system turn-on transient sequence is finished and only two main relays are remaining ON.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0103">Operation Sequence at Turn-Off Situation</p><p id="p-0094" num="0104">Stage 5 [t=t<sub>5</sub>]&#x2014;After the disconnection signal is given from the general shutdown process or from fault detection, the circuit turn-off operation sequence begins. A turn-on signal is given to S<sub>A </sub>to build up the connection path between both ends of the circuit as an auxiliary channel. During this time, S<sub>A </sub>becomes ON and a part of dc current starts to flow through this alternative path as IA. However, due to the high resistance characteristic, the major dc current still remains to conduct through R1. Also, IO remains the same at the previous stage. This period of time ends after the semiconductor is fully ON and a current reduction in I1 is detected.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0105">Stage 6 [t=t<sub>6</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-off signal is given to R1. During this time, R1 becomes OFF and is switched under zero voltage condition. The main conduction path in the positive terminal is disconnected, thus, I1 is forced to zero. The circuit still remains conducting, as, the auxiliary path is still connecting. The overall output current, IO, is kept similar to the last stage. This period of time ends after R1 is fully OFF and the current value of IA is exactly equal to I1.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0106">Stage 7 [t=t<sub>7</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-off signal is given to S<sub>A </sub>to disable the auxiliary connection path. During this time, S<sub>A </sub>becomes OFF and it acts as the main breaker during this period. All energy among the breaking action will be dissipated through the semiconductor devices. Therefore, the selection of the semiconductor is very significant in the design. This period ends when I1 becomes zero and the bidirectional blocking feature is reformulated. No more current is flowing through the breaker circuit.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0107">Stage 8 [t=t<sub>8</sub>]&#x2014;A turn-off signal is given to both RA and R2. During this time, both relays become OFF and are switched under zero current stress. Thus, during the turn-off transient action, no electrical stress is applied to the device. Afterwards, both of the auxiliary channel and the current return path are physically disconnected from the main circuit. As a result, through the dc circuit breaker, both sides of the systems are fully isolated from each other. This can guarantee to have a safe environment for workers during grid or device repairing. The circuit remains OFF until a reconnection signal is given.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0108">Design of Protection Circuit</p><p id="p-0099" num="0109">The proposed circuit is a hybrid dc breaker solution, which consists of both mechanical relays and semiconductor devices. In a traditional dc breaker solution, a single mechanical relay or a solid-state breaker is applied to act as both power line current conductors during the normal situation and circuit breaker during the transient situation.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0110">Among the traditional breaker technologies, mechanical relay and solid-state relay are two of the commonly used devices. Some of the existing dc breakers on the markets are listed in Table I as reference. The key features are highlighted in the table. The mechanical relays are physical switches, which use the electromagnetic contact to control the circuit operation. They are with low conduction resistance and can provide high-level insulation on the device. However it is not able to handle the surge current and the durability is usually bad, around 10 k times. In contrast, the solid-state relays are most likely semiconductor-based. It provides fast response and low contacting arc. The drawback is the high conduction resistance and the absence of physical isolation. Hence, for solid-state relays, the overall system reliability is limited and the system efficiency is restricted.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0111">Different from the single breaker solution, for the proposed solution, the major functions in the dc breaker circuit solution are separated clearly into two divisions, conduction and breaker. Each function is handled by a certain device, the advantage of both types of device can be fully utilized while their disadvantages are eliminated in the hybrid solution. In the design, mechanical switches are selected to handle the current conduction in the power line during the normal situation, and semiconductor-based switches are selected to handle the breaking action during the transient period.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0112">Selection of Mechanical Relays</p><p id="p-0103" num="0113">In the traditional approach, during each switching action, there is always an electrical arc between the two contracted planes. One of the examples is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, which is conducted under the on-site test. Under high voltage and high current on-off actions, the contracted plane will heat up and a small portion of the surface will be oxidized. For the oxidized area will result in high resistive and influence the next performance. After a long term repetitive breaking action, the surface will be completely oxidized and the contractor may be bent, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. Finally, the relay will no longer function properly and result in failure.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0114">In the proposed solution, mechanical switches are applied to handle the current conduction in the power line during the normal situation and to provide a physical isolation feature. The voltage rating of the relay is used to support the breakdown voltage of the system and the current rating of the relay is used to handle the current capability during the conduction period. However, different from the traditional approach, in the proposed solution, all the mechanical relays are switched under ZVS. Benefiting from that, in the selection of the relays, the design can consider:</p><p id="p-0105" num="0115">1) Ac relays in the proposed dc relay circuit. All the relays are switched under soft switching conditions, which means that no electrical stress is applied to the components during the transient actions. The voltage rating of the relays is only used to guarantee that the circuit with enough voltage insulation for the system. Therefore, ac relays can be adopted into the selection on the mechanical relays instead of the bulky and expensive dc relays. For example, a 250 Vac relay can apply to a dc circuit breaker design up to 353.6 Vdc. Therefore, it is especially suitable for low to medium voltages of dc MG.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0116">2) Mechanical durability as the system durability instead of electrical durability. All the relays are switched under zero electrical stress, which means that no more electrical arc appears in the transient mechanical action. The main power relay R1 is always paralleled with an auxiliary branch during the switching transient. Thus, a smooth transient action is guaranteed in R1. The other two relays, RA and R2, are even better which are switched under zero current situation. Overall, only mechanical operation during the switching time frame, but without any electrical stress. The reliability of the mechanical relays is enhanced, where the limitation in the electrical durability is becoming close to the mechanical ac relays at the datasheet value.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0117">In the target 250 Vdc 15 A dc breaker system, an ac relay, G2R-1A-E, is selected. It features with a 16 A current capability at 250 Vac voltage, 100 k times in mechanical durability, and 2 m&#x3a9; low resistance characteristics.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0118">Selection of Semiconductors</p><p id="p-0109" num="0119">In the design, semiconductor switches are applied to handle the transient switching action in the breaker circuit. Also, in order to offer a bidirectional blocking function, the semiconductor switches are required to be in a pair. For discrete devices, they can be arranged into a back-to-back, drain-to-drain or other bidirectional configuration. The voltage rating of both semiconductors should consider the breakdown voltage of the system and the current rating of the semiconductors is used to handle the current capability during the transient situation.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0120">Among the switching sequences, the most critical breaking action appears in stage 7. At stage 4 and stage 5, S<sub>A </sub>is switched ON and OFF under zero voltage conditions, respectively. However, at stage 7, due to the presence of parasitic inductance in the loop, high voltage stress will occur between the drain and source of the semiconductor under the turn-off transient. The detailed switching action of S<sub>A </sub>during stage 7 is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0121">For IGBTs or other semiconductors without overvoltage capability, the worst-case scenario will be the device breakdown voltage is reached and the device fault has happened. Thus, a metal oxide varistor (MOV) is required to connect in parallel with the semiconductor pair to protect the excessive transient voltage. For power MOSFET, the worst-case scenario is that it will enter the avalanche mode. Generally, inside a traditional MOSFET, there is a group of parasitic components inside the physical structure, such as parasitic resistance in P-well channel structure and a parasitic NPN bipolar transistor structure [21]. Normally, the parasitic NPN is effectively shorted. However, during the turn-off moment, a strong electric field is resultant inside the device which causes current flow proximity to the parasitic NPN transistor internally. Once the current flow causes sufficient voltage across on it, the parasitic bipolar transistor will become activated and will claim the device voltage at a value that is 1.2 to 1.3 times higher than the general breakdown voltage.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0122">By applying the Kirchhoff's voltage law to the main current loop, the detail characteristic of the overvoltage or the avalanche period can be determined.

The prototype shows that the entire system is controlled by a single microcontroller and the protection feature comes from the accurate current detection by the Hall-effect sensors. Compared to the two relays traditional system, in the proposed solution, an extra relay and a pair of semiconductor switches were applied, in which the semiconductor pair were arranged in back-to-back connection. According to the given control strategy, the power consumption of the auxiliary circuit was kept within 3 W. At the standby mode, only 0.95 W was consumed. At the normal operation mode, 2.85 W was consumed, which is closed to the traditional approach.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0128">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, it demonstrates the complete operating sequence and stable system performance of the circuit during on and off conditions, where the sequence is the same as the one proposed earlier.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, after the turn-on signal was provided to R1 at t<sub>1</sub>, the first mechanical action appeared in 8 ms afterward. In each operation, there involved two mechanical actions. During the turn-on transient, half of the time was used to set up the conducting path at R2 and RA. And another half of the time was used to handle the current conduction action, especially for the setup on R1. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, after the first mechanical action is ready, it still requires a settling time to stabilize the relay. Similarly, during the turn-off transient, half of the time was used to handle the current breaking action on R1 and S<sub>A </sub>and another half was used to set up the isolation feature at R2 and RA. Finally, the required start-up time was around 25 ms and the breaking time was around 16 ms, which was still within the 30 ms range.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0130">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, it shows the switching pattern that relates to the circuit isolation feature.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, it shows the switching pattern that relates to the main current conduction. S<sub>A </sub>was only active during the switching transient at the dc breaker circuit.

In the concept, it makes use of both mechanical switches and semiconductor switches. Each of them deals with a key feature in the dc breaker. The mechanical switches focus on the normal conduction and the semiconductor switches handle the breaker transient. Therefore, the breaker design guarantees with bidirectional current flow, galvanic isolation, high reliability, and high efficiency. The performance of the proposed concept was experimentally verified in a 250 V, 15 A dc breaker setup, where the operation of both resistive and inductive loads have been tested. The results showed that the proposed solution achieved a fast response in switching action and was featured with high-reliability performance. All the demonstration results are shown with good agreement is achieved between theoretical concepts and experimental results. The proposed Dc hybrid breaker is promosing for the applications of dc grid, PV array and battery protections.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0135">As described hereinbefore, an aspect of the present invention relates to a new hybrid circuit breaker solution for use in dc microgrids which hoffers a high-reliability projection feature for the dc microgrid with bidirectional current flow, high-durability and galvanic isolation function. The circuit breaker comprises a group of mechanical switches and semiconductors, in which the mechanical switches handle the current conduction in the normal situation and the semiconductors handle the breaker response in transient action. The design fully utilizes the advantage of both types of switch and maximizes the performance and lifetime of the system. The high conductivity of the mechanical switch is maintained, but the electrical stress during transient applied to the mechanical switch is eliminated. Thus, an effective solution is provided for the design of dc circuit breakers. The operation principle is explained in details and the design guideline is provided. A 150 Vdc/15 A circuit breaker is successfully implemented and the performance is experimentally verified which shows good agreement with the theoretical findings.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0136">The scope of the claims should not be limited by the preferred embodiments set forth in the examples but should be given the broadest interpretation consistent with the specification as a whole.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0000"><ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0137">[1] Accetta and M.
