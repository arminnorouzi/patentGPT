Therefore, the wafer leaving the chamber may have an adverse effect on the wafer entering the chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a transfer apparatus and a processing system including the transfer apparatus, such as a semiconductor processing system or a plasma processing system. In order to achieve rapid transfer, a transfer apparatus such as a transfer chamber may generally include a plurality of transfer assemblies such as a plurality of robot arms, which may transfer a plurality of workpieces such as wafers at the same time. For example, the wafers on the upper robot arms are ready to enter the chamber for being processed, and the wafers on the lower robot arms are ready to return to a wafer boat, after being processed. These wafers may overlap in the vertical projection direction. Therefore, a photoresist on the wafers at the upper robot arms will shrink to some extent by the wafers at the lower robot arms with high temperature, resulting in a relatively high ash (i.e., photoresist removal) rate, which will finally make the ash rate unrepeatable. To overwhelm and minimize the unrepeatable ash rate resulting from the effect of photoresist shrinkage, methods of extending process recipe time and adding pre-season dummy wafers before production wafers are employed. However, such methods have many disadvantages of, for example, too much ash time, low throughput, high cost of tool maintenance, and need of more time to season the chamber.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, by adding the isolation assembly between the transfer assemblies in the transfer apparatus such as the transfer chamber, for example, by adding an isolation sheet between upper and lower coaxial robot arms, an effect of photoresist shrinkage on the wafer entering the chamber due to high temperature of the wafer leaving the chamber may be effectively eliminated to ensure the repeatability of the ash rate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a processing system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The support assembly and the isolation assembly are in suspension connection by means of a magnetic force and/or the like, such that there is a certain gap between the support assembly and the isolation assembly, which reduces the frictional force between the support assembly and the isolation assembly and makes the relative rotation between the support assembly and the isolation assembly more smooth.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an example, the first workpiece entering the chamber on the first transfer assembly <b>201</b> is relatively low in temperature, and the second workpiece leaving the chamber on the second transfer assembly <b>202</b> is relatively high in temperature after being processed.
