Olive picking is an important operation that affects virgin olive oil quality, since its sensory quality depends on the health and ripeness of the harvested olives. Traditionally, olives were hand-picked. Currently, harvesting is performed by a variety of types of shakers that transmit vibrations to the tree branches, causing the olives to drop into nets that have previously been placed under the tree canopy and then they are collected with vacuum systems. Increasing ripeness generally increases yield in terms of release of olives from the tree branches. However, over-mature olives do not possess the best sensory qualities for oil production. Therefore, harvesting time is frequently a compromise between harvesting efficiency and final oil quality.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">After harvesting, the olives are transported to the olive mill. In any case, the harvested olives should be transported in such a way that air circulation prevents the rise of temperature on the bottom layers of olives. Regardless of the transport system, the olives should be stored under optimal conditions from the moment of harvesting up to their processing at the mill. The time between both events should be no longer than two days to avoid significant changes in the oil sensory profile of healthy and optimally ripe olives. The olives arriving at the olive mill do not have the same characteristics: there will be olives of various cultivars, at different levels of maturity and even in different sanitary conditions (e.g. infested by parasites), which demands the classification of batches according to pre-established quality levels. Thus, batches are weighed and later inspected by an expert who channels them to the reception lanes that match their quality. A sample of olives representative of the whole batch is randomly taken for several analyses: humidity, free acidity, yield and sensory assessment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After arriving at the olive mill, the olives are washed to remove dirt, leaves and twigs, as these materials could be harmful to the olive mill machinery and they could also modify the sensory attributes of the extracted olive oil, e.g. the presence of leaves increases bitterness. The machinery consists of powerful fans, which remove foreign vegetable material, and pipes with forced water circulation in which olives are washed. After the dirt, leaves and twigs are filtered out, the olives are ready for processing into oil. They are put on a moving belt to the processing zone of the olive mill.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment the enzymes are added during and/or after crushing olives into olive paste. The crushing process is important in order to guarantee the taste and aroma of the end product and also the yield of the extraction process. The term &#x201c;crushing&#x201d; as used herein also encompasses milling and grinding Traditional olive oil processing begins with crushing the olives into a paste. The purpose of the crushing is to facilitate the release of the oil from the vacuoles. The crushing can be done in a traditional stone mill having large granite stones. The mill may also be motorized including wiper blades. Modern olive mills are partially or fully automated and have replaced granite stones with metal crushers. They consist of a stainless-steel body and a stainless steel crusher that rotates at high speed. The olives are typically thrown against a hammer-shaped metal grating. Alternatives include toothed disc, cylinder, and roller mills. Modern milling is very gentle in order to avoid overheating of the paste. Cold pressed (extra virgin) oils must not exceed 27&#xb0; C. at any step in the processing of the oil.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment the enzymes are added in an amount ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm. In an embodiment the enzymes are added in an amount ranging from 150 to 900 ppm. In an embodiment the enzymes are added in an amount ranging from 200 to 800 ppm, In an embodiment the enzymes are added in an amount ranging from 250 to 700 ppm. In an embodiment the enzymes are added in an amount ranging from 300 to 600 ppm.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Variety and maturation are two of the most important factors of olives that influence the quality and taste of the final olive oil. Maturation can be measured based on the maturity index.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 0 or 1. When the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 0 or 1, obviously also the olive oil produced from the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 0 or 1.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a preferred embodiment when the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 0 or 1, the enzymes further comprise a beta-glucanase. The present application therefore also relates to a process for producing olive oil comprising the step of adding enzymes to olive paste made from olives having a maturity index of 0 or 1 and incubating the obtained mixture, wherein the enzymes comprise a polygalacturonase, a pectin methyl esterase, a pectin lyase, an arabinofuranosidase, a cellulase, a xylanase, a rhamnogalacturonase, a mannanase and a beta-glucanase.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 2 or 3. When the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 2 or 3, obviously also the olive oil produced from the olive paste is made from olives having a maturity index of 2 or 3.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The maturity index of olives can be calculated as follows. Firstly, take a random sample of about 2 pounds of olives from several trees of the same variety in the area where harvest is imminent. The olives should be selected from high and low in the trees and from all sides. All the olives from a branch should be collected here and there rather than individual olives. The olives can be collected in a sample bucket. Secondly, select 100 olives out of the sample bucket. Repeat this 3-10 times until all olives are gone. Thirdly, separate each 100 olives sample into 8 color categories based on the following color chart: 0=deep-green skin, fruit hard; 1=green-yellowish skin, fruit starting to soften; 2=green skin with reddish spots (i.e. &#x3c;50% of the skin turning red, purple or black); 3=reddish-brown skin (i.e. &#x3e;50% of the skin turning red, purple or black); 4=purple or black skin with all white or green flesh; 5=purple or black skin with &#x3c;50% of the flesh turning purple; 6=purple or black skin with &#x3e;50% but &#x3c;100% of the flesh turning purple; 7=purple or black skin with purple flesh to the pit. Fourthly, multiply the number of olives in each color category by the number of that color category (0 to 7). Fifthly, add all the number together and divide by 100.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">There are hundreds of varieties of olive trees. A wide range of olive varieties are used in the production of olive oil. These include Picual, Mission, Manzanillo, Sevillano, Arbequina, Tsunati, Koroneiki, Arbosana, Valanolia, Ascolano, Frantoio, Cailletier, Leccino, Pendolino, Maurino, and Coratina.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment the process further comprises subjecting the obtained mixture to malaxation. As used herein, the term &#x201c;malaxation&#x201d; means mixing/stirring the obtained mixture. In general, metal crushers can cause emulsions that lower yield. The malaxation step diminishes this effect by causing the droplets produced by crushing the olives to coalesce, thereby increasing the percentage of available oil. Malaxation is a key step in the olive oil production process, as good malaxation means optimal oil extraction and good values of antioxidants and flavor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment the obtained mixture is incubated for 10 to 200 minutes at a temperature ranging from 5&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C. In an embodiment the obtained mixture is incubated for 20 to 100 minutes at a temperature ranging from 20&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C. Incubation may take place during malaxation. So, the incubation conditions will depend on the malaxation conditions of the respective olive oil production site.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The malaxers have two or three cylindrical vats in tandem, each one with a rotating helix with several wings that mix the paste at low speed (15-20 rpm) for a period of time, for example between 30 minutes and 75 minutes, depending on the paste characteristics. Longer mixing times increase yield, however, they may also result in increased oxidation and decreased shelf life and quality. The vats are made of stainless steel and have double walls for circulation of heated water. Temperature and time are the variables of the malaxation process that are automatically controlled. The extraction yield is directly correlated to these variables; a rise in temperature and time increases the yield. However, the temperature of the paste should not be higher than 30&#xb0; C. to avoid change in the oil color (from yellow-green to reddish), the increase of acidity and the degradation of the volatile compounds that would result in an olive oil with the negative sensory attribute &#x201c;heated&#x201d;. New malaxers have an atmosphere controlled by an inert gas (i.e. nitrogen- or carbon dioxide-controlled atmosphere with around 2% oxygen content only) to reduce oxidation and produce higher-quality oils.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment the obtained mixture is incubated in a container having a voume ranging from 0.5 m<sup>3 </sup>to 5000 m<sup>3</sup>. In an embodiment the container is a malaxer. The obtained mixture can be incubated in several containers (e.g. malaxers).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment the process further comprises a solid-liquid separation after malaxation. In an embodiment the solid-liquid separation is performed by applying pressure, percolation and/or centrifugation techniques. The main constituents of olive paste are liquids, e.g. olive oil and water, and solids such as small pieces of kernel and tissues. The solid/liquid separation step is used to separate olive oil from the other constituents. As indicated above there are three different extraction processes that can be applied to do this: pressure, percolation and centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The paste can be spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other, then placed into a press. The stacks of discs are then pressed in a hydraulic press. Pressure of up to 4,000 kPa is applied to the disks, compacting the solid phase and percolating the liquid phases (oil and water). Water can be used to run down the sides of the discs to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated by decantation or centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Modem olive oil mills extract olive oil by means of centrifugation systems since they produce high-quality olive oils at lower production cost. The paste is pumped into an industrial decanter where the phases are separated using centrifugation. This step can involve a three-phase decanter or a two-phase decanter. Water can be added to facilitate the extraction process. The decanter is a large-capacity horizontal centrifuge rotating approximately 3,500 rpm. In three-phase decanting, inside the rotating conical drum is a coil that rotates more slowly than the drum. This pushes the solids out of one end of the system and the water and oil out the other end. Three-phase decanting results in loss of a portion of the oil polyphenolics due to the higher quantity of water used. It also produces larger quantities of olive mill wastewater that then need to be processed and have negative environmental effects. Two-phase decanters were created to solve these problems. In this process, the olive paste is separated into two phases, oil and wet pomace. The decanter has two exits instead of three, and the water is expelled with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace. The two-phase decanter thus solves the phenol washing issue and uses less water, but increases the waste produced.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, the olive oil is extracted by means of the Sinolea method. In this process, rows of metal discs are dipped into the paste, and the oil preferentially sticks to the metal and is removed by scrapers in a continuous process. Based on the varying surface tension between the oil and vegetation water, the oil adheres to the steel plates while the other two phases remain behind. The Sinolea method continuously introduces hundreds of plates into the paste and is not very efficient, leaving lots of oil in the paste. The final paste still requires decanting.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Regardless of the process used for oil extraction, a final centrifugation process is needed to separate the oil from the vegetation water. Vertical centrifuges, operating at speeds of 6,000-7,000 rpm under controlled temperature conditions, are used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Following processing, the olive oil is stored in large stainless-steel tanks with nitrogen blanketing to protect it from oxygen. Preferably, the olive oil is stored at about 15-18&#xb0; C. Although not necessary, virgin olive oil can be filtered prior to bottling. Diatomaceous earth is frequently used as a filter aid. Colored glass bottles are ideal packaging for olive oil, because the colored glass blocks the UV light and is also impermeable to oxygen. Bottling under nitrogen is a recommended practice.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The olive oil production process does not only give rise to olive oil, but several co-products are produced as well. These co-products contain healthy polyphenolics and fibers that can be beneficial to human health. Thus, new uses for the olive oil wastewater and their extracts are being explored as foods, supplements, and cosmetics. In addition, methods to stabilize olive pomace in an efficient manner are being studied, as are value-added final product uses for the pomace itself in foods.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Olive oils themselves exits in several grades including extra-virgin olive oil, lower grades of olive oil including virgin olive oil, refined olive oils and olive pomace oils.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another aspect of the present invention relates to an olive paste comprising a polygalacturonase, a pectin methyl esterase, a pectin lyase, an arabinofuranosidase, a cellulase, a xylanase, a rhamnogalacturonase, a mannanase and optionally a beta-glucanase.
