The support member is not limited to a support member having a flattened shape or a gently curved surface shape, and for example, may be a support member with a sharply bent curved surface. When a decorative film is applied to such a support member, the applied film is generally heated and bonded in a highly stretched state, particularly in a severe curved surface shape of the support member. As a result, the applied film, particularly the adhesive layer constituting the film, is subjected to a return stress to return to the original state.

Such a crosslinked structure is a crosslinked structure by a coordination bond, and the polymers are considered to be loosely bonded to each other as compared with, for example, a crosslinked structure by a covalent bond when an epoxy-based crosslinking agent is used. To date, from the viewpoint of heat-resistant shrinkage performance, it has been considered that a strong crosslinked structure such as a covalent bond is preferable to a crosslinked structure formed by such a loose bond. This related-art technical idea regarding heat-resistant shrinkage performance may be applied when the stretching conditions of the adhesive film are loose. However, in the case of an adhesive film that is highly stretched to an area magnification of 4 times or more and bonded to a support member, stress remains in the adhesive layer in a strong crosslinked structure by a covalent bond. Therefore, when exposed to a high temperature, this residual stress functions like a return stress, and heat shrinkage cannot be suppressed. On the other hand, surprisingly, in the case of a crosslinked structure with a coordination bond looser than a covalent bond, it was possible to reduce or prevent heat shrinkage at high temperatures even with an adhesive film applied under such conditions. The principle is not clear, but likely as follows: in the case of a crosslinked structure by coordination bonds, the coordination bonds between the polymers are temporarily broken as the adhesive film is stretched, but at least at the stage when the stretching is completed, a reversible crosslinked structure is formed in which the coordination bond is re-formed between the polymers, and the return stress is less likely to occur as compared with the strong crosslinked structure by covalent bonds, and this makes it possible to reduce or prevent heat shrinkage at high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">The metal coordination bond crosslinking agent is not particularly limited as long as it has a metal atom and is capable of forming a coordination bond between the (meth)acrylic polymers of the components (A) and (B). Examples of the metal coordination bond crosslinking agent include tris (2,4-pentanedionato) aluminum (III), and titanium diisopropoxybis(acetylsetonate).

The support member <b>20</b> is set on the pedestal <b>33</b> in the first vacuum chamber <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the first vacuum chamber <b>31</b> and the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b> are closed and depressurized, and the inside of each chamber is evacuated (when the atmospheric pressure is 1 atm, for example, about 0 atm). The film is then heated or at the same time as vacuuming.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the elevating table <b>35</b> is raised to push the support member <b>20</b> up to the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b>. The heating may be performed by, for example, a lamp heater incorporated in the ceiling of the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b>. The heating temperature can generally be about 50&#xb0; C. or higher and about 180&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably about 130&#xb0; C. or higher and about 160&#xb0; C. or lower. The degree of vacuum in the decompressed atmosphere may be about 0.10 atm or less, about 0.05 atm or less, or about 0.01 or less atm or less, assuming that the atmospheric pressure is 1 atm.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120">The heated heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b> is pressed against the surface of the support member <b>20</b> and stretched. After that or at the same time as stretching, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the inside of the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b> is pressurized to an appropriate pressure (for example, about 1 atm to about 3 atm). Due to the pressure difference, the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b> adheres to the exposed surface of the support member <b>20</b> and is stretched following the three-dimensional shape of the exposed surface, thus forming a coating that adheres to the surface of the support member. At least a portion of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film may be, for example, stretched at an area magnification of about 4 times or more, about 4.5 times or more, or about 5 times or more when the film is stretched following the three-dimensional shape of the support member. After depressurizing and heating in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the inside of the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b> can be pressurized as it is, thereby covering the exposed surface of the support member <b>20</b> with the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">After that, the upper and lower first vacuum chambers <b>31</b> and the second vacuum chamber <b>32</b> are opened to the atmospheric pressure again, and the support member <b>20</b> coated with the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b> is taken out. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, the edge of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b> in close contact with the surface of the support member <b>20</b> is trimmed to complete the TOM step. In this way, it is possible to obtain an article <b>1</b> having a good roll-in coating in which the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film <b>10</b> wraps around to the back surface portion <b>21</b> at the end portion of the support member <b>20</b> and covers the exposed surface cleanly.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122">The heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film of the present disclosure can reduce or prevent defects such as shrinkage when exposed to a high temperature even when the heat-resistant adhesive film is bonded in a highly stretched state. Therefore, the maximum area elongation rate of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film after molding can be about 400% or more, about 450% or more, or about 500% or more. The upper limit of the maximum area elongation rate is not particularly limited, and may be about 1000% or less, about 800% or less, or about 600% or less. Here, for example, 400% of the maximum area elongation rate corresponds to 4 times the stretched area magnification.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0123">The area elongation rate is defined as follows: the area elongation rate (%)=(B&#x2212;A)/A (A: the area of the part with the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film before molding, B: the area of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film corresponding to A after molding). For example, when the area of a portion of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film is 100 cm<sup>2 </sup>before molding and the portion is 250 cm<sup>2 </sup>on the surface of the article after molding, the area elongation rate is 150%. The maximum area elongation rate refers to the value of the portion having the highest area elongation rate among all the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive films on the surface of the article.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124">For example, when a flat film is attached to a support member having a three-dimensional shape by TOM, the portion where the film first hits the support member is hardly stretched, and the area elongation rate is almost 0%, while the area elongation rate varies greatly depending on the location, such that the end portion to be attached lastly is greatly stretched and the area elongation rate becomes 400% or more. Whether or not a defect such as non-following to the support member or tearing of the film occurs at the portion where the film is most stretched determines the success or failure of molding. Therefore, rather than the average area elongation rate of the entire article, the area elongation of the most stretched portion, that is, the maximum area elongation, is a substantial index of acceptance or rejection of the article.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">The maximum area elongation rate can be confirmed, for example, by printing 1 mm square on the entire surface of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film before molding and measuring the area change after molding, or by measuring the thickness of the heat-resistant shrinkable adhesive film before and after molding.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0126">Specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be exemplified in the following examples, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.

In Table 2, the adhesive force at 25&#xb0; C. is referred to as the initial adhesive force, and the adhesive force at 110&#xb0; C. is referred to as the hot adhesive force.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Heat Shrinkage Test</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a 6-stage frame having a height of 120 mm that can be evacuated was placed on a substantially flat substrate (Excelloy (trademark) CK43, manufactured by Techno Polymer Co., Ltd.) having a thickness of 3 mm, then a 25-mm thick frame (Chibi frame) was disposed on the frame to prepare a heat shrinkage test device. After attaching the adhesive film so as to cover the Chibi frame of this device, the device was placed in the three-dimensional coating molding device and heated so that the set temperature was 135&#xb0; C. and the film temperature was 163&#xb0; C. When the film hung down from the substrate at a position of about 15 mm, a vacuum was drawn from the left and right directions of the 6-stage frame, and the adhesive film was stretched and attached to the substrate to prepare a test sample for a heat shrinkage test.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">The concentric broken line portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> at a distance of about 50 mm from the center is a region exhibiting an area elongation rate of about 400% in the adhesive film. The relationship between the distance from the center and the area elongation rate can be determined by, for example, drawing concentric lines on the adhesive film, applying it to the test device described above, and examining how much the concentric lines are stretched.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">A cut was made in a concentric part about 50 mm away from the center of the test sample with a cutter, and the sample was allowed to stand in an oven at 110&#xb0; C. for 24 hours. After that, the cut part of the test sample was visually observed, the base-material exposed length, the adhesive exposed length, and the deformed portion length after the heat shrinkage test were measured, and the presence or absence of air accumulation was confirmed. The results are shown in Table 2. Here, the &#x201c;base-material exposed length&#x201d; is intended to be the average length at any five points from the cut portion to the portion where the base material of the substrate is exposed, the &#x201c;adhesive exposed length&#x201d; is intended to be the average length at any five points where the adhesive is exposed from the film and adheres to the substrate, and the &#x201c;deformed portion length&#x201d; is intended to be the distance from the cut portion to the deformed portion due to the loss of flatness of the film, and includes the base material exposed length and the adhesive exposed length. In Table 2, &#x201c;base-material exposed length&#x201d; is abbreviated as &#x201c;base-material exposed length&#x201d;, &#x201c;adhesive-exposed length&#x201d; is abbreviated as &#x201c;adhesive-exposed length&#x201d;, and &#x201c;deformed portion length&#x201d; is abbreviated as &#x201c;deformed portion length&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002"
