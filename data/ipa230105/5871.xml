10-2021-0086713, filed on Jul. 1, 2021 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The inventive concept relates to an adhesive sheet and a semiconductor package including the same, and more particularly, to an adhesive sheet which is capable of performing accurate alignment when a plurality of semiconductor devices are stacked and effective dissipation of heat generated during an operation, and a semiconductor package including the adhesive sheet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Technologies for stacking a plurality of semiconductor devices have been developed and applied for manufacturing electronic products in which
