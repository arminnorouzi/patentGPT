Controller <b>20</b> decreases the output of light emitter <b>70</b> when the detected temperature is greater than or equal to a predetermined temperature. The predetermined temperature is, for example, any value of 170&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. inclusive. In one example, the temperature is 180&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An example of first control executed by controller <b>20</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step S<b>11</b>, controller <b>20</b> acquires the temperature information from detector <b>50</b>. Controller <b>20</b> refers to storage <b>30</b> to estimate the detected temperature that is the temperature of the fabric of the clothes. In step S<b>12</b>, controller <b>20</b> determines whether the detected temperature is greater than or equal to the predetermined temperature. When it is determined that the detected temperature is greater than or equal to the predetermined temperature, controller <b>20</b> executes the processing of step S<b>13</b>. When it is determined that the detected temperature is less than the predetermined temperature, controller <b>20</b> ends the processing. In step S<b>13</b>, controller <b>20</b> decreases the output of light emitter <b>70</b>. After completion of processing of step S<b>13</b>, controller <b>20</b> ends the control. Controller <b>20</b> executes the first control at predetermined intervals while electric power is supplied from power supply <b>60</b> and light emitter <b>70</b> outputs the light.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> indicates a case where the first control by controller <b>20</b> is not executed.

The user operates operation unit <b>40</b> to select a type of fabric of target clothes. Controller <b>20</b> determines the output of light emitter <b>70</b> from the stored table of the type of the fabric of the clothes and the fabric temperature. Most of the light output from light emitter <b>70</b> is directed to base surface <b>12</b>, and a part thereof is reflected by reflection plate <b>80</b> and directed to base surface <b>12</b>. The visible light is reflected by filter <b>90</b> provided on light emitter <b>70</b> side of base surface <b>12</b>. On the other hand, the infrared rays pass through filter <b>90</b> and are output from base surface <b>12</b>. The infrared rays heat the clothes to remove the wrinkles. As the wrinkles are removed, base surface <b>12</b> is heated. Detector <b>50</b> detects the temperature information, and controller <b>20</b> decreases the output of light emitter <b>70</b> based on the temperature information.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to iron <b>10</b> according to the second exemplary embodiment, the following effect can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the detected temperature is greater than or equal to the predetermined temperature, since the output of light emitter <b>70</b> is decreased, the clothes are hardly burned. Since the fabric temperature is estimated from the temperature of base surface <b>12</b>, it is not necessary to newly provide a sensor for measuring the temperature of the fabric, and thus, the configuration of iron <b>10</b> can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">(Modifications)</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exemplary embodiments exemplarily describe the iron in a practicable mode of the present disclosure, and does not intend to limit the mode.

The notification unit notifies the user of, for example, the temperature information of the fabric estimated from the current temperature of base surface <b>12</b> and the current temperature of base surface <b>12</b>.
