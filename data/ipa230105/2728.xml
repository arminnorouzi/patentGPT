to medium compositions for cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to medium compositions for high density suspension culture of cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Discussion of the Background</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regenerative medicine technology using cells has been receiving high attention in recent years as one of the means capable of treating various diseases and damages that were difficult to treat before. Since regenerative medicine requires a large amount of cells, the development of a method for efficiently culturing cells has been actively conducted. For example, JP-A- 2008-099662, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, reports a method for culturing stem cells, including treating stem cells with a ROCK inhibitor in a medium. In addition, the present inventors also reported in 2018 a high density culture method of animal cells, including adding glucose and/or specific amino acids to a medium, and the like (see Japanese Patent Application No. 2018-184352, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The method described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2018-184352 is one of the very superior methods for high density culture of animal cells including pluripotent stem cells. This time, the present inventors reconsidered the method and attempted to develop a more preferable high density culture method of cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the present inventors' discovery that cell proliferation is more remarkably promoted in high density culture including suspension culture of cells, by adding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to the medium in an amount far higher than that previously recommended in the pertinent technical field. In addition, they have also found that, when the cells are pluripotent stem cells, the addition of large amounts of bFGF can maintain the undifferentiated state of the pluripotent stem cells to be subjected to high density culture extremely well, and that pluripotent stem cells prepared by high density culture in a medium supplemented with a large amount of bFGF have extremely good differentiation potency. Based on such findings, they have conducted further studies and completed the present invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention provides the following.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">(1) A medium composition for cell culture, comprising a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) at not less than 150 ng/mL, or a stabilized bFGF at a concentration that affords an effect equivalent to that of bFGF at said concentration.<br/>(2) The medium composition of (1), wherein the composition is for use in suspension culture.<br/>(3) The medium composition of (1) or (2), wherein the composition is for use in high density culture.<br/>(4) The medium composition of (3), wherein cells to be subjected to suspension culture have a cell density of not less than 6.0&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL.<br/>(5) The medium composition of any of (1) to (4), wherein the cell is a pluripotent stem cell, an adult stem cell, or a progenitor cell.<br/>(6) A method for culturing a cell, comprising suspension culture of the cell in the medium composition of (1).<br/>(7) The method of (6), wherein the medium comprises bFGF at 10 to 1000 ng/mL/day, or stabilized bFGF at a concentration that affords an effect equivalent to that of bFGF at said concentration.<br/>(8) The method of (6) or (7), wherein pluripotent stem cells to be subjected to suspension culture have a cell density of not less than 6.0&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL.<br/>(9) The method of any of (6) to (8), wherein the cell is a pluripotent stem cell, an adult stem cell, or a progenitor cell.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">According to the present invention, cells can be prepared extremely efficiently.

This is because the effect on cell proliferation and/or undifferentiation is considered to be constant even when bFGF is added at a higher concentration. The lower limit of the concentration of bFGF contained in the medium composition of the present invention is generally 150 ng/mL, preferably 200 ng/mL, more preferably 250 ng/mL, further preferably 275 ng/mL, particularly preferably 300 ng/mL, or may be higher. The upper limit is not particularly set, and may be generally 1500 ng/mL, preferably 1000 ng/mL, more preferably 800 ng/mL, further preferably 600 ng/mL, particularly preferably 500 ng/mL, from the aspects of the cost and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In one embodiment, the concentration of bFGF in the medium composition of the present invention may be generally 150 to 1500 ng/mL, preferably 200 to 1000 ng/mL, more preferably 250 to 800 ng/mL, further preferably 275 to 600 ng/mL, particularly preferably 300 to 500 ng/mL.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In one embodiment, bFGF to be added to the medium composition of the present invention may be a stabilized bFGF.

Examples of the preferred commercially available product include, but are not limited to, Heat Stable Recombinant Human bFGF (manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the like. As other one embodiment of the stabilized bFGF, &#x201c;FGF2-G3&#x201d; can be mentioned. FGF2-G3 is a variant bFGF protein having nine amino acid mutations (R31L, V52T, E54D, H59F, S94I, L92Y, C96N, S109E, T121P) as compared with wild-type bFGF. Without being bound by theory, FGF2-G3 was reported to show activities equivalent to those of unstabilized wild-type bFGF even when used in the amount of about 40% compared with the unstabilized one (Hui-Hsuan Kuo et al., Negligible-Cost and Weekend-Free Chemically Defined Human iPSC Culture).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In this embodiment, a preferred concentration range of the stabilized bFGF may be a concentration that affords a cell proliferation promoting effect and/or an undifferentiated state maintaining effect equivalent to those/that of unstabilized bFGF. When stabilized bFGF is used, a preferred concentration range can be appropriately set by those of ordinary skill in the art by confirming the difference in the effect between the unstabilized bFGF and the stabilized bFGF by a method known per se, by referring to the above-mentioned concentration range. The concentration of stabilized bFGF in a medium composition may vary depending on the means and degree of stabilization of bFGF. Generally, a concentration range that affords an effect equivalent to the desired effect of the present invention (cell proliferation promoting effect and/or undifferentiated state maintaining effect) that is achieved by adopting the concentration range of the aforementioned unstabilized bFGF may be appropriately set. Specifically, the concentration range of the stabilized bFGF may be determined as follows:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0000">(1) the effect (that is, the cell proliferation promoting effect and/or the undifferentiated state maintaining effect) when a medium composition containing unstabilized bFGF is used is quantified (the effect can be quantified by the method used in Examples described later of the present application),<br/>(2) using stabilized bFGF instead of unstabilized bFGF, the same test as in (1) is performed, and the concentration of stabilized bFGF that affords an effect equivalent to the effect quantified in (1) is determined.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">In one embodiment, the lower limit of the concentration of stabilized bFGF contained in the medium composition of the present invention is generally 75 ng/mL, preferably 100 ng/mL, more preferably 125 ng/mL, further preferably 138 ng/mL, particularly preferably 150 ng/mL, or may be higher.

The upper limit is not particularly set, and may be generally 500 ng/mL, preferably 334 ng/mL, more preferably 267 ng/mL, further preferably 200 ng/mL, particularly preferably 167 ng/mL, from the aspects of the cost and the like. In one embodiment, the concentration of bFGF in the medium composition of the present invention may be generally 50 to 500 ng/mL, preferably 67 to 334 ng/mL, more preferably 84 to 267 ng/mL, further preferably 92 to 200 ng/mL, particularly preferably 100 to 167 ng/mL.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">In one embodiment, the lower limit of the concentration of stabilized bFGF contained in the medium composition of the present invention is generally 38 ng/mL, preferably 50 ng/mL, more preferably 63 ng/mL, further preferably 69 ng/mL, particularly preferably 75 ng/mL, or may be higher. The upper limit is not particularly set, and may be generally 375 ng/mL, preferably 250 ng/mL, more preferably 200 ng/mL, further preferably 150 ng/mL, particularly preferably 125 ng/mL, from the aspects of the cost and the like. In one embodiment, the concentration of bFGF in the medium composition of the present invention may be generally 38 to 375 ng/mL, preferably 50 to 250 ng/mL, more preferably 63 to 200 ng/mL, further preferably 69 to 150 ng/mL, particularly preferably 75 to 125 ng/mL.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">Alternatively, bFGF can also be stabilized by separately adding a compound that contributes to the stabilization of bFGF to the medium. One such embodiment is, for example, addition of a sulfated compound (e.g., sulfated polysaccharides such as sodium dextran sulfate and the like, sulfated polymers such as sulfo group-containing polyvinyl alcohol and the like, sugar lactone sulfides such as gluconolactone-SO<sub>3</sub>NA and the like, etc.) (refer to WO2013/147264, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for details).
