id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0001">The present invention relates an organic thin film and a method for producing an organic thin film, an organic electroluminescence (hereinafter, electroluminescence is also referred to as &#x201c;EL&#x201d;) device, a display device, a lighting system, an organic thin film solar cell, a thin film transistor, a photoelectric transducer, a coating composition, and an organic electroluminescence device material.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">Organic EL devices are thin, soft, and flexible. Display devices including organic EL devices are capable of providing higher brightness, higher definition display than currently dominant liquid crystal display devices and plasma display devices. Further, display devices including organic EL devices have a wider viewing angle than liquid crystal display devices. Thus, organic EL display devices are expected to be widely used, for example, as displays of TVs and mobiles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">In addition, organic EL devices are also expected to be used as lighting systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">An organic EL device is a laminate of a cathode, an emitting layer, and an anode. In organic EL devices, the energy difference between the work function of the anode and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the emitting layer is smaller than the energy difference between the work function of the cathode and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the emitting layer. It is therefore more difficult to inject electrons into the emitting layer from the cathode than to inject holes into the emitting layer from the anode. For this reason, in traditional organic EL devices, an electron injection layer is placed between the cathode and the emitting layer to facilitate electron injection from the cathode to the emitting layer. In addition, the electron injection property and the electron transport property are improved by doping dopants in a layer between the cathode and the emitting layer (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 1 and Non-Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">An example of the electron injection layer of an organic EL device is an inorganic oxide layer (see, for example, Non-Patent Literature 3). However, the inorganic oxide layer is poor in electron injection property.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">The electron injection property of an organic EL device can be improved by forming an additional electron injection layer on an inorganic oxide layer. For example, Non-Patent Literature 4 discloses an organic EL device that includes an electron injection layer made of polyethyleneimine. Further, Non-Patent Literature 5 discloses that amines effectively improve the injection rate of electrons. Non-Patent Literatures 6, 7, 8, and 12 disclose the effects of an amino group on electron injection at an interface between an electrode and an organic layer. Non-Patent Literatures 10 and 11 report that phenanthroline derivatives, which have a high coordination ability with metal ions, facilitate electron emission from metal atoms and greatly lower electron injection barriers at the interface between an electrode and an organic layer. It is widely practiced to form an organic thin film consisting of a phenanthroline derivative at the interface between an electrode and an organic layer. Patent Literature 1 discloses an organic EL device in which an electron transport host material used is a phenanthroline compound and the host material is doped with an inert metal to lower the energy level of the LUMO of the electron transport material, facilitating electron injection and reducing the driving voltage of the device. Also, Patent Literatures 2 to 4 disclose organic EL devices in which an electron injection layer material used is a compound having a structure in which an amino group is attached to a group derived from an electron transport compound directly or via another group or an organic material having an acid dissociation constant pKa of 1 or greater.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: WO 2017/211100</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">Patent Literature 2: JP 2017-157743 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">Patent Literature 3: JP 2019-176093 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">Patent Literature 4: JP 2019-179863 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">Non-Patent Literature 1: Karsten Walzer and three others, &#x201c;Chemical Review&#x201d;, Vol. 107, 2007, pp. 1233-1271</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">Non-Patent Literature 2: Peng Wei and three others, &#x201c;Journal of the American Chemical Society&#x201d;, Vol. 132, 2010, p. 8852</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">Non-Patent Literature 3: Jiangshan Chen and six others, &#x201c;Journal Of Materials Chemistry&#x201d;, Vol. 22, 2012, pp. 5164-5170</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">Non-Patent Literature 4: Hyosung Choi and eight others, &#x201c;Advanced Materials&#x201d;, Vol. 23, 2011, p. 2759</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0015">Non-Patent Literature 5: Yinhua Zho and 21 others, &#x201c;Science&#x201d;, Vol. 336, 2012, p. 327</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0016">Non-Patent Literature 6: Young-Hoon Kim and five others, &#x201c;Advanced Functional Materials&#x201d;, 2014, DOI: 10.1002/adfm.201304163</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0017">Non-Patent Literature 7: Stefan Hofle and four others, &#x201c;Advanced Materials&#x201d;, 2014, DOI: 10.1002/adma.201304666</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0018">Non-Patent Literature 8: Stefan Hofle and five others, &#x201c;Advanced Materials&#x201d;, Vol. 26, 2014, DOI: 10.1002/adma.201400332</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0019">Non-Patent Literature 9: Peng Wei and three others, &#x201c;Journal of the American Chemical Society&#x201d;, Vol. 132, 2010, p. 8852</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0020">Non-Patent Literature 10: Hiroyuki Yoshida, &#x201c;JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY&#x201d; (J.

As a result of the examination, the inventors found that an organic thin film containing a compound which has a specific structure containing multiple pyridine rings in the structure and a material which transports electrons may be used as an electron injection layer of an organic EL device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0027">In other words, owing to the high electron-donating ability of nitrogen atoms in the compound of the formula (1) in the present invention, the compound coordinates and interacts with an inorganic material to improve the electron injection property. In addition, when an organic material which transports electrons exists adjacent to the compound, the compound can form hydrogen bonding with the different organic material to yield a trace amount of charge. Thus, the negative charge generates on the organic material. This is also considered to be a factor for improving the electron injection property.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0028">The present invention has been accomplished based on the above findings, and the following describes the summary thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0029">&#x3c;1&#x3e;

The first material preferably has high negative electrostatic potential at a nitrogen site serving as an electron donor. The first material having higher electrostatic potential is more highly capable of generating a negative charge on the second material. Furthermore, the first material is confirmed to have an effect of improving the life time of a device.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0152">Thus, the organic thin film of the present invention can be used not only in a device consisting only of organic compounds, but also in, in particular, a device including organic compounds and inorganic compounds, and can enhance the electron injection property and the atmospheric stability. Further, the organic thin film can achieve a device having a long life time.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0153">The organic thin film of the present invention contains a compound having a structure of the formula (1) as the first material. The organic thin film of the present invention, when used as an electron injection layer, can impart an excellent electron injection property and an excellent electron transport property. The compound having a structure of the formula (1) is a compound suitable as an organic EL device material. The compound of the formula (1) includes a phenanthroline compound of the formula (2). An organic EL device material containing such a phenanthroline compound of the formula (2) is another aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0154">The &#x201c;electrostatic potential&#x201d; described in the present invention can be calculated using a quantum chemical calculation program such as GAUSSIAN, for example. The absolute amount of a calculated value varies depending on the basis function used in the calculation, whereas it is possible to discuss the correlation with the generation of a negative charge using the relative values of large and small values calculated using the same calculation method.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0155">As an example of the first material of the present invention, the electrostatic potential of the nitrogen site in the phenanthroline contained in any of various types of the first material was calculated under the following conditions.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0156">Function used to calculate the most stabilized structure of a phenanthroline compound</p><p id="p-0166" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>B3LYP/6-31+G(d)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0167" num="0157">Function used to calculate the electrostatic potential of a phenanthroline compound</p><p id="p-0168" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0169" num="0158">The results of calculation are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a calculated electrostatic potential value of a site surrounded by a dotted line in which the coordinated nitrogen atoms are close to each other in phenanthroline, which is the basic structure of the compounds. The electrostatic potential values of compounds 1 to 13 are also calculated at the same site as of phenanthroline. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electrostatic potential values depend largely on a substituent to be added to phenanthroline.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0159">The compound 1, the compound 2, and the compound 3 to which a pyrrolidino group, a dimethylamine group, and a methoxy group, which are electron-donating substituents, are respectively added have large electrostatic potential values. In these compounds, the electron-donating substituents increase the electron density of the phenanthroline structure to enhance an ability of the nitrogen atoms to bind to hydrogen and an ability of the nitrogen atoms to coordinate with an inorganic compound. Thus, these compounds are particularly suitable as the first material.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0160">Also, a compound of the formula (1) in which n is 1, excluding phenanthroline, contains a large number of nitrogen atoms involved in hydrogen bonding or coordination with an inorganic compound, and is thus considered to have a relatively large electrostatic potential value.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0161">In addition to the compounds having only one phenanthroline shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, compounds of the following formulas (3-1) to (3-4) having multiple phenanthrolines are considered to be effective for generating a negative charge and are suitable as the first material.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-C00012" he="118.87mm" wi="76.28mm" file="US20230006159A1-20230105-C00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-C00013" he="151.55mm" wi="75.52mm" file="US20230006159A1-20230105-C00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0174" num="0162">The generation of a negative charge caused by phenanthroline derivatives was also simulated using quantum chemical calculations. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Any of various phenanthroline derivatives are used as the first material, and triphenylamine (TPA) having a simple molecular structure is used as the second material. The optimized structure of the two molecules was calculated, and the ionization energy of triphenylamine in the optimized structure was calculated.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the optimized structure, a specific hydrogen atom of triphenylamine forms hydrogen bonding with a nitrogen atom of phenanthroline, and a change in ionization energy is observed. There is no change in the distribution of the highest occupied orbitals in the calculation of the two molecules, whereas the larger the electrostatic potential value of the phenanthroline derivative used, the lower the ionization energy.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0164">At low ionization energy, electrons are easily extracted from a triphenylamine molecule. In other words, the triphenylamine is likely to be negatively charged, and the first material having a larger electrostatic potential value can generate a more negative charge on the second material.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0165">The presence of hydrogen bonding is suggested by the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0166">The analysis was performed using a simplified boron compound, and the peak positions of the protons of the boron compound were compared with those of the protons of the boron compound in the presence of phenanthroline.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0167">The amount of phenanthroline was 5 molar equivalents relative to the boron compound and the measurement was carried out in heavy chloroform. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that the peak positions of the protons enclosed by frames are shifted toward the high magnetic field. This is because the interaction between the boron compound and phenanthroline through hydrogen bonding increases the electron density of the hydrogen atoms of the boron compound.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0168">X<sup>1 </sup>and X<sup>2 </sup>in the formula (1) are the same as or different from each other and are each a nitrogen atom optionally having a substituent, an oxygen atom optionally having a substituent, a sulfur atom optionally having a substituent, or a divalent linking group optionally having a substituent.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0169">Examples of the divalent linking group include a divalent hydrocarbon group and a group in which at least one carbon atom of a hydrocarbon group is replaced with a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom as a heteroatom.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0170">The hydrocarbon group preferably has a carbon number of 1 to 6, more preferably has a carbon number of 1, 2, or 6.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0171">The hydrocarbon group may be linear, branched, or cyclic, or may include a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0172">The divalent hydrocarbon group may be a saturated hydrocarbon group such as an alkylene group or may be an unsaturated hydrocarbon group such as an alkenylene group or an alkynylene group.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0173">Specifically, the divalent hydrocarbon group is preferably any of compounds of the following formulas (4-1) to (4-4).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0174">R in the formulas (4-1) to (4-4) is a substituent.
