Greater power demands have meant that the current density in some areas of the vehicle, such as at power distribution units, have also increased. This leads to waste heat being generated and consequently has necessitated the need for cooling systems to mitigate the risk of overheating.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At the same time as the above, new vehicle electrical engineering (EE) architectures have looked to distribute power through a number of zonal hubs or modules as a way of reducing the length of wiring within the vehicle. For each hub or module, regulatory and energy management requirements necessitate that those power lines incorporate monitoring and protection systems in order to optimize and protect power distribution within the vehicle. As a consequence, further electronic systems and switches are introduced into the power line path. This not only exacerbates the power drain on the system, but also creates further heating points that require cooling.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The combination of the above factors means that not only have the power demands in modern vehicles increased, leading to greater heat dissipation, but also that there are more regions within the vehicle that are affected by this. This presents a significant problem because, as the temperature of a power line increases, so does its resistance, which leads to even greater thermal losses. For context, in some systems, an increase in temperature from 20&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. may cause the resistance on a power line to increase by around 70%. This effectively establishes a negative spiral because, as the temperature increases, the resistance of the power line increases, which in turn increases the power dissipation in the form of waste heat. Therefore, excessive heating degrades both performance and efficiency of power lines.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, there is a need to cool power lines and other power conductors. Unfortunately, conventional cooling methods are not optimised for this application. For instance, passive or air cooling using a heatsink requires sufficient space and airflow. This rarely can be accommodated in the narrow channels used to convey wiring harnesses within the vehicle. Similarly, liquid cooling systems would require the introduction of additional pumps, tubing and radiators. This not only requires space, but also introduces further complexity and significant costs. There remains, therefore, a need for a cooling arrangement that provides efficient cooling to electronic wiring within a vehicle, and in particular a solution for cooling power conductors when there is very limited space and poor airflow.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to a power conductor and, in particular, a heat dissipating power conductor.

The power conductor <b>1</b> is used to electrically connect between a power source <b>2</b> and a load <b>10</b> within a vehicle power distribution circuit, and thereby forms a power line within the power distribution circuit. The power source <b>2</b> may be, for instance, a vehicle battery array, an alternator, a DC/DC converter, or the like used to supply electrical power within the vehicle. The load <b>10</b> may be, for instance, a distribution unit, a zonal controller, electronic control unit, or other power consuming component within the vehicle's EE architecture.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some arrangements, power conductors can be formed with a high gauge wire or power cable for conducting current from the power source <b>2</b> to the load <b>10</b>. The power conductor <b>1</b> may therefore replace such a high gauge wire or power cable used to connect the power source <b>2</b> and load <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The power conductor <b>1</b> can be realized with a heat pipe arrangement that uses thermal conductivity and phase transition to enhance heat-transfer. In these aspects, the power conductor <b>1</b> can include a conductive body <b>4</b> which contains a sealed chamber <b>6</b>, with the chamber being lined by a wick <b>5</b> and containing a quantity of working fluid <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated example implementation, the body <b>4</b> is provided as a rigid, hollow tubular structure. However, it will be understood that in other implementations, a flexible body may be provided. For example, the body may be formed as an articulated structure comprising one or more elements connected by linkages. In the illustrated implementation, the body <b>4</b> is formed of a copper material and the working fluid <b>9</b> is water. In other implementations, other conductive materials may be used, together with a compatible working fluid. Suitable working fluids include ammonia, methanol, and ethanol During manufacture, a vacuum pump is used to remove air from the interior chamber <b>6</b>, and the chamber <b>6</b> is then partially filled with the working fluid <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The wick <b>5</b> is formed from a sintered metal powder resulting in a porous structure around the interior bore of the chamber <b>6</b>, which is used to convey liquid working fluid <b>9</b>. In other implementations, the wick layer may be formed from a mesh or from grooved channels provided parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown, a heatsink connector <b>7</b> can be attached to the exterior of the body <b>4</b> and is used to thermally connect the body <b>4</b> to a thermally conductive structure <b>11</b> of the vehicle, such as the vehicle chassis or seat frame. The heatsink connector <b>7</b> incorporates a thin layer of insulating material <b>12</b>, such as a mica sheet, for forming an electrical spacer between the conductive body <b>4</b> and the, e.g., vehicle structure <b>11</b>. As such, the heatsink connector <b>7</b> electrically isolates the conductive body <b>4</b> from the vehicle structure <b>11</b>, whilst allowing thermal heat transfer to it.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The exterior surface of the body <b>4</b>, on either side of the heatsink connector <b>7</b>, is substantially covered by an insulating layer <b>3</b> which forms a coating surrounding the body <b>4</b>. The insulating layer <b>3</b> may be formed of a plastic coating or an insulating paint, and it prevents short circuiting once the body <b>4</b> is installed in the vehicle. The ends of the body <b>4</b> are exposed to form first and second connection terminals <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>for connection to the corresponding connection terminals for the power supply <b>2</b> and load <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In use, the load <b>10</b> draws current from the power source <b>2</b> through the electrically conductive body <b>4</b>. As current is drawn, electrical resistance in the body <b>4</b> and at the connection terminals <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>generates hot spots where energy is dissipated. This causes heating of the body <b>4</b>, which is transferred through the body's envelope to the working fluid <b>9</b> within the internal cavity or chamber <b>6</b>. From a cold start, the working fluid <b>9</b> will be in a liquid form and, as the body is heated, the working fluid <b>9</b> is vaporised by absorbing heat from the interior surface of the body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once vaporised, the working fluid <b>9</b> vapor, driven by the pressure differential, travels along the interior chamber <b>6</b> to relatively cooler regions of the body <b>4</b>, and specifically the region adjacent to the heatsink connector <b>7</b>. Here, the relatively cooler interior surface of the chamber <b>6</b> will cause the working fluid <b>9</b> to condense back into a liquid and thereby release the latent heat stored therein. This heat transfer will be thermally conducted through the body <b>4</b> to the heatsink connector <b>7</b> and to the vehicle structure <b>11</b>, where it can be dissipated over a large surface area. At the same time, the condensed liquid working fluid <b>9</b> will flow back to the warmer regions of the body <b>4</b> through capillary action through the wick <b>5</b>. This cycle repeats, providing a very high heat transfer coefficient and ensuring highly effective thermal conduction throughout the body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As will be understood, the mass of working fluid <b>9</b> is selected so that the interior chamber <b>6</b> contains both vapor and liquid over the intended operating temperature range of the associated parts of the distribution circuit. This thereby ensures enhanced (e.g., optimised) heat transfer. That is, although heat transfer by thermal conduction through the body <b>4</b> is still possible outside of this operating range, the heat-transfer advantage gained from thermal phase transition is reduced or lost. Specifically, below the range, the liquid working fluid <b>9</b> would be too cold to vaporize into a gas, and above the range, the temperature would be too high for the vaporised working fluid <b>9</b> to condense back into a liquid.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Advantageously, the above arrangement allows a vehicle power cable, such as the main power cables to powered modules and distribution units within the vehicle, to be replaced by an improved power conductor which also provides a thermal cooling capability. This heat pipe thermal cooling capability provides cooling for both the connected components and the conductor itself. For example, in practical applications, the power conductor <b>1</b> may be secured in place by fixtures, such as screws and clips, which would form hot spots that may otherwise increase the temperature of the surrounding components. The body <b>4</b> is, however, able to draw heat from these hot spots to the heatsink connector <b>7</b>, thereby cooling the hotspots. Similarly, waste heat from the power source <b>2</b> and the load <b>10</b> may be drawn thorough the body <b>4</b> to the heatsink connector <b>7</b>. This may help to optimise the performance and operating lifespan of these components. In both cases, the transferred heat may then be dissipated through the vehicle chassis or a seat structure, which can act as a large heatsink.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At the same time, because the power conductor <b>1</b> contains no mechanical moving parts, it requires no maintenance and provides long term reliability. The arrangement also does not require the space or airflow associated with conventional heatsink arrangements because waste heat can be conveniently conveyed to existing structures within the vehicle, or to a more conveniently located heatsink along the electrical conduction pathway. As such, the power conductor <b>1</b> may be incorporated into narrower spaces within the vehicle's structural framework compared to conventional heatsink or liquid cooling arrangements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The improved thermal efficiency may further improve overall efficiency within the power distribution architecture by reducing power losses through the conductor. That is, because increasing temperature increases electrical resistance, improved cooling helps to mitigate the energy losses that would otherwise arise from an increased operating temperature.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, weight savings may also be provided because, by providing improved cooling efficiency, it is possible to reduce the conductor thicknesses that would otherwise be required. That is, in other arrangements, the required power line diameter would typically be determined based, at least in part, on the maximum allowable resistance at the highest expected operating temperature. As such, by lowering the operating temperature though improved thermal management, as is described herein, thinner power conductors may be used. This may thereby provide weight and cost savings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be understood that the implementations illustrated above show applications only for the purposes of illustration. In practice, implementations may be applied to many different configurations, the detailed implementations being straightforward for those skilled in the art to implement.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
