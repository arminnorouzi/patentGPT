surface of an optical waveguide, and, if a voltage is applied to the signal electrode, an electric field in a vertical direction with respect to the surface of the optical modulator is generated inside the optical waveguide. The refractive index of the optical waveguide varies due to the electric field; therefore, the phase of light propagating in the optical waveguide is changed and it is thus possible to modulate the light. In other words, the optical waveguide formed in the optical modulator constitutes, for example, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and is able to output, for example, IQ signals that are subjected to XY polarization division multiplexing on the basis of phase differences of the light between a plurality of optical waveguides that are disposed in parallel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating an example of a configuration of an optical modulator <b>100</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating an example of a cross-sectional portion taken along line E-E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>.

Accordingly, the distribution of the optical field depends on the cross-section area of the core, in order to broaden the distribution of the optical field, the width and the thickness of the core of each of the input unit <b>11</b>A and the output unit <b>17</b>A are made larger.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">The thickness of the core of each of the two first optical waveguides <b>13</b>A disposed on the outbound side is defined as Ha.

The thickness of the core of each of the input unit <b>11</b>A, the first optical waveguide <b>13</b>F disposed on the inbound side, and the output unit <b>17</b>A is defined as Ha2.

As a result, it is possible to improve the coupling efficiency between the input unit <b>11</b>A and the optical fiber <b>4</b>A and the coupling efficiency between the output unit <b>17</b>A and the optical fiber <b>2</b>A.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">In the optical modulator <b>5</b>H, the core of the first optical waveguide <b>13</b>F disposed on the inbound side is also made thicker than the core of the first optical waveguide <b>13</b>A disposed on the outbound side.
