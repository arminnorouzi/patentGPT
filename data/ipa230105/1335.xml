Some vents have two openings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The removable open bucket has a hollow tube with an opening.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The hollow tube is centrally positioned in the removable open bucket and is connected to the outlet port.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The invention has a convex reinforcing spacer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A compressible decontamination media is contained between the convex reinforced spacer and the docking lid.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The removable open bucket contains a reinforcing seat on which rests the convex reinforcing spacer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The health meter receives contaminated fluid via at least one inlet port of the decontamination device through the vents in the docking lid flows the contaminated fluid into the compressible layered decontamination media with sensors simultaneously forming decontaminated fluid as the controller continuously monitors remaining decontamination capacity of the health meter.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments, the removable open bucket, the convex reinforcing spacer and the reinforcing seat comprise a flexible material comprising a polymer selected from the group: polyethylene polyketone (PEEK), homopolymers of polyethylene, homopolymers of polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and copolymers thereof.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In embodiments of the health meter, the metal casing body and sealable metal lid operate from &#x2212;20 degrees Celsius to +120 degrees Celsius without clogging, without reducing flow rates, and without deforming dependent on contaminated fluid physical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The following terms are used herein:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term &#x201c;compressible decontamination media&#x201d; can refer to cellulose media. The compressible media can be a recycled material with a porosity enabling a fluid flow of contaminated fluid, such as transmission fluid, water, or glycol, at a rate of 0.1 to 10 liters per minute per removable open bucket. In embodiments, the compressible material can be a rolled material, made from cellulose fibers or similar fibrous material. In embodiments, the compressible material can be paper.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The term &#x201c;convex reinforcing spacer&#x201d; refers to a device with a plurality of ribs. The convex reinforcing spacer can have a diameter from 150 to 190 millimeters. Each spacer can have in cross section ribs that are tapered at an angle between 15 and 18 degrees. Each spacer can have an outer ring with 10 to 16 attached ribs around a hollow center that clip into the hollow tube. Clips can be used projecting from the hollow center to engage the hollow tube. The clips keep the convex reinforcing spacer a distance from the hollow tube. The convex reinforcing spacer can have a corrugated edge on each of the attached spokes to allow the decontaminated fluid to flow between spokes for higher flow rates.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term &#x201c;docking lid&#x201d; refers to the lid that is installed over the removable open bucket and contained within the metal casing body with sealable metal lid. The docking lid enables a second removable open bucket to be stacked on the docking lid of a first removable open bucket for simultaneous processing of contaminated fluid. The docking lids have openings which are defined herein. The docking lids not only provide openings but also provide load support as the removable open buckets become heavier with contaminated liquid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;sealable metal lid&#x201d; refers to a thin lid that can be metal that engages with the metal casing body by using fasteners. The sealable metal lid in embodiments can have a thickness of between 1 to 2 millimeters. The sealable metal lid can be flat or sloped. The sealable metal lid can have a diameter between 100 millimeters and 240 millimeters. The sealable metal lid can be sloped at an angle between 5 and 30 degrees. In embodiments, the sealable metal lid is made from stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;reinforcing seat&#x201d; refers to a structure that can be integral with the removable open bucket. The reinforcing seat has a lip that provides reinforcement keeping the seat self-centering in the removable open bucket. The reinforcing seat can be made from the same material as the removable open bucket. Other materials may be bonded to the reinforcing seat.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term &#x201c;openings&#x201d; refers to a plurality of individual slits or cutouts formed in the docking lid. The opening in embodiments can be a double opening. The openings can have a variety of shapes, such as triangular shaped openings. The openings can vary in size. The openings can have opening dimensions with widths ranging from 2 to 8 millimeters.
