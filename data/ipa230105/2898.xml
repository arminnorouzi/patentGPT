relates to a method of preparing a positive electrode active material for a secondary battery.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, with the rapid spread of electronic devices using batteries, such as mobile phones, notebook computers, and electric vehicles, demand for secondary batteries with relatively high capacity as well as small size and lightweight has been rapidly increased. Particularly, since a lithium secondary battery is lightweight and has high energy density, the lithium secondary battery is in the spotlight as a driving power source for portable devices. Accordingly, research and development efforts for improving the performance of the lithium secondary battery have been actively conducted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the lithium secondary battery in a state in which an organic electrolyte solution or a polymer electrolyte solution is filled between a positive electrode and a negative electrode which are respectively formed of active materials capable of intercalating and deintercalating lithium ions, electrical energy is produced by oxidation and reduction reactions when the lithium ions are intercalated/deintercalated into/from the positive electrode and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>), lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO<sub>2</sub>), lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO<sub>2 </sub>or LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, etc.), or a lithium iron phosphate compound (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>) has been used as a positive electrode active material of the lithium secondary battery. Among these materials, since the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) is advantageous in that its operating voltage is high and capacity characteristics are excellent, the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) has been widely used and has been used as a positive electrode active material for high voltage. However, since there is a limitation in using a large amount of the LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>as a power source for applications, such as electric vehicles, due to the rising price and unstable supply of cobalt (Co), there emerges a need to develop a positive electrode active material capable of replacing the LiCoO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a nickel cobalt manganese-based lithium composite transition metal oxide (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x2018;NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide&#x2019;), in which a portion of cobalt (Co) is substituted with nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn), has been developed. Recently, research to increase capacity by increasing an amount of Ni in the NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide has been conducted. However, with respect to a high-nickel (high-Ni) positive electrode active material with a high nickel content, high capacity may be realized, but, since side reactions, such as oxygen desorption and electrolyte oxidation, occur at an interface in contact with an electrolyte during charge, there are disadvantages of increasing resistance and causing gas generation and degradation of lifetime.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need to develop a high-Ni positive electrode active material having excellent surface stability, less side reaction with an electrolyte solution, and excellent thermal stability while meeting high capacity requirements.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the present invention provides a method of preparing a positive electrode active material for a secondary battery which may improve surface stability while minimizing film resistance, may effectively suppress a direct contact with an electrolyte solution and an interfacial side reaction, and may improve a reaction yield by forming a thin and uniform coating layer on a surface of a high-Ni positive electrode active material.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a positive electrode active material for a secondary battery which includes: preparing a lithium composite transition metal oxide which includes nickel, cobalt, and manganese and contains 60 mol % or more of the nickel among all metals except lithium; adding a moisture absorbent and the lithium composite transition metal oxide into an atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor; and adding a coating metal precursor into the atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor, and forming a metal oxide coating layer on surfaces of particles of the lithium composite transition metal oxide by atomic layer deposition (ALD).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, a thin and uniform coating layer may be effectively formed on a surface of a high-Ni positive electrode active material, and a reaction yield may be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the thin and uniform coating layer is formed on the surface of the high-Ni positive electrode active material according to the present invention, problems of reductions in structural/chemical stability and surface stability caused by an increase in nickel (Ni) may be improved in addition to the realization of high capacity and a direct contact with an electrolyte solution and an interfacial side reaction may be effectively suppressed while minimizing film resistance.

The lithium composite transition metal oxide is a NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide including nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn). The lithium composite transition metal oxide is a high-Ni NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide in which an amount of the nickel (Ni) in a total amount of the metals except lithium (Li) is 60 mol % or more. Preferably, the amount of the nickel (Ni) may be 70 mol % or more, for example, 80 mol % or more.

When a is less than 1.0, capacity may be reduced, and, when a is greater than 1.5, since particles are sintered in a sintering process, the preparation of the positive electrode active material may be difficult. The Li may more preferably be included in an amount satisfying 1.1&#x2264;a&#x2264;1.2, in consideration of balance between a significant capacity characteristics improvement effect of the positive electrode active material and sinterability during the preparation of the active material due to the control of the amount of the Li.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In the lithium composite transition metal oxide of Formula 1, Ni may be included in an amount corresponding to 1&#x2212;(b+c+d), for example, 0.6&#x2264;1&#x2212;(b+c+d)&#x3c;1. If the amount of the Ni in the lithium composite transition metal oxide of Formula 1 is 0.6 or more, since the amount of the Ni, which is sufficient to contribute to charge and discharge, is secured, high capacity may be achieved.

Thus, in the present invention, since a thin and uniform metal oxide coating layer is formed on surfaces of particles of the high-Ni NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a problem of reduction in the surface stability may be improved and a direct contact with an electrolyte solution and an interfacial side reaction may be effectively suppressed while minimizing film resistance.

Particularly, since the NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide, furthermore, the high-Ni NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide is very vulnerable to moisture, moisture absorption is important in a surface treatment process and it becomes an important factor in determining battery performance when the high-Ni NCM-based lithium composite transition metal oxide is used in a lithium secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Thus, in the present invention, a reaction yield may not only be improved, but a more uniform coating layer may also be formed by adding a moisture absorbent into the atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor.

This was due to film resistance caused by the coating layer formed at an interface. When EIS was measured after 100 charge and discharge cycles, a resistance value of Comparative Example 1, in which no treatment was performed on the surface, was 9.94 &#x3a9;g, wherein the resistance value was increased by 5.46 times that of the first cycle. In contrast, Examples 1 and 2 had a significantly less increase in the resistance in comparison to Comparative Example 1. Examples 1 and 2 also had a relatively small increase in the resistance in comparison to Comparative Example 2 without using the moisture absorbent.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
