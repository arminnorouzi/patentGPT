It should be appreciated that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any of the material referred to was part of the common general knowledge at the priority date of the application.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Oil and gas provide much of the energy for transportation in the world today. Oil wells are used to bore into the earth and bring petroleum oil hydrocarbons to the surface. In the process of drilling wells, downhole tools are used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Downhole tools are pieces of oilfield equipment that are used during well drilling, completion and intervention or well workover activities and that help the oil well in optimizing the production levels and maintaining a continuous flow from a reservoir. There are many types of downhole tools that are used to conduct well activities, such as slickline tools and equipment, wireline tools and equipment, drilling jars, fishing tools, pushing tools, drill pipes, tubular tools, centralizers, bridge plugs, packers, cement retainers, frac plugs, dissolving frac plugs, and others. Some tools involve the need to move parts downhole to set the tool in a desired location or for other purposes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various downhole tools require moving parts to activate various mechanical functionalities of the particular tool. For example, downhole tools may incorporate switch type devices for turning on or off particular tool functions, release or catch mechanisms to engage or disengage particular tool functions, rotational mechanical parts that activate particular downhole tool functions, and moving parts that change or redirect the flow of downhole fluids such as production fluids, fracking fluids, and drilling fluid which is commonly referred to as mud.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since downhole tools are located in a well bore at substantial depths, there are limited means to achieve the required mechanical movements because of the technical and spatial limitations within a wellbore. Some typical ways to achieve mechanical movements for activation of downhole tool functionality are the use of hydraulic fluids, rotational motions, pulling motions, and pushing motions. For example, a particular functionality of a downhole tool may be activated by hydraulic pressure of fluids pumped into the well bore through a downhole string or casing. In this case, various mechanisms such as ball seats, which can be used to block the flow of hydraulic fluid, and spring mechanisms, which can be moved by application of sufficient hydraulic pressure, can be used to achieve both lateral and rotational movement of downhole tool components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another method to achieve movement of mechanical components of a downhole tool is through physical movement of the downhole tool or of a drill or other downhole string to which the tool is attached. Movements of downhole tool components, and therefore, activation of downhole tool functionality in these cases is achieved by, for example, pushing or pulling on the downhole tool or downhole string or by rotating the downhole tool or downhole string. In these cases, the downhole tool is designed to respond to the corresponding motion to activate a particular function of the downhole tool. Improved tools, systems, and methods are desired.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Illustrative embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the attached drawing figures, which are incorporated by reference herein and wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic longitudinal cross-sectional view in a well casing of an illustrative embodiment of a downhole tool with functionality activated by a gas generation device and shown in an undeployed position or state;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic longitudinal cross-sectional view in a well casing of the illustrative embodiment of a downhole tool of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shown in a deployed position or state;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic, longitudinal cross section of an illustrative downhole tool in the form of a self-setting frac plug disposed in a run-in condition and located within a well casing;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic, exploded, perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of an annular charge cannister;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic, front elevation view of an illustrative embodiment of an annular lid of an illustrative embodiment of an annular charge cannister;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic, side elevation view of an illustrative embodiment of the annular lid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic, side elevation view of an illustrative embodiment of an annular chamber of an illustrative embodiment of an annular charge cannister;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic, front elevation view of the illustrative embodiment of an annular chamber of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic, front elevation view of an illustrative embodiment of an annular chamber of an illustrative embodiment of an annular charge cannister; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic, side elevation view of the illustrative embodiment of an annular chamber of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that logical structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Unless otherwise indicated, as used throughout this document, &#x201c;or&#x201d; does not require mutual exclusivity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While the above-described methods for activating various downhole tool functionalities have useful applications in many circumstances, the use of these methodologies may suffer in some regards. For example, if rotational movement of a drill string is used to cause activation of a downhole tool functionality by moving various components of the downhole tool, then often the selective use of another downhole tool or component that uses rotational movement as an activation method is not able to be achieved on the same trip because the rotational movement would activate both downhole tools, which may not be desired. The same is true of tool functionality activation by pushing, pulling, and use of hydraulic fluids. The alternatives to this are the use of more complicated downhole tools, which are more prone to failure, or to make multiple trips into a wellbore so the operator can change the downhole tools between trips, which is costly and time consuming. Again, improvements are desired.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Downhole tools are pieces of oilfield equipment that are used during well drilling, completion and intervention or well workover activities and that help the oil well in optimizing the production levels and maintaining a continuous flow from a reservoir. There are many types of downhole tools that are used to conduct well activities, such as slickline tools and equipment, wireline tools and equipment, drilling jars, fishing tools, pushing tools, drill pipes, tubular tools, centralizers, bridge plugs, packers, cement retainers, frac plugs, dissolving frac plugs, and others. Some tools involve the need to move parts downhole to set the tool in a desired location or for other purposes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A generated gas may be used to energize the movement of the parts, or components, of the downhole tool. Gas generation may be used with many of the tools mentioned, such as, pipe recovery tools, jet cutters, chemical cutters, mechanical cutters, setting tools, frac plugs, perforating guns, jars, and others. Various embodiments of the disclosure may be used with these tools.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one illustrative embodiment, the use of a generated gas can move mechanical components of a downhole tool. In such an embodiment, a gas is generated in a confined or enclosed space, typically through one or more chemical reactions. Since the gas is trapped in a confined or enclosed space, the generation of the gas results in a pressure increase within the confined space. The resulting pressure increase in the confined space then acts as a force against moveable mechanical components of the downhole tool, which results in the movement of such components. This movement can be lateral movement, translational movement, axial movement, or rotational movement. In addition, the movement of the mechanical components of the downhole tool can be a combination of lateral movement, translational movement, axial movement, or rotational movement. The movement of the mechanical components of the downhole tool results in a change in configuration or position of the various components of the downhole tool, which ultimately results in a change of a functionality characteristic of the downhole tool, such as turning on or turning off a particular function of the downhole tool.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one illustrative embodiment, gas generation and the resulting pressure from gas generation can be selectively controlled or directed toward the movement of particular components of a downhole tool by the use of vent ports and flow paths designed to direct the flow of gas being generated and therefore selectively applying a pressure force to certain components of the downhole tool</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one illustrative embodiment, a gas generation component is a distinct component of a downhole string in which the downhole tool, which is also part of the downhole string, that is the target of the gas generation component is also a component of the downhole string or is otherwise already located within a wellbore. In another embodiment, a gas generation component is an integrated component of a downhole tool. In other embodiments, a downhole string has more than one gas generation device, each of which may be selectively activated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an illustrative embodiment, components that need to be moved downhole may be moved by using a power charge, e.g., flammable solid, to generate pressured gases that are received within a chamber or cylinder or confined space to move a piston or other part relative to other portions or components. The movement of the parts often is used to forcibly set the well tool being run within the well or to achieve the desired movement. In one illustrative embodiment, the power charge is within and part of an annular charge canister. The annular charge cannister has an annular chamber with a mating annular lid and a power charge within the annular chamber.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, for illustration purposes, a simplified downhole tool <b>100</b> with a mechanical component <b>102</b> that is activated by a gas generator <b>104</b> is depicted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts the downhole tool <b>100</b> in an inactivated or undeployed state prior to activation of the gas generator <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts downhole tool <b>100</b> in an activated or deployed state after activation of gas generator <b>104</b>, which include annual cannister has presented further below. The illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is a generalized embodiment in which the downhole tool <b>100</b> may be any type of downhole tool that has a functionality that is controlled through movement of mechanical parts while the tool is downhole. For exemplary purposes, the downhole tool <b>100</b> is a simple plug that may be used to stop the flow of fluids within a casing wellbore.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The downhole tool <b>100</b> is attached, at an up-hole end, to a string <b>106</b> and lowered into a casing <b>108</b> to the desired location. The up-hole end of the downhole tool <b>100</b> has a smaller diameter than the downhole end of the downhole tool <b>100</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the gas generator <b>104</b> is an integrated component of the downhole tool <b>100</b>, which is designed to mate with and fit over the smaller diameter up hole end of the downhole tool <b>100</b>. In this manner the gas generator <b>104</b> may form a gas tight seal against a corresponding mating surface of the downhole <b>100</b>. The gas generator <b>104</b> has an internal diameter surface that may be keyed or indexed to a corresponding outer diameter of the downhole tool <b>100</b> to ensure proper fit and alignment of the gas generator <b>104</b> with the downhole tool <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the mechanical component <b>102</b> is depicted as a simple wedge, which is capable of moving along a central axis of the downhole tool <b>100</b> in the downhole direction. It should be understood that the mechanical component <b>102</b> of the downhole tool <b>100</b> is a gross simplification of the various mechanical components that can be implemented to activate the downhole tool <b>100</b> functionality. In many versions of the downhole tool <b>100</b>, the mechanical component <b>102</b> will be a much more complicated component than the simplification depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the mechanical component <b>102</b> is a collection of various components that are designed to interact with one another and other components of the downhole tool <b>100</b> to achieve the desired functionality of the downhole tool <b>100</b>. The movement of the mechanical component <b>102</b> or the various components making up the mechanical component <b>102</b> can utilize any number or types of movement or combinations of types of movements to accomplish the activation of the downhole tool <b>100</b> functionality, such as lateral movements, translational movements, and rotational movements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the downhole tool <b>100</b> is positioned within the casing <b>108</b> at the desired location, the functionality of the downhole tool is activated. Activation occurs by initiation of the gas generator <b>104</b>. Upon activation of the gas generator <b>104</b>, a gas is generated within the gas generator <b>104</b> and is expelled as directed and this case in the downhole direction. Since the downhole side of the gas generator <b>104</b> is mated with an up-hole surface of the downhole tool <b>100</b>, the generated gas increases the pressure between the gas generator <b>104</b> and the mating surface of the downhole tool <b>100</b>. The mechanical component <b>102</b> is designed to respond to the increased pressure between the gas generator <b>104</b> and the mating surface of the downhole tool <b>100</b>. In response to this pressure force, the mechanical component <b>102</b>, in the simplified embodiment of the downhole tool <b>100</b>, is forced to move in the downhole direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this embodiment, the mechanical component <b>102</b> is cone shaped. As the mechanical component <b>102</b> moves in the downhole direction, the sloped walls of the mechanical component <b>102</b> contact and engage an inner surface of a sealing element <b>110</b>. Further downhole movement of the mechanical component <b>102</b> causes the sealing element <b>110</b> to slide axially within the downhole tool <b>100</b>. Such movement continues until the sealing element <b>110</b> contacts the inner wall of the casing <b>108</b>, which results in a seal in the wellbore between the casing <b>108</b> and the downhole tool <b>100</b> to prevent or obstruct fluid flow withing the casing <b>108</b> at this point.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The downhole tool <b>100</b>, in its sealed condition, can be used for any number of purposes in which a well operator would desire to seal flow withing a casing or wellbore. For example, the downhole tool <b>100</b> can be used to plug a well permanently, in the case of shutting in a well, or temporarily, such as in the case of introducing fracking fluids into a casing or wellbore. In the case of using the downhole tool <b>100</b> for fracking procedures, once the seal between the downhole tool <b>100</b> and the casing <b>108</b> is formed, fracking fluids are pumped into the casing under pressure. The seal between the downhole tool <b>100</b> and the casing <b>108</b> creates a positive back force that acts against the fracking fluid, which allows for the operator to generate fluid pressures necessary for fracking the surrounding formation in the area of the casing or wellbore that is up hole of the downhole tool <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once fracking is completed, if flow below the downhole tool <b>100</b> is desired, then the downhole tool <b>100</b> is removed. Removal of the downhole tool <b>100</b> is accomplished by utilizing an activation method to disengage the sealing element <b>108</b>, milling away the downhole tool <b>100</b>, dissolving the downhole tool <b>100</b>, or other well-known methods of removing a downhole tool <b>100</b> from a casing or a wellbore. Alternatively, the downhole tool <b>100</b> has a controllable flow path allowing for operator control of flow through the downhole tool <b>100</b> above and below the downhole tool <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">While not depicted or described in relation to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many additional features and functions of the downhole tool <b>100</b> may be present in the downhole tool <b>100</b>. For example, the downhole tool <b>100</b> may include a flow path through the downhole tool <b>100</b> to allow for fluid communication through the casing <b>108</b> above and below the downhole tool <b>100</b>.

The frac plug <b>300</b> has a mandrel <b>308</b> that provides a central, stationary member for the frac plug <b>300</b>, extending substantially the full length of the frac plug <b>300</b>. The mandrel <b>308</b> is tubular shaped and may extend concentrically around a central longitudinal axis <b>312</b> of the frac plug <b>300</b>. A ball seat <b>316</b> is formed on the upper end of the mandrel <b>308</b> for sealingly engaging with a drop ball. The frac plug <b>300</b> further includes a lock ring <b>320</b> about the setting rod <b>322</b> and a seal and anchor assembly <b>324</b>.

An elastomeric seal element <b>344</b> is disposed between the upper conical sleeve <b>328</b> and the lower conical sleeve <b>340</b> for compressing there-between to seal between an exterior surface of the plug mandrel <b>308</b> and the interior surface of the well casing <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Below the lower conical sleeves <b>340</b> and lower slips <b>336</b> is an illustrative embodiment of an annular charge cannister <b>348</b> that is filled with a power charge <b>352</b>. The annular charge cannister <b>348</b> is between a lower edge of the lower slips <b>336</b> and an upper surface <b>354</b> of a barrel piston <b>356</b>, or piston sleeve.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The power charge <b>352</b> is contained within the annular charge cannister <b>348</b> of the frac plug <b>300</b> and powers the barrel piston <b>356</b> to set the slips <b>336</b>, <b>328</b> and expand a seal element <b>344</b>. The power charge <b>352</b> may be a mixture of propellant and epoxy that is cured into solid form in the shape of a chamber or space within the annular charge cannister <b>348</b>. Power charges are constructed of propellant mixtures composed of carefully controlled combustible elements containing an oxidizer which when ignited will begin a slow burn. The gas derived from a burning power charge propellant mixture gradually builds up to high pressures and causes a setting tool to stroke, setting a downhole tool in a well. The gas from the annular charge cannister <b>348</b> may be delivered through one or more ports in the annular charge cannister <b>348</b> (or through the lid allowing gases out) through a passageway to the ports <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A propellant for the power charge <b>352</b> may be provided by a combination of combustible materials and an oxidizer, such as sodium nitrate, Pyrodex, which is a smokeless black powder substitute, and wheat flour. The propellant mixture of the power charge <b>352</b> may be formed of a mixture of the propellant and a binder. The binder may be a two-part slow cure epoxy including an epoxy resin and an epoxy hardener which will harden to a solid in twenty-four hours, locking the propellant mixture into the rigid, solid form. To provide the power charge, the propellant mixture may be mixed to a dough-like form, of a consistency similar to cookie dough, which may be tightly packed into a chamber in the annular charge cannister <b>348</b> or is packed in uncured form directly into the annular charge cannister <b>348</b> in the frac plug <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many formulations of the power charge <b>352</b> may be used in different contexts.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The annular charge cannister <b>348</b> or the cannister lid may include a port (<b>404</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) for receiving an igniter.

Force from the pressures of the generated gases will press against an inner end face <b>368</b> of the annular-shaped boss <b>372</b> of the barrel piston <b>356</b>, moving the barrel piston <b>356</b> upwards to set the frac plug <b>300</b>. The flow ports <b>360</b> extend through the sidewall of the mandrel <b>308</b> between the inwardly extending boss <b>373</b> and the outwardly extending boss <b>375</b>.
