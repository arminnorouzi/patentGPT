It is expressed in the adult in the Sertoli cells and Leydig cells (testis) and the granulosa cells (ovary). It plays a role in the activity of the adult ovary in the regulation of folliculogenesis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The anti-M&#xfc;llerian hormone type II receptor (AMHRII) is a peptide of 573 amino acids and possesses serine-threonine kinase activity. It is involved in the regression of the M&#xfc;llerian duct associated with the development of the human reproductive system. The M&#xfc;llerian duct atrophies in men, where it only forms the prostatic vesicle and the sessile hydatid, but persists in women, where it gives rise to the Fallopian tubes, uterus and the greater part of the vagina. This receptor is frequently expressed on human ovarian epithelial tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More particularly, it has been shown that AMH inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of AMH type II receptor (AMHRII)-positive tumor cells, especially progenitor cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various reports have moreover described the expression of AMHRII in human gynecologic cancers including ovarian tumors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has moreover recently been described the detection of AMHRII mRNA in several primary cancer tissues including melanoma, lung, head and neck, colorectal and breast cancers. AMHRII protein expression was later confirmed by ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC). Using this same method, over 1000 frozen samples covering 16 different cancer types were tested, which demonstrated AMHRII expression in over 50% of hepatocarcinoma, colorectal, lung and renal cancer samples. Preliminary FACS analysis of fresh ovarian and colorectal tumor samples have demonstrated comparable expression levels with mean values of 50,000 and 40,000 AMHRII receptors per cell, respectively. It has thus been shown that AMHRII is expressed in many different histological types of gynecological and non-gynecological solid tumors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">International application WO 2008/053330 describes a murine 12G4 monoclonal antibody directed against AMHRII for treating ovarian cancers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">International application WO 2011/141653 describes mutated humanized 12G4 antibodies, or fragments thereof, possessing an affinity at least equal to that of the corresponding unmutated chimeric antibody, specificity with respect to the AMHRII receptor, and not eliciting an immune reaction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">International application WO 2017/025458 moreover describes an antibody drug conjugate, named GM103, that binds to AMHRII and can be used to treat AMHRII expressing cancers. GM103 was obtained by conjugation of the humanized low fucose 3C23K antibody with a MMAE drug payload. 3C23K is indicated as being obtained as described in WO 2011/141653.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, there still remains a need in the art for further tools for the therapy of cancers, that may be alternative or complementary to the existing therapies. In particular, it remains a need for further tools having improved properties in the therapy of cancers compared to the already existing therapy, and in particular to the already existing antibody drug conjugates.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first object, the present invention relates to an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) of general formula (I):</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(D-Lk<sub>1</sub>-C(O)-Lk<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;NH-Lk<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-Ab (I)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">wherein:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">D represents a PBD dimer of formula (II):</li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="28.28mm" wi="119.80mm" file="US20230001006A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">in which &#x2605; represents the link to the Lk<sub>1 </sub>group;<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">Lk<sub>1 </sub>represents a cathepsin B-cleavable valine-alanine dipeptide of formula (III):</li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="33.27mm" wi="74.59mm" file="US20230001006A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">in which &#x25b4; represents the link to the D group and &#x25aa; represents the link to the &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;;<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0014">Lk<sub>2 </sub>represents a group comprising at least one ethylene glycol unit &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0015">Lk<sub>3 </sub>represents a linker of formula (IV):</li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="25.32mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230001006A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0020" num="0000">in which &#x2666; represents the link to the &#x2014;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&#x2014; group and <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.22mm" wi="3.56mm" file="US20230001006A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> represents the link to the antibody or its fragment thereof;<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">n is an integer from 1 to 10; and</li>    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0017">Ab represents an anti-AMHRII antibody, or a fragment thereof, comprising:    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0018">(a) a heavy chain wherein the variable domain comprises:</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0019">a H-CDR1 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0020">a H-CDR2 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2; and</li>        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0021">a H-CDR3 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 3; and</li>        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0022">(b) a light chain wherein the variable domain comprises:</li>        <li id="ul0005-0006" num="0023">a L-CDR1 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 4,</li>        <li id="ul0005-0007" num="0024">a L-CDR2 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 5; and</li>        <li id="ul0005-0008" num="0025">a L-CDR3 having a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 6.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">The inventors have unexpectedly shown that while an ADC of the present invention has an in vitro binding to AMHRII and an in vitro potency lower than the one of an ADC different from the invention (GM103) but also targeting AMHRII, the results obtained in vivo with an ADC of the invention are superior to the said ADC outside the invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">In particular, the inventors unexpectedly demonstrated that an ADC according to the invention is more effective than an ADC outside the invention but also targeting AMHRII.

In natural antibodies, two heavy chains are linked to each other by disulfide bonds and each heavy chain is linked to a light chain by a disulfide bond. There are two types of light chain, lambda (I) and kappa (k). In the context of this invention, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also encompasses chimeric or humanized variants of an antibody.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0086">As used herein, &#x201c;antibody mutant&#x201d; or &#x201c;antibody variant&#x201d; refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i e amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0087">An &#x201c;antibody heavy chain,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the larger of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0088">An &#x201c;antibody light chain,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the smaller of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations, &#x3ba; and &#x3bb; light chains refer to the two major antibody light chain isotypes.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0089">As used herein the term &#x201c;complementarily determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refers to the part of the two variable chains of antibodies (heavy and light chains) that recognize and bind to the particular antigen. The CDRs are the most variable portion of the variable chains and provide the antibody with its specificity. There are three CDRs on each of the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains and thus there are a total of six CDRs per antibody molecule. The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a VHCDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a VLCDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. An antibody that binds AMHRII will have a specific VH region and the VL region sequence, and thus specific CDR sequences. Antibodies with different specificities (i.e. different combining sites for different antigens) have different CDRs. Although it is the CDRs that vary from antibody to antibody, only a limited number of amino acid positions within the CDRs are directly involved in antigen binding. These positions within the CDRs are called specificity determining residues (SDRs).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0090">&#x201c;Framework regions&#x201d; (hereinafter FR) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues. Each variable domain typically has four FRs identified as FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. If the CDRs are defined according to Kabat, the light chain FR residues are positioned at about residues 1-23 (LCFR1), 35-49 (LCFR2), 57-88 (LCFR3), and 98-107 (LCFR4) and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-30 (HCFR1), 36-49 (HCFR2), 66-94 (HCFR3), and 103-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0091">The term &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; refers to an engineered antibody which comprises a VH domain and a VL domain of an antibody derived from a non-human animal, a CH domain and a CL domain of another antibody, in particular a human antibody. As the non-human animal, any animal such as mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0092">The term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies in which the framework or &#x201c;complementarity determining regions&#x201d; (CDR) have been modified to comprise the CDR from a donor immunoglobulin of different specificity as compared to that of the parent immunoglobulin. In a preferred embodiment, a mouse CDR is grafted into the framework region of a human antibody to prepare the &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0093">The term &#x201c;AMHRII&#x201d; relates to the Anti-M&#xfc;llerian Hormone type II Receptor, and in particular the human Anti-M&#xfc;llerian Hormone type II Receptor. The sequence of the human AMHRII (lacking the signal peptide MLGSLGLWALLPTAVEA (SEQ ID NO: 12)) is:</p><p id="p-0078" num="0094">PPNRRTCVFFEAPGVRGSTKTLGELLDTGTELPRAIRCLYSRCCFGIWNLTQDRAQVE MQCGRDSDEPGCESLHCDPSPRAHPSPGSTLFTCSCGTDFCNANYSHLPPPGSPGTPG SQGPQAAPGESIWMALVLLGLFLLLLLLLGSIILALLQRKNYRVRGEPVPEPRPDSGR DWSVELQELPELCFSQVIREGGHAVVWAGQLQGKLVAIKAFPPRSVAQFQAERALYE LPGLQHDHIVRFITASRGGPGRLLSGPLLVLELHPKGSLCHYLTQYTSDWGSSLRMAL SLAQGLAFLHEERWQNGQYKPGIAHRDLSSQNVLIREDGSCAIGDLGLALVLPGLTQ PPAWTPTQPQGPAAIMEAGTQRYMAPELLDKTLDLQDWGMALRRADIYSLALLLWE ILSRCPDLRPDSSPPPFQLAYEAELGNTPTSDELWALAVQERRRPYIPSTWRCFATDPD GLRELLEDCWDADPEARLTAECVQQRLAALAHPQESHPFPESCPRGCPPLCPEDCTSI PAPTILPCRPQRSACHFSVQQGPCSRNPQPACTLSPV (SEQ ID NO: 11). Several variants of the human AMHRII are also known. The sequences for these isoforms are provided by the identifiers Q16671-2 and Q16671-3 at the web site uniprot.org.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0095">AMHRII is expressed at the cell membrane of gynecologic and non-gynecologic cancer tissues with a variable frequency depending of the cancer type which is considered. Illustratively, AMHRII is expressed more frequently by cancer cells derived from tumor tissue originating from patients affected with colorectal cancer than by cancer cells derived from tumor tissue originating from patients affected with a head and neck cancer. This means that these two types of cancers are eligible for an anti-cancer treatment targeting AMHRII, but that such an anti-cancer treatment will be less frequently relevant for treating patients affected with a head and neck cancer.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0096">Any cancer mentioned in the present text may be treated by an ADC according to the invention, provided that cancer cells from the said cancer express AMHRII at their membrane, thus provided that the presence of AMHRII proteins at the cancer cell membrane can be detected or determined according to any method well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0097">Thus, a ADC according to the invention is effective for treating a plurality of distinct kinds of cancers, provided that the AMHRII target protein is expressed at the cancer cells membrane.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0098">Incidentally, in particular in the field of anti-cancer active ingredients consisting of target-binding molecules, e.g. ADC, the situation wherein the same active ingredient is effective for treating a plurality of distinct cancers is not unprecedented. Illustratively, the anti-PD1 antibody named pembrolizumab has been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an active ingredient useful in the treatment of a variety of distinct kinds of cancers, provided that the said cancers share the same physiological features.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0099">Thus, an individual affected with a cancer may be treated for the said cancer with an ADC as described herein when AMHRII membrane expression by the cancer cells previously collected from the said individual is detected or otherwise determined by an appropriate method.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0100">In some embodiments, expression of AMHRII at the cell membrane of cancer cells encompasses that the said cancer cells express AMHRII at a given quantifiable level or higher than the said quantifiable level.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0101">Thus, according to some embodiments, responsiveness of an individual affected with a cancer according to the invention to a treatment with an ADC of the invention may be assessed by determining whether cancer cells from a sample previously collected from the said individual express AMHRII at their membrane.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0102">According to some embodiments, responsiveness of an individual affected with a cancer according to the invention to a treatment with an ADC according to the invention may be assessed by determining whether cancer cells from a sample previously collected from the said individual express AMHRII at their membrane above a determined threshold value.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0103">The AMHRII membrane expression level that may be used in some embodiments for determining the responsiveness of a patient affected with a disease according to the invention to a treatment with an ADC of the invention may be assessed with a variety of techniques, which include (i) the percentage of disease cells contained in a cancer sample that express AMHRII at their membrane, (ii) the mean number of AMHRII proteins at the cancer cell membrane and (iii) the FACS AMHRII signal profile of the cancer cells contained in a tested cancer cell sample.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0104">According to some embodiments, cancer cells comprised in a tumor sample previously collected for an individual affected with a cancer according to the invention may be assessed as expressing membranous AMHRII when membranous AMHRII is detected in 5% or more of the cancer cells comprised in the said cancer sample.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0105">Thus, in some embodiments, an individual affected with a cancer according to the invention is determined as being responsive to a treatment with an ADC of the invention when 5% or more of the cancer cells comprised in a cancer sample previously collected from the said individual express AMHRII at their membrane.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0106">Methods for determining the frequency (e.g. the percentage) of cancer cells expressing membrane AMHRII proteins are well known in the art (see for example Wo2018189379).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0107">According to some embodiments, responsiveness of a patient affected with a cancer according to the invention to a cancer treatment with an ADC of the invention may be assessed by determining the mean number of AMHRII proteins present at the membrane of the cancer cells contained in a cancer sample previously collected from the said patient.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0108">In some embodiments, a patient affected with a cancer according to the invention may be classified as responsive to a treatment with an ADC of the invention when the mean number of membrane AMHRII proteins expressed by the cancer cells contained in a cancer sample previously collected from the said patient is of 10 000 AMHRII proteins or more.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0109">Assessing the number of AMHRII proteins expressed at the cancer cell membrane may be performed by using conventional methods comprising (a) a step of incubating a sample containing the cells from a cancer tissue sample previously collected from the patient with a detectable compound that binds specifically with AMHRII protein, such as a fluorescently labeled anti-AMHRII antibody, and further (b) a step of determining the number of the said detectable compounds, e.g. the number of fluorescently labeled anti-AMHRII antibodies, bound to each tested cell from the said sample. Assessing the number of AMHRII proteins expressed at the cancer cell membrane may be, for instance, performed by using the well-known Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) technique, as it is shown in the examples herein.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0110">In still other embodiments, a patient affected with a cancer may be classified as responsive to a treatment with an ADC of the invention by analysis of the AMHRII FACS profile of the cancer cells contained in a cancer sample previously collected from the said patient.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0111">According to these still other embodiments, a patient affected with a cancer according to the invention may be classified as responsive to a treatment with an ADC of the invention when, in a method of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), the ratio of (i) the mean fluorescence intensity of the cancer cells incubated with an anti-AMHRII fluorescently labeled antibody to (ii) the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value obtained from cancer cells incubated with an isotypic fluorescently labeled antibody is of 1.5 or more.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0112">For determining the said mean fluorescence intensity ratio, both the isotypic antibody and the anti-AMHRII antibody are labeled with the same fluorescent agent, such as the Alexa Fluor 488 dye commercialized by the Company ThermoFisher Scientific., as shown in WO2018189379.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0113">In some further embodiments, responsiveness of a disease individual to a treatment with an ADC of the invention may be determined by calculating an AMHRII expression score allowing to discriminate between (i) membrane AMHRII-expressing cancer cells derived from cancers that may be treated with an AMHRII-binding agent and (ii) membrane AMHRII-expressing cancer cells derived from cancers that may not be treated with an AMHRII-binding agent.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0114">Thus, the inventors have determined that patients affected with a cancer of the present text, who are especially eligible to a cancer treatment with an ADC of the invention encompass those having cancers expressing AMHRII at the cell membrane at a sufficiently high level for consisting in relevant cell targets to be destroyed.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0115">Then, according to these further embodiments, the inventors have determined that a minimal AMHRII expression level measured in a cancer cell sample from a disease patient may confirm that the said patient is responsive to a treatment with an ADC of the invention and that the said patient may thus be treated by an ADC described here-in.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0116">Responsiveness of an individual affected with a cancer to a treatment with an ADC of the invention may thus also be determined when AMHRII

cell.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0117">Thus, in some of these further embodiments, responsiveness of a patient affected with a cancer according to the invention to an ADC of the invention in a sample of

As shown in WO2018189379, the membranous AMHRII expression level, allowing assigning an individual membranous AMHRII score, may also be assessed by determining the mean number of membranous AMHRII proteins per cell, starting from a sample of tumor cells that has been previously collected from a patient affected with a cancer according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0122">According to the above embodiments of determining responsiveness of an individual affected with a cancer according to the invention to a treatment with an ADC of the invention, a membranous AMHRII expression score is determined, for a given cancer of the invention cell sample, by taking into account both (i) the frequency of AMHRII-expressing cells in the said cancer cell sample and (ii) the level of AMHRII expression by the said AMHRII-expressing cells. Typically, an AMHRII expression score of a given cancer cell sample is determined by the following formula (I):</p><p id="p-0107" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>E-SCORE=FREQ&#xd7;AMHRII_LEVEL, wherein<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0123">E-SCORE means the AMHRII expression score value for a given cancer cell sample,</li>        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0124">FREQ means the frequency of the cells contained in the said cancer cell sample for which membrane AMHRII expression is detected, and</li>        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0125">AMHRII_LEVEL means the level of expression of AMHRII by the AMHRII-expressing cells contained in the said given cancer cell sample.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0108" num="0126">Illustratively, a E-SCORE of 1.0 is determined for a given cancer according to the invention cell sample wherein (i) 50% of the cells express AMHRII (FREQ value of 0.5) and (ii) the AMHRII expression level (AMHRII_LEVEL) is of 2.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0127">In preferred embodiments, an AMHRII expression score (or E-SCORE) is determined by immunohistological methods as shown in the examples herein. According to these preferred embodiments, AMHRII membrane expression is assessed by using a detectable antibody specific for AMHRII and by (i) determining the frequency of cells having the said anti-AMHRII antibody bound thereto and (ii) determining the intensity of the signal generated by the said detectable anti-AMHRII antibody after its binding to the membrane-expressed AMHRII.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0128">Although, AMHRII-expressing cancer cells having an AMHRII expression score of 1.5 or more have been determined for various cancers, albeit to distinct frequencies. Illustratively, it has been shown that cancer cells derived from colon tumors are classified as AMHRII positive (i.e. having an AMHRII score of 1.5 or more) with a higher frequency than cancer cells derived from head and neck cancer.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0129">For determining the level of AMHRII membrane expression, detection of AMHRII at the cell membrane shall be most preferably performed by using an anti-AMHRII monoclonal antibody having a high affinity and high specificity for AMHRII.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0130">Further, determination of AMHRII expression by an immuno-histochemical method with the view of determining a AMHRII score most preferably involves a careful pretreatment of the tissue sample before contacting the said sample with an appropriate detection reagent (e.g. a high affinity anti-AMHRII monoclonal antibody such as monoclonal 3C23K antibody, having a Kd value of 55.3 pM for binding to AMHRII). Sample pretreatment shall allow increasing the availability to the detection reagent of the AMHRII molecules expressed at the cell surface. Illustratively, staining method comprises an appropriate combination of specific steps such as (i) a high-temperature dewaxing by exposure to a microwave source and (ii) a system for amplifying the signal generated by the binding of an AMHRII-binding reagent, such as a biotinylated anti-AMHRII antibody that may be subsequently complexed with a streptavidin-conjugated detectable reagent. A pretreatment dewaxing step has appeared to be important for reversing the detection signal extinction effect due to the prior tissue fixation step. The inventors have shown that AMHRII detectability is particularly sensitive to the action of formalin which is used for the tissue fixation step.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0131">In the context of the present invention, this means that an ADC of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent with a higher frequency for treating patients affected with a colon cancer than for treating patients affected with a head and neck cancer. This also means that, although an ADC of the invention may be a relevant therapeutic agent for treating patients affected with head and neck cancer, it will be preferred to test previously for the AMHRII expression of the tumor-derived cancer cells for deciding that a specific patient will be administered with an ADC of the invention.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0132">As used herein, the interchangeable terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; and &#x201c;individual&#x201d; denote a mammal, such as a rodent, a feline, a canine, or a primate.

It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0212">An ADC of the invention can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition of the invention in a neutral or salt form. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0213">The medium can also be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetables oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid; thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride.

Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0215">The preparation of more, or highly concentrated solutions for direct injection is also contemplated in the present invention, where the use of DMSO as solvent is envisioned to result in extremely rapid penetration, delivering high concentrations of the active agents to a small tumor area.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0216">Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective.
