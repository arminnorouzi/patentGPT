description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to motor vehicle bodywork panels, and more particularly to bumper skins.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The bodywork panels may comprise a transparent portion that is visible from outside the vehicle on which the panels are mounted. For example, a bumper skin can comprise, at an area comprising a vehicle emblem, a portion comprising a wall that is transparent to visible light. It could also be an area of a bodywork panel forming a radome. The term &#x201c;transparent to visible light&#x201d; means that it is at least transparent to any light radiation having a wavelength comprised in the visible spectrum, that is to say, comprised between about 380 and 780 nm. Using a transparent wall for example allows a good quality visual rendering to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the transparent wall, which is visible from outside the vehicle, can be exposed to climatic conditions and deteriorate, which poses a substantial problem for a part intended at least in part for esthetics. For example, certain available thermoplastic materials turn yellow by thermal oxidation, that is to say, in contact with oxygen and in the presence of heat, for example that of the sun. This is particularly the case for certain polyamides and polyvinyl chloride. It is then necessary to use special plastic materials that are not subject to this phenomenon, which reduces the choice of materials and can generate additional production costs for the bodywork panels by having to design a transparent wall with a plastic material having a particular formulation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These degradations lead not only to a potential loss of the desired esthetic rendering, but can also give the bodywork panel an appearance that is not acceptable in the long term.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the present disclosure is in particular to provide a bodywork panel of the type mentioned above having an optimal and durable esthetic result during the lifetime of the vehicle on which it is mounted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To this end, the subject of the present disclosure is a motor vehicle bodywork panel comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a main body,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">a wall made of plastic material that is transparent to visible light, comprising a face intended to be visible from outside the vehicle, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">a coating that is transparent to visible light covering at least the face of the wall that is transparent to visible light intended to be visible from the outside of the vehicle, the wall being encapsulated in a sealed manner between the main body and the coating.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">Thus, a motor vehicle bodywork panel is obtained comprising an outer wall that is transparent to visible light which is not in contact with oxygen, which prevents thermal oxidation leading to the yellowing of certain plastic materials. This allows the esthetics of the bodywork panel to be preserved, regardless of the plastic material used to form the wall transparent to visible light (it is therefore possible to use plastic materials that are frequently used to design bodywork panels without having to modify their formulation, in particular polyamides). The presence of an external coating makes it possible to protect the transparent wall from scratches and ultraviolet rays, but also to integrate, for example, a decorative film or even defrosting wires. This can make it possible to protect the transparent wall (protection against scratches and ultraviolet rays), to change the esthetic rendering of the bodywork panel (integration of a decorative film) or even to integrate options on the vehicle (presence of defrosting wires).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">The bodywork panel according to the present disclosure may further comprise at least one of the

<b>1</b></figref> illustrating an exploded view of a portion <b>2</b> of a bodywork panel according to an embodiment. It may for example be a bodywork panel of the bumper skin type, this portion <b>2</b> therefore being able to correspond to an area comprising an emblem of the motor vehicle. The presence may for example be noted of a decorative element <b>4</b> (which may have the form of a decorative leaf or even be painted). Of course, the portion <b>2</b> can also be put in place at a bodywork panel other than a bumper.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0038">In what follows, we will describe the portion <b>2</b> of the bodywork panel. Of course, everything that is described for the portion <b>2</b> (component elements, manufacturing method) is also applicable to the bodywork panel as a whole.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0039">The portion <b>2</b> of the bodywork panel comprises a main body <b>6</b>. The latter can be made conventionally from a thermoplastic material of the type used to manufacture a bodywork panel from thermoplastic material. The main body can also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, be opaque to visible light. The term &#x201c;opaque to visible light&#x201d; means that a material does not allow any light radiation having a wavelength comprised in the visible spectrum, that is to say, comprised between approximately 380 and 780 nm, to pass. The color of the main body <b>6</b> may vary.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0040">The portion <b>2</b> also comprises a wall <b>8</b> made of plastic material transparent to visible light comprising a face <b>12</b> intended to be visible from outside the vehicle. This wall <b>8</b> is fixed on one face of the main body <b>6</b>, more precisely the face visible from the outside of a motor vehicle on which the portion <b>2</b> is present.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0041">The wall <b>8</b> can be made of polyamide or polyvinyl chloride. As explained above, these materials tend to degrade (yellowing) by thermal oxidation, i.e. in contact with oxygen (for example that of the ambient air) and in the presence of heat (for example that of the sun).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0042">To avoid this, a coating <b>10</b> transparent to visible light (according to the definition given above) is placed against the wall <b>8</b> so as to cover covering at least the face <b>12</b> of the wall transparent to visible light that is intended to be visible from the exterior of the vehicle, the wall <b>8</b> being encapsulated in a sealed manner between the main body <b>6</b> and the coating <b>10</b> transparent to visible light.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0043">In other words, the wall <b>8</b> cannot be in contact with oxygen. As a result, and even in the event of an increase in the temperature of the wall, no yellowing of the wall <b>8</b> is observed because no thermal oxidation can take place.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0044">In the examples shown, the main body <b>6</b> and the coating <b>10</b> are dimensioned so as to encapsulate the wall <b>8</b> in a sealed manner between them. No other element is necessary to encapsulate the wall <b>8</b>. It is observed for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> that the face <b>12</b> of the wall <b>8</b> is covered by the coating <b>10</b>, all of the other faces, including the face <b>16</b> and the face <b>14</b>, being covered by the main body <b>6</b> (therefore covering all the faces of the wall <b>8</b> with the exception of the face <b>12</b> covered by the coating <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0045">Alternatively, it would be possible to bring at least one other element to encapsulate the latter. For example, the main body <b>6</b> and the coating <b>10</b> could each cover one face of the wall, for example the opposite faces <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>. The other faces (including the face <b>14</b>) would therefore be covered by one or more other elements ensuring the sealing of the final structure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0046">The coating <b>10</b> can be made of a thermoplastic material. For example, it can be made of polyurethane. It is moreover advantageous to use a polyurethane coating <b>10</b> in combination with a polyamide wall <b>8</b> because of the good adhesion properties between the two materials. More particularly, and in particular in the case where the part is produced by an in-mold coating (IMC) method, a mixture of a resin and a polyurethane hardener is used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0047">In the case where a polyurethane coating <b>10</b> (which may have the form of a film) is used, it is advantageous for the thickness of the latter to be between 0.5 and 3 millimeters. Indeed, this thickness range is interesting because:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0048">the coating <b>10</b> protects the wall <b>8</b> from ultraviolet radiation,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0049">the coating <b>10</b> protects the wall <b>8</b> from scratches. It is even possible to make scratches disappear by locally heating the coating <b>10</b>, and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0050">a depth effect is obtained at the portion <b>2</b>, in particular if the latter has esthetic aims.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0051">As explained before, it is possible for a decorative element <b>4</b> to be placed between the main body <b>6</b> and the wall <b>8</b> at the wall <b>16</b>. It could also be placed between the wall <b>8</b> and the coating <b>10</b> at the wall <b>12</b>. Since the wall <b>8</b> and the coating <b>10</b> are transparent to visible light, the decorative element <b>4</b> is visible from the outside of a motor vehicle on which the portion <b>2</b> is placed (it should be noted here that, in the zones that do not comprise the decorative element <b>4</b>, the main body <b>6</b> is visible due to the transparency to visible light of the wall <b>8</b> and the coating <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0052">It is also possible to introduce at least one visible light emitting device between the main body <b>6</b> and the decorative element <b>4</b> (which here is opaque to visible light) to obtain backlighting of the zone. Such devices, for example LEDs or even light guides (for example optical fibers diffusing the light emitted by LEDs), are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0053">In the same way, it is possible to place at least one bodywork panel defrosting means between the wall <b>8</b> and the main body <b>6</b> or between the wall <b>8</b> and the coating <b>10</b>. This is all the more relevant if the zone is traversed by waves emitted by distance sensor-type wave emitting members in order to avoid disturbing wave propagation by a layer of frost. The defrosting means are chosen as a function of the wave emission device, for example metal wires for ACC-type radars capable of emitting between 75 and 81 GHz. Such means are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0054">The disclosed embodiment also relates to a method of manufacturing a motor vehicle bodywork panel of the type of that of the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0055">According to this method, a wall (the wall <b>8</b>) made of plastic material transparent to visible light is encapsulated in a sealed manner by molding between a coating (the coating <b>10</b>) transparent to visible light and a main body (the main body <b>6</b>) of the bodywork panel (or portion <b>2</b>). Thus, the wall <b>8</b> cannot be in contact with the oxygen in the ambient air.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0056">In the case of molding by an in-mold coating method, the molding temperature is approximately 90&#xb0; C., and the molding pressure is approximately equal to 20 bars.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0057">According to a first embodiment of the method, corresponding to an in-mold coating method:<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0058">the coating <b>10</b> transparent to visible light is applied in a mold, preferably by spraying.
