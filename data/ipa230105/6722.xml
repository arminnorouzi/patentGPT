When using such radio resources in the high frequency bands, it is common for the wireless communication devices on the transmission side and the reception side to execute beamforming.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When executing beamforming, a beam pattern, which is a combination of a transmission beam formed by the transmission device and a reception beam formed by the reception device, is determined. That is, the optimal combination of the direction of the transmission beam and the direction of the reception beam may be determined prior to communication. As a beam pattern determination method, there is a method that sequentially forms transmission beams and reception beams to the respective directions by using a phased array, for example, and actually transmits/receives signals for searching the direction of the transmission beam and the reception beam with which the reception power becomes the maximum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, it is also considered to use a True Time Delay (TTD) array capable of forming beams of different directions for each frequency and transmit/receive Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols including a plurality of subcarriers, for example, to perform fast beam searching.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2017-143356</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">Patent document 2: Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No. 2020-537432</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">Patent document 3: Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No. 2019-501577</li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0009">With the above-described beam searching, however, it is difficult to efficiently determine the optimal beam pattern. That is, when performing beam searching by using the phased array, a single optimal transmission beam is determined after sequentially forming all transmission beams, and a single optimal reception beam is determined after sequentially forming all reception beams. Therefore, it takes a great number of signal transmission times until determining the beam pattern, which results in causing overhead increase. That is, it is difficult to efficiently determine the beam pattern.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">In the meantime, beam searching using the TTD array needs only a smaller number of signal transmission times, which results in causing no overhead increase. However, the optimal beam direction is not always selected depending on the radio environment, since the beam direction is determined depending on the frequency. That is, the wireless quality such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), for example, varies depending on the frequency, so that the beam in the direction corresponding to the frequency of low SNR may be determined to be of a lower property than it actually is. Therefore, there is a certain limit in the performance of beam searching using the TTD array.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0011">According to an aspect of an embodiment, a wireless communication system includes a wireless transmission device and a wireless reception device.
