id="p-0001" num="0000">A reinforcing bar binding machine capable of reliably performing a wire gripping operation includes a first movable gripping member that is displaced in a direction to contact with and separate from one side of a fixed gripping member and a second movable gripping member that is displaced in a direction to contact with and separate from the other side of the fixed gripping member. A bending portion brings the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member into and out of contact with the fixed gripping member. The fixed gripping member includes a shaft that rotatably supports the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member. Further, the bending portion includes an opening and closing pin that pushes an opening and closing guide hole provided in the first movable gripping member, and an opening and closing guide hole provided in the second movable gripping member.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="162.22mm" wi="138.85mm"

For such a reinforcing bar binding machine, there has been proposed a reinforcing bar binding machine in which after wires are wound around a reinforcing bar, the wires are cut in a state of being wound around the reinforcing bar in close contact with each other, and the reinforcing bar is wound with the wires by twisting crossing points of one end of the wire and the other end.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the reinforcing bar binding machine in which the wires wound around the reinforcing bar are wound around the reinforcing bar, when one side of the wire wound around the reinforcing bar is gripped between a first movable gripping member and a fixed gripping member and the other side of the wire is gripped between a second movable gripping member and the fixed gripping member, an operation of winding the wire around the reinforcing bar and an operation of twisting the wire are performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the related art, a configuration has been proposed in which a first movable gripping member and a second movable gripping member are opened and closed by parallel movement (for example, see Patent Literature 1). A configuration has also been proposed in which a first movable gripping member and a second movable gripping member are opened and closed by a rotating operation with a shaft as a fulcrum (for example, see Patent Literature 2).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">[Patent Literature 1]: Japanese Patent No. 4747455</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">[Patent Literature 2]: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. S57-125111</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the configuration according to the related art in which the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member are opened and closed by the parallel movement, the movement of the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member is guided by members such as grooves or pins. Since the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member move in parallel, a dimension increases in a lateral direction. For this reason, miniaturization is difficult. Further, in the configuration according to the related art in which the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member are opened and closed by the rotating operation with the shaft as a fulcrum, a mechanism for rotating the first movable gripping member and the second movable gripping member is required, and the structure is complicated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made to solve such problems, and an object thereof is to provide a binding machine that can be miniaturized and has a simple structure.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve the problems, the present invention provides a binding machine including: a feeding unit that is capable of feeding a wire and winding the wire around a binding target; and a binding unit that grips and twists the wire, wherein the binding unit includes: a pair of gripping members in which the other end side is rotatably supported by a shaft extending in a first direction such that one end side is movable toward and away from each other; and a moving member that extends in the first direction and that is movable in a second direction orthogonal to the first direction; and at least one of the pair of gripping members is a movable gripping member having a fitting portion such that the moving member is fitted into the fitting portion and the fitted moving member is movable in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the present invention provides a binding machine including: a feeding unit that is capable of feeding a wire and winding the wire around a binding target; and a binding unit that grips and twists the wire, wherein the binding unit includes: a pair of gripping members in which the other end side is rotatably supported by a shaft extending in a first direction such that one end side is movable toward and away from each other; and a movable member that is movable in a second direction orthogonal to the first direction, at least one of the pair of gripping members has an opening and closing shaft portion which extend in the first direction, the movable member has a fitting portion into which the opening and closing shaft portion is fitted, and the fitting portion is configured to be capable of moving the movable member in the second direction in a state in which the opening and closing shaft portion is fitted.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present invention, the other end of the pair of gripping members is rotatably supported by the shaft such that one end of the pair of gripping members is movable relatively toward and away from the other end thereof. The pair of gripping members rotates about the shaft as a fulcrum by the operation in which the fitting portion and the moving member fitted in the fitting portion or the fitting portion and the opening and closing shaft portion fitted in the fitting portion relatively move in the second direction orthogonal to the first direction in which the shaft extends. The wire can be gripped when one end of the pair of gripping members is moved toward the other end, and the gripped wire can be released when one end of the pair of gripping members is moved away from the other end.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, it is possible to move one end of the gripping member toward and away from the other end thereof only by the rotation of the other end of the pair of gripping members about the shaft as a fulcrum, and thus miniaturization can be achieved. In addition, it is possible to rotate the pair of gripping members only by the movement of the moving member or the movable member, and thus the structure is simple.</p><?summary-of-invention

Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates the internal configuration of the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A of the present embodiment binds the reinforcing bar S, which is a binding object, by using two or more wires W having a diameter smaller compared to a conventional wire having a large diameter. In the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A, as will be described later, by the operation of winding the wire W around the reinforcing bar S, the operation of winding the wire W wound around the reinforcing bar S in close contact with the reinforcing bar S, and the operation of twisting the wire wound around the reinforcing bar S, the reinforcing bar S is bound with the wire W. In the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A, since the wire W is bent in any of the operations described above, by using the wire W having a smaller diameter than the conventional wire, the wire is wound on the reinforcing bar S with less force, it is possible to twist the wire W with less force. Further, by using two or more wires, it is possible to secure the binding strength of the reinforcing bar S by the wire W. Further, by arranging two or more wires W to be fed in parallel, the time required for winding the wire W can be shortened compared with the operation of winding the reinforcing bar twice or more with one wire. It should also be noted that winding the wire W around the reinforcing bar S and winding the wire W wound around the reinforcing bar S in close contact with the reinforcing bar S is collectively referred to as winding the wire W. The wire W may be wound in a binding object other than the reinforcing bar S. Here, as the wire W, a single wire or a twisted wire made of a metal that can be plastically deformed is used.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A includes a magazine <b>2</b>A that is a housing unit that houses the wire W, a wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A that feeds the wire W housed in the magazine <b>2</b>A, a parallel guide <b>4</b>A for arranging the wires W fed to the wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A and the wires W fed out from the wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A in parallel. The reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A further includes a curl guide unit <b>5</b>A that winds the wires W fed out in parallel around the reinforcing bar S, and a cutting unit <b>6</b>A that cuts the wire W wound around the reinforcing bar S. Further, the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A includes a binding unit <b>7</b>A that grips and twists the wire W wound around the reinforcing bar S.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The magazine <b>2</b>A is an example of a housing unit. In the embodiment, a reel <b>20</b> in which two long wires W are wound in a drawable manner is detachably housed in the magazine. The reel <b>20</b> is provided with a tubular hub portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>that can wind the wires W and a pair of flanges <b>20</b><i>b </i>that are provided at opposite end sides of the hub portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>in an axial direction. The flanges <b>20</b><i>b </i>have a larger diameter than the hub portion <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and protrudes beyond the opposite end sides of the hub portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction. Two or more wires W, in this example, two wires W are wound around the hub portion <b>20</b><i>a</i>. In the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A, while the reel <b>20</b> housed in the magazine <b>2</b>A rotates, the two wires W are fed out from the reel <b>20</b> through the operation of feeding the two wires W by the wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A and the operation of feeding the two wires W manually. At this time, the two wires W are wound around the hub portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>so that the two wires W are fed out without being twisted.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A is an example of a wire feeding unit constituting a feeding unit and includes a first feed gear <b>30</b>L and a second feed gear <b>30</b>R as a pair of feeding members for feeding the parallel wires W, the first feed gear <b>30</b>L has a spur gear shape which feeds the wire W by a rotation operation, and a second feed gear <b>30</b>R also has a spur gear shape which sandwiches the wire W with the first feed gear <b>30</b>L. Although the details of the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R will be described later, the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are in the form of a spur gear in which teeth are formed on the outer peripheral surface of a disk-like member. The first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are meshed with each other, and the driving force is transmitted from one feed gear to the other feed gear, so that the two wires W can be appropriately fed. Other drive arrangements can be used and the arrangement is not limited to use of a spur gear.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are each formed of a disk-shaped member. In the wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A, the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are provided so as to sandwich the feed path of the wire W, so that the outer peripheral surfaces of the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R face each other. The first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R sandwich the two parallel wires W between portions opposing to the outer peripheral surface.

In other words, the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are arranged in parallel in a direction along the axial direction Ru1 of a loop Ru formed by the wire W wound by the curl guide unit <b>5</b>A, that is, along the axial direction of the virtual circle in which the loop Ru formed by the wire W is regarded as a circle. In the following description, the axial direction Ru1 of the loop Ru formed by the wire W wound by the curl guide unit <b>5</b>A is also referred to as the axial direction Ru1 of the loop of wire W.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The first feed gear <b>30</b>L includes a first feed groove <b>32</b>L on its outer peripheral surface.

The first feed groove <b>32</b>L has a first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and a second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb forming a V-shaped groove. The first feed groove <b>32</b>L has a V-shaped cross section so that the first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb face each other at a predetermined angle. When the wires W are held between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R in parallel, the first feed groove <b>32</b>L is configured such that one wire among the outermost wires of the wires W arranged in parallel, in this example, a part of the outer peripheral surface of one wire W1 of the two wires W arranged in parallel is in contact with the first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The second feed groove <b>32</b>R is formed in a V-groove shape on the outer peripheral surface of the second feed gear <b>30</b>R along the rotation direction of the second feed gear <b>30</b>R. The second feed groove <b>32</b>R has a first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and a second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb that form a V-shaped groove. Similarly to the first feed groove <b>32</b>L, the second feed groove <b>32</b>R has a V-shaped cross-sectional shape, and the first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb face each other at a predetermined angle. When the wire W is held between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R in parallel, the second feed groove <b>32</b>R is configured such that, the other wire among the outermost wires of the wires W arranged in parallel, in this example, a part of the outer peripheral surface of the other wire W2 of the two wires W arranged in parallel is in contact with the first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">When the wire W is pinched between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, the first feed groove <b>32</b>L is configured with a depth and an angle (between the first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb) such that a part, on the side facing the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, of one wire W1 in contact with the first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb protrudes from the tooth bottom circle <b>31</b>La of the first feed gear <b>30</b>L.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">When the wire W is pinched between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, the second feed groove <b>32</b>R is configured with a depth and an angle (between the first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb) such that a part, on the side facing the first feed gear <b>30</b>L, of the other wire W2 in contact with the first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb protrudes from the tooth bottom circle <b>31</b>Ra of the second feed gear <b>30</b>R.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">As a result, the two wires W pinched between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R are arranged such that one wire W1 is pressed against the first inclined surface <b>32</b>La and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Lb of the first feed groove <b>32</b>L, and the other wire W2 is pressed against the first inclined surface <b>32</b>Ra and the second inclined surface <b>32</b>Rb of the second feeding groove <b>32</b>R. Then, one wire W1 and the other wire W2 are pressed against each other. Therefore, by rotation of the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, the two wires W (one wire W1 and the other wire W2) are simultaneously fed between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R while being in contact with each other. In this example, the first feed groove <b>32</b>L and the second feed groove <b>32</b>R have a V-shaped cross-sectional shape, but it is not necessarily limited to the V-groove shape, and it may be, for example, a trapezoidal shape or an arcuate shape. Further, in order to transmit the rotation of the first feed gear <b>30</b>L to the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, between the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R, a transmission mechanism including an even number of gears or the like for rotating the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and the second feed gear <b>30</b>R in opposite directions to each other may be provided.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">The wire feeding unit <b>3</b>A includes a driving unit <b>33</b> for driving the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and a displacement unit <b>34</b> for pressing and separating the second feed gear <b>30</b>R against the first feed gear <b>30</b>L.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">The driving unit <b>33</b> includes a feed motor <b>33</b><i>a </i>for driving the first feed gear <b>30</b>L and a transmission mechanism <b>33</b><i>b </i>including a combination of a gear and the like for transmitting the driving force of the feed motor <b>33</b><i>a </i>to the first feed gear <b>30</b>L.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the first feed gear <b>30</b>L, the rotation operation of the feed motor <b>33</b><i>a </i>is transmitted via the transmission mechanism <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the first feed gear <b>30</b>L rotates.

Two or more wires W enter and the parallel guide <b>4</b>A feeds the two or more wires W in parallel. In the parallel guide <b>4</b>A, two or more wires are arranged in parallel along the feed direction, and are offset from one another in a direction orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W, with the guide limiting relative movement of the wires with respect to each other, and the guide can also control the relative positions of the wires. Specifically, preferably the two or more wires W are arranged so that the direction an axis of one wire is offset from the axis of the other wire is in parallel with the axial direction Ru1 of the loop-like wire W wound around the reinforcing bar S by the curl guide unit <b>5</b>A. The parallel guide <b>4</b>A has a wire restricting unit (for example, an opening <b>4</b>AW described later) that restricts the directions of the two or more wires W and makes or maintains them in parallel. In this example, the parallel guide <b>4</b>A has a guide main body <b>4</b>AG, and the guide main body <b>4</b>AG is formed with an opening <b>4</b>AW which is the wire restricting unit for passing (inserting) a plurality of wires W. The opening <b>4</b>AW penetrates the guide main body <b>4</b>AG along the feeding direction of the wire W. When the plurality of wires W pass through the opening <b>4</b>AW and after passing through the opening <b>4</b>AW, the orientation thereof is determined so that the plurality of wires W are arranged in parallel (that is, the axes of the plurality of wires W are offset in a direction (radial direction) orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W (axial direction) and the axis of each of the plurality of wires W is substantially parallel to each other in the feed direction). Therefore, the plurality of wires W that have passed through the parallel guide <b>4</b>A go out from the parallel guide <b>4</b>A in a state of being arranged in parallel. In this way, the parallel guide <b>4</b>A restricts the direction in which the two wires W are aligned in the radial direction so that the two wires W are arranged in parallel. Therefore, in the opening <b>4</b>AW, one direction orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W is longer than the other direction which is orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W orthogonal to the one direction. The opening <b>4</b>AW has a longitudinal direction (in which two or more wires W can be juxtaposed) disposed along a direction orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W, more specifically, along the axial direction Ru1 of the loop of wire W formed by the curl guide unit <b>5</b>A. As a result, two or more wires W inserted through the opening <b>4</b>AW are fed in parallel in a direction orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W, that is, in the axial direction of the loop of wire W. Therefore, the pinching portion controls a direction of movement of the two or more wires.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the following description, when describing the shape of the opening <b>4</b>AW, a cross-sectional shape in a direction orthogonal to the feeding direction of the wire W will be described. The cross-sectional shape in the direction along the feeding direction of the wire W will be described in each case.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">For example, when the opening <b>4</b>AW (the cross section thereof) is a circle having a diameter equal to or more than twice of the diameter of the wire W, or the length of one side is substantially a square which is twice or more the diameter of the wire W, the two wires W passing through the opening <b>4</b>AW are in a state where they can freely move in the radial direction.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">If the two wires W passing through the opening <b>4</b>AW can freely move in the radial direction within the opening <b>4</b>AW, the direction in which the two wires W are arranged in the radial direction cannot be restricted, whereby the two wires W coming out from the opening <b>4</b>AW might not be in parallel, and could become twisted or interfere with each other.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In view of this, the opening <b>4</b>AW is formed such that the length in the one direction, that is, the length L1 in the longitudinal direction is set to be slightly (n) times longer than the diameter r of the wire W in the form in which the plurality (n) of wires W are arranged along the radial direction, and the length in the other direction, that is, the length L2 in the lateral direction is set to be slightly (n) times longer than the diameter r of one wire W. In the present example, the opening <b>4</b>AW has a length L1 in the longitudinal direction slightly twice longer than a diameter r of the wires W, and a length L2 in the lateral direction slightly longer than a diameter r of one wire W. In the present embodiment, the parallel guide <b>4</b>A is configured such that the longitudinal direction of the opening <b>4</b>AW is linear and the lateral direction is arcuate, but the configuration is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the length L2 in the lateral direction of the parallel guide <b>4</b>A is set to a length slightly longer than the diameter r of one wire W as a preferable length.

Further, in the case where the same binding strength is to be obtained between the case where the reinforcing bar S is bound with a single wire as in the conventional case and the case where the reinforcing bar S is bound with the two wires W as in this example, the diameter of each wire W can be made thinner by using two wires W. Therefore, it is easy to bend the wire W, and the wire W can be brought into close contact with the reinforcing bar S with a small force. Therefore, the wire W can be reliably wound around the reinforcing bar S in close contact with a small force. In addition, by using two thin wires W, it is easy to make the wire W in a loop shape, and it is also possible to reduce the load at the time of cutting the wire W. Along with this, it is possible to downsize each motor of the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A, and downsize the entire main body by downsizing the mechanical section. In addition, it is possible to reduce power consumption by reducing the size of the motor and reducing the load.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the wire W is cut.

Considering the function of binding the reinforcing bar S with the wire W, the rigidity of the wire W varies not only by the diameter of the wire W but also by the material thereof etc. For example, in the present embodiment, the wire W having a diameter of about 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm is described as an example. However, if the material of the wire W is also taken into consideration, between the lower limit value and the upper limit value of the diameter of the wire W, at least a difference of about tolerance may occur.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref>, in the conventional configuration in which one wire Wb having a predetermined diameter is wound around the reinforcing bar S and twisted, since the rigidity of the wire Wb is high, even in the operation of twisting the wire Wb, the slack of the wire Wb is not eliminated, and a gap L is generated between the wire and the reinforcing bar S.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>, in the present embodiment in which two wires W having a smaller diameter are wound around the reinforcing bar S and twisted as compared with the related art, the rigidity of the wire W is lower as compared with the conventional one, by the operation of twisting the wire W, the gap M between the reinforcing bar S and the wire can be suppressed small as compared with the conventional case, whereby the binding strength of the wire W is improved.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329">By using the two wires W, it is possible to equalize the reinforcing bar holding force as compared with the conventional case, and to suppress the deviation between the reinforcing bars S after the binding. In the present embodiment, two wires W are simultaneously fed, and the reinforcing bars S are bound using the two wires W fed simultaneously. Feeding the two wires W at the same time means that when one wire W and the other wire W are fed at substantially the same speed, that is, when the relative speed of the other wire W to one wire W is substantially 0. In this example, the meaning is not necessarily limited to this meaning. For example, even when one wire W and the other wire W are fed at different speeds (timings), the two wires W are advance in parallel in the feed path of the wire W in a state that the two wires W are arranged in parallel with each other, so, as long as the wire W is set to be wound around the reinforcing bar S in the parallel state, it means that two wires are fed at the same time. In other words, the total area of the cross-sectional area of each of the two wires W is a factor determining the reinforcing bar holding force, so even if the timings of feeding the two wires W are deviated, in terms of securing the reinforcing bar holding force, the same result can be obtained. However, compared to the operation of shifting the timing of feeding the two wires W, since it is possible to shorten the time required for feeding for the operation of simultaneously feeding the two wires W, it is preferable to feed the two wires W simultaneously, resulting in improvement of the binding speed. Therefore, the wire feeding unit feeds the two or more wires together.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of the operational effect of the reinforcing bar binding machine of this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of an operation and a problem of the conventional reinforcing bar binding machine.

Therefore, one end WS and the other end WE of the wire W, which are the distal end side of the twisted portion of the wire W binding the reinforcing bar S largely protrude from the reinforcing bar S. If the distal end side of the wire W protrudes largely, there is a possibility that the protruding portion interferes with the operation and hinders work.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">Also, after the reinforcing bars S are bound, the concrete <b>200</b> is poured into the place where the reinforcing bars S are laid. At this time, in order to prevent the one end WS and the other end WE of the wire W from protruding from the concrete <b>200</b>, the thickness from the tip of the wire W bound to the reinforcing bar S, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>, the thickness from the one end WS of the wire W to the surface <b>201</b> of the concrete <b>200</b> that has been poured is necessarily kept at a predetermined dimension S1.

In the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A of the present embodiment, the wire W is bent by the bending portion <b>71</b> such that one of (i) the bent portion bent by the preliminary bending portion <b>72</b> in the operation of gripping the wire W by the first movable gripping member <b>70</b>L and the fixed gripping member <b>70</b>C and (ii) the bent portion bent by the fixed gripping member <b>70</b>C and the second movable gripping member <b>70</b>R in the operation of binding the wire W around the reinforcing bar S becomes the top portion of the wire W. The top portion is the most protruding portion in the direction in which the wire W is separate away from the reinforcing bar S.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334">As a result, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>, the wire W bound to the reinforcing bar S in the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A according to the present embodiment has the first bent portion WS1 between the twisted portion WT and one end WS, and one end WS side of the wire W is bent toward the reinforcing bar S side so that one end WS of the wire W is located closer to the reinforcing bar S than the first bent portion WS1. The second bent portion WE1 is formed between the twisted portion WT and the other end WE of the wire W. The other end WE side of the wire W is bent toward the reinforcing bar S side so that the other end WE of the wire W is located closer to the reinforcing bar S side than the second bent portion WE1.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>, two bent portions, in this example, the first bent portion WS1 and the second bent portion WE <b>1</b>, are formed on the wire W. Of the two, in the wire W bound to the reinforcing bar S, the first bent portion WS1 protruding most in the direction away from the reinforcing bar S (the direction opposite to the reinforcing bar S) is the top portion Wp. Both of the one end WS and the other end WE of the wire W are bent so as not to protrude beyond the top portion Wp in the direction opposite to the reinforcing bar S.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">In this manner, by setting one end WS and the other end WE of the wire W so as not to protrude beyond the top portion Wp constituted by the bent portion of the wire W in the direction opposite to the reinforcing bar S, it is possible to suppress a decrease in workability due to the protrusion of the end of the wire W. Since one end WS side of the wire W is bent toward the reinforcing bar S side and the other end WE side of the wire W is bent toward the reinforcing bar S side, the amount of protrusion on the distal end side from the twisted portion WT of the wire W is less than the conventional case. Therefore, the thickness S2 from the laying position of the reinforcing bar S to the surface <b>201</b> of the concrete <b>200</b> can be made thinner than the conventional one.

For example, in the case of binding the reinforcing bars S constituting the base with the wire W, in the work using the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A, the opening between the first guide unit <b>50</b> and the second guide unit <b>51</b> of the curl guide unit <b>5</b>A faces downward.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0364">When performing a binding operation, the opening between the first guide unit <b>50</b> and the second guide unit <b>51</b> is directed downward, and the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A is moved downward as indicated by an arrow Z1 as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>A</figref>, the reinforcing bar S enters the opening between the first guide unit <b>50</b> and the second guide unit <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0365">When the binding operation is completed and the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A is moved in the lateral direction indicated by the arrow Z2 as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>B</figref>, the second guide unit <b>51</b> is pressed against the reinforcing bar S bound by the wire W, and the movable guide unit <b>55</b> on the distal end side of the second guide unit <b>51</b> rotates in the direction of the arrow H around the shaft <b>55</b><i>b </i>as a fulcrum.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">Therefore, every time the wire W is bound to the reinforcing bar S, the binding work can be performed successively only by moving the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A in the lateral direction without lifting the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A every time. Therefore, (since it is sufficient to simply move the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A in the lateral direction as compared with moving the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A once upward and moving it downward) it is possible to reduce restrictions on the moving direction and the movement amount of the reinforcing bar binding machine <b>1</b>A in the operation of pulling out the reinforcing bar S bound to the wire W, thereby improving working efficiency.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>, the fixed guide unit <b>54</b> of the second guide unit <b>51</b> is fixed without being displaced and capable of restricting the position in the radial direction Ru2 of the wire W in the binding operation described above. Accordingly, in the operation of winding the wire W around the reinforcing bar S, the position in the radial direction of the wire W can be restricted by the wall surface <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the fixed guide unit <b>54</b>, and the displacement in the direction of the wire W guided to the gripping portion <b>70</b> can be suppressed, thereby suppressing occurrence of gripping failure. As described above, the reinforcing bar binding machine according to the related art in which the wires are wound around the reinforcing bar, and then twisted to bind the reinforcing bar has a configuration in which the looped wire is difficult to spread in the radial direction of the loop because there is no feeding for pulling back the wire and there is no operation of temporarily stopping the feeding of the wire and inverting the feeding direction. For this reason, a guide corresponding to the fixed guide unit of the present embodiment is unnecessary. However, even in such a reinforcing bar binding machine, when the fixed guide unit and the movable guide unit of the invention are applied, it is possible to suppress the radial expansion of the loop of the wire wound around the reinforcing bar.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">In the following, an example of the operational effect of the reinforcing bar binding machine of the present embodiment with respect to the displacement unit <b>34</b> will be described.
