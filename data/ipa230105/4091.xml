A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). A lithographic apparatus may, for example, project a pattern (also often referred to as &#x201c;design layout&#x201d; or &#x201c;design&#x201d;) of a patterning device (e.g., a mask) onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) provided on a substrate (e.g., a wafer).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As semiconductor manufacturing processes continue to advance, the dimensions of circuit elements have continually been reduced while the amount of functional elements, such as transistors, per device has been steadily increasing over decades, following a trend commonly referred to as &#x201c;Moore's law&#x201d;. To keep up with Moore's law the semiconductor industry is seeking technologies that make it possible to create increasingly smaller features. To project a pattern on a substrate a lithographic apparatus may use electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of this radiation determines the minimum size of features which are patterned on the substrate. Typical wavelengths currently in use are 365 nm (i-line), 248 nm, 193 nm and 13.5 nm.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lithographic apparatus may include an illumination system for providing a projection beam of radiation, and a support structure for supporting a patterning device. The patterning device may serve to impart the projection beam with a pattern in its cross-section. The apparatus may also include a projection system for projecting the patterned beam onto a target portion of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a lithographic apparatus the substrate to be exposed (which may be referred to as a production substrate) may be held on a substrate table (sometimes referred to as a wafer table or substrate holder). The substrate table may be moveable with respect to the projection system. A substrate-facing surface of the substrate table may be provided with a plurality of projections (referred to as burls). The distal surfaces of the burls may conform to a flat plane and support the substrate. The burls can provide several advantages: a contaminant particle on the substrate table or on the substrate is likely to fall between burls and therefore does not cause a deformation of the substrate; it is easier to machine the burls so their ends conform to a plane than to make the surface of the substrate table flat; and the properties of the burls can be adjusted, e.g. to control clamping of the substrate to the substrate table.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Production substrates may become distorted due to frictional forces between the burls and the substrate. These interactions can be reduced by driving fluid through the burls to provide a lubricating effect. It has proven challenging to drive fluid through a large number of burls uniformly and reliably.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to improve manufacture and/or performance of substrate supports.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a substrate table configured to support a substrate during a lithography process, comprising: a substrate support comprising: a plurality of holes extending through a base member of the substrate support;

The term &#x201c;light valve&#x201d; can also be used in this context. Besides the classic mask (transmissive or reflective, binary, phase-shifting, hybrid, etc.), examples of other such patterning devices include a programmable mirror array and a programmable LCD array.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically depicts a lithographic apparatus LA. The lithographic apparatus includes an illumination system (also referred to as illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (e.g., EUV radiation or DUV radiation), a mask support (e.g., a mask table) MT constructed to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device MA in accordance with certain parameters, a substrate table WT constructed to hold a substrate (e.g., a resist coated wafer) W and connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate table WT in accordance with certain parameters, and a projection system (e.g., a refractive projection lens system) PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion C (e.g., comprising one or more dies) of the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the illumination system IL receives the radiation beam B from a radiation source SO, e.g. via a beam delivery system BD. The illumination system IL may include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic, and/or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, and/or controlling radiation. The illuminator IL may be used to condition the radiation beam B to have a desired spatial and angular intensity distribution in its cross section at a plane of the patterning device MA.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; PS used herein should be broadly interpreted as encompassing various types of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, anamorphic, magnetic, electromagnetic and/or electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, and/or for other factors such as the use of an immersion liquid or the use of a vacuum. Any use of the term &#x201c;projection lens&#x201d; herein may be considered as synonymous with the more general term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; PS.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The lithographic apparatus may be of a type wherein at least a portion of the substrate W may be covered by an immersion liquid having a relatively high refractive index, e.g., water, so as to fill an immersion space between the projection system PS and the substrate W&#x2014; which is also referred to as immersion lithography. More information on immersion techniques is given in U.S. Pat. No. 6,952,253, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lithographic apparatus may be of a type having two or more substrate tables WT (also named &#x201c;dual stage&#x201d;). In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machine, the substrate tables WT may be used in parallel, and/or steps in preparation of a subsequent exposure of the substrate W may be carried out on the substrate W located on one of the substrate table WT while another substrate W on the other substrate table WT is being used for exposing a pattern on the other substrate W.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to the substrate table WT, the lithographic apparatus may comprise a measurement stage (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The measurement stage is arranged to hold a sensor and/or a cleaning device. The sensor may be arranged to measure a property of the projection system PS or a property of the radiation beam B. The measurement stage may hold multiple sensors. The cleaning device may be arranged to clean part of the lithographic apparatus, for example a part of the projection system PS or a part of a system that provides the immersion liquid. The measurement stage may move beneath the projection system PS when the substrate table WT is away from the projection system PS.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In operation, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device, e.g. mask, MA which is held on the mask support MT, and is patterned by the pattern (design layout) present on patterning device MA. Having traversed the mask MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and a position measurement system PMS, the substrate table WT can be moved accurately, e.g., so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B at a focused and aligned position. Similarly, the first positioner PM and possibly another position sensor (which is not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be used to accurately position the patterning device MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B. Patterning device MA and substrate W may be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> as illustrated occupy dedicated target portions, they may be located in spaces between target portions. Substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> are known as scribe-lane alignment marks when these are located between the target portions C.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this specification, a Cartesian coordinate system is used. The Cartesian coordinate system has three axis, i.e., an x-axis, a y-axis and a z-axis. Each of the three axis is orthogonal to the other two axis. A rotation around the x-axis is referred to as an Rx-rotation. A rotation around the y-axis is referred to as an Ry-rotation. A rotation around about the z-axis is referred to as an Rz-rotation. The x-axis and the y-axis define a horizontal plane, whereas the z-axis is in a vertical direction. The Cartesian coordinate system is not limiting the invention and is used for clarification only. Instead, another coordinate system, such as a cylindrical coordinate system, may be used to clarify the invention. The orientation of the Cartesian coordinate system may be different, for example, such that the z-axis has a component along the horizontal plane.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a lithographic apparatus it is necessary to position with great accuracy the upper surface of a substrate to be exposed in the plane of best focus of the aerial image of the pattern projected by the projection system. To achieve this, the substrate can be held on a substrate table. The surface of the substrate table that supports the substrate can be provided with a plurality of burls whose distal ends can be coplanar in a nominal support plane. The burls, though numerous, may be small in cross-sectional area parallel to the support plane so that the total cross-sectional area of their distal ends is a few percent, e.g. less than 5%, of the surface area of the substrate. The gas pressure in the space between the substrate table and the substrate may be reduced relative to the pressure above the substrate to create a force clamping the substrate to the substrate table. Alternatively or additionally, an electrostatic clamping force may be used to clamp the substrate to the substrate table.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When a substrate is loaded onto a substrate table, the substrate generally does not land perfectly flat on the substrate table. This means that during loading of a substrate, one point of the substrate tends to make contact with at least one of the burls and then the rest of the substrate comes into contact with the substrate table. Frictional forces between the substrate and the substrate table during loading may lead to in-plane deformation in the substrate as the substrate makes contact across the substrate table. Similar effects may occur during unloading. The in-plane deformation can increase overlay errors.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is possible to reduce frictional forces between burls and the substrate by driving fluid (e.g. either or both of a gas and a liquid) through the burls to provide a lubricating effect. It is difficult to provide such a lubricating fluid flow uniformly because unwanted variations in flow resistance between different burls will cause corresponding variations in flow rate through the burls. The flow rate will be larger where the flow resistance is smaller and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One approach to reducing the above problem is to provide flow restrictions in each burl to increase the flow resistance in each burl in a controlled way. The increased flow resistances of the buds makes it possible to reliably ensure a sufficient flow out of each burl without having excessive flow through any of the burls or an excessive overall flow.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments described below provide efficient and/or reliable methods of manufacturing a substrate support having burls (referred to below as burl structures) with such flow restrictions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a substrate support <b>2</b> attached to an upper surface of a substrate table WT.

The outward flow of fluid may be provided for example during loading and/or unloading of a substrate W onto the substrate table WT and/or, at least briefly, while the substrate W is fully loaded on the substrate table WT, to reduce frictional forces between the burl structures <b>6</b> and the substrate W.

In embodiments of this type, the burl structures <b>6</b> are thus formed by removing material from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> before removing material from inside of the burl structures <b>6</b>. This approach is advantageous because it is not necessary to protect the inside of the burl structures <b>6</b> when removing the material from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> (which may be performed using laser ablation, for example, which can generate a significant amount of debris). In other embodiments, material may be removed simultaneously from inside and outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> to form the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> directly from the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> (i.e. without the intermediate step leading to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).

The holes <b>12</b> are formed in the base member <b>20</b> while the burl structures <b>6</b> are formed in the burl formation member <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>22</b></figref> depict an alternative approach in which both the holes <b>12</b> and the burl structures <b>6</b> are formed in the base member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an initial step, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, a base member <b>20</b> is provided.

The removal process may comprise deep reactive ion etching or focused ion-beam milling for example. At this stage, the holes <b>12</b> may be blind (as depicted) or may penetrate through the base member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, in a subsequent step, the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is turned over and a removal process is applied to form a plurality of base recesses <b>15</b>, thereby providing the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. The base recesses <b>15</b> are thus formed before the burl structures <b>6</b> (which are formed as described below) in this embodiment. Forming the base recesses <b>15</b> before the burl structures <b>6</b> is desirable because it avoids having to support the structure on delicate burl structures <b>6</b> during formation of the base recesses <b>15</b>. The manufacturing process is thus made simpler and/or risk of damage to burl structures <b>6</b> is reduced or avoided. The shape and depth of each base recess <b>15</b> is not particularly limited. In some embodiments, each base recess <b>15</b> is substantially cylindrical, with an axis of cylindrical symmetry perpendicular to a plane of the base member <b>20</b>. In the embodiment shown, each base recess <b>15</b> is deep enough to ensure that the holes <b>12</b> now penetrate through the base member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment, in a subsequent step, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, a coating <b>24</b> is applied.

In embodiments of this type, the burl structures <b>6</b> are thus formed by removing material from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> before removing material from inside of the burl structures <b>6</b>. Advantages associated with this approach have been discussed above. In other embodiments, material may be removed simultaneously from inside and outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> to form the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> directly from the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> (i.e. without the intermediate step leading to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>).

Forming all or at least a portion of the holes <b>12</b> at an early stage facilitates manufacture by reducing the extent to which pre-existing structures need to be protected, or taken account of, during the removal process (e.g. deep reactive ion etching or focused ion-beam milling), for example by requiring special arrangements to hold the base member <b>20</b> during the removal process and/or to otherwise protect the pre-existing structures from mechanical damage and/or contamination.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other embodiments, variations on the sequence described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>22</b></figref> may be made. For example, in some embodiments the formation of the plurality of base recesses <b>15</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, is performed after one or more of the steps described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b></figref> (e.g. after the removal of material from outside and inside of the burl structures <b>6</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the order of the material removal processes used to form the burl structures <b>6</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, may be reversed. In such embodiments, material is thus removed from inside of the burl structures <b>6</b> to form the recessed surfaces <b>13</b> before material is removed from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> (with the base recesses <b>15</b> being formed before or after).

For example, in one embodiment the removal of material from inside of the burl structures <b>6</b> to form the recessed surfaces <b>13</b> is performed before the holes <b>12</b> are formed through the base member <b>20</b> and the removal of material from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b> is performed after the holes <b>12</b> are formed through the base member <b>20</b>. In a first variation of this example, the base recesses <b>15</b> are formed after the holes <b>12</b> are formed through the base member <b>20</b> and before the removal of material from outside of the burl structures <b>6</b>.

The burl formation member <b>30</b> comprises a plurality of burl structures <b>6</b>. The base member <b>20</b> comprises a plurality of holes <b>12</b> extending through the base member <b>20</b>.

The opening <b>41</b> is thus fluidically connected to the holes <b>12</b> by the intermediate passage <b>42</b> and intermediate chamber <b>43</b>. As mentioned below, the intermediate chamber <b>43</b> may be omitted, for example where the elongate intermediate passage <b>42</b> is sufficiently tapered. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>22</b></figref> the opening is connected directly to each of the holes <b>12</b> in the base member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A flow resistance in respect of flow through the holes <b>12</b> in the base member <b>20</b> is larger than a flow resistance in respect of flow through the intermediate passage <b>42</b> and intermediate chamber <b>43</b>. The portion of the base member <b>20</b> providing the holes <b>12</b> therefore acts as a flow restrictor. The amount of flow restriction depends on the cross-sectional area and number of the holes <b>12</b>. Relative dimensions of the elements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> can vary depending on details of the implementation context. In one class of implementation, a diameter of the intermediate passage <b>42</b> may be of the order of 10-100 times larger than a diameter of each hole <b>12</b> in the base member <b>20</b>.

The process is applicable both to the case where a plurality of the holes <b>12</b> are provided per burl structure <b>6</b> and the case where a single hole <b>12</b> is provided per burl structure <b>6</b>. The process may use a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate to achieve an accurate layer thickness for providing the flow-restricting holes <b>12</b>, to accommodate wafer fab manufacturing processes, and/or to provide a good thermal expansion coefficient match to substrate tables WT formed from SiSiC.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a first step, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, an SOI substrate is provided (e.g. of 300 mm diameter). Layer <b>20</b>A is the handle Si substrate layer of the SOI substrate. Layer <b>20</b>B is the buried SiO2 layer of the SOI substrate.

The base recess <b>15</b> may be formed by selective etching. Alternatively or additionally, the base recess <b>15</b> may be formed using laser processing. Laser processing may be less intrinsically clean than selective etching and care may be needed to maintain the thickness of the layer in which the holes <b>12</b> are formed. A difference in threshold fluence between Si and SiO2 may not be sufficient to use the SiO2 as an intrinsic processing stop (e.g. by arranging for a laser processing fluence to be higher than a threshold fluence for Si but lower than a threshold fluence for SiO2, such that the laser processing automatically stops when it reaches the SiO2) as it may be used in selective etching.
