The electronic apparatus <b>100</b> herein may be used for a vehicle, for example, a terminal apparatus arranged in the vehicle or integrated in the vehicle. Further, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may communicate with a server located at a network side or in the cloud through an RSU. The communication between the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> and the RSU may be in a form of broadcasting.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may include a communication unit <b>110</b>, a decoding unit <b>120</b>, and a determination unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Here, units of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may be included in a processing circuit. It should be noted that the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may include one processing circuitry or multiple processing circuitry. Further, the processing circuitry may include various separate functional units to perform various functions and/or operations.

That is, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may forward only part of the message, thereby minimizing overhead and time delay, thereby improving the communication efficiency.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the effective time of the message may include a start time of the message and an end time of the message. That is, the message is valid in a time range from the start time to the end time. Alternatively, the effective time of the message may include the start time and the effective time range of the message. That is, the message is valid within the valid time range from the start time. Apparently, the effective time of the message may further include parameters in other forms, as long as the effective time characterizes the range of the effective time of the message.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the determination unit <b>130</b> may determine whether a current time is within the effective time of the message. For example, in a case that the effective time of the message includes the start time of the message and the end time of the message, the determination unit <b>130</b> may determine whether the current time is between the start time and the end time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the effective range of the message may include a location of the message source and an effective radius of the message.

Alternatively, the effective range of the message may be other shapes, so that parameters in other forms may further be included.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the determination unit <b>130</b> may determine whether the position of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> is within the effective range of the message. Here, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may include, for example, a GPS unit to acquire position information of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may determine the position of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> in other ways, for example, through RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime services) differential signal messages from multiple base station apparatus.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, in a case that the determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the current time is within the effective time of the message and the position of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> is within the effective range of the message, it is determined that the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> forwards the message. For example, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may forward the message in a form of broadcasting.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, in a case that the determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the current time is not within the effective time of the message, or determines that the position of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> is not within the effective range of the message, or determines that the current time is not within the effective time of the message and the position of the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> is not within the effective range of the message, the determination unit <b>130</b> may determine that the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> does not forward the message.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, in a case that the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> does not forward the message, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may discard the message. In addition, in a case that the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> does not forward the message, the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> may not display the message to a driver driving the vehicle.

The fleet drives toward a left direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. A foremost vehicle in the driving direction is a head vehicle, and other vehicles are member vehicles of the fleet. Here, two vehicles lost communication with the head vehicle and are referred to as straggling vehicles. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of some RSUs arranged near intersections. Here, the head vehicle may be provided with the electronic apparatus <b>400</b> described above, and the RSU may be provided with the electronic apparatus <b>100</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0203">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, when the head vehicle of the fleet finds that there are straggling vehicles, the head vehicle generates and sends a message. The message, for example, includes an effective time of the message and an effective range of the message. The message may further include identification information (a group ID) of the fleet or identification information of the straggling vehicles. Here, the head vehicle may send the message in a form of broadcasting. According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the head vehicle determines the effective time and the effective range of the message according to a time and a place before the straggling vehicles loss communication with the head vehicle, so as to reduce a search range. Next, an RSU receiving the message from the head vehicle determines whether to forward the message according to the effective time and the effective range included in the message. Next, when receiving the message from an RSU, the straggling vehicle determines that the head vehicle is searching for the straggling vehicle according to the identification information of the fleet or the identification information of the straggling vehicle that are included in the message. The straggling vehicle sends position information of the straggling vehicle. Through the forwarding of the RSU, the head vehicle acquires position information of the straggling vehicle, so as to find the straggling vehicle.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0204">Dashed arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> indicate a transmission direction of the message.

In this case, when the head vehicle searches for the straggling vehicles, the message sent by the head vehicle may include the identification information of the fleet. An RSU receiving the message from the head vehicle may determines whether to forward the message according to the effective time and effective range included in the message and whether the identification information of the fleet is stored. That is, in a case that a current time is within the effective time, a position of the RSU is within the effective range, and the RSU stores the identification information of the fleet, the RSU forwards the message.

When the head vehicle finds that there is a straggling vehicle, in step S<b>903</b>, the head vehicle sends a message in a form of broadcast, the message including the effective time and the effective range of the message and the group ID. In step S<b>904</b>, the RSU receiving the message determines whether to forward the message according to the effective time, the effective range and the group ID. In a case that the RSU determines not to forward the message, the RSU discards the message. In a case that the RSU determines to forward the message, the RSU forwards the message in step S<b>905</b>. Thus, through the forwarding of one or more RSUs, the straggling vehicle receives the message and determines that the head vehicle is searching for the straggling vehicle according to the group ID in the message. Next, in step S<b>906</b>, the straggling vehicle sends a determination message including position information.
