This number increased to approximately 450,000 by the year of 2000, when the number of bone grafting procedures performed worldwide exceeded 2.2 million (Lewandrowski et al, 2000). Of the 300,000 procedures performed in 1998, 90% involved the use of either autologous grafts (i.e. using tissue from another part of the body of the patient), or of allografts (i.e. using tissue from a live human donor or cadaver). Therefore, a phase of tissue harvest from the patient or from a donor is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The tissue harvesting is executed by a surgical procedure usually involved collecting tissue from the iliac crest, the distal femur, the proximal tibia, the fibula, or from other small bones. The harvested tissue is restructured and transplanted at the damaged site.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the graft-harvesting procedures are associated with considerable morbidity and substantial pain. Tissue harvesting for an autologous grafts or from live donors for an allograft may also result in complications such as inflammation, infection, or even death.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The limited supply and inherited harvesting complications have inspired the development of alternative strategies for the repair of significant bone defects.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of 3-dimensional (3-D) bone substitutes such as bone extract, polymer or mineral scaffolds as implants has been investigated and porous biocompatible scaffolds have been used for the repair and regeneration of bone tissue.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Early attempts at tissue repair have focused mainly on the use of amorphous, biocompatible foam as porous plugs to fill large voids in bone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,186,448 described the use of porous mesh plugs composed of polyhydroxy acid polymers, such as polylactide, for healing bone voids. Several different methods for making other scaffolds were also described (i.e. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,133,755; 5,514,378; 5,522,895; 5,607,474; 5,677,355; 5,686,091; 5,716,413; 5,755,792; 5,769,899; 5,770,193; 6,333,029; 6,365,149 and 6,534,084).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bone marrow (BM) has been shown to contain population of cells that possess osteogenic potential. As such, an alternative to the scaffold-osteoinductive approach is to transplant into patients living cells that possess this capacity. Cytokine-manipulated, na&#xef;ve autologous and allogeneic BM cells have successfully healed diffracted or resorbed bones in experimental models (Werntz et al, 1996; Lane et al, 1999; Nilsson et al, 1999; Kawaguchi et al, 2004) and human patients (Horwitz et al, 1999; Horwitz et al 2001, 2004). Progenitor cells of the osteogenic lineage are seeded onto biocompatible (biodegradable or non-biodegradable) scaffolds in the presence or absence of growth promoting factors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,541,024; 6,544,290; 6,852,330). Transplantation into affected patients is performed following an ex-vivo expansion phase of the cells on the given scaffold. Using this approach, either primary osteogenic cells or expanded Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) layered upon ceramic scaffolds was able to regenerate bone tissue (Kadiyala et al, 1997; Bruder et al, 1998a,b; Cinotti et al, 2004).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Living bone is a continuously evolving organ and in the normal course of bone maintenance, a constant remodeling process is being employed. In those procedures, Old bone is being replaced by new bone and the organ responds to its environment changing requirements for strength and elasticity. Therefore, normal remodeling progression requires that the mechanical loading processes of bone resorption and bone formation procedures are tightly coordinated.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In cellular terms, this depends on sequential functioning of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) and osteoblasts (bone forming cells). In addition, endothelial cell and endothelial cell precursors (angioblasts) are required to form the new blood vessels in the developed bone tissue. Yet, the various cell types participating in bone formation are of different lineages. It is now known that osteoblasts stalk from mesenchymal stem cells, while osteoclasts (directly originating from Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC)) and endothelial cells are descendents of a common blast colony-forming cell (Choi et al, 1998; Hamaguchi et al, 1999). As such, methodologies for ex-vivo production of bone-like material that rely on osteoblasts as the exclusive cellular component suffer from an inherited fault.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising, (a) a mineral particle, (b) endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, and (3) hyaluronic acid.

Furthermore, cells generated multi cellular layers onto the mineral particles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Histological and scanning electron microscope analysis shows the formation of multicellular layers on top of the bone mineral particles. These layers generate a typical connective tissue structure containing collagen fibers and polysaccharides as seen in Picro Sirius Red stain and Toluidine Blue stain, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Both Adipose derived endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells were seeded as a co-culture on the scaffold. For evaluation of endothelial cell functionality, seeded particles were placed in Matrigel for predetermined time points. Adipose Tissue derived endothelial cells were shown to be able to attach to the Matrigel and to form sprouts out of the scaffold and out to the surrounding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
