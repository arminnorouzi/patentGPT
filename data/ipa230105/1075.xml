The drive head consists of a drive head lower shell and a drive head upper shell, and the metallic support structure is adapted to support an end/end portion of a tubular retaining/drive arm projecting into the drive head lower shell as well as a number of electronic components inside the drive head in a stable manner and without any further mechanical support elements of the drive head upper shell. In other words, the upper shell supports and, resp., bears neither the drive arm projecting into the drive lower shell nor the electronic components installed in the lower shell, i.e., the bearing of the drive arm and the electronic components installed in the lower shell takes place exclusively using the metallic support structure in connection with the drive head lower shell.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The development in modern medicine, in particular in intensive care medicine, has resulted in infusion therapies requiring the well-targeted use and the exact dosing of highly efficient drugs via fluid pumps. A fluid pump design used very frequently in this case is the so-called syringe pump. For operating a syringe pump, a filled syringe barrel is inserted into the syringe pump and the free end of the extended syringe plunger/syringe plunger rod is fixed to a drive head attached to a retaining/drive arm. The end/end portion of the syringe plunger is usually retained on the drive head by adjustable angled arms/clips. Also, in the drive head frequently a force is measured which is exerted by a pump drive via the drive arm and the drive head mounted thereon upon the syringe plunger so that clogging can be detected in the fluid path between the syringe and the patient, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the drive head of such syringe pump is a complex component part with high requirements to dimensional accuracy. Due to its arrangement effectuated by the drive arm and projecting from the pump housing, the drive head is moreover also frequently exposed, during operation, to at least minor shocks which may be result from the handling, the set-up and dismantling etc. of the pump by the operator or, in an extreme case, even by the pump falling down.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The drive head solutions known from prior art such as from WO 2012/123 417 A1 show a bearing of the drive arm in the drive head which takes place both in the lower shell and in the upper shell of the drive head. This entails the drawback that shocks acting from outside upon the drive head are transferred undiminished to the sensitive components and to the bearing of the drive arm and, thus, may result in damage. Further, the bearing via the drive head lower and upper shells entails the drawback that higher manufacturing tolerances are required and that pretensions due to the screwing of the drive head lower and upper shells may be introduced to the bearing and to the sensitive components.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objects and purposes of the disclosure are to eliminate or at least reduce the drawbacks of prior art and to provide in particular a medical syringe pump and, resp., a metallic support structure for a drive head which allows for an exclusive bearing of the drive arm in connection with the drive head lower shell and ensures decoupling of the flux of force from the drive head lower shell to the drive head upper shell and the components installed there. Furthermore, the metallic support structure is intended to contribute to bearing components in the drive head lower shell without pretensions due to the screwed connection of the drive head lower shell and upper shell being induced in the bearing of the components.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The medical fluid pump, in particular syringe pump, comprises a housing and a drive head linearly movable to the housing via a tubular or rod-shaped drive arm or, resp., a drive arm, the drive head having a drive head lower shell facing the housing and preferably made of plastic and a drive head upper shell turned away from the housing and preferably made of plastic. Also, the syringe pump has a metallic support structure preferably in the form of a plate which is accommodated in an interior space formed by the drive head lower shell and the drive head upper shell and is directly fixed to a free end portion of the tubular or rod-shaped drive arm and preferably also to the drive head lower shell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The direct fixation of the drive arm in the drive head lower shell offers the advantage that, in contrast to a joint bearing via the drive head lower shell and upper shell, the bearing of the drive arm remains unaffected by the fitting accuracy between the drive head lower shell and upper shell. The metallic plate shape of the support structure continues to constitute a so-called robust core in the plastic housing of the drive head and, on the one hand, by its flat shape distributes forces introduced in the drive head via the bearing of the drive arm extensively to the housing cross-section, allowing stress peaks to be avoided, and, on the other hand, the metallic plate shape serves so-to-speak as a robust partition between the drive head lower shell and upper shell. In its function as a robust partition, the metallic support structure additional shields shocks coming from the direction of the housing upper shell against the components situated in the housing lower shell.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred variant, the medical fluid pump may include a U-shaped bracket extending in the axial direction of the drive arm, the U-shaped bracket being integrally formed with the side of the drive head lower shell facing the interior space so that it encompasses the drive arm and, thus, delimits the axial insertion depth of the tubular drive arm in the drive head lower shell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The U-shaped bracket can be formed of a circular sleeve-type portion at the inner face of the drive housing lower shell and project in the longitudinal direction of the drive arm into the drive housing. The arms of the U-shaped bracket extending in the longitudinal direction may include a through-bore for passing through a clamp sleeve on each of opposite sides. This offers the advantage that the drive arm inserted in the U-shaped bracket which also includes corresponding through-bores level with the through-bores at the arms of the U-shaped bracket can be aligned and secured radially and axially in the U-shaped bracket via a clamp sleeve in a pre-assembling step already.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another preferred embodiment of the medical fluid pump, the metallic support structure can consist of a first portion and a second portion formed separately from the first portion, each abutting on the drive arm.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This facilitates the assembly and the alignment of the metallic support structure on the drive arm, for example.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the medical fluid pump, the support structure can engage, via projections, in bores of the tubular drive arm and, in this way, can secure the drive head lower shell relative to the drive arm in the axial direction as well as against rotation. The projections of the support structure protruding into the drive arm advantageously help additionally provide a positive connection between the drive arm and the support structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an advantageous development of the medical fluid pump, the first portion of the support structure can form, with the second portion of the support structure, a clamp for clamping the drive arm at the U-shaped bracket so that the drive arm is secured in the axial direction as well as against rotation. The clamp shape of the support structure does not only facilitate the assembly, but also enables the clamping force relative to the drive arm and the U-shaped bracket to be set via the screwing of the clamp.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the clamp formed of the first portion and the second portion of the support structure can have an inner contour reproducing the U-shaped bracket which permits axial and rotational fine alignment at the U-shaped bracket. At the same time, the reproduction of the inner contour of the U-shaped bracket can also enable, when the clamp is closed, a positive connection against the direction of rotation, i.e., along the circumference, which renders the connection between the support structure and the drive head even more robust against rotation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the first portion of the support structure can be indirectly connected to the drive head lower shell via a screwed connection. In the indirect screwing, the first portion of the support structure is connected to a flat component which in turn is supported itself in the housing via cylinder pins. In this way, pretensions between the support structure and the drive housing lower shell due to screwed connections are avoided, thereby preventing component distortion and extensively distributing bearing forces.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, the first portion of the support structure may include a recess for passing through cables, thus facilitating an electronic connection between the drive arm and the components present in the drive head lower shell.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment of the medical fluid pump, the first portion and the second portion of the support structure can be detachable from each other. This facilitates assembling and aligning the support structure in the housing lower shell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, the drive head upper shell can close and fluid-tightly seal the interior space formed between the drive head lower shell and the drive head upper shell without aligning components in the drive head lower shell. The aim is to ensure that, although the drive head upper shell is connected positively and non-positively to and efficiently seals the drive housing lower shell, impacts and warping are largely absorbed via the drive housing, which is composed of the drive housing lower shell and the drive housing upper shell, and only as little as possible of the force effect is transferred to the internal components, however.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosure shall be illustrated in detail in the following by means of Figures using a preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a syringe pump according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a drive head comprising swivel arms and a drive arm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the inner face of the drive head lower shell without an installed base plate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view of the drive head lower shell as well as the components of base plate, board and board end plate to be inserted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the drive head lower shell comprising the inserted components of base plate, board and board end plate as well as an exploded view of the support structure consisting of the first and second portions.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view with the inserted base plate, board and board end plate and the mounted support structure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the drive head lower shell with installed components and support structure as well as the drive head upper shell.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The Figures are schematic and serve only for the comprehension of the disclosure.

The free end of an extracted syringe plunger is further fixed to the drive head <b>4</b> which has been extended before via the drive arm <b>5</b> away from the sidewall of the housing <b>2</b>, preferably with two swiveling angled arms <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) as a part of the drive head <b>4</b>. In order to empty the syringe content in a controlled manner, the drive head <b>4</b> serving as a stop for the syringe plunger here is displaced toward the sidewall of the housing <b>2</b> preferably via a spindle drive inside the housing not shown in more detail.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drive head <b>4</b> consists of a drive head lower shell <b>7</b> facing the housing <b>2</b> and preferably made of plastic and a drive head upper shell <b>8</b> turned away from the housing <b>2</b> and equally preferably made of plastic.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the inner face of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b>. As is visible, a free end portion <b>9</b> of the drive arm <b>5</b> is accommodated in a U-shaped bracket <b>10</b> serving as a stop. Further, a clamp sleeve <b>40</b> which is also passed through through-holes located at the free end portion <b>9</b> of the drive arm <b>5</b> extends transversely through the legs <b>11</b> of the U-shaped bracket <b>10</b>. Using the clamp sleeve <b>40</b>, the drive arm <b>5</b> is already preadjusted relative to the drive head and secured in the axial direction as well as against rotation relative to the drive head.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a base plate with electronic components <b>12</b>, hereinafter merely referred to as base plate <b>12</b>, inserted in the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> is shown. It is emphasized that the base plate <b>12</b> is merely inserted or attached but not screwed with the drive head lower shell <b>7</b>. The base plate <b>12</b> includes three circular recesses <b>13</b> and two guide strips <b>14</b> substantially perpendicularly projecting from the base plate <b>12</b> by means of which the base plate <b>12</b> is aligned at dedicated contours of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b>. Inserting the base plate <b>12</b> without screwing offers the advantage that no screwing points must be provided which might produce different stress zones on the surface of the base plate <b>12</b> and which might transfer locally concentrated shock pulses to the base plate <b>12</b> which may result in damage of the electronic components fastened on the base plate <b>12</b>. At the same time, the mounting position of the base plate <b>12</b> is safeguarded by the recesses <b>13</b> and guide strips <b>14</b> which align the base plate <b>12</b> at the contours of the drive head lower shell.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, three substantially perpendicularly projecting cylinder pins <b>15</b> which at their free ends form a circular shoulder <b>16</b> with a cylinder pin tip <b>17</b> situated centrally therein are arranged on the base plate <b>12</b>. A board <b>18</b> including three corresponding circular recesses <b>19</b> is placed, in turn, on the three shoulders <b>16</b>, the recesses <b>19</b> indirectly encompassing the cylinder pin tips <b>17</b>. Further, a board end plate <b>20</b> is placed onto the board <b>18</b>. The board end plate <b>20</b> includes three sleeve-type extensions <b>21</b> on its side facing the board <b>18</b>. The sleeve-type extensions <b>21</b> engage in the circular recesses <b>19</b> of the board <b>18</b>, equally rest on the circular shoulders <b>16</b> of the cylinder pins <b>15</b> and directly enclose the cylinder pin tips <b>17</b>. As the sleeve-type extensions <b>21</b> engage in the recesses <b>19</b> of the board <b>18</b> and at the same time directly encompass the cylinder pin tips <b>17</b>, the board end plate <b>20</b> rests stably on the board <b>18</b> without getting out of place relative to the latter.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> comprising the already inserted base plate <b>12</b>, the board <b>18</b> and the board end plate <b>20</b>.

It is emphasized in this context that the inner contours of the first portion <b>23</b> and the second portion <b>24</b> situated toward the free end portion <b>9</b> of the drive arm <b>5</b> reproduce the U-shaped bracket <b>10</b>, thereby allowing for axial and rotational fine alignment at the U-shaped bracket <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first portion <b>23</b> of the support structure <b>22</b> is screwed with the board end plate <b>20</b> via a screwed connection <b>33</b>, resulting in the support structure <b>22</b> being indirectly connected to the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> by resting on the board end plate <b>20</b>. At the same time, in the mounted state the first portion <b>23</b> and the second portion <b>24</b> of the support structure <b>22</b> directly rest, with the respective so-to-speak lower clamp side, on a shoulder of a sleeve-type portion <b>34</b> of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b>, which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the base plate <b>12</b>, the board <b>18</b> and the board end plate <b>20</b> are held together sandwich-like via defined pressing forces from two sides, namely on the lower side by the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> and on the upper side by the first portion <b>23</b> of the support structure <b>22</b>. The defined pressing forces are mainly resulting from the predetermined spaces as a result of the direct bearing faces between the support structure <b>22</b> or, resp., clamp <b>22</b> and the sleeve-type portion <b>34</b> of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> as well as via the stacking height between the base plate <b>12</b> and the board end plate <b>20</b> which is significantly defined by the length of the cylinder pins <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The afore-mentioned type of assembly or the clamp-like arrangement of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> and the support structure <b>22</b> with the interposed sensitive components which are situated above all on the base plate <b>12</b> and the board <b>18</b>, offers the advantage that screwed connections can be almost completely dispensed with in shock-sensitive zones and that the pressing forces required for the cohesion of the base plate <b>12</b>, the board <b>18</b> and the board end plate <b>20</b> can be distributed extensively and evenly. The support structure <b>22</b> further adopts the function of a partition from the drive head upper shell <b>8</b> and additionally protects the components situated in the drive head lower shell against impacts.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is also visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> that the U-shaped bracket <b>10</b> has on its end face a U-shaped recess <b>35</b> which serves for guiding a ribbon cable <b>36</b> which is guided through the drive arm <b>5</b>. In the first portion <b>23</b> of the support structure <b>22</b>, a connector recess <b>37</b> is provided which enables the ribbon cable <b>36</b> guided out of the drive arm <b>5</b> to be guided through the support structure <b>22</b> and to be connected to the board <b>18</b> underneath.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> with components installed there and the support structure <b>22</b> as well as the drive head upper shell <b>8</b>. The drive head upper shell <b>8</b> is screwed, via through-bores <b>38</b>, with screw bosses <b>39</b> in the drive head lower shell <b>7</b> so that the drive head upper shell <b>8</b> closes and seals the drive head <b>4</b> without the drive head upper shell <b>8</b> or the screwed connections having an influence on the alignment of the base plate <b>12</b> and the board <b>18</b>. Possible flows of forces caused by impacts onto the drive head upper shell <b>8</b> are thus not transferred directly to the base plate <b>12</b> and the board <b>18</b>. The base plate <b>12</b> and the board <b>18</b> are quasi force-decoupled from direct force impacts of the drive head upper shell <b>8</b> and absorb them only indirectly via the bearing face in the drive head lower shell <b>7</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
