The invention further relates to methods of fecal microbiota transplantation as a treatment for alcohol use disorder.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related cirrhosis are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Continued alcohol misuse in the setting of end-stage organ damage such as cirrhosis can hasten disease progression. Therefore, therapies that encourage alcohol abstinence or reduce alcohol misuse are relevant. Pharmacotherapies for craving in alcohol-related cirrhosis have yielded partial success and largely focus on neuromodulation. AUD is associated with major changes in the gut-brain axis that is worsened with the occurrence of cirrhosis. In addition, other studies have demonstrated a potential role of microbiota in the addictive behavior. For example, see Cryan et al. (<i>Physiol Rev </i>2019; 99:1877-2013) and Liang et al. (<i>Front Integr Neurosci </i>2018; 12:33). These and other studies have demonstrated the potential effects of the microbiota on the gut-brain axis and neuronal circuits that regulate behaviors, including addictive behavior.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In patients with advanced cirrhosis who are not currently drinking alcohol, the altered gut-brain axis responds to fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) (6-8). For example, see publications by Bajaj et al. in (<i>Hepatology </i>2017; 66:1727-1738), Gastroenterology 2019 (May; 156(6):1921-1923), Hepatology 2018 (Hepatology. 2018 October; 68(4):1549-1558) (<i>JCI Insight </i>2019 JCI Insight. 2019 Dec. 19; 4(24):e133410), and (<i>Hepatology </i>2019 Hepatology. 2019 November; 70(5):1690-1703), which demonstrated safety and efficacy of FMT as a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and the ability to effect changes in the microbiota of FMT recipients.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, abstinence from alcohol is linked with microbial change. However, the impact of microbial modulation to facilitate reduction of alcohol misuse remains unclear. There is a need to identify a useful application of microbial modification that would have a meaningful impact on alcohol cravings underlying the morbidity and mortality associated with AUD, including alcoholism and alcohol misuse or abuse. It would further be beneficial to have a treatment that would modify the microbiota and reduce alcohol craving, thereby encouraging abstinence and reducing alcohol misuse.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the invention pertains to the use of fecal material and its transfer to a recipient as a treatment for AUD that modulates cognition, behavior, daily function, short-term alcohol craving and alcohol consumption by changing the microbial composition and function in the FMT recipient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the invention is a method of reducing alcohol craving in a subject in need thereof, comprising the steps of assaying a stool sample from the subject to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon and determine whether the subject is deficient in beneficial microbiota species, obtaining a sample of fecal material from a suitable donor wherein the sample of fecal material comprises beneficial microbiota, which are associated with a reduction in alcohol craving and/or consumption, processing the sample of fecal material to produce at least one dose for fecal material transfer (FMT), and administering a dose of FMT to the subject.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, the term &#x201c;beneficial microbiota&#x201d; refers to species associated herein with reduced alcohol craving, alcohol misuse and/or alcohol use disorder. It is an object of the invention to provide beneficial microbiota to the subject. The microbiota identified herein as being beneficial include species, genera and strains belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families such as, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Roseburia, </i>in addition to other taxa such as <i>Alistipes, Eubacterium, Lactonifactor, Oscillibacter, Anaerostipes </i>and <i>Bilophila</i>. Thus, at minimum, the microbiota in the sample of fecal material comprises at least one species selected from the group consisting of strains belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes </i>and <i>Bilophila. </i></p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the invention, the method includes an administering step to deliver a dose of FMT. In one embodiment, the adminstering is performed as an enema comprising the dose of FMT. In another embodiment, the subject receives multiple doses that are combined into a single administration by enema. When administered as an enema, the enema is retained in the colon for at least thirty minutes. In another embodiment, administration is in the form of a rectal suppository. In yet another embodiment, the FMT is lyophilized and packaged in capsules having an enteric coating and the capsules are administered orally. In another embodiment more than one dose of FMT is administered as a series over a suitable period of time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises a step of screening for pathogens selected from the group consisting of <i>Clostridium difficile </i>toxin B, qualitative RT-PCR, Cyclospora and Isospora examination, ova and parasites exam with Giardia antigen EIA, <i>Salmonella</i>-<i>Shigella</i>-<i>Campylobacter </i>culture, Shiga toxins EIA with reflex to <i>E. coli </i>O157 culture and <i>Vibrio </i>culture, <i>Cryptosporidium </i>antigen EIA, <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>antigen EIA, stool norovirus EIA, stool rotavirus antigen detection, adenovirus antigen detection, gastroenteritis EIA, vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus </i>culture and <i>Microsporidia </i>exam.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of filtering the sample of fecal material, suspending the filtered fecal material in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffered solution to produce doses of FMT, storing the doses of FMT at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until time of administration. The doses are thawed when a practitioner and subject are ready for the administering step.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of obtaining a second stool sample from the subject at least 15 days after the administering step, culturing the second stool sample to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon after receiving the at least one dose of FMT, and determining whether the microbiota of the subject has been altered by receiving the at least one dose of FMT. If the desired results have not been achieved, another dose of FMT is administered at least one time. Multiple doses may be administered, and these would typically be performed at 15-day intervals.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another embodiment, the invention is method of increasing or changing the composition of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the colon of a subject in need thereof, comprising the steps of assaying a stool sample from the subject to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon, obtaining a sample of fecal material from a suitable donor wherein the sample of fecal material comprises microbiota known to alter short-chain fatty acids associated with a reduction in alcohol craving and/or consumption, processing the sample of fecal material to produce at least one dose for fecal material transfer (FMT), and administering a dose of FMT rectally to the subject. The administering step may be performed as an enema comprising the dose of FMT. When administered as an enema, the enema is retained in the colon for at least thirty minutes. In another embodiment, the subject receives more than one dose of FMT, or multiple doses that are combined into a single administration by enema. In another embodiment, administration is performed as a rectal suppository. In yet another embodiment, FMT is lyophilized and packaged in capsules having an enteric coating and the capsules are administered orally. The beneficial microbiota in the dose of fecal material comprise at least one species selected from the group consisting of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Lactonifactor, Oscillibacter, Anaerostipes </i>and <i>Bilophila</i>. In one embodiment, the microbiota in the sample of fecal material comprises at least one species selected from the group consisting of strains belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes </i>and <i>Bilophila</i>. Confirmation of a therapeutically effective treatment can be made by measuring SCFA in a stool sample or in plasma at a suitable time after the treatment is administered.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of obtaining a second stool sample from the subject at least 15 days after the administering step, culturing the second stool sample to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon after receiving the at least one dose of FMT, and determining whether the microbiota of the subject has been altered by receiving the dose of FMT. In some cases, after at least 15 days, another dose of FMT is administered at least one time. In another embodiment of the invention, the patient is routinely administered additional doses of FMT at suitable intervals.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In practicing the method of the invention, the step of processing may comprise screening the sample of fecal material for pathogens, filtering the sample of fecal material, suspending the filtered fecal material in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffered solution to produce the at least one dose of FMT, storing the at least one dose of FMT at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until time of administration, and thawing the at least one dose of FMT for the administering step.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The step of screening the sample of fecal material for the pathogens may include any or all selected from the group consisting of <i>Clostridium difficile </i>toxin B, qualitative RT-PCR, Cyclospora and Isospora examination, ova and parasites exam with Giardia antigen EIA, <i>Salmonella</i>-<i>Shigella</i>-<i>Campylobacter </i>culture, Shiga toxins EIA with reflex to <i>E. coli </i>O157 culture and <i>Vibrio </i>culture, <i>Cryptosporidium </i>antigen EIA, <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>antigen EIA, stool norovirus EIA, stool rotavirus antigen detection, adenovirus antigen detection, gastroenteritis EIA, vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus </i>culture and <i>Microsporidia </i>exam.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in the description of invention that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.

Those of the skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous variations and modifications of this invention that are encompassed by its scope. Accordingly, the description of a certain exemplary embodiment should not be deemed to limit the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invention is a composition comprising fecal material and method for its transfer to a recipient as a treatment for AUD that modulates cognition, behavior, daily function, short-term alcohol craving and alcohol consumption by changing the microbial composition and function in the FMT recipient.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the following acronyms refer to the indicated terms: AUD: alcohol use disorder; HE: hepatic encephalopathy; FMT: fecal microbiota transplant; SCFA: short-chain fatty acids; AUDIT: alcohol use disorder identification test; ACQ-SF: alcohol craving questionnaire-short form; PHES: psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score; SIP: sickness impact profile; QOL: quality of life; LEfSe: linear discriminant analysis effect size; Etg: ethylglucuronide; LBP: lipopolysaccharide binding protein and SAE: serious adverse event.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention is a composition comprising fecal material and method for its transfer to a recipient as a treatment for AUD that modulates cognition, behavior, daily function, short-term alcohol craving and alcohol consumption by changing the microbial composition and function in the FMT recipient. It is an object of the invention to provide beneficial microbiota to the subject.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;microbiota&#x201d; refers to the microorganisms that reside in the colon of mammals, particularly in humans. The microbiota are an ecological community of commensal, symbiotic microorganisms, also known as gut flora or gut microbiota. These include bacteria, archaea and fungi that live in the digestive tract, and can also include pathogens. Microbiota of the gut are collectively known as the &#x201c;microbiome&#x201d; of the gut.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;beneficial microbiota&#x201d; refers to species associated herein with reduced alcohol craving, alcohol misuse and/or alcohol use disorder. The microbiota identified herein as being beneficial include Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Lactonifactor, Oscillibacter, Anaerostipes </i>and <i>Bilophila</i>. At minimum, the microbiota in the sample of fecal material comprises at least one species selected from the group consisting of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes </i>and <i>Bilophila. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;gut-brain axis&#x201d; refers to a bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous system, linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. Recent advances in research have described the importance of gut microbiota in influencing these interactions. This interaction between microbiota and GBA appears to be bidirectional, namely through signaling from gut-microbiota to brain and from brain to gut-microbiota by means of neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral links.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the invention is a method of reducing alcohol craving in a subject in need thereof. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;reducing alcohol craving&#x201d;, &#x201c;reducing alcohol consumption&#x201d; are used interchangeably, since a reduction in alcohol craving frequently allows a subject afflicted with AUD to reduce their alcohol consumption.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The gut microbiota may be evaluated either by assessing its composition or by measuring its functions. It is an object of the invention to provide SCFA producing microbiota to individuals who are deficient in SCFA. In one embodiment, the invention is a method of assessing microbial metabolites that are SCFA as an indicator of microbiota functions. SCFA are products of fermentation of unabsorbed food residues (mainly carbohydrates) within the colon and are absorbed and used as an energy source for the host or FMT recipient. SCFA also play an important role in the communication between the gut microbiota and other parts of the body. The production of SCFAs is dependent on the microbiota; thus, assessment of SCFAs is a recognized measure of gut microbiota function. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of increasing SCFA production by microbiota. Increased levels of SCFA in stool and/or plasma are associated with reduced alcohol craving and/or consumption. A subject's SCFA levels may be measured before or after treatment in stool or plasma samples since the increased SCFA production occurs in the colon and, as a result of absorption, SCFA are taken up into the blood.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The methods of the invention generally includes assaying a stool sample from the subject to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon, obtaining a donor sample of fecal material comprising microbiota associated with a reduction in alcohol craving and/or consumption, processing the sample of fecal material to produce at least one dose for fecal material transfer (FMT), and administering a dose of FMT rectally to the subject. It is an object of the invention to identify a donor able to supply fecal material that is enriched in beneficial microbiota. The ideal donor will have fecal material that is high in as many beneficial microbiota as possible, including any of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Lactonifactor, Oscillibacter, Anaerostipes </i>and <i>Bilophila </i>species. Accordingly, the ideal donor will have fecal material that is low in pathobionts, including <i>Ethanoligenens, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus</i>, and/or <i>Serratia </i>species. These pathobionts are also known to be harmful to the intestinal barrier and can also produce endogenous alcohol, which is counterproductive to reducing alcohol craving and/or consumption.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the fecal material acquired from a donor may be &#x201c;spiked&#x201d; or supplemented with cultures of one or more of beneficial microbiota that are deficient or absent from the donor FMT. In another embodiment, the fecal material of two or more donors may be combined in order to enhance the microbiota content of the final FMT product for administration to a recipient.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the administering step is performed as an enema comprising the dose of FMT. In another embodiment, the subject receives more than one dose of FMT, or multiple dose that are combined into a single administration by enema. In another embodiment, administration is performed as a rectal suppository. In yet another embodiment, FMT is lyophilized and packaged in capsules having an enteric coating and the capsules are administered orally. When administered as an enema, the enema is retained in the colon for at least thirty minutes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises the step of processing further comprises screening for pathogens selected from the group consisting of <i>Clostridium difficile </i>toxin B qualitative RT-PCR, Cyclospora and Isospora examination, ova and parasites exam with Giardia antigen EIA, <i>Salmonella</i>-<i>Shigella</i>-<i>Campylobacter </i>culture, Shiga toxins EIA with reflex to <i>E. coli </i>O157 culture and <i>Vibrio </i>culture, <i>Cryptosporidium </i>antigen EIA, <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>antigen EIA, stool norovirus EIA, stool rotavirus antigen detection, adenovirus antigen detection, gastroenteritis EIA, vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus </i>culture and <i>Microsporidia </i>exam.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of filtering the sample of fecal material, suspending the filtered fecal material in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffered solution to produce doses of FMT, storing the doses of FMT at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until time of administration, and thawing them when ready for the administering step.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of obtaining a second stool sample from the subject at least 15 days after the administering step, culturing the second stool sample to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon after receiving the at least one dose of FMT, and determining whether the microbiota of the subject has been altered by receiving the at least one dose of FMT. If the desired results have not been achieved, another dose of FMT is administered at least one time. Multiple doses may be administered, and these would typically be performed at 15-day intervals. These intervals allow time for the transplanted fecal microbiota to expand in the colon of the subject or patient who is the recipient or host of the FMT. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a post-FMT stool sample is collected and assayed to identify whether beneficial microbiota species have increased. An increase in beneficial species is a successful FMT, while a result of no change or a decrease in beneficial species is an unsuccessful FMT.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to increasing beneficial microbiota, FMT reduces microbes that are harmful to the intestinal barrier and could also produce endogenous alcohol. These include <i>Ethanoligenens, Streptococcus. Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Serratia </i>species. Thus, in one embodiment, a stool sample is collected from a recipient subject post-FMT, and the sample is assayed to identify whether any of <i>Ethanoligenens, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus</i>, and/or <i>Serratia </i>species are decreased, indicating a successful FMT. An increase or no change in harmful species would indicate an unsuccessful FMT.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another embodiment, the invention is method of changing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the colon of a subject in need thereof. SCFA of interest include but are not limited to butyric acid, isobutyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, 2-methybutyric acid, and hexanoic acid. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of assaying a stool sample from the subject to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon to determine whether the subject is deficient in beneficial microbiota species, obtaining a sample of fecal material from a suitable donor wherein the sample of fecal material comprises microbiota known to alter short-chain fatty acids associated with a reduction in alcohol craving and/or consumption, processing the sample of fecal material to produce at least one dose for fecal material transfer (FMT) and administering a dose of FMT rectally to the subject. The administering step is performed as an enema comprising the dose of FMT. When administered as an enema, the enema is retained in the colon for at least thirty minutes. In another embodiment, the subject receives more than one dose of FMT, or multiple doses that are combined into a single administration by enema. In another embodiment, administration is performed as a rectal suppository. In yet another embodiment, FMT is lyophilized and packaged in capsules having an enteric coating and the capsules are administered orally. The beneficial microbiota in the dose of fecal material comprise at least one species selected from the group consisting of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes </i>and <i>Bilophila. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises the steps of obtaining a second stool sample from the subject at least 15 days after the administering step, culturing the second stool sample to identify microbiota species resident in the subject's colon after receiving the at least one dose of FMT, and determining whether the microbiota of the subject has been altered by receiving the dose of FMT. In one embodiment of the invention, the microbiota is considered to be beneficially altered when any of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, <i>Odoribacter, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Eubacterium, Lactonifactor, Oscillibacter, Anaerostipes </i>and/or <i>Bilophila </i>species are increased in the post-FMT stool sample. In another embodiment, the microbiota is further considered to be beneficially altered when any of <i>Ethanoligenens, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, </i>and/or <i>Serratia </i>species are decreased in the post-FMT stool sample. In another embodiment, the levels of SCFA are measured in plasma. In some cases, after at least 15 days, another dose of FMT is administered at least one time. In another embodiment of the invention, the patient is routinely administered additional doses of FMT at suitable intervals. It is well-known that alcohol craving is an ongoing condition or symptom of AUD, and in some instances, additional doses of FMT may be administered routinely for an indefinite period of time, including many years of repeated dosing.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In practicing the method of the invention, the steps of processing may comprise screening the sample of fecal material for pathogens, combining samples from two or more donors, filtering the sample of fecal material, suspending the filtered fecal material in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffered solution to produce a dose of FMT. The fecal material may be homogenized in a buffered solution and filtered, or it may be pressed through a filter and suspended in the buffered solution. The buffered solution is generally an aqueous solution but may be any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent that is suitable for maintaining the microbiota of the fecal sample. Examples include buffer systems prepared by dissolving an organic acid, e.g. citric and acetic acid, or an inorganic acid, e.g. phosphoric acid in water or preferably in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and adjusting the pH with a base, preferably alkali base, e.g. KOH and NaOH, most preferably NaOH. Alternatively a buffer system can be prepared by dissolving an organic acid, e.g. citric and acetic acid, or inorganic acid, e.g. phosphoric acid, with the appropriate conjugate base, e.g. trisodium citrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate or sodium acetate, in water or preferably in a pharmaceutically acceptable intravenous vehicle. Optionally the pH can be (fine) adjusted to the final desired pH with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Optionally in addition to the tonicity agents which are chosen from glucose, sodium chloride, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, dextran 40 and dextran 70, the buffered formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant. This adjuvant is chosen from co-solvents, stabilizers, cryoprotective agents, desiccants, fillers. The fillers and cryoprotective agents are preferably chosen from simple sugars, for example, glucose, mannitol, fructose or sorbitol, disaccharides, for example, sucrose, lactose, trehalose or maltose; or water-soluble polymers, for example dextran, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is important to understand that when someone with AUD without advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis, stops drinking, the abundance of some harmful bacteria in the microbiome may be reduced in their system. For example, see Gao et al, <i>Front Physiol </i>2020; 11:370; and also see Leclercq et al. <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>2014; 111:E4485-4493, who showed that when such individuals voluntarily stopped drinking, these changes generally follow the expected pattern of reduction of harmful microbiota. However, some people, especially in the study by Leclercq et al., did not show changes in their microbiota function after stopping problem drinking. Despite this, the use of microbiota as a therapy to reduce alcohol craving or consumption was never demonstrated or suggested by Leclerq et al. or Gao et al. Furthermore, these patients did not have advanced liver disease and were not identified as having tried and failed at other therapies. The invention is a totally novel way of modulating the gut-brain axis in humans, while Leclercq and Gao merely followed what happens when people change drinking habits under supervision.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Before exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to any particular embodiment described herein and may vary.

A control group received at least one placebo enema and a test group received at least one FMT enema from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae as part of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial and demonstrate safety, conducted over a 6-month period. The Examples demonstrate that FMT is safe and associated with short-term reduction in alcohol craving and consumption with favorable microbial changes versus placebo in alcohol-related cirrhosis who were active alcohol misusers. There was also a reduction in AUD-related events over 6 months in patients assigned to FMT.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alcohol craving questionnaire, alcohol consumption (urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine, Etg), quality of life (QOL), cognition, serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), plasma/stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and stool microbiota were tested at baseline and day 15. A 6-month follow-up with serious adverse events (SAE) analysis was performed. 20 patients with AUD-related cirrhosis [65&#xb1;6.4 years, all men, MELD 8.9&#xb1;2.7] with similar demographics, cirrhosis and AUD severity were included. Craving reduced significantly in 90% of FMT versus 30% in placebo at day 15 (p=0.02) with lower urinary Etg (p=0.03), improved cognition and psychosocial QOL. There was reduction in serum IL-6 and LBP and increased butyrate/isobutyrate compared to baseline in FMT but not placebo. Microbial diversity increased post-FMT with higher Ruminococcaceae and other beneficial taxa but was not increased in subjects receiving placebo. Particular microbial species were linked with increased SCFA levels, and diversity of these SCFA-producing taxa were also increased. At 6 months, patients with any SAEs (8 vs 2, p=0.02), AUD-related SAEs (7 vs 1, p=0.02) and SAEs/patient [median(IQR),1.5(1.25) vs 0(0.25) in FMT,p=0.02] were higher in placebo versus FMT.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">FMT Donor Selection</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062">To select a donor of fecal material, 16S rRNA sequencing data was obtained from active drinkers with cirrhosis and healthy control samples (n=156) from Virginia Commonwealth University and McGuire VA Medical Center to train a Random Forest Classifier, a machine learning classification technique. The resulting classifier (AUC=0.94) was used to classify OpenBiome stool donors, giving each donor a classification score that classifies the sample as &#x2018;healthy&#x2019;. In addition, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae bacterial families in each donor were calculated, and taxa found to be depleted in those with alcohol intake patients were identified. These data were combined to rank OpenBiome stool donors (n=28), from which the donor with the highest aggregate ranking was selected as the FMT donor for FMT-randomized patients. The selected donor had the highest relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae among the stool donor registry.

We used LefSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) to determine the microbial taxa differences between groups (Pre vs post FMT and post-FMT vs post-placebo).</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Bacterial Taxon Analysis</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A Bayesian classifier with a posterior probability was used to identify query sequence based on the occurrence of seven-length base pair subsequences in the rRNA database. The raw data was filtered using a 180 base pair cutoff. The abundances of the bacterial identifications were then normalized using a custom PERL script and taxa present at &#x3e;1% of the community were tabulated. For this approach, a 1% cut off was chosen based on an a priori assumption that taxa present in &#x3c;1% of the community vary between individuals and have minimal contribution to the functionality of that community and 2,000 reads per sample will only reliably identify community components that are greater than 1% in abundance. The underlying a priori assumption for this filtering is that the low abundance components of the community vary between individual subjects and will not contribute significantly to the functionality of the gut mucosal microbiome. Additionally, the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2) package for UNIFRAC analysis and diversity analysis was utilized.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Cognitive Testing</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">EncephalApp Stroop is a validated smartphone App version of the Stroop test. This involves presentation of an easier &#x201c;Off&#x201d; Stage in which subjects have to identify the color of the pound-signs presented on the phone and a more difficult &#x201c;On&#x201d; stage in which subjects must correctly identify the color of a discordant word presented. For example, the word &#x201c;GREEN&#x201d; will be presented in blue colored letters and the correct response would be blue and not green. The App has two practice runs and requires 5 correct runs in the Off and On Stage. The total time required for 5 correct On and 5 correct Offstage runs is the &#x201c;OffTime+OnTime&#x201d; which is of relevance in HE. A low OffTime+OnTime indicates better cognition. Average differences in OffTime between patients with and without cognitive impairment are &#x3e;8 seconds, while that in OnTime are &#x3e;7 seconds.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) is a validated five test paper-pencil battery which tests visuo-motor coordination, psychomotor speed and reaction time.

If any subject did not want to continue, their last observation was carried forward. At day 16 (15 days post-intervention), cognition, alcohol craving, stool microbiota, urinary Etg/Cr and QOL were reassessed. Serum IL-6 and LBP and stool/plasma SCFAs were also reassessed. At day 31 (30 days post-intervention or day 30 post-FMT), a safety check was performed. Finally, at 6 months a safety visit was performed again either in person, remotely or through chart review where necessitated due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0090">Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as hospitalizations or emergency room visits during the study. All potential AEs and SAEs were first analyzed by the principal investigator for potential relatedness to the FMT material and forwarded to the DSMB, the IRB and FDA. The FDA mandated that all patients be followed via chart review or remotely for safety regardless of whether they were able to come in or not. Relatedness of AUD to the SAE was judged based on the medical records and presence of active alcohol drinking or withdrawal by patient interview, blood or urine alcohol levels and/or the judgement of the admitting physician. Data pertaining to alcohol abstinence were gleaned from interviews and chart review at 6 months.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0091">The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of the FMT versus placebo with respect to SAEs. Secondary outcomes were short-term changes in microbiota composition, alcohol craving and consumption, cognition and QOL. Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank matched paired tests when comparing continuous data from baseline to post-FMT and using Mann-Whitney tests when compared post-placebo to post-FMT. To compare between groups, delta changes in SIP, alpha diversity and ACQ between FMT and placebo groups were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Baseline analyses were compared using Mann-Whitney or unpaired t-tests as appropriate. Fisher exact tests were used to calculate proportion changes between and within groups. Microbial analyses were performed using 16srRNA sequencing of stool, changes in microbial diversity and Linear discriminant function effect size (LEfSe) was used to compare taxa pre vs post-FMT and post-FMT vs post-placebo. Correlation network analyses were performed between microbial genera, ACQ, and SCFAs pre vs post-FMT and post-FMT vs post-placebo using validated techniques in R and only correlations that were p&#x3c;0.05 and r&#x3e;0.7 or &#x3c;0.7 were studied. Due to the Phase 1 and exploratory nature of the study, 10 subjects in each group were the target enrollment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0092">This study was approved by the McGuire VA Medical center IRB and all participants provided written informed consent before study procedures. Between February 2018 and October 2019, 20 men with alcohol-related cirrhosis with a mean age of 65&#xb1;6.4 years, mean model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 8.9&#xb1;2.7, and median (IQR) AUDIT-10 (Alcohol use disorder identification test) score of 16.0(12.0) were randomized 1:1 into one-time FMT or placebo enema administration.

num="0107">Patients with any AUD-related SAE were significantly lower in the FMT versus placebo group (1 vs 7, p=0.02). The time to first AUD-related events was 89&#xb1;62 days in placebo while the only AUD-related event in FMT group occurred at day 179 post-intervention. AUD-related events continued throughout the 6-month period, indicating continued alcohol misuse in most placebo-assigned patients. At 6 months, three patients in the FMT and one in placebo group had stopped drinking based on interview and chart review. Through chart review and patient contact, the patients who continued to misuse alcohol had a steady rate of drinking without binges. One patient with prior HE was randomized to placebo and one to FMT. The FMT-assigned patient did not get hospitalized, while the patient with HE assigned to placebo was admitted for alcohol-related but not HE-related reasons multiple times. Both patients continued their therapy throughout the trial and no changes in their mentation were observed.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0108">Changes in the gut-brain axis are found in several behavioral and addictive disorders, but translation into clinical practice by microbial modulation was previously unclear. Example 2 included AUD patients with cirrhosis who had failed, and were unwilling to participate in usual therapies, which left adequate equipoise in studying FMT associated with potential risks in this population. The use of FMT to affect brain functional change builds from prior trials in patients with cirrhosis and HE.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0109">The part of the EncephalApp which interrogates cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control, i.e., OnTime, improved post-FMT, rather than the more basic OffTime part of the App, which relies mostly on psychomotor speed. Inhibitory control is often impaired in addictive disorders and this focused benefit may associate with favorable craving changes. Moreover, this was accompanied by improved psycho-social but not physical QOL. The improvement centered around higher mental functions and psychosocial QOL demonstrates that the impact of FMT may be selective and not an overall improvement in QOL. ACQ-SF captures the stated intention to use alcohol, which largely tracks urges and desires to drink, while urinary Etg/creatinine determines actual intake. These findings demonstrate that both perceived and actual short-term alcohol craving and use may be reduced by FMT.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0110">The microbial changes post-FMT support the short-term findings. Increased alpha-diversity was accompanied by increased relative abundance of butyrate-producing genera such as <i>Roseburia </i>and <i>Odoribacter </i>post-FMT. This is important because <i>Alistipes </i>and <i>Odoribacter </i>are lower in alcohol-related cirrhosis, while butyrate producers are lower in AUD with and without cirrhosis. <i>Alistipes </i>and <i>Bilophila </i>also decrease with advancing liver disease and grow with higher fat availability, which is associated with protection from alcohol-induced intestinal and liver injury. Moreover, craving amelioration was also associated with Ruminococcaceae genera post-FMT. These data extend prior experience that demonstrates increase in beneficial taxa after alcohol abstinence into the realm of FMT using a donor enriched in taxa that are deficient in this population.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0111">The Examples of the invention demonstrate a trend towards higher stool and plasma SCFA in the FMT group that were linked positively with Lachnospiraceae and most Ruminococcaceae constituents. The higher trend towards butyrate and isobutyrate and their association with Lachnospiraceaeae and Ruminococcaceae post-FMT points towards the Firmicutes that were higher in the donor material. Several taxa such as <i>Alistipes </i>and <i>Odoribacter </i>that increased post-FMT were also positively linked with SCFA levels. Other SCFA-producing taxa such as <i>Eubacterium </i>and <i>Anaerostipes </i>were also associated with lower ACQ and with SCFAs post-FMT(32). <i>Ethanoligenens</i>, an ethanol-producing genus of Ruminococcaceae, in contrast was negatively linked with SCFAs and positively with ACQ showing that these linkages were selective away from alcohol-producing and towards SCFA-producing taxa. Likely due to small numbers and inter-individual variations, the effects on SCFA levels themselves were not striking but their linkages with bacteria that increased post-FMT could indicate these moieties as potential mechanisms behind gut-brain axis improvement. Prior studies correlate with the findings in the Examples of the invention, showing that SCFA modulation engages the gut-brain axis in animal models and humans with addiction disorders.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0112">Moreover, these changes were accompanied by a short-term reduction in systemic inflammation, as indicated by IL-6, and potential reduction in intestinal permeability with lower LBP in the FMT recipients but not the placebo group. Without being bound to theory as to the exact gut-brain mechanism of these short-term benefits in craving and brain function, SCFAs, reduction in systemic inflammation and relatively strengthened intestinal barrier are contributory. These findings ultimately demonstrate that the short-term impact of FMT in AUD patients extends beyond the gut lumen with bioactive metabolite and intestinal barrier changes. Given the short-term changes in microbial function, intestinal barrier and inflammation, administration of multiple FMTs may used to achieve a long-term effect.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0113">In patients with both AUD and cirrhosis, who are prone to events focused on either condition, most events in placebo-assigned patients were focused on AUD and not cirrhosis. This highlights the effect of the intervention against AUD and the severity of the underlying AUD in this population. Despite one patient in each group being on HE therapy, there were no changes pertaining to HE during the follow-up for any subject. While there was a trend towards greater abstinence in the FMT-as signed group at 6 months, the mechanism of this longer-term change is unclear. The lower event rate could reflect the reduction but not the absence of alcohol intake in more patients in the FMT versus placebo group. These findings are in line with prior long-term studies of FMT in hepatic encephalopathy and alcoholic hepatitis and extend these into patients with AUD.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0114">The Examples herein are limited by the phase 1 nature which is not powered for efficacy and the resultant small sample size. In addition, the short-term microbial and alcohol consumption assessment without a daily record of alcohol use over the long-term is a limitation; thus, clinical follow-up, chart review and admissions pertaining to AUD were relied upon. Patients in these Examples were men and further studies in women, who have a different AUD susceptibility pattern are needed. Given the favorable short-term microbial changes and relatively lower AUD-related outcomes in this group of patients who had continued alcohol misuse despite reaching end-organ disease, treatments of AUD without cirrhosis may also be safe and potentially provide benefit.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0115">While the invention has been described in terms of its several exemplary embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
