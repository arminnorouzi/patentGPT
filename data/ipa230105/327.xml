Specifically, the invention relates to visualization means provided on endoscopic devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Endoscopic devices are devices comprising a handle (control section), an insertion tube (insertion shaft), typically visualization and illumination means on the distal face, and means for transmitting images captured by the visualization means to a display device. The insertion shaft can be either rigid, flexible or a combination of both. It can also comprise an articulation section.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Endoscopic devices that are used in medical procedures are known inter alia as endoscopes or laparoscopes. They are inserted into a patient's body either through a small cut or through a natural opening in the body such as the mouth, in order to inspect internal organs. Endoscopes are used to perform surgical procedures, such as removal of abnormal tissues, e.g. tumors or polyps by means of additional devices that are either mounted on the insertion shaft or introduced to the surgical location via one or more working channels through the insertion shaft. Endoscopic devices, e.g. borescopes, are used in industrial applications. Herein the word endoscope is used to refer to all types of endoscopic devices both medical and industrial.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many different types of visualization means e.g. CCD or CMOS still or video cameras, optical relay systems, optical fibers, &#x201c;chip on a stick&#x201d;, etc., are known in the art of endoscopy for transferring images proximally from the distal to the proximal end of the insertion tube, Since most modern endoscopic devices comprise video cameras, herein (including the claims) the word camera is used to represent any of these systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">All endoscopic devices known to the inventors comprise one or more cameras that are fixedly attached to either the distal tip or the insertion shaft of the endoscope. These cameras have a direction of view and field of view that is predetermined according to the intended use of the endoscope. In certain situations this field of view or direction of view is inadequate to carry out the intended task and in other situations the field of view becomes partially or totally blocked, for instance during a medical procedure when tissue that is being operated upon comes between the lens of the camera and the surgical tool. In these situations the surgeon either has to carry out the procedure &#x201c;blind&#x201d; or to reposition the endoscopic device in an attempt to get a better view. It would therefore be advantageous to have an endoscopic device capable of obtaining images from a variety of fields of view and of maintaining continuous endoscopic observation throughout an entire endoscopic procedure without the necessity of rotating or repositioning the endoscope.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an endoscopic device capable of providing images from multiple directions of view and corresponding fields of view during an endoscopic procedure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide an endoscopic device capable of maintaining continuous endoscopic observation throughout an entire endoscopic procedure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further purposes and advantages of this invention will appear as the description proceeds.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect the invention is an endoscopic device comprising an insertion tube, a distal tip, and at least one camera located at an initial location on or in the distal tip or the insertion tube.

The endoscopic device also comprises a mechanical arrangement that is activated from the proximal end of the endoscopic device. The mechanical arrangement is configured to do at least one of the following: (a) to move the camera from the initial location to one or more different locations on, in or spaced away from the distal end of the insertion tube; and (b) to change the direction of view of the camera, i.e. the direction in which the optical axis of the camera is pointed relative to the distal direction defined by the longitudinal symmetry axis of the insertion tube.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0064">The invention can be implemented in many different ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>12</b>C</figref> schematically illustrate some of these ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref> schematically illustrate in more detail the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A to <b>12</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>F</figref> schematically show different views of the distal tip <b>10</b> of an endoscopic device.

Many other ways of implementing the invention are possible. For example, the endoscopic device may comprise at least one camera attached fixedly to the distal tip or insertion tube of the endoscope and at least one camera attached to the distal tip or insertion tube of the endoscope by one or more rods configured to be reversibly extended in any direction with respect to the surface of the endoscopic device in order to provide a field of view that cannot be obtained by the cameras attached fixedly to the endoscope. In another example, one or more of the cameras, for instance but not necessarily, a fixed camera on the distal tip or one of the cameras attached to the endoscope by an extendible rod or rods, may be mounted in such a way that the camera can be panned, tilted, or rotated in order to provide various directions of view. In other examples different permutations of the components described herein can be utilized, for example, the moveable camera <b>12</b> or the fixed 2<sup>nd </sup>camera <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>12</b>C</figref> could be replaced with a camera mounted on a ball joint as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0072">Embodiments of the present invention are endoscopic devices comprising visualization means comprised of a first set of cameras comprising one or more cameras that are fixedly attached to the distal tip or insertion tube of the endoscopic device and a second set of cameras each of which is mounted on one or more rods configured to be reversibly extended outwards from the distal tip or insertion tube of the endoscopic device, wherein the first set of cameras provides a field of view looking outwards from the interior of the endoscopic device and the second set of cameras provides a field of view looking inwards towards the endoscopic device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a front view of an embodiment of an endoscope <b>100</b> that comprises visualization means according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the location of a forward facing camera <b>101</b>, in the center of the distal face of endoscope <b>100</b>, and an illumination source, which in this embodiment is a light ring <b>104</b>. In other embodiments the illumination source can be of any other type known in the art, e.g. LEDs or optical fibers. The endoscope may also comprise other conventional components such as working channels and a channel for irrigation or insufflation, which are not shown on the distal tip to simplify the figures. A camera mount <b>102</b> is located at the top of the distal tip. Camera mount <b>102</b> comprises a backward facing camera (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and an illumination source (not shown in the figures).

In this embodiment camera mount <b>102</b> is attached to two rods <b>203</b> that can be extended distally from a first position abutting base <b>202</b> to a second position spaced apart from base <b>202</b> and retracted proximally from the second position back to the first position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0075">In one embodiment of the invention, the base <b>202</b> is a specially configured distal tip, which is an integral part of a dedicated endoscope. In this embodiment the distal tip comprises two bores through which rods <b>203</b> can be slid distally and proximally. In another embodiment of the invention, base <b>202</b> is a collar which slips over and is attached to the distal tip of a standard endoscope. In this embodiment the collar comprises two bores through which rods <b>203</b> can be slid distally and proximally. In this add-on embodiment, an elastomeric sheath (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) is used to cover operation wires for moving the rods and electrical wires to the camera and illumination means on camera mount <b>102</b> and signal wires that are located outside of the insertion tube of the endoscope, as will be described herein below.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0076">Extendable camera rods <b>203</b> are configured to move camera mount <b>102</b> distally away from and proximally towards base <b>202</b>. The motion of camera rods <b>203</b> is controlled by cables, rods or other mechanical means (not shown) that are attached to the proximal ends of rods <b>203</b>. For simplicity, any arrangement known in the art for moving the rods laterally is referred to hereinafter as wires. The wires are stiff enough to cause camera rods <b>203</b> to move distally when the wires are pushed distally. In the embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is an integral part of an endoscope, the wires pass through channels in the insertion tube of the endoscope to a handle where the proximal end of the wires are attached to a mechanism that is configured to extend and retract camera rods <b>203</b>. In the embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is added on to an endoscope, the wires pass through tubes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>that are held against the insertion shaft of the endoscope by a sheath, to a dedicated control box located at the proximal end of the endoscope.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0077">A stapling device comprised of an anvil <b>103</b> and a staple cartridge <b>205</b> is located on base <b>202</b>. The designs of cartridge <b>205</b> and anvil <b>103</b> have been previously described in WO2007/141776 to the applicant of the present patent application. Anvil <b>103</b> is mounted on extendable rods <b>207</b> which can be extended distally to obtain an opened configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), or can be retracted proximally to obtain a closed configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The motion of rods <b>207</b> is controlled by a mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic arrangement similar to that described herein above for rods <b>203</b>. In embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is an integral part of the endoscope, the wires that control movement of rods <b>207</b> pass through channels in the insertion tube of the endoscope to a handle where the proximal end of the wires is attached to a mechanism that is configured to extend and retract rods <b>207</b>. In embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is added to the endoscope, the wires pass through tubes <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b </i>that are enclosed by the additional sheath. When anvil <b>103</b> is retracted, i.e. when rods <b>207</b> are moved proximally, alignment pins <b>215</b>, which are fixedly attached to base <b>202</b>, enter alignment openings <b>214</b> in anvil <b>103</b> causing the anvil to be perfectly aligned with cartridge <b>205</b>. In other embodiments, arrangements such as an ultrasound or optical sensor system can be used instead of the alignment pins <b>215</b> and openings <b>214</b> to obtain and verify alignment of the anvil and cartridge.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0078">In this design of the stapler, stapler cartridge <b>205</b> does not comprise an arrangement of cams to actively eject the staples, such as is conventionally found in medical staplers. In the present stapling device, when anvil <b>103</b> is retracted proximally as described herein above, the face of anvil <b>103</b> engages a portion of tissue which is between the anvil and cartridge <b>300</b>, and presses the portion of tissue against the distal face of cartridge <b>300</b>, whereupon continued retraction of anvil <b>103</b> causes a distal section of cartridge <b>205</b> to slide proximally into a proximal section. Neither staple pushers nor staples move inside the proximal section and the legs of the staples are passively forced to exit the distal section of cartridge <b>205</b> through slots <b>208</b> in the distal end of cartridge <b>205</b> and engage matching depressions <b>210</b> on the face of anvil <b>103</b>. Continued pulling on the wires attached to the extendable rods <b>207</b> of the anvil <b>103</b> causes more and more of the length of the legs of the staples to exit through slots <b>208</b> and layers of tissue until the legs of the staples start to curl in depressions <b>210</b>. The process continues until the staples completely exit the cartridge <b>205</b>, the legs are completely curled and the process of stapling the layers of tissue together is completed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0079">A tissue gripping device comprising at least one tissue gripper <b>204</b> is configured to be reversibly extended from base <b>202</b>.

Other embodiments of gripping means can comprise, for example, forceps or any similar grasping tool known in the art. The proximal end of gripper <b>204</b> is connected to a wire <b>216</b>, which is connected to a mechanism in the handle of the endoscope or in the dedicated control box, which controls the longitudinal and the rotational motion of gripper <b>204</b>. In embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is an integral part of the endoscope, wire <b>216</b> passes through channels in the insertion tube of the endoscope and in embodiments in which base <b>202</b> is added on to an endoscope, wire <b>216</b> passes through tube <b>218</b> to the proximal end of endoscope <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0080">In the opened configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an operating space <b>206</b>, shown as the gap between two dashed lines, exists in the space between rods <b>207</b> and between cartridge <b>205</b> and anvil <b>103</b>.

After gripper <b>204</b> has firmly gripped the growth, in step <b>516</b>, the gripper is retracted through the operating space pulling the growth through the operating space until the entire growth is above the staple cartridge and a portion of tissue below the growth is located opposite the slots <b>208</b> in the distal end of cartridge <b>205</b>. At this point in the procedure, the field of view of front facing camera <b>101</b> is blocked by the growth so, in the next step <b>517</b> the backward facing camera <b>209</b> is used to ensure the growth is in the correct position. In step <b>518</b>, the anvil is retracted towards the cartridge, pressing tissue below the growth between the anvil and the cartridge. In step <b>519</b>, at least one staple is ejected from the cartridge through the tissue below the growth. In step <b>520</b>, a cutting device is actuated by the operator and the tissue below the growth is cut above the staple line. In the next step <b>521</b>, the anvil is moved distally, releasing the stapled tissue from the operating space and leaving the growth connected to the gripper. In the next and final step <b>522</b> the growth is withdrawn from the body of the patient along with endoscope <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0088">An additional step can be introduced between steps <b>519</b> and <b>520</b>. This additional step comprises moving the anvil distally after firing the staples to carry out a detailed inspection of the stapled tissue using backward facing camera <b>209</b> followed by moving the anvil proximally before cutting the tissue.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0089">The order of the steps that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is presented just for illustration. Other orders of the steps are possible, for example steps <b>512</b> and <b>513</b> can be interchanged allowing the backward facing camera to be used to help position the endoscope relative to the growth.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0090">In the embodiment of endoscope <b>100</b> described herein above there is a fixed distance between extendible anvil rods <b>207</b> through which growths and tissue can be pulled, in order to perform procedures such as those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. This distance is determined by the maximum diameter of the insertion shaft of endoscope <b>100</b>, which in turn is determined by the minimum inner diameter of the lumen through which the insertion shaft must travel to reach the site at which the procedure is to be carried out. Therefore, in some instances, a growth or a hole with a diameter that is larger than the opening between rods <b>207</b> cannot be successfully operated upon because it cannot be pulled entirely into the operating space between the rods.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> (see drawing sheet <b>2</b>/<b>11</b>) is a perspective view of anvil <b>103</b> attached to base <b>202</b> by rods <b>401</b> that are configured to provide a solution to the problem of the limited distance between them. As in the case of rods <b>207</b> described herein above, the proximal ends of rods <b>401</b> are connected to the distal ends of wires that control movement of the anvil distally and proximally from handle of the endoscope or a dedicated box. These wires pass through tubes in the interior of the insertion tube of endoscope <b>100</b> or through tubes <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b </i>in an add-on embodiment. When the wires are pulled proximally, the rods <b>401</b> are in a first position confined inside the tubes in a straight configuration. As they are pushed distally and they exit the tubes their pre-shaped memory property causes them to bow outward until they reach a second position having the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> when they are totally extended in front of base <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0092">After positioning ECD <b>100</b> above a tissue of interest and extending rods <b>401</b>, tissue is grabbed by gripper <b>204</b> and is pulled it into operating space <b>206</b>. After the tissue is grabbed and pulled into the operating space, rods <b>401</b> are retracted proximally, pulling them into tubes <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b</i>. As the rods <b>401</b> enter the tubes, the rods are straightened and tissue encompassed by rods <b>401</b> is squeezed between them, until the tissue is finally pressed between cartridge <b>205</b> and anvil <b>103</b> for stapling, as described above.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0093">Embodiments of the endoscopic device of the invention can be usefully employed to perform the visualization functions of robotic surgical systems.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0094">Although embodiments of the invention have been described by way of illustration, it will be understood that the invention may be carried out with many variations, modifications, and adaptations, without exceeding the scope of the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
