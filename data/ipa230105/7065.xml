In particular, techniques are disclosed for selecting a local device within a collaborative environment setting to perform a particular function within the collaborative environment.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a working environment, there is often need for occasions where people need to work together. In such situations, it is usually most effective to organize a collaborative environment (e.g., a meeting) in which the relevant people can participate. Such a collaborative environment could also be a social event where not all participants are able to be in the same physical location. In situations where a meeting or event is organized, but some participants are in one location, such as an office meeting room, while other participants are in other locations, such as in their homes or in another office meeting room, it is necessary to hold the meeting using conference calling or video meeting technology. Participants will often each have their own device for accessing the meeting or call, even if attending the meeting or event in the same room as other participants. The room in which they are sitting (i.e., the setting) may also have its own audio-visual facilities, such as a web cam, which may or may not also include a microphone and/or speakers; a conference call hub, which may include one or more microphones and/or speakers and also may be linked to one or more additional microphones connected by long leads (known as spokes), or connected wirelessly such that people sitting farther from the hub may be heard via the microphones. If each participant in a meeting is using their own device to access the meeting, the resulting sound is often compromised by the &#x201c;echo&#x201d; of hearing other people directly and also via various speakers in the room. This means that sound quality can be unclear and make it difficult for people to understand or participate in the meeting efficiently. For anyone participating in the meeting who is not in the room, perhaps if they are working at home, the sound quality may be even more unclear as they will hear the sound picked up by several microphones and possibly through several speakers, as well as through the speakers of their personal device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, generally in a conference room setting with multiple participants each having their own device, not all devices will be connected to a power supply, and some may become depleted of battery power during the meeting. Some devices may have many background programs running, which may slow down the audio or video signals causing a delay or inconsistencies in the input or output of audio and video signal. Some devices may be of a higher specification than others and will have a higher resolution screen, or a larger screen than other devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some meeting room settings attempt to solve these issues by having one large central audio-visual system, such as a projector, a screen, ceiling or wall speakers and wired internet. However, issues, particularly with sound, still occur with participants at different distances from the microphones. Furthermore, if there is a problem with a central system, the meeting cannot go ahead at all.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need, especially in present times with hybrid working (some people in the office, some people at home) becoming more and more prevalent, for a system to ensure meetings can take place efficiently and effectively when multiple devices are joined to a meeting, particularly in the same room. It may be useful to be able to use just one device for, e.g., a microphone and speaker and video. However, one such device may have a good microphone quality, but the speakers may not be of a high enough quality to serve the whole meeting room. Accordingly, there is a need for a system that is able to identify one or more local devices from a plurality of devices in a collaborative environment setting that have a highest quality of one or more system characteristics and select said one or more devices for one or more functions related to the characteristics, such that the collaborative environment is not disrupted by multiple devices all performing the same multiple functions throughout the duration of the meeting.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for selecting one or more local devices in a collaborative environment setting. For each device in the collaborative environment, first and second qualities of a first and second system characteristic, respectively, of the device are determined. The first system characteristic and the second system characteristic may be different and may each be selected from the list consisting of microphone quality, speaker quality, video capture quality, video display quality, screen resolution, power availability, internet connection quality, network bandwidth and device operating system speed. The collaborative environment setting may be a meeting where several participants are in the same meeting room in an office building. There may be additional participants joining from other locations, perhaps their individual homes or maybe another group of participants in a different meeting room in a different location. The collaborative environment may therefore be only in one physical setting or may be spread over several physical settings that are all joined to one virtual meeting or event. Each physical setting may have only one participant with one device or may include several participants, each with their own device. Based on the respective first quality and second quality of each device of the plurality of devices, a subset of devices of the plurality of devices is identified, including at least one device having a highest first quality and at least one device having a highest second quality. One or more devices from the subset of devices are then selected based on the first quality and the second quality of each device of the subset of devices. In some embodiments, once the one or more devices are selected, the first and second system characteristics of at least one device not selected may be disabled.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A device having a second-highest quality for a system characteristic as a back up may be identified, in case the device having the highest-quality fails or if the user does not agree to allow their device to be selected. If the device having the highest quality system characteristic fails, cannot be selected, or is manually deselected by a user, the device with the second-highest quality of the system characteristic may be selected.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first system characteristic may be relevant for a first function in the collaborative environment, and the second system characteristic may be relevant for a second function in the collaborative environment. The functions may be any function that is used in a collaborative environment setting, such as a microphone, speaker, internet, camera, video (real-time or playback), screen or display. A first selected device having the highest first quality to perform the first function and a second selected device having the highest second quality may each be instructed to perform the first and second function, respectively.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first selected device and the second selected device may be the same device, should the device have the highest quality of more than one characteristic. The first selected device and the second selected device may be different devices, meaning they are separate devices and also that they may be different types of devices. Each device may be a laptop computer, a mobile telephone, a tablet, a projector, a television, a conference call hub which may include spokes, devices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, a smart watch, a desktop computer, a speaker (free standing or wall- or ceiling-mounted), a microphone or a monitor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For a duration of the collaborative environment setting, the first quality of the first characteristic may be periodically redetermined, and the second quality of the second characteristic may be periodically redetermined. It may be that at one or more points in the duration of the collaborative setting one or more of the selected devices is no longer providing the highest-quality characteristic for which it was selected. Therefore, periodic determinations of the quality of the first system characteristic and the quality of the second system characteristic for the duration of the setting ensure the meeting runs efficiently and effectively with minimal or no interruptions. If a change in the quality of one or more characteristics is determined, in response to determining a change in the first quality, a first device previously selected to perform the first function may be deselected, and a third device having a current highest first quality to perform the first function may be selected. In response to determining a change in the second quality, a second device previously selected to perform the second function may be deselected, and a fourth device having a current highest second quality to perform the second function may be selected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Negative feedback from a user of the collaborative environment related to a first function may be received, and as such, human input may contribute to the selection of a device. In response to receiving the negative feedback, a first device selected to perform the first function may be deselected, and a different device from the plurality of devices to perform the first function may be selected.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order that a user of a device knows that their device has been selected, a notification that the device has been selected to perform at least one function in the collaborative environment may be generated for output at a selected device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As an example, a meeting may take place involving ten participants in three separate settings. Six of the participants are together in a meeting room in an office in London (Anna, Bob, Claire, Danny, Ellen and Fred), three others are in a meeting room in New York (Gail, Harry and Isla) and one is at their home in Vancouver (Jon). The meeting is a video meeting and includes a presentation involving a slide deck and a playback of a pre-recorded video. At the end there is time for a discussion, which happens in a Zoom- or Teams-type format where each of the participants is seen on a display.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Using the methods and systems of the invention, at the start of the meeting, the quality of the relevant characteristics of each device in the London meeting room is determined. The characteristics may be audio quality (microphone and speaker), display quality, video playback capability, power remaining, operating system capability and internet connection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Anna's device, a laptop, is chosen as the speaker, since it has the highest-quality speaker and plenty of power, a good internet connection and a fast operating system. A pop-up box appears on Anna's screen to let her know the device has been chosen, and she clicks &#x201c;OK&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Bob's device, a tablet, has the highest-quality microphone. However, it isn't plugged into a power supply and the battery is running fairly low, and the device is running an old and slow operating system. Therefore, Bob's device is not selected for the microphone function.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fred's device has a good-quality microphone, and the power level and operating system are running at a higher level than Bob's device. Fred's device is selected as the microphone, and the system notifies Fred accordingly, who agrees.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The London meeting room has a central audio-visual (AV) system, with a projector and a large screen. This device is selected as the device on which to display the visual aspects of the meeting, i.e., the slides, the video and the individual video capture of each of the participants, respectively, depending on which part of the meeting is in progress at any one time.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Danny's and Ellen's devices are also not selected, and so all microphones, speakers and cameras are disabled on Bob's, Claire's, Danny's and Ellen's devices. Fred's device has the speaker disabled, and Anna's device has the microphone disabled.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the New York meeting room, there is no central AV system. Isla has a brand new top-of-the-range laptop, and she is not running any other programs in the background. Isla's device is therefore selected as the device to use as the microphone, the speaker and for video playback. Gail and Harry have their devices disabled for these functions. Jon's device is used for all functions, since in his setting of the collaborative environment, his laptop is the only device. It may be that Jon links his laptop to a monitor, which has its own speakers and display. In this case, the collaborative environment setting would have two devices, and the control circuitry would determine which of Jon's laptop or the monitor has the highest quality speakers and display and select the device accordingly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">During the first part of the meeting, Danny is presenting some slides. He is sitting near Fred, and when the system periodically redetermines the quality of the relevant characteristics, it is determined that Fred's microphone should remain selected, even though Danny is closer to his own microphone. It may be that Danny has a slow operating system, or less power, or a low-quality microphone.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the slides have been presented, Jon wants to show a pre-recorded video. He introduces this and then plays it. It is determined that the video be displayed on the central AV system in London, and on Isla's laptop in New York. Jon's laptop display is used in Vancouver. The system, during its periodic review of the quality of the characteristics of each device in the collaborative environment setting, determines that Anna's laptop is now running several background programs and this is affecting the audio quality. The system therefore deselects Anna's device's speaker and selects Ellen's device as the speaker for the London meeting room. After a short time, Ellen receives a notification on her device asking if the speaker function is satisfactory. Bob and Claire report that they cannot hear the video sound well, so Ellen clicks NO and the system redetermines that the central AV system speakers are the highest quality and selects those, deselecting Ellen's device simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">After the video has finished, each participant is invited to speak. The system of the invention determines periodically which device has the highest-quality audio input each time a different participant speaks. Most often this results in the speaker's device being selected as the microphone for the duration of that participant speaking, but sometimes, as in Danny's case, Fred's device's microphone is determined to be better and therefore, Danny's device's microphone remains deselected throughout. Each participant uses their own device's camera, and the display is only shown on the one device, as above, in each location of the collaborative setting.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary scenario in which several devices are being used within a single room to access the same meeting, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary notification box, which may appear on the display of a selected device to notify the user of the device that the device has been selected, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary notification box, which may appear on the display of a selected device to request feedback from the user of the device on the quality of the selected function, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram showing components and dataflow therebetween of a system for selecting a device in a collaborative environment setting, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart representing an illustrative process for selecting a local device in a collaborative environment setting, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart representing an illustrative process for instructing devices to perform first and second functions, respectively, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart representing an illustrative process for periodically redetermining the device to select in a collaborative environment setting, deselecting the selected device and reselecting a different device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart representing an illustrative process for deselecting a local device in a collaborative environment setting in response to user feedback and selecting a different device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary scenario in which several devices are being used within a single collaborative environment setting (a meeting room) to access the same meeting. Meeting room control circuitry <b>100</b> connects with six Devices <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> present in the meeting room. Meeting room control circuitry <b>100</b> assesses system characteristics such as the audio input, audio output and video characteristics of each of the devices and selects Device <b>102</b> to use as the microphone for the whole room, such that echoes and inconsistent sound are reduced or eliminated. Device <b>102</b> may be a device that is personal to one of the participants, such as a laptop, mobile telephone or a tablet. Device <b>102</b> may be a conference call hub of the type that is placed in the center of a meeting room table that generally includes a microphone and a speaker. If Device <b>102</b> is selected only for its microphone capabilities, the speaker or any other capabilities may be disabled. Device <b>104</b> may be selected by meeting room control circuitry <b>100</b> to act as the sole speaker for the meeting room in this particular meeting or collaborative environment setting. The speaker that is used may be on a personal device such as a laptop or tablet, or it may be a speaker in the meeting room, such as ceiling-mounted speaker system or a speaker integrated into an AV system, but the display is disabled. Device <b>106</b> may be selected as the display device.

Notification box <b>200</b> may be displayed on the screen of a device such as a laptop or tablet in response to the device being selected for having the highest-quality of a system characteristic (for example, at <b>514</b> or <b>518</b> in the process exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the device has been determined to have the highest-quality audio input characteristic, and the device has been selected to be used as the microphone for the environment. The notification box may give the user the option to agree to continue with the selection of their device by clicking a sub-box to indicate that the user agrees, such as an OK box <b>204</b>. If the user clicks OK, <b>204</b>, the device will be selected and other devices in the environment disabled for the microphone function.

Audio input circuitry <b>404</b> may convert the audio to a digital format such as WAV. Audio input circuitry <b>404</b> transmits <b>406</b> the audio signal (usually a voice signal) to control circuitry <b>408</b>. Control circuitry <b>408</b> may be based on any suitable processing circuitry.

In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core i7 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The audio signals are received by audio processing circuitry <b>410</b>. Audio processing circuitry <b>410</b> may be any suitable circuitry configured to perform audio analysis functions, such as volume, frequency domain analysis, level and gain analysis, harmonic distortion analysis, etc. Audio processing circuitry <b>410</b> analyzes the quality of each separate audio signal received from each individual device to identify one audio signal that has the highest quality, which may be a function of characteristics such as volume, clarity, interference, frequency and consistency.

Video processing circuitry <b>428</b> analyzes the quality of each separate video signal received from each individual device to identify one video signal that has the highest quality, which may be a function of characteristics such as clarity, interference, resolution and consistency. Video processing circuitry <b>428</b> transmits <b>430</b> the characteristics to memory <b>414</b> for storage in a device database associated with the environment.

Control circuitry <b>408</b> may retrieve the stored quality data and/or other characteristics of each device and compare those data to identify the device with the highest quality or best characteristic for each function to be performed in the collaborative environment. For example, to identify the best device to perform the audio input function, control circuitry <b>408</b> may compare stored characteristics of each device relating to audio input, such as microphone quality.

For example, to identify the best device to perform the video input function, control circuitry <b>408</b> may compare stored characteristics of each device relating not only to camera quality, but also to system processing speed, available video compression codecs, and available bandwidth, as each of these characteristics can affect video quality. In some embodiments, audio processing circuitry <b>410</b> determines which device has the highest-quality audio signal, and audio processing circuitry <b>410</b> prevents transmission of the audio signal from other devices that do not have the highest quality of audio signal.

As another alternative, the command signal may be transmitted directly to non-selected devices. The command signal may be a data packet, which may require the transmission of a second data packet at the end of the predetermined period of time to reenable audio input circuitry <b>404</b>. Alternatively, for devices that communicate with control circuitry <b>408</b> over a physical connection, such as USB or Ethernet cable, the command signal may be a voltage level that remains constant at the signaling voltage level during the predetermined period of time, after which the level changes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At the end of the predetermined period of time, audio processing circuitry may compare the audio signals from each of the plurality of devices to determine which device has the highest quality audio signal.
