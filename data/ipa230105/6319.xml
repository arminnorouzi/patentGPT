The present disclosure more specifically relates to external electrical connections for batteries.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In batteries with multiple cell elements, the cells are connected in series by conductive straps. The straps also connect the cells to a positive terminal and a negative terminal. These terminals are accessible outside the battery housing. These terminals allow for a vehicle (or other application) to connect to the battery for use. The conductive straps and terminals comprise a conductive material. Typically, in a lead-acid battery, this conductive material is comprised of lead.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lead is a heavy metal and considered to be toxic. Any lead surface exposed to the environment is a potential source of contamination. Use of lead is therefore prohibited in many applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known lead-acid batteries require interaction between a consumer or technician with the lead terminals in order to connect, change, or otherwise maintain the battery. Certain governmental bodies are advancing tighter regulation of lead in lead-acid batteries. For example, the European Union and the State of California have explored regulations about lead exposure as it relates to lead-acid batteries. For example, Department of Toxic Substances Control's (DTSC) in California is actively evaluating whether it should identify lead-acid batteries as a Priority Product under the Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program. Of particular concern is the exposure of consumers to lead dust by inhalation and ingestion during consumer use and replacement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, various embodiments of solutions are disclosed which seek to remedy the above deficiencies.

The housing <b>103</b> may further comprise a surface <b>105</b> (for example, a cover or lid). Protruding from the cover <b>105</b> can be seen two terminals <b>107</b>. While terminals <b>107</b> are generally specified, the terminals <b>107</b> may comprise a positive terminal <b>109</b> or a negative terminal Ill (the phrase &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; may be used herein to describe a positive terminal <b>109</b>, negative terminal Ill or both unless otherwise particularly specified). While the cover <b>105</b> is shown on a top of the battery <b>101</b> with the terminals <b>107</b> protruding towards an upper edge of the page, it should be understood the cover <b>105</b> and terminals <b>107</b> may be provided on any orientation, such as a side to allow access to terminals <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The various elements of the battery <b>101</b>, the battery housing <b>103</b>, the battery cover <b>105</b>, and the cell containers may be made of a wide variety of known materials. For example, the cover <b>105</b>, container/housing <b>103</b>, and/or various components may be made of any polymeric (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, a polypropylene containing material, etc.) or composite (e.g., glass-reinforced polymer) material. For example, the container may be made of polypropylene-containing material (e.g., pure polypropylene, co-polymers comprising polypropylene, polypropylene with additives, etc.). Such polymeric material is relatively resistant to degradation caused by acid (e.g., sulfuric acid) provided within cells of the container or housing <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a section of a battery <b>101</b>. The battery <b>101</b> includes a battery element <b>113</b> coupled to an end strap <b>115</b> which leads to a terminal post <b>117</b>. The terminal post <b>117</b> extends through a bushing <b>119</b> provided within the cover <b>105</b> of the battery housing <b>103</b>. This is one non-limiting example of a battery <b>101</b> which may be used with the devices (e.g. bushing <b>119</b>, terminal post <b>117</b>, and/or cover <b>105</b>), systems, and methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a cross-section of a first cap <b>251</b> for a battery terminal <b>107</b> for a lead-acid battery <b>101</b>, according to various embodiments. The cap <b>251</b> may be understood as sized to accept a battery terminal <b>107</b> (such as a positive terminal <b>109</b> or negative terminal <b>111</b>) protruding from a lid or cover <b>105</b> of a battery housing <b>103</b>. The cap <b>251</b> may be provided on top of a terminal post <b>117</b> and bushing <b>119</b>, which may, for example be welded together to form a terminal <b>107</b> and facilitate connection between the terminal <b>107</b> and an electrical connector (not shown). The cap <b>251</b> may be understood to be electrically conductive, for example, but not limited to, in an electrically conductive portion (such as, but not limited to, a conductive cage <b>259</b>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The cap <b>251</b> may comprise at least an electrically conductive portion. In various embodiments, the electrically conductive portion comprises a conductive cage <b>259</b>. The conductive cage <b>259</b> may generally comprise copper or other conductive metal. The conductive cage <b>259</b> may surround a battery terminal <b>107</b>. Therefore, a bottom <b>253</b> of the cap <b>251</b> may be provided onto a top surface of a battery cover <b>105</b>. In one or more examples the conductive cage <b>259</b> is filled, spaced apart, or alternates with a portion <b>256</b> which may be non-conductive comprising a substance such as a polymer or resin, for example, polypropylene.

The cap <b>251</b> may, in various embodiments, be glued/molded/bonded to top <b>105</b> of battery <b>101</b>. Then, a connector may be attached to the cap <b>251</b>, facilitating connection with the battery <b>101</b> by way of the terminal <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows another example embodiment of an electrically conductive cap <b>351</b> for a battery terminal <b>107</b>, according to various embodiments. The electrically conductive cap <b>351</b> may be understood as provided on top of a battery terminal <b>107</b> in an interior <b>361</b> of the cap. The cap <b>351</b> may be comprised of an electrically conductive material that is resistant to acid. In one or more examples of embodiments, the cap <b>351</b> may be comprised, for example, of copper, brass, stainless steel, nickel, alloys or combinations thereof, or the like. The cap <b>351</b> may be comprised entirely of electrically conductive material or the cap <b>351</b> may include non-conductive components. For example, the cap <b>351</b> may include an overmolded ring <b>365</b> (for example, an overmolded resin ring) for facilitating fastening to the surface of a cover <b>105</b>. In various embodiments, the overmolded ring <b>365</b> facilitates the joint connection to the battery cover <b>105</b>. In various embodiments, connection to an exterior surface of the battery cover <b>105</b> is provided using an adhesive or a plastic that is molded overtop of the cap <b>351</b>. In various embodiments, the cap <b>351</b> is stamped out of a conductive material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cap <b>351</b> may further comprise a number of torque ribs <b>359</b>. The torque ribs <b>359</b> may be stamped or otherwise formed into the cap <b>351</b>. The torque ribs (or, in various embodiments, inward dimples) <b>359</b> may compress into the lead post <b>107</b> by an attached battery clamp providing the electrical connection and torque resistance. The cap <b>351</b> material may have a thickness sufficient to resist the clamping torque and abrasion. This way, the cap <b>351</b> may maintain coverage of the lead terminal <b>107</b> and prevent exposure thereof. In various embodiments, the thickness of the cap material may be from approximately 0.050 mm to approximately 1.5 mm. The torque ribs <b>359</b> may likewise be comprised of a conductive material.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As an alternative, solder <b>367</b> may be provided on the inside of the cap <b>351</b>. The solder <b>367</b> may be tinned to the cap <b>351</b>. The solder <b>367</b> may facilitate an electrical connection (i.e. a soldered connection) between the cap <b>351</b> and the terminal <b>107</b>. The cap <b>351</b> may comprise a conductive material other than lead (for example, but not limited to, copper, brass, stainless steel, nickel, alloys or combinations thereof, or the like). The solder <b>367</b> may be localized to one surface (for example, under the top <b>357</b> of the cap <b>351</b>) or on more than one or all surfaces (e.g. top <b>357</b>, sides <b>355</b>, and/or bottom <b>353</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also shows a number of attachment mechanisms for providing the cap <b>351</b> onto a housing <b>103</b> or cover <b>105</b>. For example, the cap <b>351</b> may attach by way of an overmold <b>365</b>. The overmold <b>365</b> may allow for attachment by heating of a polypropylene or plastic or other suitable material, for example, between a bottom of the conductive material <b>353</b> and a top of a battery housing <b>103</b> or cover <b>105</b>. While heating of the overmold <b>365</b> would facilitate connection between the cap <b>351</b> and battery housing <b>103</b> in various embodiments, other fastening mechanisms may be used to seal the cap <b>351</b> to the battery housing <b>103</b>. For example, as described herein, an adhesive provided on a bottom surface <b>369</b> of the cap <b>351</b> may be used. In various embodiments, the cap <b>351</b> is sealed to the housing <b>103</b> after being positioned over the terminal post <b>107</b>. The positioning of various embodiments of the cap (<b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>, etc.) disclosed herein may be performed after terminal post weld (in other words, when bushing <b>119</b> and end strap <b>115</b> are joined to produce the terminal <b>107</b>) or after full battery formation, in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the cap <b>351</b> may be joined to the cover <b>105</b> by a joining process such as spin welding. As previously described, the cap may further comprise an overmolded ring <b>365</b> that can be heat sealed or laser welded to the cover <b>105</b>. Alternately, the electrically conductive cap <b>351</b> may have an adhesive at the base (or bottom) (e.g. <b>353</b>) which may then be attached to the surface of the battery cover <b>105</b>. Some combination of the above may also be used. In addition, for attachment, the cap <b>351</b> may first be heated, then pressed onto the terminal <b>107</b>. Also, torque ribs <b>359</b> in the heated cap <b>351</b> could be melted into the softer lead of the terminal <b>107</b> to make a robust connection.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a bushing or terminal <b>507</b> (for example, positive and negative terminals) could also be designed with some grooves which may key into torque ribs (for example, <b>359</b> and <b>459</b>) provided on the cap (<b>351</b>, <b>451</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows various embodiments of another electrically conductive terminal post cap or cover <b>451</b>. Again, the cap <b>451</b> may be comprised of a conductive material (for example, copper, however, further materials may be contemplated as within the scope of this disclosure). In various embodiments, the cap <b>451</b> may be slightly smaller in inner dimensions or diameter <b>467</b> compared to the battery terminal diameter <b>469</b> on which the cap <b>451</b> sits. In other words, in one or more examples of embodiments, the inner diameter of the cap (b) <b>467</b>, in various embodiments, may be smaller than a diameter of a terminal (a) <b>469</b>. This may provide a tight or friction fit of the cap on the terminal. In various embodiments, the cap <b>451</b> may fit onto the terminal by way of a thermal press-fit.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cap <b>451</b> further may further comprise a sealing ring <b>465</b> to be attached, for example, by welding into the surface of the battery housing cover <b>105</b>. The sealing ring <b>465</b> and ring detail <b>471</b> may aid in providing a tight connection to the housing <b>103</b>. The tight connection may aid in preventing exposure of lead of the terminal <b>107</b> to the environment. In other words, in various embodiments, the heated metal cap <b>451</b> may be pressed into the housing (which may, in various embodiments, comprise polypropylene) to weld to the housing with which ring <b>465</b> and ring detail <b>471</b> allow for a tight seal between the cap <b>451</b> and housing <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cap <b>451</b> may further comprise one or more small wings <b>459</b> for torque. A cross-section of the cap <b>451</b> having the wings <b>459</b> may be seen in as reference &#x201c;P&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Further, the cap <b>451</b> may comprise one or more horizontal structures to prevent removal of the cap <b>451</b>. In various embodiments, horizontal structures provided within the cap <b>451</b> may collide with the lead of the bushing <b>107</b> it covers when the metal cap <b>451</b> is pushed down for welding. Collision may not occur, for example, if the cap is heated such that the dimension is enlarged during insertion based on temperature elongation (thermal expansion and contraction) as described further herein. In addition, in various embodiments, the cap <b>451</b> may comprise a number of vertical wings or ribs inside of the cap in a way that when pressing the cap down the cap is slightly screwed into the bushing. A slight turn may, for example, assist in further seating the cap <b>451</b> on the terminal <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One or more examples of additional attachment mechanisms for use with a cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) as described herein will now be described. The cap may first be heated, then pressed onto the terminal. Thermal expansion and contraction by the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) may ensure a tight connection between the terminal <b>107</b> (post, bushing) and cap when the terminal <b>107</b> is pressed upon from above. In various embodiments, heating the cap (e.g. <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) may allow for forming of the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) into the lid <b>105</b>, for example, using a heat sealing ring (for example, <b>465</b>) on the cap for providing into the housing <b>103</b> or lid <b>105</b>, which may comprise polypropylene. In other words, the sealing ring (for example, <b>465</b>) may form into melted polypropylene or like material comprising the housing cover <b>105</b>. The heated cap may allow for melting of the lid <b>105</b> and sealing of the connection. In addition, the heated cap may allow for attachment to the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) to the terminal <b>107</b> by way of thermal expansion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) may comprise an undercut.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The lid <b>105</b> may be modified, in various embodiments, to accept the cap. For example, a depression may be provided in the lid to accept the cap. In various embodiments, the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) may &#x201c;dig into&#x201d; the lid or cover <b>105</b> material to facilitate a tight seal between the cap and housing cover.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The torque ribs <b>359</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> could also be included in other embodiments of the cap disclosed, for example, in the design described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and contribute fastening of that cap <b>451</b> to the terminal <b>107</b>. Torque ribs provided into a heated cap could likewise be formed into the softer lead (terminal <b>107</b>) to make a robust connection.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition to the examples described above, the cap (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>) may be attached to the terminal (for example, <b>107</b>, <b>507</b>) by a number of methods including welding, solder tin etc., pressure, torque ribs, and the like. The cap may be attached to the housing (e.g. polypropylene lid) by a number of methods including by heat, adhesive, glue, spin welding, heat sealing, laser welding, an overmolded ring at the cap (for example, an overmolded polypropylene ring), and the like. In various embodiments, the cap and cover <b>105</b> connection may comprise a pressure-sensitive adhesive.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Caps, such as those provided above (for example, <b>251</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>451</b>), may advantageously allow for attachment after battery formation. For example, whether the terminal is provided with a cap may be based on battery distribution. In one non-limiting example, providing the terminals of batteries with a cap may be made after formation but prior to a battery being shipped to a particular location. This allows for advantages in the manufacturing process. The disclosed cap has a number of additional advantages. The cap may facilitate additional acid tightness due to the sealing ring. The cap may allow for post-manufacturing attachment of a cap as necessary. The cap may allow for modifications to a bushing alloy. The cap may allow for reduced exposure to lead of existing and new batteries.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The caps described herein could be used with a modified battery terminal, in various examples of embodiments. As noted previously and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the bushing or terminal <b>107</b> could also be designed with some grooves <b>509</b> to produce bushing or terminal <b>507</b> which could key in to the torque ribs (for example <b>359</b>). In other words, in various embodiments, the bushings or terminal <b>507</b> may have grooves <b>509</b> which mate in various embodiments with torque ribs <b>359</b>. In general, it should be understood the terminal size or design (for example, <b>107</b>, <b>507</b>) may require modification to compensate for the thickness of the cap. In other words, resizing of the terminal due to increased thickness of the cap may be required in order to facilitate connection with standard-size electrical connectors.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a terminal <b>607</b>, according to various examples of embodiments. The terminal <b>607</b> may be understood to be comprised of a non-lead material (such as, but not limited to, brass, copper alloys, etc.) that is still highly conductive. The terminal <b>607</b> may be seen as attaching to the inner electrical path of a battery (for example, the terminal post <b>617</b> of a battery <b>101</b> (for example, a lead-acid battery)) through a cover <b>605</b>. The attachment may be made through a connector for example, a stud connector <b>621</b>. Other methods of connection, such as but not limited to, a sealed welding operation such as sonic or spin welding may be used. The interface between the bushing <b>607</b> and the terminal <b>617</b> may allow for sufficient area to achieve current-carrying requirements. The terminal <b>617</b> and associated components therefore may provide a lead-free interface for a stamped battery terminal connector in a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> may be seen to show another version of a terminal as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Again, the terminal <b>707</b> may be seen received by a bushing <b>719</b> molded into the cover <b>705</b>, facilitating connection to the inner electrical components of the battery by way of terminal <b>717</b>. The terminal <b>707</b> may be understood to be connected to the bushing <b>719</b> below an exposed surface of the cover <b>705</b>, resulting in no exposed lead while allowing connection to meet current-carrying requirements.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The various elements of the battery, the battery housing, the battery cover, and the cell containers may be made of a wide variety of materials as is well known in the art. For example, the cover, container, and/or various components may be made of any polymeric (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, a polypropylene containing material, etc.) or composite (e.g., glass-reinforced polymer) material. For example, the container may be made of polypropylene-containing material (e.g., pure polypropylene, co-polymers comprising polypropylene, polypropylene with additives, etc.). Such polymeric material is relatively resistant to degradation caused by acid (e.g., sulfuric acid) provided within cells of the container. The terminal posts, side terminals and connection members may be made of one or more conductive materials (e.g., lead or a material containing lead). Likewise, the strap members and end straps may be made of one or more conductive materials (e.g., lead or a material containing lead).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Known terminals may be comprised, in various embodiments, of a lead alloy. In various embodiments, this alloy may be a substantially pure lead and may, in various embodiments, include lead, tin, antimony, calcium, and combinations thereof. The alloy may, as a non-limiting example, be a lead tin alloy with a tin composition range of 1-4%, 1-2.25%, 1-1.5%, and the like. The lead may be virgin lead or high purity lead or highly purified secondary lead, in various examples of embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As utilized herein, the terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially&#x201d;, and similar terms are intended to have a broad meaning in harmony with the common and accepted usage by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter of this disclosure pertains.
