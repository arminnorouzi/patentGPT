The surgical assistance system is composed of a base unit and a robot mechanism. The robot mechanism has a support column, a first robot arm that is attached to the tip of the support column so as to be rotatable, a second robot arm that is attached to the tip of the first robot arm so as to be rotatable, and a device support that is attached to the tip of the second robot arm. The device support is configured to accommodate an endoscope or other medical tool or device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a medical robot, an arm unit holds a body to be held, such as an endoscope, a treatment tool, or a camera, and is driven and controlled thereby to place the held body at a desired position, and the held body performs an operation that is set. It is, however, often necessary to release the drive control of the arm unit to manually operate the arm unit, such as when making adjustments upon introduction of the held body into the patient's body or making detailed settings during treatment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to release such drive control, however, the practitioner has to move away from the arm unit and temporarily suspend the operation of the medical robot because the practitioner needs to operate the medical robot main body, that is, operate the release switch of the medical robot main body. In this regard, if the above release switch is provided on the arm unit, the practitioner can perform the release operation without moving away from the arm unit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, a master-slave type system is being adopted, which is composed of a master machine operated by the practitioner and a robot as a slave machine that operates under the control by the master machine. In such a system, in addition to the practitioner who operates the master machine, an assistant who assists the operation of the slave machine placed away from the master machine is in charge. In such a system, the assistant needs to work while moving around the medical robot or the surgical table, and even if the release switch is provided on the arm unit, the assistant has to move, for example, around the surgical table for the operation of the release switch. In addition, it is often difficult to change the placement of each part of the medical robot during the treatment due to the relationship between each part of the robot and the diseased site of the patient on the surgical table. In such a case, there is a problem in that the operation of the release switch will be difficult because the posture of the assistant who operates the switch is limited.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, in recent medical robots and surgical systems including medical robots, there may be employed a configuration in which the arm unit, the main body, etc. are arranged so as to be close to each other in a smaller size than before or a configuration in which a plurality of arm units is arranged so as to be close to each other. In such a configuration, the practitioner or assistant cannot take a free posture because there are adjacent members or the like in the way, and the operation of the release switch may be difficult. Furthermore, a peripheral device may incidentally contact the above release switch to release the drive control of the arm unit or cause the arm unit to return from the release state to the drive control state.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is an aspect to provide a medical robot including a selector switch that selectively switches between a control state in which the driving of an arm unit is controlled and a manual state in which control by a control unit is released, wherein the medical robot allows a practitioner or an assistant to operate the selector switch in a short time regardless of the posture of the medical robot or the ambient environment and can prevent the selector switch from operating due to contact with an adjacent member or an erroneous operation by the practitioner or the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to some embodiments, there is provided a medical robot that includes an arm unit, a control unit, a holding body, and a selector switch. The control unit controls driving of the arm unit. The holding body is connected to the arm unit at a connection portion and holds a held body. The selector switch is provided on the holding body for selectively switching between a control state in which the driving of the arm unit is controlled by the control unit and a manual state in which control by the control unit is released. The selector switch is disposed on at least one of both sides of a reference plane including an extending direction of the arm unit and an extending direction of the held body. The control unit performs control of switching between the control state and the manual state based on an operation signal from the selector switch.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to various embodiments, the selector switch may be provided on the holding body so as to be located on the opposite side to the held body with respect to the connection portion in the extending direction of the held body.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to various embodiments, the selector switch may be provided with a prevention section that prevents the switching between the control state and the manual state due to contact with an interfering body located around the selector switch.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to various embodiments, the prevention section may be achieved by the selector switch, and the selector switch may be configured to: output a control signal for the control unit to switch from the control state to the manual state when the selector switch is pressed inside the holding body; and output a control signal for the control unit to return from the manual state to the control state when pressing of the selector switch is released.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to various embodiments, the prevention section may be achieved by the selector switch, and the selector switch may be configured to output a control signal for the control unit to switch between the control state and the manual state each time the selector switch is pressed inside the holding body.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to various embodiments, the selector switch may be a switch that operates when pressed for a predetermined time or longer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to various embodiments, the selector switch may have a first selector switch provided on one side of the reference plane and a second selector switch provided on the other side, and the control unit may switch between the control state and the manual state based on the operation signal from one of the first selector switch and the second selector switch.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to various embodiments, the control unit may be configured to: provided that the control of switching from the control state to the manual state is carried out based on the operation signal output from the first selector switch, carry out the control of returning from the manual state to the control state when another version of the operation signal output from the first selector switch is input; and provided that the control of switching from the control state to the manual state is carried out based on the operation signal output from the second selector switch, carry out the control of returning from the manual state to the control state when another version of the operation signal output from the second selector switch is input.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to various embodiments, the holding body may include a rotation mechanism that enables the held body to rotate relative to the holding body about the extending direction of the held body.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to various embodiments, the selector switch may be provided so that the relative position with respect to the holding body is kept when the held body is rotating relative to the holding body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to various embodiments, the medical robot may include at least one second arm unit in addition to a first arm unit as the arm unit provided with the holding body on which the selector switch is provided, and the interfering body preferably includes the second arm unit located around the first arm unit.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to various embodiments, the second arm unit may be provided with a holding body and a selector switch equivalent to the holding body and the selector switch for the first arm unit, respectively.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to various embodiments, a medical robot may allow a practitioner himself/herself or an assistant to operate the selector switch in a short time and that can prevent the selector switch from operating due to contact with an adjacent member or an erroneous operation by the practitioner or the like. In a master-slave type system or a surgical robot having a complicated configuration, the medical robot can be provided in which the selector switch can be easily operated without imposing a heavy burden on the practitioner or assistant even when the approach to the selector switch is limited due to the posture of the robot's arm unit or the relationship with a peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, the medical robot according to one or more embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a configuration as a part of a medical robot <b>10</b> in which a holding body <b>30</b> is provided on an arm <b>21</b> of an arm unit <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the holding body <b>30</b> as viewed from the front upper side, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the holding body <b>30</b> as viewed from the rear lower side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an enlarged view of the rear part of the holding body <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an enlarged view of the rear part of the holding body <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Examples of the held body may further include a camera capable of capturing images of the appearance of the patient's diseased site or the like without inserting the camera into the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> are provided at the right and left positions, respectively, on the rear upper part of the main body portion <b>31</b> of the holding body <b>30</b>. In the main body portion <b>31</b>, these two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> may be provided at positions corresponding to each other in the up-down direction (Z<b>1</b>-Z<b>2</b> direction) and the front-rear direction (X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction) and are arranged so as to form a pair.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, for example, when operating the main body portion <b>31</b> which faces approximately downward, the practitioner can press the first selector switch <b>41</b> or the second selector switch <b>42</b> with a fingertip F to operate it while touching/holding the main body portion <b>31</b> with the palm and/or fingers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a state in which the practitioner performs the operation with the right index finger F while holding the main body portion <b>31</b> from the side with the right palm and the like, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates a state in which the practitioner performs the operation with the left index finger F while holding the main body portion <b>31</b> from the side with the left palm and the like. Thus, the practitioner can perform the operation with any of the right and left hands depending on the availability of his/her both hands and the distance from a peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, the practitioner operates the main body portion <b>31</b> in an approximately horizontal state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates a state in which the practitioner performs the operation with the left thumb F while holding the main body portion <b>31</b> from below the side with the left fingers, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates a state in which the practitioner performs the operation with the right index figure F while holding the main body portion <b>31</b> from below with the right palm and the like. Thus, the practitioner can perform the operation while holding the main body portion <b>31</b> from below depending on the orientation of the main body portion <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the practitioner holds from above the side the main body portion <b>31</b> which is in an approximately horizontal state. By providing the two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> in a predetermined range on the rear upper part of the main body portion <b>31</b>, the main body portion <b>31</b> in an approximately horizontal state as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> can be held from different directions. Thus, the degree of freedom in the posture during the operation is increased, and the most well-balanced holding position can be arbitrarily selected in relation to the support position by the connection portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the arm unit <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are arranged so that a reference plane S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is interposed therebetween. More specifically, when the reference plane S is defined as a plane that includes a first direction D<b>1</b> in which the arm <b>21</b> of the arm unit <b>20</b> extends and a second direction D<b>2</b> (front-rear direction) in which the held body attached to the holder <b>32</b> extends, that is, a plane that is orthogonal to the right-left direction (Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> direction) and passes the holding body <b>30</b> at the center in the right-left direction, the first selector switch <b>41</b> is disposed on one side of the reference plane S while the second selector switch <b>42</b> is disposed on the other side of the reference plane S. Thus, the two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are arranged at respective positions symmetrical with respect to the reference plane S.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are provided so as to be located on the opposite side to the holder <b>32</b> and the held body with respect to the connection portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>in the extending direction of the held body (X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction). Through this configuration, when in the manual state, it is easy to balance with the weight of the held body located on the front side, and the rotating operation can be easily performed, which is centered on the first axis of rotation AX<b>1</b> with the connection portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>as a fulcrum.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When one of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> is pressed inside the main body portion <b>31</b>, an operation signal is output to the controller <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). When a predetermined time (e.g., 1 second) or more has elapsed from the start of pressing the selector switch, the controller <b>51</b> starts outputting to the drive unit <b>52</b> a control signal for switching from the control state to the manual state, and while this control signal is being output, the output of a drive signal from the drive unit <b>52</b> to the arm unit <b>20</b> is stopped, and the arm unit <b>20</b> is in a state in which it can be manually operated. That is, on the basis of the operation signal from one of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b>, the controller <b>51</b> selectively switches between the control state in which the driving of the arm unit <b>20</b> is controlled and the manual state in which the control by the controller <b>51</b> is released.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, the control state is switched to the manual state only when the selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> is pressed for a predetermined time or longer, and the selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> thereby serves as a prevention section that prevents the switching between the control state and the manual state due to contact with an interfering body located around the selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, the state can be switched by pressing or releasing only one of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b>; therefore, even when another arm unit or other member is located in the vicinity of any of the selector switches, the other selector switch can be visually recognized and operated, and the state can thus be changed reliably.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the pressing of the pressed selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> is released, the controller <b>51</b> outputs a control signal to the drive unit <b>52</b> to switch from the manual state to the control state and executes the control of returning from the manual state to the control state. The drive unit <b>52</b> switched to the control state drives each arm of the arm unit or units <b>20</b> in response to the control signal from the controller <b>51</b>. The control by the controller <b>51</b> may include not only changing the posture and position of each arm, but also keeping the changed posture and position. On the other hand, in the manual state, the output of the control signal from the controller <b>51</b> to the drive unit <b>52</b> is stopped, and the practitioner can freely change the posture and position of each arm.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, each of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> has an operation surface in a rectangular shape and is formed so as to protrude outward from the surface of the main body portion <b>31</b>. Around these selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, rectangular frame portions <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>a </i>may be respectively provided so as to surround the selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> with a certain gap from each four sides. These frame portions <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>a </i>may also be formed so as to protrude outward from the surface of the main body portion <b>31</b>, and the amount of protrusion thereof is approximately the same as the amount of protrusion of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Therefore, while the practitioner can press the first selector switch <b>41</b> or the second selector switch <b>42</b> with his/her fingertip, even if an interfering body is liable to come into contact with any of the two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, the prior contact with the frame portion <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>a </i>can prevent the selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> from being pressed. Examples of such an interfering body include those other than the arm unit (first arm unit) which supports the holding body <b>30</b> provided with these switches, for example, one or more arm units (second arm units) arranged around the first arm unit or a member associated with the one or more arm units (second arm units), and an interfering body such as another member of the medical robot. Thus, erroneous switching between the control state and the manual state can be prevented. That is, the frame portion <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>a </i>serves as a prevention section that prevents the switching between the control state and the manual state due to contact with an interfering body located around the selector switch <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The holding body <b>30</b> has the built-in motor <b>53</b> as a rotation mechanism that enables the holder <b>32</b> to rotate relative to the main body portion <b>31</b> of the holding body <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The motor <b>53</b> rotates the holder <b>32</b> about its central axis (axis along the second direction D<b>2</b>) in response to the control signal from the controller <b>51</b>. This allows the held body, which is held by the holder <b>32</b>, to rotate relative to the holding body <b>30</b> about the central axis along the extending direction of the held body (direction along the second direction D<b>2</b>). When the holder <b>32</b> is rotating, the holding body <b>30</b> keeps its posture and position, and the two selector switches <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> also keep their relative positions with respect to the holding body <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A modified example will be described below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, when one of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> is pressed for a predetermined time or longer, the control state may be switched to the manual state while when the pressing is released, the manual state is returned to the control state, but the switching of the state is not limited to this. For example, the control state and the manual state may be selectively switched each time one or both of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> are pressed. This configuration enables quick switching between the states, and any of the states can be maintained even if the hand is released from the selector switch or switches.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the switching between the control state and the manual state may be performed only when both the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> are operated at the same time. This configuration can prevent the state from changing due to erroneous contact with one of the two selector switches.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Another configuration including a regulating unit may also be possible. In this configuration, a sensor that detects that a surrounding arm unit or other interfering body approaches within a predetermined distance may be provided on the surface of the main body portion <b>31</b> as a prevention section that prevents switching between the control state and the manual state due to contact with an interfering body located around the holding body <b>30</b>, and when the sensor detects the approach of an interfering body, the regulating unit regulates the operation of the selector switch.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the arrangement of the first selector switch <b>41</b> and the second selector switch <b>42</b> is not limited to the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a second selector switch <b>142</b> may be displaced forward (X<b>1</b> side) from the first selector switch <b>41</b> so that the positions of the two switches <b>41</b> and <b>142</b> are displaced from each other in the front-rear direction (X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction). By arranging the switches asymmetrically in this way, it is possible to perform the treatment efficiently depending on the orientation of the holding body <b>30</b>, the orientation of the treatment tool or other held body, the positional relationship with another arm unit or another peripheral device, the orientation of the practitioner's hand holding the holding body <b>30</b>, the dominant hand of the practitioner, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Various embodiments have been described above with reference to the drawings.
