These byproducts may accumulate within the power tool and may eventually compromise operation of the mechanical components of the power tool. In addition, these by products may escape from the power tool and contaminate the work environment with debris. It is desirable to reduce dust pollution from such power tools.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some aspects, a power tool may include a table top that defines a work surface, and a blade that is mounted near the work surface so as to cut a work piece that is supported on the work surface. For example, in the example in which the power tool is a table saw, the blade may protrude through the work surface and be actuated by a motor assembly that is disposed below the work surface. A dust management assembly provides an enclosure that is mounted to the motor assembly, collects dust and debris generated during cutting operations of the power tool, and directs the dust and debris away from the blade while avoiding pollution of the tool environment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The dust management assembly includes a blade cover that surrounds a portion of the blade, a dust port that is detachably connected to an open lower end of the blade cover, and a dust shield that cooperates with the blade cover to direct cutting debris to the dust port. The blade cover, dust shield and dust port provide the enclosure which surrounds portions of the blade below the work surface. The dust management assembly is shaped and dimensioned to have close proximity to the blade and to minimize volume of the chamber around the lower portion of the blade.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, the dust management assembly forms a channel around the blade and includes a declining, curved bottom or floor that directs debris to the dust port and provides improved evacuation of debris through the dust port. By this configuration, the enclosure has a small volume and good air flow that is generated by the blade rotation and includes additional air flow exhausted from the motor assembly. The combination of small volume and good air flow results in efficient and reliable evacuation of dust from the enclosure. Since the dust management assembly is mounted to the motor assembly, the dust management assembly moves with the blade between high and low blade positions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further advantage of providing a small enclosure is that the dust management assembly uses less materials and is lighter in weight than some known dust management devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The dust management assembly is supported on the motor assembly, and therefore moves with the motor assembly and blade from side to side along with any bevel angle adjustment, and up and down along with any blade height adjustment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The dust port is selectively detachable from the blade cover, which allows for access to the interior of the enclosure and simplifies cleaning.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The dust shield overlies openings between the blade cover and the table top, preventing access to the blade and ensuring closure of the enclosure to minimize dust pollution in the environment of the table saw. This arrangement is particularly advantageous for power tools that are cabinet-free and instead are supported by legs or other supports that do not fully enclose the space below the work surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some aspects, a power tool includes a table top having a work surface disposed on a first side of the table top, and a table top second surface disposed on a second side of the table top, the first and second sides being on opposite sides of the table top. The table top has a blade opening that extends between the work surface and the table top second surface. The power tool includes a rigid undercarriage that is supported on the table top second surface, and a motor assembly that includes a motor and is supported on the undercarriage in such a way that the motor assembly is movable, relative to the undercarriage, between a first position and a second position. The power tool includes a blade, which is driven by the motor to rotate about a rotational axis. The blade extends through the blade opening. In addition, the power tool includes a dust management assembly that is secured to, and moves in concert with, the motor assembly. The dust management assembly includes a blade cover that is fixed to the motor assembly and surrounds a portion of the blade that is disposed on the second side of the table top, a dust shield that is pivotably connected to the table top second surface in such a way that an inner surface of the dust shield faces toward an outer wall of the blade cover, and a dust port that is detachably connected to the blade cover and is configured collect debris generated by a cutting action of the blade.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the motor assembly and the dust management assembly are disposed on opposite sides of the undercarriage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the blade extends through the blade opening in such a way that a first blade surface faces toward a first portion of the blade opening and a second blade surface faces toward a second portion of the blade opening.

In addition, the first pair of parallel edges are configured to engage with, and translate relative to, the second pair of parallel edges.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the blade cover comprises an inner wall disposed between the blade and the undercarriage, the inner wall being parallel to a first surface of the blade, and an outer wall disposed on a side of the blade that is opposite the undercarriage. The outer wall is angled relative to the first surface of the blade.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the blade comprises a curved periphery, and the blade cover includes a first side wall disposed on a side of the blade corresponding to a cutting edge of the blade.

The blade cover <b>32</b>, the dust shield <b>50</b> and the dust port <b>60</b> cooperate to enclose the portion of the blade <b>14</b> that is disposed below the table top <b>2</b>, whereby the dust management assembly <b>30</b> serves as a barrier that prevents access to the blade from the second side of the table top <b>2</b>. In addition, the dust management assembly <b>30</b> is shaped and dimensioned to have close proximity to the blade <b>14</b> and to minimize volume of the enclosure <b>31</b> around the lower portion of the blade <b>14</b>. Due the shape of the resulting enclosure <b>31</b>, and air flow generated due to blade rotation in the enclosure <b>31</b>, the debris is contained in the enclosure <b>31</b> and efficiently discharged from the dust port <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>19</b></figref>, the blade cover <b>32</b> is a generally tubular structure having four sides <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and opposed open ends <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>.
