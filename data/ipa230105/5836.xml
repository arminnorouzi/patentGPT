Recently in semiconductor memory devices such as dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), static RAMs (SRAMs), flash memories, increased memory capacity has been desired. To increase memory capacity while maintaining or reducing chip size, areas for compensation capacitors for memory cells has been limited. Thus, some compensation capacitors may be disposed in the back-end-of-line (BEOL). For example, the compensation capacitors may be metal-in-metal (MIM) capacitors including an insulating film of high-k material having a high dielectric constant as compared to silicon dioxide (SiO2).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Memory cells of memory devices can experience defects leading to errors and/or failures. Some electrically active defects in interfaces, such as silicon(Si)/silicon dioxide(SiO2), are considered to be major factors of leakage currents and degradation of refresh rates. Supplying hydrogen to the interfaces of the memory cells may deactivate the defects by saturating dangling bonds of amorphous silicon. High temperature annealing in hydrogen-nitrogen (H2-N2) ambient has been commonly used to supply hydrogen in a later stage of the BEOL. However, the high temperature annealing in the BEOL may affect characteristics of transistors fabricated in the front-end-of-line (FEOL), which is not desirable. The high temperature annealing in the BEOL may cause leakage currents of the capacitive membrane of capacitors in the FEOL. Furthermore, increased hydrogen in and around the high-k material in the compensation capacitors may cause leakage currents in the compensation capacitors in the BEOL due to chemical reduction of the high-k material. Thus, structures or methods that provide hydrogen to the memory cells while suppressing excess hydrogen around the compensation capacitors in the BEOL are desired.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a semiconductor memory device including a memory cell region and a peripheral region in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure a portion of the memory in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a capacitor of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a portion of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of a structure of a capacitor of the memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various embodiments of the present disclosure will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
