In addition, the material can easily be applied to an object via the cartridges, provided that the cartridge is inserted into a corresponding dispensing device. The material can be applied precisely using the dispensing device. For example, a rod of the ejection device presses against a base of the cartridge, as a result of which the volume of the cartridge is compressed, such that the material located in the cartridge is pressed out of an opening. An attachment or a head part is attached to the cartridge so that the material can be applied to the object in a controlled and precise manner.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cartridges are known from practice which are designed having an inherently non-rigid film pouch and an inherently rigid insert. The film pouch has a cylindrical wall and a base part, the insert being connected to the film pouch at an end remote from the base part. The insert is annular and has a circular opening closed by a cover, through which opening the chamber can be filled with the material. The cover is connected to the insert in a welding process. In a subsequent step, the insert is connected to the head part in an adhesion process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, producing such a cartridge is disadvantageously complex.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to provide a method for producing a cartridge by means of which the cartridge can be produced easily. A further object of the invention is to provide a cartridge that is easy to produce.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object is achieved by the subject matter of the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments relating to the subject matter of the independent claims can be found in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method is proposed for producing a cartridge for a dispensing device by means of the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">providing a film pouch which comprises a chamber and has an opening, a head part and an inherently rigid insert having a passage,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">connecting the insert to the film pouch,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">filling the chamber with a composition through the passage,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">closing the passage by means of a cover.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">According to the invention, the insert is connected to the head part in a welding process, the welding process being carried out by introducing heat into the cover.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">A cartridge can be produced simply and cost-effectively using a method according to the invention, since the head part can be connected to the insert in a structurally simple manner by means of a welding device. A connection of the insert to the head part achieved in this way can be implemented in a particularly safe and stable manner, such that damage or leakage in this region is reliably prevented. The insert and the head part each have, in mutually facing regions, in particular an interacting and substantially diametrically opposed contour, the cover that is arranged in the region of the contours being weldable. In this way, when the head part is connected to the insert, the cover can also be connected to the insert, preferably in the same step.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">The head part allows the cartridge to be inserted into commercially available dispensing devices, such that the cartridge can be dispensed in a controlled manner when the composition in the chamber is applied to an appropriate object.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">In a simple and cost-effective embodiment of a method according to the invention, the insert is connected to the head part in an induction welding process. The connection of the head part to the insert is preferably contactless, for example carried out in a high-frequency welding process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">A welding tool for carrying out the welding process is preferably guided from a side of the film pouch facing away from the head part over the film pouch in the direction of the insert and the head part. The welding tool engages around the film pouch and the corresponding contours of the insert and the head part, preferably on the outside.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">In an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, the welding tool is guided around a single film pouch in order to connect the insert associated with this film pouch to the head part. In particular, in a first step, a film pouch is first connected to the head part via the insert and, if necessary, in a second step, a second film pouch is connected to the head part via the insert. As a result, the individual film pouches can be connected using different, individually adapted welding parameters. This is particularly advantageous if differently designed covers are used for the individual film pouches.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">In an embodiment of the method according to the invention that can be carried out quickly and cost-effectively, the welding tool is guided around at least two film pouches together in order to connect the inserts associated with the two film pouches to the head part. If a gap between the two chambers is not welded, this method is particularly suitable when using more viscous filling media. However, it is also possible for the space between the two chambers to be welded.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">In an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, a defined predetermined breaking region is produced in the region of the cover. The predetermined breaking region of the cover can be produced, for example, before the production of the film pouch, after the production of the film pouch, or during the production of the film pouch. The predetermined breaking region is preferably introduced into the cover only after the composition has been filled into the chamber and the chamber has been closed by the cover. In this respect, for example, material of the cover is removed from an outer face facing away from the chamber in order to form the predetermined breaking region. However, the predetermined breaking region can also be produced before the cover is attached to the chamber. This also results in the possibility of forming the predetermined breaking region on a lower face of the cover facing the chamber or of forming two opposing predetermined breaking regions on the lower and upper faces.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">In an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, the film pouch has a film tube and a base part, the film tube preferably being formed by welding or gluing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">In an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, the predetermined breaking region of the cover is produced by means of a laser, a material weakening by hot stamping or by thermal stamping with a heated stamp, by scoring with a suitable cutting tool or knife, or during a process of welding the cover to the insert. In this way, it can be easily achieved that the predetermined breaking region has, in particular, a different material thickness and/or strength than further regions of the cover, and a defined predetermined breaking region is thereby formed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">When producing the predetermined breaking region during the welding process of the cover to the insert, in order to achieve the predetermined breaking region preferably at least one welding parameter is varied in relation to the connection of the cover to the insert in further regions and, for example, a higher pressure, an increased temperature or an extended welding duration or a combination of these parameters is used. The predetermined breaking region is thus produced in the immediate vicinity of the weld seam or in the weld seam itself.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">In an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, the insert has at least one material extension, in particular a material extension surrounding the passage, which melts during the closure of the passage. The tightness is improved as a result, since an integral bond of the insert with the cover can be ensured due to the melt. The material extension can surround the passage of the insert. It functions as the intended melting point of the insert, such that a high quality cover is provided and no composition can escape from the chamber through the opening.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In addition, in an advantageous embodiment of a method according to the invention, a second film pouch having a chamber may be provided. The second film pouch can be designed analogously to the first film pouch and connected to the head part. The connection is preferably carried out by means of gluing or welding. Accordingly, a multi-component packaging or cartridge can be produced in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">It is possible for a different cover to be provided for the various chambers.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">In order to be able to ensure that the chambers are opened as synchronously as possible during the process of dispensing the cartridge, the covers of the various chambers can have differently designed predetermined breaking regions, for example different notches.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">A cartridge for a dispensing device produced using such a method is also proposed, the cartridge having at least one inherently non-rigid, elongate film pouch, which has a chamber for receiving a composition, having a head part for interacting with the film pouch and having an inherently rigid insert, the insert being connected to the film pouch on a side facing the head part and having a passage closed by a cover.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">According to the invention, the insert and the head part each have, in mutually facing regions, an interacting and substantially diametrically opposed contour, the cover that is arranged in the region of the contours being weldable.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">The technical advantages described in connection with the proposed method for producing a cartridge apply analogously to a cartridge designed according to the invention, A cartridge designed according to the invention is therefore advantageously easy to produce; the cover can preferably not only be connected to the insert in a welding process, but the insert can alternatively or additionally also be connected to the head part by means of the cover by means of a welding process. A welding tool provided for this purpose preferably has a cylindrical recess substantially corresponding to the film pouch and can be guided around the film pouch in the direction of the insert from a side facing away from the head part, the welding tool being designed to heat the cover at least in the region of the contours of the insert and the head part such that the insert can be welded to the head part by means of the cover. The welding tool engages around the particular film pouch preferably on the outside.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">An &#x201c;inherently rigid component&#x201d; is understood to mean a component that retains its shape if it is removed from a device. Such a component is also referred to as inherently stable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">In an advantageous embodiment of a cartridge according to the invention, the contours of the insert and of the head part each have two surfaces arranged at an angle to one another. In this case, the stability of a connection between the insert and the head part is advantageously high.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">The connection between the insert and the head part is particularly stable due to the favorable force ratios present when the surfaces of the insert and the head part are arranged substantially perpendicularly to one another.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">Likewise, the cover can rest against at least two surfaces of the stepped raised elevation that are, for example, substantially perpendicular to one another. In this way, the cover can also be fastened in a stable manner to the insert on the lower face and in the receptacle of the head part on the upper face. Furthermore, this also reduces the leakage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">A stable connection of the head part to the insert can be achieved if the insert has a stepped raised portion on its side facing the head part, via which raised portion the insert is received in a receptacle of the head part, which is provided for the arrangement of the insert. It is possible that the stepped raised portion of the insert protrudes from the film pouch. The raised portion allows stable receiving of the insert in the receptacle of the head part. This also improves the tightness during operation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the cover has a predetermined breaking region. This provides a cover that is easy to use. On the one hand, the cover securely closes the film pouch and prevents unwanted leakage of the material in the chamber out of the chamber. On the other hand, the cover allows a simple and safe and, in particular, defined opening in order to be able to deliver the composition located in the chamber. The opening properties are improved by the predetermined breaking region, in particular when the cartridge is used in a dispensing device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">Due to the predetermined breaking region in the cover, the cartridge can be opened in a dispensing device in particular in a defined manner with comparatively low forces. At the same time, the cover can be designed, in a simple manner, to be stable so as to reliably prevent self-opening of the cartridge, for example if it accidentally falls down. By means of the cover, leakage of the composition located in the cartridge can also be very slightly or completely prevented in a simple manner and, in particular, can be significantly reduced in comparison with known cartridges.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">The cover is designed in particular as a film; alternatively, it can also be designed in the form of a plate; for example, and represent a plastics plate, for example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The predetermined breaking region can easily have any shape and, depending on the application, can be, for example, round, oval, square, rectangular, angular or linear or have a combination of these shapes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">In an advantageous embodiment of a cartridge according to the invention, the cover has, in the predetermined breaking region, a defined material discontinuity at least in regions, in particular in an entire planar region, in comparison with a further region of the cover. The cover has a simple design and can be produced cost-effectively, thus allowing the cover to be opened reliably and in a defined manner in the predetermined breaking region. The defined material discontinuity can be formed, for example, by the cover having, in the predetermined breaking region, an increased or reduced material thickness at least in regions in comparison with a further region of the cover. This allows the cover to be opened reliably and in a defined manner in the predetermined breaking region. Such a cover can also be produced easily and cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The predetermined breaking region of the cover can also have a different material strength from a further region of the cover. This also allows the cover to be opened reliably and in a defined manner in the predetermined breaking region.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">A further region of the cover is understood here to be a region of the cover that is not associated with the predetermined breaking region and extends outside the defined predetermined breaking region. In the further region of the cover, there are preferably substantially constant material properties.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">In an advantageous embodiment of a cartridge according to the invention which is particularly cost-effective to produce, the predetermined breaking region of the cover is delimited by a linear material weakening. The linear material weakening encompasses the predetermined breaking region in particular completely and thus separates the predetermined breaking region from the further region of the cover. The linear material weakening can be both a continuous, in particular uniform, material weakening as well as a perforation, the material thickness or the material strength of the linear material weakening being both less and greater than the material thickness of the further region of the cover.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In order to be able to achieve a defined opening of the cover in the state of use, in an advantageous embodiment of the invention the predetermined breaking region of the cover can have a defined different material strength from a further region of the cover. A different strength or a different material structure from that in the further region of the cover can be provided in the predetermined breaking region, completely or in a region encompassing the predetermined breaking region in a linear manner. This can be achieved, for example, by the action of temperature, in particular by means of laser or energetic radiation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">The predetermined breaking region of the cover can preferably have a notch that is star-shaped, cross-shaped, in line form, circular, semicircular or the like. The special geometry of the notch makes it possible to adjust the pressure required to open the cartridge. In addition, the shape and spatial arrangement of the notch can influence the opening characteristics.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the insert is conical on a side facing the head part. In this way, a cartridge can be provided in a structurally simple manner, in which cartridge a cover connected to the insert can be easily and securely attached to the insert under all conditions and securely holds on the insert. Furthermore, undesired peeling or shearing off and/or damage to the cover, which is designed as a film, for example, is reliably prevented because of the favorable introduction of force. Due to the conical design of the insert, in the event of a pressure increase in the chamber before opening, a notch effect in the connection region of the cover to the insert is low and the cover is reliably opened in the region of the predetermined breaking point when the cover or film expands by applying pressure during a dispensing process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">It has been found to be particularly advantageous if a surface of the insert facing the head part encloses an angle between 10&#xb0; and 50&#xb0; with a horizontal perpendicular to a central axis of the film pouch, with a region of the surface facing the central axis being at a greater distance from a base part of the film pouch than a region of the surface facing away from the central axis. The angle particularly preferably has a value between 15&#xb0; and 35&#xb0;, in particular approximately 25&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">In order to be able to fill the film pouch particularly quickly and to safely allow the air present in the film pouch to escape, the insert can have at least one ventilation opening independent of the passage and/or at least one ventilation slot independent of the passage. The passage is in particular circular and, when the film pouch is being filled, is preferably at least approximately close to a filling tube of a filling device. Air located in the chamber of the film pouch can easily escape through the ventilation opening and/or the ventilation slot. After the filling process, the ventilation opening and/or the ventilation slot can be closed in particular in a sealing manner by the cover, so that the composition located in the chamber is sealingly enclosed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">Alternatively or in addition, the passage of the insert can have at least one ventilation notch in a region facing the central axis of the film pouch, such that during a filling process of the film pouch by means of a filling device, which has a filling tube having a circular cross-section, air located in the chamber of the film pouch can escape through the ventilation notches directly along the filling tube.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">Both the provision of the ventilation opening or the ventilation slot and the provision of ventilation notches prevent the occurrence of high pressures during a filling process, as a result of which the filling process can be carried out cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">A plurality of ventilation openings and/or ventilation slots are preferably provided, which are in particular uniformly distributed around the circumference of the insert.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">In an embodiment of the invention that is structurally simple to produce, the ventilation openings have a substantially circular cross-section. The ventilation slots are preferably arranged substantially concentrically to a central axis of the insert.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">The ventilation notches can have a substantially rectangular, triangular, curved or comparable shape.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The film pouch can preferably be formed by a cylindrical film tube which is closed at the bottom by a base part, the base part being in particular glued and/or welded to the film tube. The film tube, also called tubular film or blown film, can be made of a thermoplastic material, and the film tube can be extruded or welded or glued at its longitudinal seam. Since the base part is in particular glued and/or welded, this produces an integral bond, which improves the storage properties of the cartridge, such that a leakage rate of the cartridge is reduced compared to a cartridge in which a film pouch is closed by a clip closure.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">The head part of the cartridge represents a type of adapter, since the head part allows commercially available attachments or standardized dispensing devices to be used to apply the composition located in the cartridge. The insert, which optionally partially protrudes beyond the film pouch, thus represents an interface to the head part.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">In an embodiment, the head part has an outlet nozzle that is in fluid connection with the receptacle. The outlet nozzle can define the flow rate. In particular via its diameter.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">It is possible that the outlet nozzle has a thread. Commercially available attachments or dispensing devices for applying the composition located in the cartridge can be attached to the head part precisely at an outlet opening of the outlet nozzle by means of the thread, thus making it possible to precisely position and dose the composition during application.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The outlet nozzle can also have a partition which divides the volume into two or more outlet channels. The relative position of the partition in the outlet nozzle defines the cross-sections of the outlet channels and thus the flow rates through these outlet channels.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">The outlet channels can have different diameters. The outlet channels can be oriented coaxially with respect to one another.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">The head part can thus be suitable for receiving several film pouches which can have different compositions. The head part separates the different compositions up to the outlet opening, such that the different compositions can come into contact only after the outlet opening. This is important in the case of two-component adhesives, for example.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The cartridge can thus receive different compositions and serve as a multi-component packaging. The different diameters of the outlet openings make it possible to set a special mixing ratio for the different compositions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">The compositions located in the cartridge can be a chemical composition or a liquid, for example components of a two-component mixture.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">Sealing compounds, multi-component mortars, multi-component coating compounds, multi-component paints, multi-component foam precursors, multi-component adhesives, multi-component sealing compounds and multi-component lubricants can be stored in the corresponding cartridges.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">The receptacle of the head part can be assigned an expansion space into which the cover can expand. The expansion space makes it possible to open the cover in a controlled manner, so that it does not hinder the flow of the outflowing composition. On the one hand, this results in a laminar flow, since there are no obstacles in the flow path that could result in a turbulent flow. On the other hand, this ensures that the flow rate is precisely maintained, which is important for the mixing ratio of two or more components.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">In one embodiment, the passage is tapered. As a result, the passage acts like a confusor or a nozzle when the composition flows out. The tapered passage can also act as a diffuser when the film pouch is filled.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">The passage can in particular be adapted to a filling cone of the composition located in the chamber. This makes it possible to optimally fill the chamber with a composition so that little or no air is left in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">In an embodiment, the cartridge has at least one second, elongate film pouch which is inherently non-rigid and has a chamber for receiving a composition. The cartridge can thus be used as a multi-component packaging. A resin, for example an epoxy resin, and a curing agent for a two-component adhesive can thus be stored in the same packaging.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">The second film pouch can have the same length as the first film pouch, in which case a ratio of the bases of the film pouches determines a mixing ratio to be achieved. As an alternative to this, it is also possible for two film pouches to be used which have different lengths.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">The base part can be made of a plastics material, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and/or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS). It is possible for the base part to be manufactured by injection molding, 3D printing or machining. It can also consist of a pre-formed mono- or multilayer film. It is possible that the base part is formed from the same or a comparable material as the cover. This makes it possible for the base part to be manufactured cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">The film pouch can comprise a mono- or multilayer film. The total layer thickness is 50 to 350 &#x3bc;m, in particular 80 to 150 &#x3bc;m. The materials used can be PE, PP, PET, aluminum, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyamides (PA), and/or polylactides (PLA). A coating with silicon oxide or aluminum oxide can also be provided for each layer. The multilayer film can be produced by adhesive or extrusion lamination.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">The film pouch can preferably be evenly collapsed during a dispensing process, similar to an accordion, so that the entire composition in the chamber can be used as far as possible. When in use, the film pouch is exposed to chemical compositions or liquids which can sometimes act on the film pouch. An exact structure of the film pouch must therefore sometimes be adapted to the composition in the chamber or to the liquid in the chamber, in particular to the corresponding material properties.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">The cover can preferably be designed as a multilayer film.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">For example, the cover has a PE and/or a PP layer on the upper and lower sides so that it can be welded, for example thermally welded, to other plastics parts of the cartridge. The film can also have layers made of PVC, especially if other plastics parts of the cartridge are made of PVC.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">A barrier layer can be provided between an upper face and a lower face of the cover, which layer, for example, prevents oxygen or water vapor from entering the chamber after it has been closed by the cover. This can reliably prevent outgassing of the composition located in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">The total thickness of the cover can be between 50 &#x3bc;m and 350 &#x3bc;m. In particular, the total thickness is between 130 &#x3bc;m and 250 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">The barrier layer can comprise, for example, aluminum or coatings of silicon oxide and/or aluminum oxide on PET, bi-axially arranged PP (BOPP), PA, PLA, or ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">Multilayer films are preferred for chemically active compositions, i.e. demanding filling materials.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">Further advantages can be found in the following description of the drawings.

The cover <b>14</b> then expands into the expansion region <b>72</b>. The predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> of the cover <b>14</b> is associated with the expansion region <b>72</b>, the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> breaking up above a certain force or a corresponding pressure, so that the composition can flow through the passage <b>60</b> of the insert <b>16</b> and the torn-open predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> from the chamber <b>20</b> into the outlet channel <b>80</b>. The composition can thus flow out of the head part <b>12</b> through the outlet opening <b>78</b> and be applied, for example, to an object.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0139">Due to the fact that, after the chamber <b>20</b> has been completely pressed out, the composition located in the expansion space <b>74</b> and in the outlet channel <b>80</b> cannot be pushed further out of the outlet opening <b>78</b>, the outlet channel <b>80</b> and the expansion space <b>74</b> should be kept as small as possible.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0140">It has been found to be advantageous if the expansion region <b>72</b>, which is associated with the chamber <b>20</b>, has an area of 1-40% based on the total area of the relevant receptacle <b>66</b> or <b>68</b>, better 2-35% and preferably 3-30%. The expansion height <b>90</b> of the expansion space <b>74</b> should be between 2.0 and 15.0 mm, in particular 3.0 and 12.0 mm and preferably 5.0 and 10.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0141">The opening force required to break up the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> can be adapted by changing the expansion region <b>72</b>, Furthermore, it is also possible to adapt the opening force by means of a corresponding arrangement of the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> on the cover <b>14</b> or the shape and size of the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0142">For example, the required opening force is increased if the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> is displaced from a central region in an edge region of the expansion surface <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0143">The expansion region <b>72</b> and the predetermined breaking region <b>88</b> are selected such that the two chambers <b>20</b> substantially break open when the opening force is identical, so that the compositions can flow out of the chambers <b>20</b> synchronously.
