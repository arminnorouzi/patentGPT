In a society that makes use of social media and the ubiquitous use of smart phones, there is a desire to display more relevant images and a greater selection of images. Further, conventional digital photo frame systems are dated and limited in their functionality.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the invention are set out in the independent claims and optional features are set out in the dependent claims. Aspects of the disclosure may be provided in conjunction with each other, and features of one aspect may be applied to other aspects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a digital photo frame display system comprising a master digital photo frame and a plurality of slave digital photo frames wherein the master digital display system provides power to the plurality of slave digital photo frames, therefore resulting in a system which requires only a single power supply and/or power source.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a digital photo frame display system which may provide a means of displaying a greater variety and selection media, and media that is more relevant and up to date (e.g. images from social media platforms/social networking websites such as Facebook&#xae; or Instagram&#xae;). The digital photo frame display system may allow an end user to change the media displayed in each of the digital photo frames, and such media may comprise media that has recently been created (e.g. images that have recently been uploaded to social networking websites such as Facebook&#xae; or Instagram&#xae;). For example, the user may use a computer program on a computing device to instruct the master digital photo frame to retrieve different media from a social networking website.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure may also provide a digital photo frame display system that is customisable by a user to display a selected plurality of different images. For example, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a modular digital photo frame system where the number and/or arrangement of the digital photo frames can be altered by a user into any user-customisable arrangement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, embodiments of the disclosure provide a digital photo frame system comprising a master digital photo frame and a plurality of slave digital photo frames.

It will be understood that the media connections may be configured to allow power to be transferred from the master digital photo frame to the plurality of slave digital photo frames.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples the master digital photo frame is configured to generate a map of the display system based on respective locations of the plurality of slave digital photo frames to the master digital photo frame. In some examples the master digital photo frame may send the generated map to a computing device. The computing device may, for example, be a handheld device such as a smartphone or tablet that is running a computer program configured to communicate with the master digital frame and optionally control the media displayed by the master and slave digital photo frames.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples the master digital photo frame is configured to send location requests to the respective plurality of slave digital photo frames via the slave communications interface. The slave digital photo frames may be configured to send a location response to the master digital photo frame via the communication interface, wherein the location response of each respective slave digital photo frame comprises any one or more of the following data:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0023">an identifier of the individual slave digital photo frame;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0024">one or more identifiers of other slave digital photo frames to which the individual slave digital photo frame is directly connected;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0025">a time taken for the location request to be received by the respective slave digital photo frame.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">The media package request may comprises a master and slave media request portion, configured to instruct the storage location to send specified master and slave media to the master digital photo frame; and, a location portion, configured to instruct the master digital photo frame to send each of the plural slave media to respective slave digital photo frames based on the generated map. The master and slave media request portion and the location portion of the media package request may, for example, be determined by a user input on the computing device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">In some examples each of the master digital photo frame and/or the plurality of slave digital photo frames comprises an orientation sensor configured to determine an orientation of each of the frames; and, each of the master digital photo frame and/or the plurality of slave digital photo frames is configured to display the respective media at an orientation based on the determined orientation of the frame.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">In some examples, connectors of the master digital photo frame, such as the slave communications interface, may have an associated master connector identifier. In some examples, connectors of the slave digital photo frames such as the master communications interface may have an associated slave connector identifier. A connection between two digital photo frames comprises a connector from a first digital photo frame connected to connector from a second digital photo frame (e.g. a connection comprising a connector of a master digital display connected to a connector of a slave digital display; or, a connection comprising a connector of a slave digital display connected to a connector of another slave digital display). The connector identifier of each connector forming a particular connection may be obtained by a computing device and/or the master digital photo frame, and hence information indicative of which connectors are connected to one another may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">For example, the connector identifiers may comprise any of: barcode; QR code; serial number of a component; printed alphanumeric sequence; symbolic representation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In some examples, connectors of the master digital photo frame may have an associated master connector identifier. For example, the master digital photo frame may comprise four connectors, such as the slave communications interface, a master-top port, a master-left port, a master-bottom port, a master-right port with respectively connector identifiers MT, ML, MB, MR. In some examples, connectors of the slave digital photo frames may have an associated slave connector identifier. For example, a first slave digital photo frame may comprise four connectors, a first slave-top port, a first slave-left port, a first slave-bottom port, a first slave-right port with respectively connector identifiers <b>1</b>ST, <b>1</b>SL, <b>1</b>SB, <b>1</b>SR. A connection between two digital photo frames comprises a connector from a first digital photo frame connected to connector from a second digital photo frame (e.g. a connection comprising a connector of the master digital display connected to a connector of the first slave digital display). The connector identifier of each connector forming a particular connection may be obtained by a computing device and/or the master digital photo frame, and hence information indicative of which connectors are connected to one another may be obtained. A map of the digital photo frame system may be obtained using the information indicative of which connectors are connected to one another.
