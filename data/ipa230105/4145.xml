In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, machining system <b>10</b> includes a machine tool <b>100</b>A, a machine tool <b>100</b>B, and an information processing system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Machine tool <b>100</b>A and machine tool <b>100</b>B may be of the same type or of different types. Hereinafter, when machine tools <b>100</b>A and <b>100</b>B are not particularly distinguished, any one of machine tools <b>100</b>A and <b>100</b>B is also referred to as a machine tool <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Machine tool <b>100</b> is a workpiece processing machine. As an example, machine tool <b>100</b> is a machine tool that performs subtractive manufacturing (SM) process on a workpiece. Alternatively, machine tool <b>100</b> may be a machine tool that performs additive manufacturing (AM) process on a workpiece. Machine tool <b>100</b> may also be a vertical or horizontal machining center or turning center. Alternatively, machine tool <b>100</b> may be a lathe or another cutting machine or grinding machine. Furthermore, the machine tool may be a combined machine obtained by combining the machines described above.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Information processing system <b>200</b> is, for example, an information processing apparatus such as a computer having a server function.

Machine tool <b>100</b> and information processing system <b>200</b> may be connected in a wireless manner or in a wired manner. As an example, EtherNET (registered trademark) is adopted as a communication standard of machine tool <b>100</b> and information processing system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x3c;B. Overview of Inheritance Function&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Successively, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an inheritance process for allowing inheritance of setting data of machine tool <b>100</b>A (first machine tool) to machine tool <b>100</b>B (second machine tool) will be described.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, suppose that a user using machine tool <b>100</b>A newly introduces machine tool <b>100</b>B. At this time, if setting data set in existing machine tool <b>100</b>A is inherited to newly introduced machine tool <b>100</b>B, the user can operate machine tool <b>100</b>B with the same operational feel as that for machine tool <b>100</b>A. In order to achieve this situation, machining system <b>10</b> has a function of allowing inheritance of the setting data set in machine tool <b>100</b>A to machine tool <b>100</b>B.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">More specifically, in step S<b>1</b>, machine tool <b>100</b>A receives an uploading operation of uploading the setting data from the user. The uploading operation is received by, for example, an operation panel <b>130</b> of machine tool <b>100</b>A. Machine tool <b>100</b>A transmits a part or all of the setting data set in machine tool <b>100</b>A to information processing system <b>200</b> in response to the uploading operation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The setting data transmitted to information processing system <b>200</b> includes, for example, at least one of screen setting of machine tool <b>100</b>A and machining setting related to machining performed by machine tool <b>100</b>A. The screen setting includes, for example, at least one of a screen configuration on operation panel <b>130</b> and character setting related to a screen. The character setting includes, for example, at least one of a language setting, a character color, and a font. The machining setting includes, for example, parameters (for example, an interlock condition or the like) that can be inherited without any trouble, such as numerical control (NC) parameters and PC parameters.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Note that the setting data to be inherited is not limited to the screen setting or the machining setting. Examples of the setting data to be inherited may include a setting related to a calendar, a setting related to a notepad, a conversion history of an input method editor (IME), and a search history (display history) of a G code or an M code. Preferably, setting data by which the operation of machine tool <b>100</b> changes before and after the inheritance even if machine tool <b>100</b> is operated by the same NC program is excluded from the setting data to be inherited.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Information processing system <b>200</b> stores the setting data received from machine tool <b>100</b>A in a settings database <b>222</b> in information processing system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Typically, settings database <b>222</b> is managed in a storage device <b>220</b>. Setting data received from a machine tool other than machine tool <b>100</b>A is also stored in settings database <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>2</b>, the user performs a setting data inheritance operation on machine tool <b>100</b>B which is in an initial setting state. In response to this operation, machine tool <b>100</b>B transmits a setting data acquisition request to information processing system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>3</b>, when receiving the setting data acquisition request from machine tool <b>100</b>B, information processing system <b>200</b> acquires setting data that can be inherited to machine tool <b>100</b>A from among the setting data managed in settings database <b>222</b>. At this time, when the setting data of machine tool <b>100</b>A stored in storage device <b>220</b> is inheritable to machine tool <b>100</b>B, information processing system <b>200</b> transmits the setting data to machine tool <b>100</b>B.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step S<b>4</b>, information processing system <b>200</b> transmits the setting data determined to be inheritable in step S<b>3</b> to machine tool <b>100</b>B.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step S<b>5</b>, machine tool <b>100</b>B inherits the setting data received from information processing system <b>200</b>. The wording &#x201c;inheriting&#x201d; herein means that at least a part or all of the setting data of machine tool <b>100</b>B is rewritten with the setting data received from machine tool <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With the above inheritance function, the setting data of machine tool <b>100</b>A is reflected in machine tool <b>100</b>B, and the user can operate newly introduced machine tool <b>100</b>B with the same operational feel as that for existing machine tool <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, if there is no inheritance function described above, the user needs to change the setting of machine tool <b>100</b>B according to the setting of machine tool <b>100</b>A, or needs to copy the setting data of existing machine tool <b>100</b>A to a recording medium such as a USB memory and write the setting data in machine tool <b>100</b>B from the recording medium. The inheritance function described above reduces the labor of the setting operation described above.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, in a case where machine tool <b>100</b>A and machine tool <b>100</b>B are in different buildings and setting data is stored and carried using a recording medium, there is also a risk that the recording medium is lost. Such a risk is also eliminated by the above inheritance process.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Note that, although the example in which, in step S<b>2</b>, the setting data acquisition request is input to machine tool <b>100</b>B that is an inheritance destination has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the acquisition request does not necessarily need to be input to machine tool <b>100</b>B. As an example, the acquisition request may be input to a user terminal that can communicate with information processing system <b>200</b>. The user terminal is, for example, a communication terminal such as a desktop computer, a notebook computer, a tablet terminal, or a smartphone.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The user terminal displays a portal site on the basis of an access to information processing system <b>200</b>. The portal site receives selection of an inheritance source machine tool, selection of an inheritance destination machine tool, selection of setting data to be inherited, and the like. In response to these selections, the user terminal transmits a setting data acquisition request to information processing system <b>200</b>. Thereafter, information processing system <b>200</b> transmits data to be inherited of the designated inheritance source machine tool to the designated inheritance destination machine tool. The inheritance destination machine tool performs a setting data inheritance process on the basis of the selling data received from information processing system <b>200</b>. Note that the portal site may be displayed on machine tool <b>100</b>A as the inheritance source or machine tool <b>100</b>B as the inheritance destination.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, although an example in which the process of uploading the setting data to information processing system <b>200</b> from machine tool <b>100</b> is executed in response to the user operation has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the execution of the process of uploading the setting data is not limited to be triggered by the user operation. As an example, the setting data of machine tool <b>100</b> may be automatically uploaded from machine tool <b>100</b> to information processing system <b>200</b> according to a predetermined schedule.
