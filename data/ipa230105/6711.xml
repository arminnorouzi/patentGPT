A system includes transmitter(s) configured to map orthogonal sub-carriers of a digital signal to narrowband receivers to form receiver-allocated audio channels, modulate the digital signal, and transmit the signal as an ultra-high frequency (UHF) analog carrier wave comprising the orthogonal sub-carriers to the nearby receiver. A narrowband receiver is configured to demodulate and sample the sub-carriers allocated to the receiver. Sub-carriers can be positioned orthogonal to one another in adjacent sub-bands of the frequency domain and beacon symbols and pilot signals can be iteratively provided in the same portion of the frequency domain for each channel. The receiver can use non-data-aided and data-aided approaches for synchronization of the time domain and frequency domain waveforms of the received signal to the transmitted signal prior to sampling the allocated sub-carriers.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="101.26mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230006712A1-20230105-D00000.TIF"

No. 63/217,477, filed Jul. 1, 2021 and entitled &#x201c;Scalable Multiuser Audio System and Method,&#x201d; the entire disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to in-ear-monitor systems, and more particularly to orthogonal sub-carrier spacing in the frequency-time domain of a carrier wave for ultra-low latency transmission of audio to receivers of in-ear-monitor systems and methods of synchronizing and demodulating the carrier wave by in-ear-monitor receivers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In audio production systems, audio is often captured by microphone or audio pick-up, mixed or modulated by audio mixers, and provided to users by an air interface between a transmitter or multi-antenna array and one or more receivers coupled to one or more in-ear-monitors. Wireless audio transmitters, wireless audio receivers, wireless microphones, and other wireless communication devices include antennas for transmitting and receiving radio frequency (RF) signals which contain digital or analog signals, such as modulated audio signals, data signals, and/or control signals. Users of wireless communication devices include stage performers, singers, actors, news reporters, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless audio receiver may be able to receive RF signals from one or more wireless audio transmitters over one or more channels and corresponding frequencies. For example, a wireless audio receiver may have a single receiver channel so that the receiver is able to wirelessly communicate with one wireless audio transmitter at a corresponding frequency. As another example, a wireless audio receiver may have multiple receiver channels, where each channel can wirelessly communicate with a corresponding wireless audio transmitter at a respective frequency.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wireless audio transmitters typically transmit analog audio signals to receivers for in-ear-monitor systems, and wireless audio receivers are typically configured to receive analog audio signals. Analog systems are often affected by noise during transmission and require hardware that is less flexible and consume more power. Also, analog systems typically require a dedicated frequency sub-band be allocated to each receiver, and dynamic re-allocation of sub-bands to different receivers is typically not possible or results in an unacceptable delay in audio transmission in that sub-band. Further, analog systems are typically not efficiently user scalable meaning that as additional users are added to the IEM system, additional sub-bands must be allocated to the receivers for those additional users, which increases the bandwidth on which the IEM system is operating. As such, there is a need for audio in-ear-monitoring systems that are more user scalable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments illustrated herein disclose wireless audio monitoring systems, receivers, transmitters, and associated methods for achieving increased efficiency of spectrum use and bandwidth utilization that scales in proportion to the number of unique audio channels in the system. In some embodiments, a system can include one or more transmitters and one or more receivers configured to receive audio signals from the one or more transmitters. In some embodiments, the one or more receivers can be in communication with one or more in-ear-monitors (IEMs). The IEMs can be configured to be disposed about, within, or partially within an ear of a user and configured to generate audio waves based on information received form the receiver.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some embodiments, a transceiver, such as a transmitting transceiver (&#x201c;transmitter&#x201d;), can be provided that is configured to enable low latency audio playback by in-ear monitors positioned in an interferer laden environment. In some embodiments, a transmitter can be configured to transmit a signal, carrier wave, or the like towards one or more receivers. In some embodiments, the signal or carrier wave may be an ultra-high frequency signal in a narrow bandwidth of spectrum. In some embodiments, the carrier wave comprises a time domain and a frequency domain, or a time-frequency domain, that can be subdivided across the time domain and across the frequency domain. Receivers can be assigned one or more sub-carriers of the carrier wave across the time domain and/or the frequency domain. Sub-carriers in the time-frequency domain can be orthogonal such that content of each audio channel is collocated in a narrow bandwidth of spectrum with a signal so that it can be decoded using a narrowband receiver. In some embodiments, a portion of the sub-carrier may overlap with a portion of an adjacent sub-carrier. In some embodiments, symbols may be assigned to each sub-carrier such that the receiver can interpret each sub-carrier and map the sub-carriers in the time and frequency domains to carry out channel estimation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the transmitter can be configured to co-locate audio channels in a narrow bandwidth of spectrum with a signal designated so that it can be decoded using a receiver, such as a narrowband receiver, without interference from adjacent signal energy. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured for mono-directional communication or bi-directional communication. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured for downlink communication with receiver(s) only. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured for downlink communication with receiver(s) and also configured for receiving communications, such as raw audio from a microphone or instrument, from receiver(s).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to receive audio information, such as analog audio signals, digital audio signals, an audio bitstream, audio packets, or the like, e.g., from an instrument, a microphone, an audio mixer, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the transmitter can be configured to receive raw audio from one or more microphones and/or one or more instruments and associated with one or more in-ear-monitor users. In some embodiments, the transmitter may comprise means, such as a processor, a memory storing computer program instructions, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a combining module, a modulator, an antenna, a digital signal processor, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to transmit a carrier wave towards one or more receivers in an interferer laden environment. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to associate one or more sub-carriers of the carrier wave to receivers in the interferer laden environment. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to generate a user-customized audio mix based upon user preferences, such as a loudness of audio from the user's microphone and/or the user's instrument(s) relative to a loudness of audio from other microphone(s) and/or other instrument(s) in the interferer laden environment. Said otherwise, the user may prefer to hear only the audio from their own microphone and/or instrument(s) or may prefer to hear all captured audio, e.g., with a slight emphasis on the audio from their microphone and/or instrument(s).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The transmitter may receive user-customized audio or may generate the user-customized audio based upon raw audio from the various microphones and/or instruments in the interferer laden environment. In some embodiments, the transmitter may generate the user-customized audio based upon known and/or pre-set user preferences. The transmitter may therefore comprise an audio mixing system, such as a mixing board or the like. In some embodiments, the transmitter can be configured to generate user-customized audio that is specific for each in-ear-monitor of a pair of in-ear-monitors associated with (used by) the user. For example, a user may prefer to hear only their vocals, captured by the user's microphone, in a first ear, and a mixture of the user's instrumental audio, captured by a microphone positioned near the user's instrument or an audio pickup coupled to or integrated into the user's instrument, in a second ear. Continuing this example of a user preference for in-ear-monitor audio playback, the transmitter may transmit two streams of audio associated with the user's two in-ear-monitors. In some embodiments, the transmitter may transmit both streams of audio to a single receiver worn by the user and coupled to the user's two in-ear-monitors. In some embodiments, the user may need to wear a first receiver coupled to the first in-ear-monitor and a second receiver coupled to the second in-ear-monitor. In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to allocate a portion of the carrier wave to respective receivers associated with the respective in-ear-monitors such that each receiver can demodulate and playback the correct audio based upon the distinct sub-carrier allocation of each receiver.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the transmitter may be configured to associate various portions (e.g., sub-carriers, resource units, signal blocks, etc.) of the carrier wave to different receivers, e.g., body-worn receivers associated with different users. In some embodiments, one or more sub-carriers may be allocated to, or associated with, a single receiver at any one point in a time domain and/or a frequency domain of the carrier wave. In some embodiments, the sub-carrier allocations may be known by the receivers and/or communicated with the carrier wave to the receivers. In some embodiments, the sub-carriers may be allocated orthogonally within the frequency and time domain in order to reduce sub-carrier spacing and improve spectral efficiency.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment, an apparatus is provided for facilitating multi-user audio monitoring. In some embodiments, the apparatus can comprise means, such as a processor and a memory storing computer program instructions, for causing the apparatus at least to subdivide a frequency-time domain of a carrier wave in a radio frequency band into a plurality of sub-carrier allocations associated with a plurality of in-ear-monitors, wherein respective sub-carrier allocations are orthogonal in the frequency-time domain to other sub-carrier allocations of the plurality of sub-carrier allocations. In some embodiments, the apparatus can further comprise means for causing the apparatus at least to modulate the plurality of sub-carrier allocations according to a plurality of modulation schemes such that respective sub-carrier allocations are individually modulated. In some embodiments, the apparatus can further comprise means for causing the apparatus at least to generate, based at least on the plurality of modulation schemes, demodulation information for demodulating the plurality of sub-carrier allocations of the frequency-domain spectrum. In some embodiments, the apparatus can further comprise means for causing the apparatus at least to cause transmission of the carrier wave, the carrier wave comprising the demodulation information.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the apparatus can further comprise means, such as the processor and memory storing computer program instructions, for causing the apparatus at least to scramble the carrier wave using one or more of: block coding, block coding with error correction, selected mapping, convolutional encoding, selected list mapping, partial transmit sequence, interleaving, tone reservation, or tone injection.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the apparatus can further comprise means, such as the processor and memory storing computer program instructions, for causing the apparatus at least to modulate the carrier wave using one or more of: inverse fast Fourier transform conversion, upsampling, peak windowing, envelope scaling, or clipping and filtering.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment, a method can be carried out, such as by an apparatus described herein, to facilitate multi-user audio monitoring. In some embodiments, the method can comprise subdividing a frequency-time domain of a carrier wave in a radio frequency band into a plurality of sub-carrier allocations associated with a plurality of in-ear-monitors, wherein respective sub-carrier allocations are orthogonal in the frequency-time domain to other sub-carrier allocations of the plurality of sub-carrier allocations. In some embodiments, the method can further comprise modulating the plurality of sub-carrier allocations according to a plurality of modulation schemes such that respective sub-carrier allocations are individually modulated. In some embodiments, the method can further comprise generating, based at least on the plurality of modulation schemes, demodulation information for demodulating the plurality of sub-carrier allocations of the frequency-domain spectrum. In some embodiments, the method can further comprise causing transmission of the carrier wave, the carrier wave comprising the demodulation information.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the method can further comprise scrambling the carrier wave using one or more of: block coding, block coding with error correction, selected mapping, convolutional encoding, selected list mapping, partial transmit sequence, interleaving, tone reservation, or tone injection.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the method can further comprise modulating the carrier wave using one or more of: inverse fast Fourier transform conversion, upsampling, peak windowing, envelope scaling, or clipping and filtering.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the interferer laden environment may be a concert venue, a stadium, a recording studio, or the like.

Indeed, these disclosures may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements.

Such component or feature may be optionally included in some embodiments, or it may be excluded.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;data,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d; &#x201c;information,&#x201d; and similar terms may be used interchangeably, according to some example embodiments of the present invention, to refer to data capable of being transmitted, received, operated on, displayed, and/or stored. Thus, use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Further, where a computing device is described herein to receive data from another computing device, it will be appreciated that the data may be received directly from the other computing device or may be received indirectly via one or more computing devices, such as, for example, one or more servers, relays, routers, network access points, base stations, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As used herein, the term &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; as used herein refers to any medium configured to participate in providing information to a processor, including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (for example, non-volatile media, volatile media), and transmission media. Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals include man-made transient variations in amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization or other physical properties transmitted through the transmission media. Examples of non-transitory computer-readable media include a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other non-transitory magnetic medium, a compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disc compact disc-rewritable (CD-RW), digital versatile disc (DVD), Blu-Ray, any other non-transitory optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a random access memory (RAM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other non-transitory medium from which a computer can read. The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media. However, it will be appreciated that where embodiments are described to use a computer-readable storage medium, other types of computer-readable mediums may be substituted for or used in addition to the computer-readable storage medium in alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As used herein, the term &#x201c;computing device&#x201d; refers to a specialized, centralized device, network, or system, comprising at least a processor and a memory device including computer program code, and configured to provide guidance or direction related to the charge transactions carried out in one or more charging networks.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; generally mean plus or minus 10% of the value stated, e.g., about 250 &#x3bc;m would include 225 &#x3bc;m to 275 &#x3bc;m, about 1,000 &#x3bc;m would include 900 &#x3bc;m to 1,100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Musicians, singers, performers, conference speakers, and others often use in-ear-monitors (IEMs) to be able to hear the audio captured by their microphone, instrument, or the like, in real-time or near real-time. Users of such IEMs are typically mobile in such an environment during use of the IEM and therefore the audio must be received wirelessly at the IEM system. Since the user speaking or singing into the microphone, for example, generates audio that must be transmitted to a sound board or the like and then transmitted back to the user's IEM such that the audio from the microphone can be played back in the user's IEM, a lag between audio capture and audio playback occurs, which is described herein as latency or audio latency. As described herein, the term &#x201c;low latency&#x201d; may refer to latencies of about 15 ms or less. As described herein, the term &#x201c;ultra low latency&#x201d; may refer to latencies of about 5 ms or less.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Environments where IEMs are commonly used (e.g., stages, convention centers, outdoor pavilions, etc.) tend to be interferer laden, which means that audio for playback by a user's IEM typically picks up noise and distortion from such interferers in the environments during transmission to the receiver associated with the IEM. Since the user of the IEM is typically mobile within the interferer laden environment, the audio must typically be transmitted to the user's IEM system wirelessly, which means that the type and magnitude of signal interference on a transmitted carrier wave within the interferer laden environment is typically not static. As such, Applicant has found that analog audio playback systems often require that each user be associated with a distinct and different frequency within a frequency band or sub-band, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and the analog signal associated with just that user's audio mixture be transmitted back to the user's IEM receiver. However, in order to avoid interference or intermodulation of the sub-carrier by adjacent sub-carriers, Applicant has found that such IEM systems typically require sufficient spacing of sub-carriers within the carrier wave, leading to spectral inefficiency.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Digital audio playback systems may be able to increase spectral efficiency by not requiring the same sub-carrier spacing within the frequency domain, however, Applicant has determined that digital audio playback systems tend to exhibit unacceptable latency, e.g., in part because of the additional synchronization and demodulation information that needs to be transmitted with audio, which occupies spectrum in the time and frequency domain and reduces the rate of audio payload units across the time domain of the carrier wave and/or diminishes available spectrum.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As such, there is a need for a digital IEM audio playback system which has sufficient spectral efficiency, is user scalable while accounting for the diminishing availability of spectrum, and which achieves a sufficiently short latency between audio capture and audio playback at the user's IEM.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Provided herein are wireless audio monitoring systems, receivers, transmitters, and associated methods for achieving increased efficiency of spectrum use and bandwidth utilization that scales in proportion to the number of unique audio channels in the system. In some embodiments, a system can include one or more transmitters and one or more receivers configured to receive audio signals from the one or more transmitters. In some embodiments, the one or more receivers can be in communication with one or more IEMs. The IEMs can be configured to be disposed about, within, or partially within an ear of a user and configured to generate audio waves based on information received form the receiver. The one or more transmitters can be configured to transmit a signal or carrier wave carrying subcarriers positioned orthogonally in sub-bands of the frequency domain of the signal or carrier wave. The signal or carrier wave transmitted by the one or more transmitters can be a relatively wideband signal occupying a relatively larger range of the frequency domain with audio payload subcarriers, synchronization information subcarriers, beacon symbols, pilot subcarriers, and/or the like being transmitted in the orthogonally positioned sub-bands. The one or more receivers can be configured to &#x2018;listen to&#x2019; or demodulate and process only a portion of the wideband signal or carrier wave, meaning that the one or more receivers are configured to be tuned to particular sub-band(s) of the spectrum occupied by the signal or carrier wave. As such, the one or more transmitters can map an audio channel associated with a particular receiver to the respective subcarriers in the particular sub-band(s) of the spectrum to which the particular receiver is tuned. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the scalability of such a narrowband approach may stem from at least the orthogonality of subcarriers in the frequency domain, meaning that more subcarriers per unit of time may be transmitted without increasing the total bandwidth of the signal or carrier wave. In some embodiments, the increase in subcarriers per unit of time may lead to more users or audio mixes being transmitted towards receivers, while receivers may be still configured to capture, listen to, or sample, the same or similar narrowband subset of the total signal bandwidth. However, implication of such a user scalable narrowband approach may be that non-payload overhead cannot or should not be shared between the narrowband receivers. As such, according to some embodiments, each narrowband portion of the signal or carrier wave to which the particular receiver is tuned must allocate its own overhead in the time domain. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the static allocation of sub-band(s) to respective receivers and the orthogonality of subcarriers in the frequency domain may increase user scalability, but the increase in overhead may lead to decreases in latency. As such, various approaches for non-data-aided and data-aided synchronization are described herein that reduce the burden of increased overhead on latency.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> for wireless audio monitoring, according to an example embodiment.

As illustrated, the spectrum is subdivided into a number of sub-carriers that are orthogonal to one or more other sub-carriers in the frequency domain. In some embodiments, each sub-carrier is modulated independently. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, because the sub-carriers are orthogonal in the frequency and/or time domain, a receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>105</b>) that is time and frequency synchronized to a transmitter (e.g., the downlink transmitter <b>104</b>) can recover the sub-carriers and their modulated data that are associated with that particular receiver such that the adjacent sub-carriers do not interfere with each other, by avoiding inter-sub-carrier interference and sub-carrier intermodulation.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> illustrate that, by allocating sub-carriers orthogonally across the frequency domain of the carrier wave, a larger number of audio channels can be accommodated on the same portion of the spectrum. Among other benefits of this audio channel allocation approach, the system is user scalable, with improved spectral efficiency, achieves a low latency relative to other digital audio monitoring systems, is resilient to system interference and intermodulation between audio channels, and reduces external hardware (rack gear) for combining transmissions to achieve user-customized stereo audio mixtures by implementing internal digital combining.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Thus far, the frequency domain of the carrier wave has been primarily discussed. However, spectral resources for audio playback transmissions in an IEM system may be allocated across both the frequency domain and the time domain, according to some embodiments described herein. Applicant has found that, oftentimes, when receivers are allocated to a particular frequency range of the analog signal with spacing therebetween to avoid inter-channel interference, this necessary spacing can lead to inefficient spectrum use and an IEM system that is not sufficient user scalable in light of diminishing available spectrum.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example allocation of audio channels for plural users (user<sub>0</sub>, user<sub>1</sub>, user<sub>2</sub>, and user<sub>3</sub>) to respective sub-carriers within the time-frequency domain of the carrier wave is illustrated. Applicant has found that such allocation of audio channels for an audio monitoring system typically requires that signals for individual users be spaced in the time domain and/or spaced in the frequency domain to avoid interference from adjacent users, leading to relatively poor resource use (e.g., spectral inefficiency). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, such an allocation approach typically requires that an IEM system uses the spectrum in the time and frequency domain in a relatively sparse manner, meaning that the payload audio carried on the carrier wave at each portion of the frequency domain, per unit of the time domain, is low because of a relatively large sub-carrier spacing in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Applicant has found that such wideband systems typically require an arbitrary allocation of fixed bandwidth frequency-time resources to users, and that such wideband systems often use the same or similar bandwidth regardless of the number of active audio devices. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> as BW, which illustrates that, in order for a receiver to identify and demodulate the correct sub-carriers across the time-frequency domain, each receiver must receive the full bandwidth. Said otherwise, the receiver associated with a first user (u<sub>1</sub>) would need to receive a larger bandwidth, e.g., about 6 MHz, in order to ensure that all allocated sub-carriers across the time-frequency domain are properly identified and demodulated such that the entire audio channel for the first user is received and can be played back for the first user. Applicant has likewise found that such an allocation approach requires the use of a wideband receiver to accommodate the larger bandwidth across which sub-carriers the audio channel for the first user, for instance, is allocated.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Conversely, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example allocation of audio channels for plural users (user<sub>0</sub>, user<sub>1</sub>, user<sub>2</sub>, and user<sub>3</sub>) to respective sub-carriers within the frequency domain of the carrier wave according to embodiments of the present disclosure. As illustrated, the spectrum is subdivided into a number of sub-carriers that are orthogonal to one or more other sub-carriers in the frequency domain and remain stable across the time domain. In some embodiments, each sub-carrier is modulated independently. In some embodiments, because each receiver is allocated a stable sub-carrier occupying a same or similar portion of the frequency domain across the time domain of the carrier wave, the mobile receiver can be a narrowband portable receiver, e.g., a receiver configured to receive and sample or otherwise process a relatively smaller sub-band of spectrum (e.g., less than about 6 MHz, less than about 5 MHz, less than about 4 MHz, less than about 3 MHz, less than about 2 MHz, less than about 1 MHz, less than about 900 kHz, less than about 800 kHz, less than about 700 kHz, less than about 600 kHz, less than about 500 kHz, less than about 400 kHz, less than about 300 kHz, or less than about 200 kHz of bandwidth, inclusive of all values and ranges therebetween) instead of the receiver according to the allocation approach illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which is configured to receive and process a bandwidth of greater than about 6 MHz. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, because the sub-carriers are orthogonal in the frequency and/or time domain, a receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>105</b>) that is time and frequency synchronized to a transmitter (e.g., the downlink transmitter <b>104</b>) can recover the sub-carriers and their modulated data that are associated with that particular receiver such that the adjacent sub-carriers do not interfere with each other, by avoiding inter-sub-carrier interference and sub-carrier intermodulation.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Also, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, by orthogonal allocation of sub-carriers across the frequency domain, the same audio resources may be transmitted while using a smaller portion of the sub-band of spectrum allotted for the IEM system, meaning that additional sub-carriers may be orthogonally allocated across the unused portion of the frequency domain and that additional users may be added to the IEM system without requiring additional spectrum.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> illustrate example sub-carrier allocations of the frequency domain of a carrier wave in which a portion of the spectral resource may be used for carrying other information besides the audio payload. While sub-carriers remain allocated to the same portion of the frequency domain, the time domain may be apportioned to various other information, to guard intervals, or the like.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">For example, during a first portion of the time domain, synchronization information, demodulation information, and/or the like may be transmitted in the portion of the frequency domain allocated to u<sub>1</sub>, for example, and then in a second portion of the time domain subsequent the first portion, the audio payload for user u<sub>1 </sub>can be carried in the portion of the frequency domain of the carrier wave allocated to u<sub>1</sub>, followed by a third portion of the time domain subsequent the second portion in which further synchronization or demodulation information may be provided in the portion of the frequency domain allocated to u<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of an instance in which portions of the spectrum are allocated to only two users, e.g., because only two users require audio playback during that time, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may illustrate an example of an instance in which two additional users require audio playback and thus additional portions of the spectrum are allocated to the two additional users. By allocating a particular and stable portion of the frequency domain to u<sub>1</sub>, for example, when u<sub>2 </sub>and u<sub>3 </sub>are added to the IEM system, it is likely that the portion of the spectrum (sub-carriers) associated with the audio channel of u<sub>1 </sub>will not change, meaning that the u<sub>1 </sub>receiver will not need to resynchronized to a new or changing sub-carrier allocation scheme. Likewise, in an instance in which one or more users no longer require audio playback, the portion of the frequency domain allocated to those users might not be used and the portion of the frequency domain associated with the remaining users may be unchanged in terms of sub-carrier allocation.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example of sub-carrier allocation across the frequency domain that can be allocated bidirectionally across the time domain. Said otherwise, during a first portion of the time domain, a portion of the frequency domain may be used for downlink direction audio transmission between a soundboard transceiver and an IEM transceiver worn by the user, e.g., to provide a stereo audio mix for playback to the user by one or more IEMs. Then, during a subsequent portion of the time domain, the same portion of the frequency domain may be used for uplink direction audio transmission between the IEM transceiver worn by the user and the soundboard transceiver, e.g., to provide audio captured by the user's wireless microphone. However, when orthogonally allocating audio channels to sub-carriers that occupy the same portion of the frequency domain, it is important to be sure that the stereo audio mix for IEM playback can be transmitted, received, and demodulated without significant interference, noise, or uncorrected signal deformation. Likewise, when receiving uplink direction audio from a user's microphone at the soundboard transceiver, for example, it is also important to correct for or avoid interference, noise, and uncorrected signal deformation.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the same user audio channel allocations are illustrated as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, but now the time domain is subdivided to accommodate synchronization between transmitter and receiver and to leave guard intervals where needed in the time domain.

For example, the transmitter <b>404</b>, <b>504</b> may provide one or more pilots, pilot sub-carriers, pilot signals, or pilot frames in or with particular pre-determined sub-carrier(s)s and the receiver <b>605</b> may know to expect a pilot, pilot sub-carrier, pilot signal, or pilot frame at or in the particular pre-determined sub-carrier(s), in which case the receiver <b>605</b> can sample the signal at the portion of the time and frequency domain associated with that pre-determined sub-carrier to identify whether the pilot, pilot sub-carrier, pilot signal, or pilot frame is found. In an instance in which the receiver <b>605</b> does not see the expected pilot, pilot sub-carrier, pilot signal, or pilot frame at the point in the time and frequency domains where the particular pre-determined sub-carrier(s) is/are expected to be, the receiver <b>605</b> can carry out further sub-carrier offset correction, e.g., based upon sub-carrier spacing, and continue determining presence or absent of the expected pilot, pilot sub-carrier, pilot signal, or pilot frame until the receiver completes pilot-aided synchronization. After initial synchronization, temperature changes, movements of the user wearing the receiver, interference from interferers in the environment, and the like may contribute to fine frequency or timing offsets.
