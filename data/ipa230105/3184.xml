id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention relates to energy generation and water conservation. There are many water systems which might lend themselves to energy extraction, such as canal systems. However, despite canal systems being around for hundreds of years, practical solutions for using the energy available have not been developed. The invention provides, among various examples, a system which can be associated with a lock in a canal and provides a flow control strategy responsive to water availability upstream of the lock. Thus electricity may be generated selectively in response to the lock state and energy demands but without adversely affecting the canal system by taking excess water. The system may be applied to multiple locks and may incorporate machine learning to evolve a strategy for a canal based on lock usage and energy demand.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="101.60mm" wi="140.38mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="223.35mm" wi="142.41mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="142.32mm" wi="154.60mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="146.47mm" wi="139.11mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="130.05mm" wi="134.45mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="87.12mm" wi="148.51mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="130.98mm" wi="149.27mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="147.91mm" wi="121.84mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="111.76mm" wi="168.40mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="125.31mm" wi="106.17mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="166.79mm" wi="105.49mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="171.20mm" wi="154.01mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="240.37mm" wi="71.12mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="195.16mm" wi="163.24mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="238.68mm" wi="170.69mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="226.99mm" wi="169.76mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="171.20mm" wi="154.01mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="171.20mm" wi="154.01mm" file="US20230003185A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to methods of alleviating the effects of climate change and, in particular to the utilisation of fluid systems for creation and generation of electrical and/or other energy. This application claims priority from UK patent applications numbers GB1917225.3, GB2001941.0, GB2002518.5, GB2007289.8 and GB2008942.1, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that the combustion of carbonaceous fuels contribute to climate change and that this effect can be mitigated by replacing vehicles propelled by such fuels with alternatives that are powed by electricity which can be stored in batteries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generation of electrical or other energy from water sources uses the gravitational potential energy of the water and occasionally in a flowing water source some of the kinetic energy also. The energy available is related to the mass of water that flows multiplied the net effective change in height from the effective inlet and outlet level. Physical barriers such as dams are often used to provide a store of water at a higher level.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,969,935 and EP-A-3387191 disclose energy generating arrangements or pumping arrangements in association with a canal lock system. They can generate energy when water flows downstream and may also be used as pumps to return water upstream, consuming energy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An issue with canal systems is that they generally have a limited supply of water and disrupting the flow of water through them may cause unhelpful consequences. Simply trying to extract energy from water flowing through the canal may seem simplistically like a good idea but is problematic in practice and so despite canals and electricity generation being known for a very long time and the longstanding issue of a desire for renewable energy generation, practical systems have not been deployed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, the invention provides a water level control and energy recovery system for a canal having at least one lock, the system comprising:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">an upstream conduit arranged to be fluidly coupled to water upstream of a canal lock upper gate;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a downstream conduit arranged to be fluidly coupled to water downstream of a canal lock lower gate;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">an energy generating arrangement positioned in a flow conduit between the upstream conduit and the downstream conduit arranged to generate energy from flow of water through the upstream conduit to the downstream conduit;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a control arrangement arranged to obtain at least one lock state input related to the state or intended state of the canal lock and to provide a flow control output for controlling the flow through the conduit, wherein the controller is further arranged to obtain a canal state indication indicative of available water upstream of the lock and wherein the controller is arranged to produce a flow control output which varies with both the lock state inputs and the canal state indication to implement a flow control strategy for the canal responsive to the available water upstream.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">By using a canal state indication the flow through the lock and the energy generating arrangement may be varied for example from a maximum energy generation strategy if for example the canal is at a high level and reservoirs or rivers which feed the canal have plentiful water or there is a risk of flooding upstream to a maximum conservation strategy if water upstream of the lock is scarce or the canal level is low.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The canal state indication may be derived from a measure of water level in at least one remote water source feeding the canal upstream of the lock. In some embodiments the canal state indication may be derived from multiple parameters or measurements or observations or policies but reduced to a single parameter (or small number of parameters) controlling a more conservative or more aggressive energy generation strategy. A numerical signal may be used but a more complex signal may also be used, for example having multiple subcomponents or thresholds (e.g. a do not pump flag or a minimum level threshold for flow or a modified flow versus water level curve).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The canal state indication may advantageously be derived from at least one predictive water availability parameter indicating likely future state of the canal. This may be derived from a seasonal parameter based on observed seasonal variation in water availability or based on predicted parameters based on observed water levels or weather and forecast rainfall or other measures relevant to upstream water levels.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The canal state indication may advantageously be derived from a measure of canal water levels downstream of the lock. The parameter may be adjusted to increase net water flow if the water level is low downstream of the lock or to reduce it if there is a risk of flooding.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an advantageous arrangement, the control arrangement is arranged to receive at least one further input indicative of a measure of current or predicted energy demand and to adjust the flow in dependence of energy demand. Higher flow may be provided when canal state permits at times of actual or expected higher energy demand. If control includes pumping some water upstream, reduced pumping may be provided at times of higher energy demand. A time input may be provided as a measure of energy demand and a table of likely energy demand as a function of time may be stored.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system may include a water storage arrangement and the control arrangement may be arranged to divert water into or from the water storage arrangement. The water storage arrangement may have a volume comparable to a typical lock volume, for example at least 100 m{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}3 and be used cyclically in conjunction with lock cycles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Desirably the system includes an intermediate conduit arranged for fluid communication with the water in the lock.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Desirably the system is operable selectively to recover energy from more than one of the following lock states:&#x2014;<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">1. Water flowing into the lock, either (a) from the upstream canal or (b) storage arrangement if provided, with the lower gates closed to fill the lock</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">2. Water flowing out of the lock to empty the lock</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">3. Water bypassing the lock or flowing into the lock with the lower gates open</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Desirably the system is operable selectively to pump water from within the lock with the lower gates closed either upstream or to the storage arrangement if provided.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The control arrangement may have sensors integrated into components of the lock to determine current lock state. Alternatively a human interface, for example with push buttons, may allow a user to indicate a selected current or intended lock state.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">If the lock is powered or automated the control arrangement may be arranged to control some or all of the lock operation. In particular the control arrangement may control powered sluice gates associated with the lock.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The control arrangement may be arranged to monitor lock usage and predict lock usage and to modify the flow control strategy based on monitored or predicted lock usage.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">In a desirable development the system is applied to more than one lock in a canal system and the control arrangement is arranged to adjust the flow control strategy for one lock in dependence on information from another lock in the system. For example if a first lock upstream of a second lock is opened to let a vessel pass downstream, the system can take into account both the expected short term increase in water flow and the likely subsequent passage of the vessel, for example in increasing flow and energy generation until the vessel arrives.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">Even if the system is not physically applied to second lock, the canal state indication may be adjusted to include an indication of an upstream lock opening or likely vessel passage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">The flow may be controlled by regulating the power from and/or rotational speed of turbo generators in the flow conduit and/or by flow control valves. Regulating the flow may include switching turbogenerators into a pumping mode to pump water upstream.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The control arrangement may include a local controller arranged to control the arrangement and a remote server, typically connected over the internet. The remote server may derive complex control strategies and may communicate control strategies to a semi-autonomous local controller and/or may communicate information for controlling the lock apparatus directly. Control strategies may be viewed and displayed on GUI and may be modifiable by a user, for example to take into account expected developments with information not available to the controller.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">The controller may use machine learning to determine estimated canal state from measured parameters or to modify control strategies based on observed measurements following application of an initial strategy.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">The invention extends to corresponding methods and to a computer program or computer program product or logic for implementing or deriving the control strategies of the methods. The invention further extends to constructional methods and equipment and to a modified lock.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">In a development, the above arrangement is applied to a cofferdam in a body of water in place of a lock, with the references to a lock being changed to a cofferdam and the sub features applying where applicable mutatis mutandis (the intermediate conduit would not apply for example).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">The following description includes detail of a number of physical arrangements and techniques which may be useful in implementing or refining aspects of the invention or making use of its principles but are not to be considered limiting.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Accordingly, the present invention provides an electrical energy generating system comprising an input source of fluid having a first potential energy and an output for fluid having a potential energy lower than said first potential energy, wherein the input and output are separated by a cofferdam structure having a conduit linking the input and output and containing electrical generating means actuated by the passage of fluid between said input and output.

Pioneers, such as the Duke of Bridgewater, who wanted to transport coal from his coal mines to consumers in centres of population such as Liverpool and Manchester, constructed a network of canals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This permitted a vessel carrying a load of 30 tons and pulled by a single horse to replace a large train of pack-horses, with commensurate cost savings. Industries, such as potteries in the Midlands, also used the canals to transport their fragile products to purchasers, thereby alleviating the losses due to handling breakage in the packhorse trains.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">The English canal and navigable river network (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) covers an area of varying geographic topography. In order to overcome uneven terrain through which they pass, the canals were provided with pound locks to connect sections of the canals at different levels. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of the drawings, these locks customarily each had paired upper gates <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> connected between the upstream section of the canal and its operating section <b>4</b>.<b>2</b> in which the level of the water could be changed and a further double gate <b>4</b>.<b>3</b> connecting the lock to the downstream section of the canal. By opening the respective double gate the level of water in the lock was equalised with that of the upstream or downstream section of the canal. Culverts <b>4</b>.<b>4</b> controlled by valves (not shown) permit water to be introduced into the lock to reduce the initial force necessary to open the gate in order to allow the level of the water to be raised.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">This principle was used in the construction of the Panama Canal, where a high-level lake fed downstream locks used to permit ships travelling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to traverse the elevated geographic topography of the intervening Panamanian land mass.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0060">In accordance with a specific embodiment of the invention, the lock shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is provided with a bypass path shown in schematic plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and elevational view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> to transfer water from the section of the canal or river upstream to the section downstream of the lock. This bypass path includes a receptacle having an input chamber <b>5</b>.<b>1</b> and an output chamber <b>5</b>.<b>2</b> separated by a cofferdam structure <b>5</b>.<b>3</b> containing a turbo-generator <b>5</b>.<b>4</b> to generate electricity when actuated by the flow of water from the input chamber to the output chamber. The flow of water is indicated by the arrows shown. The drop in potential energy of the water (due to the height of the lock) as it traverses the lock provides the motive power to operate the turbo-generator. This transfer of water (effectively, leakage of the lock) will have a negligible influence on the depth of the water in the canal since the change in this will only be equal to the height difference of the geographic topography spanned by the lock multiplied by the surface area of the input chamber and divided by the surface area of the canal from its upstream gate to the downstream gate of the next lock on the canal, and, typically, will be no more than a few millimetres, thus having a negligible deleterious effect on the passage of vessels along the canal. The flow of water through the turbo-generator may be increased in response to demand by an input pump <b>5</b>.<b>4</b> in the input conduit and a complementary output pump <b>5</b>.<b>5</b> in the output conduit. The input and output pumps may be controlled in response to changes in demand from the electricity supply grid. This control may also be subjected to sensors (not shown) of the water level of the input and output sections of the canal to prevent these levels departing catastrophically from predetermined values.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0061">Each time a vessel traverses the lock, water is drained from the high-level section of the canal. In order to replace this loss, reservoirs, such as the Toddbrook Reservoir were therefore constructed by building dams to trap rain water which fell on higher ground. These reservoirs were connected to the navigable canals to maintain the level of water which was diminished by the passage of vessels through the locks. Buildings, typically dwelling houses, were frequently constructed in the sheltered lee of these dams.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0062">In accordance with another specific embodiment of the invention, such a reservoir, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, may be provided with a cofferdam structure <b>7</b>.<b>1</b>, within and supplementary to the main dam <b>7</b>.<b>2</b>, but containing a turbo-generator/pump <b>7</b>.<b>3</b> to utilise the reservoir for both pumped storage and for continuous electricity generation using the water flowing in from rainfall. The cofferdam structure serves an auxiliary purpose, to protect the main dam against catastrophic surcharge effects, such as that experienced at Whaley Bridge and it may be constructed with a bridging structure <b>7</b>.<b>4</b> to provide access for servicing both the turbo-generator and the normal access pipework, without the necessity and inconvenience of draining the reservoir. Advantageously, the cofferdam structure may be constructed using civil engineering techniques described by Gordon Rollinson in NRDC Bulletin No. 51 pp 16-18 (1980). (A copy of this was deposited with the former UK Patent Office Library) and may now be consulted at the British Library. Preferably, the bridging structure <b>7</b>.<b>4</b> is positioned somewhat below the tops of the dam and cofferdam. It supports a pedestrian or vehicular path for access from side to side of the reservoir and a layer of earth (not shown) in which vegetation may be planted to preserve the natural beauty of the reservoir. The reservoirs themselves are features of outstanding natural beauty and, by constructing the cofferdam structure in this way, it will not detract from this beauty.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0063">As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the auxiliary cofferdam <b>7</b>.<b>1</b> is constructed adjacent to, parallel with and spaced apart from the main dam <b>7</b>.<b>2</b>. The cofferdam is provided with a turbo-generator <b>7</b>.<b>3</b> to generate electricity using stored water fed to the reservoir after rainfall. Auxiliary vents and conduits (not shown) are provided to remove excess water, which is discharged to the normal overflow path.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an isolated lake, such as may be found in the Lake District of England or the Scottish lochs or Spain, Austria or Switzerland. In accordance with another embodiment of this invention, such lakes may also be used for pumped storage generation of electricity by the use of a cofferdam structure <b>9</b>.<b>1</b>, shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>and in elevation view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>. Contrary to normal practice, water is pumped out of the structure by the turbo-generator <b>9</b>.<b>3</b> and returns by gravitational pressure to generate electricity. The cables (not shown) connecting the turbo-generator to the grid supply may conveniently be laid from the base of the structure to the external connection point. The cofferdam may be capped and provided with earth and vegetation to give the appearance of an island in the lake, thus not detracting from its natural beauty. An archipelago of such islands (not specifically illustrated), interconnected by a network of basal conduits fitted with controlling pumps and valves, will provide a flexible pumped storage electricity generating system which keeps the mean water level in the lake constant and protects against flooding. Such a system may also, conveniently, be appended to reservoirs storing water for other purposes. Electricity generating means may also be installed at the normal outflow location.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">Whilst the embodiments of the invention described specifically utilised water as the working fluid, it will be apparent that other fluids, such as atmospheric air, fall within the ambit of the invention. For example, it is applicable to systems using Venturi tubes to utilise atmospheric pressure differences created by meteorological weather fronts and, in particular, by thunderstorms. Cofferdam structures constructed for the harvesting of water in association with locks or weirs for other industrial purposes such as mills may also be adapted to generate electricity. Auxiliary priming and/or flow-enhancing pumps may also be provided with standby batteries. It will also be apparent that the arrangements of water supplies for mills and the like, and typically with weirs and leats to control the flow of water, constructed since Saxon times may be adapted in accordance with the principles of this invention for the pumped-storage generation of electricity. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of the local generating facilities means that their control system may be constructed so that the electricity supplied to the grid can respond to changes in demand created locally, thereby increasing grid supply security.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">A typical medieval arrangement of weirs and leats, exemplified by the River Exe system at Exeter, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The River Exe <b>10</b>.<b>1</b> has a weir <b>10</b>.<b>2</b> with a principal leat <b>10</b>.<b>9</b> feeding a water engine <b>10</b>.<b>4</b> to supply water to the city before dividing into an upper and lower leat <b>10</b>.<b>5</b>, <b>10</b>.<b>6</b> to power various mills M constructed outside the city wall <b>10</b>.<b>7</b> for corn milling, fulling and other industrial purposes. A second weir <b>10</b>.<b>8</b> downstream of the head weir supplies a head mill <b>10</b>.<b>9</b>. Cross leats <b>10</b>.<b>10</b> regulate the water flow to the mills to ensure that each mill has sufficient water. A cofferdam structure (not shown), similar to that described previously in relation to a pound lock, containing an electricity generator is fed with water from either the upper or the lower leat and its water output is exhausted either to a downstream leat or directly downstream to the river.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0067">River and canal systems, such as those described, flow continuously to the sea. During times of heavy rain fall it is necessary for measures to be taken to prevent flooding, usually by diverting the water into another channel. Advantage may be taken of this excess water to drive further electricity generators. Surplus electricity from this source may be utilised for electrolysis of water. Hydrogen generated in this way may be distributed to users through the gas supply network, either as a supplement to natural hydrocarbons or, when the gas supply is converted to a hydrogen-based system, as an additional source. Such local connections are analogous to the system of town gas works and storage holders which was previously the norm which was abandoned only with the advent of natural gas supplies from the North Sea and elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, relates to the temporal security of electrical supply systems for domestic and other premises. For example, premises provided with a solar cell installation will conventionally have a storage battery to permit the electricity supply to be continuous, but this will only be recharged when solar energy is available and thus it is desirable to have an auxiliary electricity supply to top up this battery at other times. Mains water supply to domestic and other premises needs to be at a pressure which is high enough to raise the water to fill a header tank which is mounted at the highest available point of the premises, which may typically be just below roof level. Furthermore, the general pressure pf the water main will need to be sufficiently high to fill header tanks in the tallest buildings in the distribution network and this will create an excess pressure energy source which may be utilised for other purposes. If, conveniently, there is a nearby aqueduct or the mains supply pipe passes over a nearby hill, the excess pressure will be sufficiently high to drive a more powerful turbine.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">A turbo-generator <b>11</b>.<b>01</b> is preferably mounted between the isolating ball valve <b>12</b>.<b>04</b> and the flexible coupling <b>12</b>.<b>05</b> so that, each time water is fed to the storage tank, a trickle electrical charge is available via the connector <b>11</b>.<b>4</b>. Conveniently, this charge may be utilised to top up a battery connected to solar panels (not shown) mounted externally on the roof of the premises. The specification of the turbo-generator will be chosen so that the trickle charge is supplied at an appropriate voltage for this battery.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">A further turbo-generator, or a plurality thereof, may additionally or alternatively be connected to the outlet pipe <b>12</b>.<b>09</b> of the storage tank to generate a trickle charge each time water is drawn from the tank. Furthermore, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the principle of this invention may be applied to any electrical generating system, such as a so-called solar farm, by the provision of a suitably-placed water storage tank. It will also be apparent that the invention may be adapted to increase the security of supply of other intermittent electrical energy sources, such as wind generators. For example, a household with a smart meter might have one or more batteries which are charged during the night, when electricity is cheapest and used during peak hours. There are times when there is excess electricity in the grid (e.g. sudden change in weather, becoming more sunny and windy, so that much electricity is being generated, but power stations haven't yet been ramped down, which can take two days). At such times, consumers can be paid to take power off the grid. A smart meter may also be set for the battery to charge when electricity drops below a certain price per kWh.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">In locations, such as when the water supply passes over an aqueduct, or has a supply pipe from a pumping station which passes over a hill, advantage may be taken of the associated increased pressure to drive a more powerful turbine and extract the energy which would otherwise be wasted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a virtual pound lock system provided with auxiliary means to generate and store gaseous oxygen and hydrogen for use as a green gaseous chemical energy source.
