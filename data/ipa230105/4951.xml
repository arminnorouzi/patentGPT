For instance, contactless payment systems facilitate the exchange of transaction information between a payment instrument (e.g., an EMV payment card, a mobile device executing a payment application, etc.) and a payment terminal over a short-range communication network when the payment instrument and the payment terminal are within a threshold distance of one another. In an example where a customer uses a mobile device as a payment instrument, to alert a customer associated with the payment instrument of a successful transaction, the mobile phone or the payment terminal may provide an indication to the customer. For instance, with APPLE PAY&#xa9;, a customer's mobile phone may vibrate or beep to confirm that the customer paid correctly. Or, with other payment systems, the payment terminal may output an audible success tone (e.g., a sound generated by a 1500 Hz sine wave for a period of approximately 500 milliseconds) or an audible alert tone (e.g., a double beep generated by a 750 Hz sine wave for a first period of approximately 200 milliseconds and a second period of approximately 200 milliseconds, with approximately 200 milliseconds between the first period and the second period) to provide an indication to the customer regarding the contactless payment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The above and other features of the present disclosure, its nature and various advantages, will be more apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative block diagram of a payment system in accordance with some examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative block diagram of a point-of-sale (POS) system in accordance with some examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative block diagram of server(s) associated with a payment service in accordance with some examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an illustrative block diagram of a customer device in accordance with some examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a non-limiting flow diagram illustrating a method for determining a transaction status indication corresponding to a status of a transaction and sending the transaction status indication to a POS system for presentation of respective aspects of the transaction status indication via a payment reader device of the POS system and a customer device;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a non-limiting flow diagram illustrating a method for receiving instructions for outputting respective aspects of a transaction status indication via a payment reader device and a customer device; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a non-limiting flow diagram illustrating a method for receiving instructions for outputting respective aspects of a transaction status indication via a payment reader device and a customer device, sending instructions to the customer device, and outputting the respective aspects of the transaction status indication via the payment device and the customer device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the figures, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number identifies the figure in which the reference number first appears.

The payment reader device may physically interact with payment instruments such as magnetic stripe payment cards, EMV payment cards, and/or short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;, Bluetooth&#xae; low energy (BLE), near-field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), etc.) payment instruments. The POS terminal may provide a rich user interface, communicate with the payment reader device, and communicate with a payment server. In this manner, the POS terminal and payment reader device may collectively process transaction(s) between a merchant and customer(s).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an example, short-range communication payment instruments may include an electronic device (e.g., a mobile device, etc.) executing a payment application thereon. In such an example, the payment application may exchange data with a payment reader device of a POS system via a short-range communication network to facilitate a transaction between a customer associated with the electronic device and a merchant associated with the POS system. That is, when the electronic device executing the payment application thereon is within a threshold distance of the payment reader device, payment data may be passed from the payment application to the payment reader device via a short-range communication network. The payment reader device may provide the payment data to a POS terminal associated with the POS system, which may provide the payment data to a payment server for processing the payment data and attempting to authorize the transaction based on the payment data.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Techniques described herein are directed to facilitating transaction status indications. In at least one example, techniques described herein are directed to facilitating transaction status indications that are output on both a payment reader device and a device associated with a customer (i.e., a customer device). That is, to alert the customer of a status of a transaction, techniques described herein, are directed to outputting different aspects of a transaction status indication on a payment reader device and on a customer device. For the purpose of this discussion, a transaction status indication is a signal output via two or more devices (e.g., a payment reader device, a customer device, etc.). An aspect of a transaction status indication is the portion of the signal output on one of the devices (e.g., a payment reader device, a customer device, etc.). A transaction status indication may be an audio signal (e.g., a chord, a chime, a song, a sound, a rhythm, etc.), a visual signal (e.g., a flash of a light, a presentation of multiple lights, a graphical presentation, etc.), a combination of an audio signal and a visual signal, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In at least one example, as described herein, different transaction status indications may be output based on various characteristics of a transaction. For instance, transaction status indications may be customized based on merchants, merchant characteristics, transaction characteristics, customer characteristics, device types, events, locations, etc. As a non-limiting example, a coffee shop may customize a transaction status indication that is output when a customer completes a transaction at the coffee shop to sound like liquid (e.g., coffee) pouring out of a container. Accordingly, when a customer uses his or her mobile device to pay for coffee at the coffee shop, the customer may hear liquid pouring out of a container upon authorization of the transaction. In such an example, the payment reader device and the mobile device of the customer may output the sound of liquid pouring out of a carafe or other container synchronously. That is, both the payment reader device and the mobile device may output respective aspects of the transaction status indication (e.g., liquid pouring out of a container) in a time-synchronized manner so as to communicate to the customer that his or her transaction is successful.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As another non-limiting example, a merchant may customize a transaction status indication that is output when a customer spends more than a threshold or predetermined amount (e.g., $1000.00) in a single transaction with the merchant. For instance, the transaction status indication may sound like hands clapping (i.e., applause). Accordingly, when a customer uses his or her mobile device to pay for items (e.g., goods and/or services) offered for acquisition (e.g., for sale, rent, lease, etc.) by the merchant and spends more than $1000, the customer may hear an applause upon authorization of the transaction. In such an example, the payment reader device and the mobile device of the customer may output the sound of applause synchronously. That is, both the payment reader device and the mobile device may output respective aspects of the transaction status indication (e.g., applause) in a time-synchronized manner so as to communicate to the customer that his or her transaction is successful.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The time-synchronized output of aspects of transaction status indications described herein afford various technical improvements. For instance, in at least one example, techniques described herein enable enhanced and/or customized transaction status indications using clock and/or timer synchronization between a payment reader device and a mobile device. That is, as described below, a payment reader device and a mobile device may output aspects of transaction status indications based on receiving signals from timers on the respective devices. The time-synchronized output may afford enhanced and/or customized transaction status indications as described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although the examples discussed above refer to both the payment reader device and the customer device outputting transaction status indications, it should be noted that in some instances, either of the devices may output a transaction status indication or both devices may output a transaction status indication. That is, in at least one example, either the payment reader device or the customer device may output a transaction status indication or an aspect of a transaction status indication. Furthermore, although the examples discussed above refer to aspects of the transaction status indication being output synchronously, as described herein, aspects of the transaction status indication may be output asynchronously. Additionally, although the examples discussed above refer to aspects of the transaction status indication comprising a same sound, as described herein, aspects of the transaction status indication may be associated with different sounds or same or different visual signals.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and an enabling description of these implementations.

As described above, in at least one example, the second instructions may include a second time interval, the lapse of which triggers the customer device <b>400</b> to output the second aspect of the transaction status indication. In at least one example, the presentation module <b>412</b> may determine the second interval based on the second instructions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Block <b>716</b> illustrates determining that a lapse of time is equal to the second time interval. In at least one example, the presentation module <b>412</b> may determine that a lapse of time following the receipt of the second instructions is equal to the second time interval.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Block <b>718</b> illustrates outputting the second aspect of the transaction status indication at a second time. In at least one example, the second instructions may include data associated with the second aspect of the transaction status indication. That is, the second instructions may include audio data, image data, etc. In such examples, the presentation module <b>412</b> may cause the audio data, image data, etc. to be output via the input/output interface(s) <b>406</b> at the second time. In other examples, the second instructions may instruct the presentation module <b>412</b> to access data associated with the second aspect of the transaction status indication from the transaction status indication library <b>418</b>. In such examples, the presentation module <b>412</b> may access the audio data, image data, etc. corresponding to the second aspect of the transaction status indication that is stored in the transaction status indication library <b>418</b> and may cause the audio data, image data, etc. to be output via the input/output interface(s) <b>406</b> at the second time.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The first aspect and the second aspect of the transaction status indication may be output synchronously or asynchronously. That is, in some examples, the first time and the second time may be a same time or different times. In at least one example, the first time and the second time may be successive. In other examples, the first time and the second time may substantially overlap. Moreover, in yet additional and/or alternative examples, the first time may be a specified time interval before or after the second time.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In at least one example, a first aspect may be output for a first length of time and the second aspect may be output for a second length of time. In some examples, the first length of time and the second length of time may be the same length of time. In other examples, the first length of time and the second length of time may be different lengths of time.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In at least one example, the first aspect and the second aspect may be associated with audio outputs. In some examples, the first aspect and the second aspect of the transaction status indication may be same sounds. In other examples, the first aspect and the second aspect of the transaction status indication may be different sounds. In some examples, when the first aspect and the second aspect of the transaction status indication are different sounds, the different sounds may be complementary. In at least one example, the first aspect and the second aspect may be output such to generate a harmonious sound. In other examples, the first aspect and the second aspect may be output in a particular order to generate a musical scale (i.e., a set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch). Or, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first aspect may be a first word (e.g., &#x201c;Go!&#x201d;) and the second aspect may be a second word (e.g., &#x201c;Team!&#x201d;), that when output successively comprise a phrase (e.g., &#x201c;Go Team!&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In alternative examples, the first aspect and the second aspect may be associated with visual outputs. For instance, the payment reader device <b>204</b> may output a first aspect of a transaction status indicator that is associated with a first color of light and the customer device <b>400</b> may output a second aspect of the transaction status indicator that is associated with a second color of light. The first aspect and the second aspect may be a same color. Or, the first aspect and the second aspect may be different colors. In some examples, the first aspect and the second aspect may represent colors of a team, a school, etc. In other examples, the first aspect and the aspect may be blended to create a third color. In yet an additional and/or alternative example, the payment reader device <b>204</b> may output a first aspect of a transaction status indicator that is associated with a first set of colors of light and the customer device <b>400</b> may output a second aspect of the transaction status indicator that is associated with a second set of colors of light. In some examples, the first aspect may transition into the second aspect. Or, the first aspect and the second aspect may be integrated to generate a rainbow. Additional and/or alternative visual signals may be imagined.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> refers to first instructions and a second instructions corresponding to a first aspect and a second aspect, in some examples, the first instructions may be associated with more than one aspect and the second instructions may be associated with more than one aspect. In such examples, each aspect may be associated with respective time intervals indicating when the aspect is to be output. A non-limiting example of a transaction signal indication having multiple aspects may be a transaction signal indication where the payment reader device <b>204</b> outputs a first sound, the customer device <b>400</b> outputs a second sound, the payment reader device <b>204</b> outputs a third sound, and the customer device <b>400</b> outputs a fourth sound, etc., such that the two devices are playing sounds back and forth.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is directed to an example where the transaction status indication determination module <b>312</b> may send instructions to the POS terminal <b>202</b> and the POS terminal <b>202</b> may provide instructions to the payment reader device <b>204</b>, which may provide instructions to the customer device <b>400</b> via a short-range communication network, the instructions may be sent to the payment reader device <b>204</b> and/or the customer device <b>400</b> from alternative sources. For instance, in an alternate example, instructions associated with the transaction status indication may be provided by the payment server(s) <b>300</b> directly to the POS terminal <b>202</b> and the customer device <b>400</b>. Or, in yet another alternate example, instructions associated with the transaction status indication may be provided by the payment server(s) <b>300</b> directly to the payment reader device <b>204</b> and the customer device <b>400</b>. Alternatively, instructions associated with the transaction status indication may be provided by the payment server(s) <b>300</b> to the POS terminal <b>202</b>, which may send instructions to the payment reader device <b>204</b> and the customer device <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this disclosure and various modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of this disclosure.
