Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in the background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present technique.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Banking fraud and scamming is an increasing problem. In a typical fraud or scam, a perpetrator of the fraud will illegally obtain funds from a victim's bank account. This may be via a &#x201c;phishing&#x201d; or &#x201c;malware&#x201d; attack where access to the victim's bank facilities is obtained. For example a perpetrator of the fraud or scam may access a victim's account or deceptively obtain funds via the victim transferring funds into the perpetrator's bank account.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After the funds have been transferred from the victim's account, the perpetrator will transfer funds through numerous other bank accounts. These other bank accounts may be legitimate accounts which have also been compromised, bank accounts set up using illegally obtained documents (such as a stolen or fake passport), or may be rented from a 3<sup>rd </sup>party to be used for illicit purposes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The speed at which the funds are transferred is usually very high. Typically, a transfer between multiple banks' accounts may be completed within a few minutes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This transfer of funds occurs for two reasons. The first reason is to make tracing the funds very complicated. This is because investigation is done manually using the limited view of data from each bank on a bank by bank basis. Therefore, it is difficult to trace the movements of funds originating from the initial fraudulent transaction across the banking network. This is especially the case where the funds obtained from the victim are typically mixed with other funds in each bank account (some legitimate funds and some illegitimate funds). This makes tracing the funds incredibly difficult.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The second reason is to disperse the money in the original transaction. This allows the perpetrator to, for example, withdraw small amounts of money as cash from e.g. an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or to buy lower value products in a shop without arousing suspicion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some instances, some money from a fraudulent transaction may pass through tens of bank accounts in a few hours. This number of accounts and the speed at which the funds transfer makes tracing the funds using conventional mechanisms impossible. It is an aim of the disclosure to address these issues.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method of tracing messages through a network of nodes is provided, the method comprising receiving message information corresponding to a first outbound message, the message information comprising a first source identifier and a first destination identifier and determining whether the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages in a storage unit, whereby when the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages, the method comprises producing a trace request, the trace request comprising the first destination identifier and an identifier identifying the set of messages associated with the first source identifier.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An apparatus for building a set of traceable messages through a network of nodes is provided, the apparatus comprising communication circuitry configured to receive message information corresponding to a first outbound message, the message information comprising a first source identifier and a first destination identifier and processing circuitry configured to determine whether the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages in a storage unit, whereby when the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages, the processing circuitry is configured to produce a trace request, the trace request comprising the first destination identifier and an identifier identifying the set of messages associated with the first source identifier.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A computer program product comprising instructions which, when the program is executed by a computer, cause the computer to carry out a method of tracing messages through a network of nodes is provided, the method comprising receiving message information corresponding to a first outbound message, the message information comprising a first source identifier and a first destination identifier and determining whether the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages in a storage unit, whereby when the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages, the method comprises producing a trace request, the trace request comprising the first destination identifier and an identifier identifying the set of messages associated with the first source identifier.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to embodiments of the disclosure, all those accounts and transactions associated with the fraudulent activity can be traced quickly and substantially in real time without the requirement for a central database, increasing the level of privacy and network security.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing paragraphs have been provided by way of general introduction, and are not intended to limit the scope of the following claims.

Typically, an apparatus <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the disclosure is a computer device such as a personal computer or a terminal connected to a server. Indeed, in embodiments, the apparatus may also be a server. The apparatus <b>100</b> is controlled using a microprocessor or other processing circuitry <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The processing circuitry <b>110</b> may be a microprocessor carrying out computer instructions or may be an Application Specific Integrated Circuit. The computer instructions are stored on storage medium <b>125</b> which may be a magnetically readable medium, optically readable medium or solid state type circuitry. The storage medium <b>125</b> may be integrated into the apparatus <b>100</b> or may be separate to the apparatus <b>100</b> and connected thereto using either a wired or wireless connection.

The user input <b>105</b> may also be a keyboard or any combination of these devices.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A network connection <b>115</b> is also coupled to the processor circuitry <b>110</b>. The network connection <b>115</b> may be a connection to a Local Area Network or a Wide Area Network such as the Internet or a Virtual Private Network or the like. The network connection <b>115</b> may be connected to banking infrastructure allowing the processor circuitry <b>110</b> to communicate with other banking institutions to obtain relevant data or provide relevant data to the institutions. The network connection <b>115</b> may therefore be behind a firewall or some other form of network security.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally coupled to the processing circuitry <b>110</b>, is a display device <b>120</b>.

In addition, the display device <b>120</b> may be a printer or some other device allowing relevant information generated by the apparatus <b>100</b> to be viewed by the user or by a third party.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a schematic diagram showing a fraudulent transaction is shown.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The embodiments of the present disclosure aim to trace the flow of funds subsequent to a fraudulent transaction. In particular, one aim of the present disclosure is to trace the funds in a very efficient and quick manner. This is important given the number of bank accounts through which the fraudulently obtained money flows and the speed at which the money flows the various accounts in a fraudster's network as well as the high number of non-fraud accounts that funds may flow to. This enables the possible recovery of the money and importantly the closure of bank accounts associated with fraudulent activity in a timely fashion.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a chart showing the dispersal of money from a fraudulent activity is shown. In particular, a victim <b>205</b> has &#xa3;100,000 stolen from their account using fraudulent means. For example, a fraudster may use one of a myriad of techniques in order to comprise the security of the account. The fraudster may contact the victim reporting to be a bank employee and to fraudulently obtain secret information which then allows the fraudster to illegally transfer &#xa3;100,000 from the victim's account.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Typically, the fraudster will utilise a transaction which allows money to be transferred between various bank accounts very quickly and within a matter of seconds or minutes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the fraudster transfers the &#xa3;100,000 of the victim's money as four transactions each of &#xa3;25,000. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, this is illustrated with &#xa3;25,000 being allocated to account <b>1</b> <b>210</b>A, account <b>2</b> <b>210</b>B, account <b>3</b> <b>210</b>C, and account <b>4</b> <b>210</b>D. These accounts may be in the same banking organisation or may be different banking organisations. Typically, this fraudulently obtained money may be mixed with other money located in the respective bank accounts. The other money in the respective bank accounts may be legitimate money or other fraudulent money. These bank accounts are the first generation of bank accounts associated with the fraudulent activity.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Within a few minutes of the money reaching the bank accounts in the first generation of accounts, the fraudsters then transfer the money to different bank accounts which are termed second generation bank accounts. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the fraudsters transfer &#xa3;10,000 from account <b>1</b> <b>210</b>A to account <b>5</b> <b>215</b>A and &#xa3;15,000 to account <b>8</b> <b>215</b>D. Similarly, the fraudsters transfer &#xa3;12,000 from account <b>2</b> <b>210</b>B to account <b>7</b> <b>215</b>C and &#xa3;13,000 to account <b>10</b> <b>215</b>F. The fraudsters transfer &#xa3;25,000 from account <b>3</b> <b>210</b>C transfers to account <b>6</b> <b>215</b>B. Finally, the fraudsters transfer &#xa3;25,000 from account <b>4</b> <b>210</b>D to account <b>9</b> <b>215</b>E.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As with the first generation bank accounts, each of the second generation bank accounts <b>215</b>A-<b>215</b>F may be with the same or different banking organisations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The process of transferring the money away then continues for possibly many generations of bank accounts. The purpose of the distribution of the money to various bank accounts is so that at a final step, the terminating bank accounts usually have smaller quantities of cash which may be extracted using an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) or may be used to purchase goods from a shop without arousing suspicion or extracted from the terminating bank account in some way. Nevertheless, given the speed at which the money can be distributed between fraudulent accounts, the initial &#xa3;100,000 stolen from victim <b>205</b> may be extracted and used within a few hours of the initial fraudulent transaction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is important to note that this does not mean that the first generation bank accounts or the second generation bank accounts have no money remaining after the transfer. Typically, the fraudster will use bank accounts having some other funds (either legitimate or illegitimate). This makes it very difficult to identify which of the money passed to the second generation bank account is associated with the initial fraudulent activity. It is therefore important to identify the bank accounts associated with fraudulent activity very quickly so that those accounts can be closed to frustrate the fraudster from performing similar fraudulent transactions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">This is especially the case since the transfer from the first generation bank accounts to the second generation bank accounts is usually carried out very quickly and within minutes of the initial fraudulent activity <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Tracing this stolen money is very difficult using known techniques. This is because banks will typically only see money entering one account and leaving the same account a short time later; there is no indication to the bank that these transactions are linked. Additionally, as banking regulations are very tightly controlled, it is difficult to obtain information pertaining to an individual's bank account. This means tracking the money after the fraudulent activity has taken place can be very difficult. This is especially the case if the bank accounts in the fraudulent network are located in different countries.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the network of accounts associated with the fraudulent transaction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, it will be apparent to the skilled person in the art, that the victim bank account is a root node of a network. Each bank account within the network is therefore a node of the network. The transaction transferring the money is therefore an edge of the network. This means that the skilled person in the art may consider the network as a graph and, therefore, may implement graph theory in analysing the network.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a flowchart explaining embodiments of the disclosure used to trace this fraudulent activity very quickly. The flowchart <b>300</b> starts at the start block <b>305</b>. The process moves to step <b>310</b>. In step <b>310</b>, a Breadth-First traversal of the network is carried out. In this type of traversal, the root node is processed first, then all of its children are processed next and then all of the children's children are processed next. In this traversal, in embodiments, a check is conducted at each node (bank account). This check determines whether the node is an end-point node. In other words, the check determines if the node is part of the fraudulent dispersal. The check of one account, according to embodiments, will be described with reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A brief description will follow set in the context of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The initiating fraudulent transaction from the victim account (the root node) to &#x201c;Acc <b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;Acc <b>2</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;Acc <b>3</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;Acc <b>4</b>&#x201d; (nodes) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is tracked. At each of these nodes, the check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is carried out as will be explained later to determine if any of the children nodes (Acc <b>1</b> to Acc <b>4</b>) is an end point node of the network.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Any children nodes which are end point nodes do not form part of the fraudulent dispersal and no further tracing of transactions from that end-point node will be carried out.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">On the other hand, for any of the first generation nodes which are not end point nodes, the transactions from each of the non-end point nodes are traced to a second generation of nodes (i.e. the children of those first generation nodes). These transactions may be time limited so that only transactions occurring within a period of time from the funds arriving in the account are traced. Examples of this time period include any period between 24 hours and 148 hours. As explained later, this period is statistically significant. The check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is then applied to each of these second generation nodes to see which, if any, of these second generation nodes are also part of the fraudulent dispersal.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, therefore, as all of the first generation nodes (Acc <b>1</b> to Acc <b>4</b>) are not end points, the check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is applied to each of the second generation nodes. In other words, the check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is applied to each of Acc <b>5</b>, Acc <b>6</b>, Acc <b>7</b>, Acc <b>8</b>, Acc <b>9</b> and Acc <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, embodiments of the disclosure are disclosed in the flow chart <b>400</b> which is a check applied to each node. This process is implemented, in embodiments, as computer readable code stored on storage medium <b>125</b>. The process is carried out on processor circuitry <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The process starts at step <b>405</b>. The process moves to step <b>410</b> where a first check is performed to determine whether the account under test (the node) has a predetermined number of account relationships. In some embodiments, the predetermined number is 500 or more account relationships. In this instance, an account relationship is set up between two accounts when a payer transfers money to a payee for the first time within the period of time of data stored in the process. This is an advantageous check because most large organisations, such as utility companies or local authority institutions (which are legitimate and so will not transfer fraudulent funds out of the account) have 500 or more account relationships. Of course, although in embodiments, 500 or more account relationships is chosen as the predetermined number, the disclosure is not so limited. The number may be less or more than this. However, it is noted here that the inventors have identified this number as being statistically significant.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, in step <b>410</b>, if the account has 500 or more account relationships, the yes path is followed to step <b>415</b> where it is determined that the account is an end node. The checking process then ends at step <b>435</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, if the account has less than 500 account relationships, the no path is followed to step <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">By performing this check, therefore, it is possible to quickly eliminate large organisations (which will not propagate the fraudulent money) from the remainder of check process. This reduces computational burden on the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and accelerates the checking of the node.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Returning to step <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a second decision is made. Specifically, it is determined whether there have been any transactions out of the account within a specified period of the incoming transaction to the node. For example, not only may a transaction in this instance include transferring money to another bank account, but a transaction may include a withdrawal of cash from an ATM, or a debit card purchase or the like.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In embodiments, the specified period is between 24 and 148 hours. This period is statistically significant because this identifies the typically rapid diffusion of fraudulent transactions whilst ignoring the natural flow of non-fraudulent transactions such as utility bill payments or the like. Of course other periods of time are envisaged such as 12 hours as well as various periods within this advantageous range of 24 to 148 hours.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the event that there have been outgoing transactions from the account within the specified period of time, the yes path is followed to step <b>425</b> and the account is determined to not be an end-point node. Alternatively, if there has not been outgoing transactions from the account within the period of time, the no path is followed to step <b>430</b> and the account is determined to be an end-point node.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">After step <b>425</b> or <b>430</b> has concluded, the flow chart moves to step <b>435</b> where the process ends.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be noted here that although the foregoing describes the check includes identifying the number of account relationships followed by determining that other outgoing transactions took place a predetermined time after the inbound transaction, the disclosure is not so limited.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, each of these checks may be performed on their own to assist in tracing the fraudulent accounts. This would still achieve the effect of quickly identifying the fraudulent accounts very quickly.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, or additionally, the ordering of the two-step check of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be performed in any order.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The checking process of embodiments described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is particularly advantageous in the field of fraud detection because the account(s) used in fraudulent transactions can be traced quickly. This allows financial institutions to be notified of accounts which are used in fraudulent and scamming activity so that money can be stopped leaving those accounts and ultimately those accounts can be closed.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, the checking process of embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> identifies large organisations which are not used to propagate fraudulent funds. By quickly identifying these organisations and determining that these are the end node, they are quickly removed from the tracing path. This reduces the number of nodes to be traced which reduces the time and computational resource required in tracing the money.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Once the accounts have been identified, this information is passed to the banks involved. It is important to pass this information to the banks quickly. This is because, as noted above, the banks will only ever see money being transferred into an account and money being transferred from an account. The link to fraudulent activity would only ever be identified to the bank much later on (if ever) using known techniques. However, by using embodiments of the disclosure, fraudulent activity is identified to the bank much more quickly. This information will be provided to the bank using the network connection <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Building a Set of Traceable Messages Through a Network in Real Time:</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As noted above, it is desirable to trace the dispersion of funds through a network as quickly as possible. This enables rapid identification of transactions and accounts which are associated with fraudulent activity. Accordingly, a method of building a set of traceable messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment which may be applied to the dispersion of funds through a network of financial institutions by transactions between bank accounts associated with those financial institutions is provided. According to this present embodiment, the dispersion of funds through the network is determined more quickly and is substantially in real time, enabling rapid identification of transactions and accounts related to a transaction or account which has been reported as being linked with fraudulent activity.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of building a set of traceable messages according to this embodiment of the disclosure. In this embodiment, since the messages sent through the network relate to transactions between bank accounts the information contained in these transactions is standardised. As such, each message, or transaction, comprises a source identifier (identifying the account from which the message is sent), a destination identifier (identifying the account to which the transaction is sent). The transaction information also comprises a value in seconds indicating the time of the transaction and a unique identifier of the transaction such as a transaction identifier.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the transactions between bank accounts can be considered as a stream consisting of a sequence of transactions between bank accounts. In an economy such as the UK, the number of transactions between accounts could reach a rate of around 300 transactions per second. The method according to the present embodiment converts the stream of transactions between accounts into a set of connected transactions, tracing the transfer of funds through the network. When a transaction from the stream of transactions is received, the method according to the present embodiment comprises determining a set of previous transactions through the network with which the received transaction is associated. The set of previous transactions may be referred to as a dispersion tree, as is explained in more detail below. In other words, for each transaction which is received (identified in this example by a unique identifier txn_id), an outbound message is produced which describes the set of previous messages or transactions the received transaction belongs to or is a member of.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts the connections between a set of bank accounts according to the present embodiment. In contrast to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the source bank account <b>5020</b> does not necessarily relate to a bank account which has been reported as fraudulent, nor do the transactions <b>5010</b> between the accounts correspond to fraudulent transactions between these accounts. Rather, a set of connected transactions of funds through the network form a separate set of transactions within the network. That is, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the set of transactions between accounts originating with account <b>5020</b> (indicated with the empty circles) form a first set of connected transactions <b>5040</b>. In contrast, the set of transactions starting with a transaction from account <b>5060</b> form a second set of connected transactions <b>5080</b> (indicated by the filed circles). The transaction between accounts <b>5100</b> and <b>5120</b> may therefore belong to both set of connected transactions <b>5040</b> and set of connected transactions <b>5080</b> since accounts <b>5100</b> and <b>5120</b> are linked with both sets of transactions.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the stream of transactions is processed as each transaction is received. Accordingly, the transactions are identified and the set of traceable transactions are produced quickly and substantially in real time.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When an account, or transaction, is reported as being linked with fraudulent activity, the method according to the present embodiment enables all those accounts and transactions associated with the fraudulent activity to be rapidly identified. This enables financial institutions be notified very quickly of other accounts and transactions which are associated with fraudulent and scamming activity, such that money can be stopped leaving those accounts and ultimately those accounts can be closed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Building a Set of Traceable Messages:</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a method of building a set of traceable messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment of the disclosure. Step S<b>6020</b> comprises receiving message information corresponding to a first message, the message information comprising a first source identifier and a first destination identifier. Step S<b>6040</b> comprises determining whether the source identifier is associated with a previous set of messages. When the first source identifier is associated with a set of previous messages, the method comprises identifying the first message as also belonging to the set of previous messages in step S<b>6060</b>. When the first source identifier is not associated with a set of previous messages, the method comprises identifying the first message as belonging to a new set of messages in step S<b>6080</b>. Then, in step S<b>6100</b>, the method comprises associating the first destination identifier with the set of messages to which the first message belongs, such that if a second message is sent from that destination, the second message will be identified as belonging to that set of messages.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The method steps S<b>6020</b> to S<b>6100</b> are described in detail below, with reference to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the messages referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may relate to transactions between a network of bank accounts, and as such, a set of previous messages corresponds to a set of connected transactions tracking the dispersion of a set of funds through the accounts of the network.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this example, each bank account within the network is therefore a node of the network. The transaction transferring the money is therefore an edge of the network. This means that the skilled person in the art may consider the network as a graph and, therefore, may implement graph theory in analysing the network. Accordingly, a set of previous messages or transactions represents a tree, and may be referred to as a dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As previously stated, in this example, the stream of transactions is consumed transaction by transaction substantially in real time. For each transaction that is received, a single outbound message is produced which describes which dispersion tree, or set of previous messages or transactions, the received transaction belongs to or is a member of. In order to identify the dispersion tree to which an inbound transaction belongs, the method according to the present embodiment produces and maintains a set of leaves, or end points of the dispersion trees, in a storage unit A:</p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>A</i>: account_<i>id</i>&#x2192;tree_<i>id </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0087" num="0000">where account_id is a unique identifier which identifies the bank accounts which are part of the banking network, and tree_id is an identifier which identifies the dispersion trees as described above. After receiving transaction information in step S<b>6020</b>, the account_id of the bank account from which the transaction is sent, the source identifier, is checked for presence in the storage unit A in step S<b>6040</b>. This could be, for example, through a lookup of the source identifier in the storage unit A. It will be appreciated that the function used to perform this lookup is not particularly limited in this regard. It will further be appreciated that the account identifier according to the present example may relate to any unique identifier or combination of identifiers which identify the account to which they belong, and is not particularly limited in this regard. The method then proceeds to step S<b>6060</b> or step S<b>6080</b> according to the result of this determination.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">When it is found that the source identifier is associated with a dispersion tree in the storage unit A, then, in step S<b>6060</b>, the dispersion tree with which that source identifier is associated in the storage unit A will be retrieved, and the transaction will be identified as also belonging to that dispersion tree. That is, according to the present example, the single outbound message describing which dispersion tree the received transaction belongs to may be produced at this stage.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">However, when it is determined that the source identifier is not associated with a dispersion tree in the storage unit A, then, in step S<b>6080</b>, the method comprises identifying the first message as belonging to a new set of messages. That is, since the received transaction originated from an account which is not stored in the storage unit A, and thus is not associated with any previous dispersion trees, then it is determined that the transaction represents the start of a new dispersion of funds through the banking network. Therefore, a new dispersion tree is created, having a new dispersion tree identifier (tree_id), and the received transaction is identified as belonging to this new dispersion tree. That is, according to the present example, the single outbound message describing which dispersion tree the received transaction belongs to may be produced at this stage.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">The new tree_id may be generated in accordance with transaction information corresponding to the received transaction. For example, the new tree_id may be generated based upon a unique transaction identifier identifying the received transaction or the like.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">Once the received transaction has been identified as belonging either to a previous dispersion tree or a new dispersion tree as described above, the method proceeds to step S<b>6100</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">In step S<b>6100</b>, the account_id of the bank account to which the transaction is sent, the destination identifier, is then added to the storage unit A, being mapped against the dispersion tree to which the transaction has been identified as belonging. That is, if the transaction has been identified as belonging to a previous dispersion tree then the destination identifier be mapped against the previous dispersion tree, whereas if the transaction has been identified as belonging to a new dispersion tree the destination identifier will be mapped against the new dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">Accordingly, if a further transaction is sent from the account having the account_id corresponding to the destination identifier of the first transaction, then the second message will also be identified as belonging to that dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">As will be appreciated from the above described example, the method of building a set of traceable messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment therefore requires only a single lookup in the storage A for each transaction which is received. That is, regardless of the size of the stream of transactions, each individual transaction triggers only a single lookup of the source identifier in the storage unit A in order to retrieve any dispersion tree identifiers with which the source identifier is associated. This enables the identification of a dispersion tree to which a transaction belongs to be performed quickly and substantially in real time as the stream of transactions is consumed. As such, if a transaction is subsequently reported as a transaction of interest, being linked to fraudulent activity for example, then accounts or transactions which are associated with that reported transaction can quickly be identified, since the dispersion tree has already been created as the stream of transactions is consumed; thus increasing the speed at which related fraudulent activity is recognised and reducing the computational burden upon the network.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">The method according to the present embodiment may be performed on an apparatus (or alternatively a server) as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As previously stated, this apparatus <b>100</b> is controlled using a microprocessor or other processing circuitry <b>110</b>. The apparatus is connected to the network and is able to receive transaction information from each node of the network. For each transaction of the stream of transactions the apparatus <b>100</b> performs the method steps S<b>6020</b> to S<b>6100</b> according to the present embodiment in order that the identification of the dispersion tree to which the transaction belongs can be performed quickly and substantially in real time.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Exemplary Messages and Transactions</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a set of exemplary messages according to this embodiment of the disclosure. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when considering a transaction between two accounts, there are four distinct possibilities: A) neither source account or the destination account belongs to a previous dispersion tree; B) the source account belongs to a previous dispersion tree, but the destination account does not belong to a previous dispersion tree; C) the source account does not belong to a previous dispersion tree but the destination account belongs to a previous dispersion tree and D) both the source account and the destination account belongs to a previous dispersion tree. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an account associated with a previous dispersion tree is illustrated with a filed circle, while an account which is not associated with a previous dispersion tree is illustrated by an empty circle. Each of these situations will be considered with reference to the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">Consider now the first situation A), where neither the source account <b>7000</b> nor the destination account <b>7002</b> belongs to a dispersion tree. The transaction information comprising the source identifier <b>7000</b> and the destination identifier <b>7004</b> is received in step S<b>6020</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The method according to the present embodiment then comprises determining whether the source identifier (identifying the account from which the transaction is sent) belongs to a previous set of messages or not. In this example, as stated above, the source identifier does not belong to a dispersion tree; that is, the source identifier is not associated with a dispersion tree in a storage device A storing a mapping of account identifiers to dispersion trees. Accordingly, the method proceeds to step S<b>6080</b>. In step S<b>6080</b>, since the source identifier is not associated with a previous dispersion tree, it is determined that the transaction represents the start of a new dispersion of funds (linked transactions) throughout the network. Accordingly, a new dispersion tree is generated. In this example, the generation of a new dispersion is achieved by generating a new dispersion tree identifier with which the subsequent transactions belonging to that dispersion tree will be associated. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the transaction is identified as belonging to a new dispersion tree with identifier <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">Furthermore, in this example, the destination account <b>7002</b> will then be associated with the dispersion tree to which the transaction between accounts <b>7000</b> and <b>7002</b> belongs. That is, an association between the destination identifier and the dispersion tree identifier generated in step S<b>6080</b> will be stored in the storage unit A, such that if further transactions are sent from that account, those transactions will also be identified as belonging to the same dispersion tree as account <b>7002</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">Consider now the example B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, where the source account <b>7004</b> does not belong to a known dispersion tree, but the destination account <b>7006</b> does belong to a known dispersion tree. In this example, the transaction information comprising the source identifier and the destination identifier is received in step S<b>6020</b>. In this exemplary situation, as described with reference to the first situation A) above, the source identifier identifying the source account <b>7004</b> is not associated with a previous set of transactions. Therefore, again as described with reference to the first situation A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the method comprises identifying that the transaction represents the start of a new dispersion tree, or set of transactions, of funds through the network of accounts in step S<b>6080</b>. The new dispersion tree is identified by the identifier <b>2</b> in this example.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In this example however, the destination account <b>7006</b> already belongs to a previous dispersion tree (illustrated as dispersion tree <b>1</b>). Since the transaction has been identified as belonging to dispersion tree <b>2</b>, the destination account <b>7006</b> therefore forms a part of both the previous dispersion tree <b>1</b> and the new dispersion tree <b>2</b> generated in step S<b>6080</b>. Accordingly, the destination account <b>7006</b> is then associated with the dispersion tree <b>2</b> in step S<b>6100</b>. However, this does not remove the association between the destination account and the previous dispersion tree <b>1</b>. Rather, the destination account <b>7006</b> is then associated with a plurality of dispersion trees. As such, in this example, if a further transaction is generated from the account <b>7006</b> then that transaction will be associated with both the dispersion trees <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. According to the present embodiment, in the case that a certain condition is satisfied, two separate dispersion trees may be combined into a single resultant dispersion tree.

For example, in the case of a banking network, if a transaction has been reported as fraudulent, or has been linked to a fraudulent account, then it is necessary to rapidly identify other transactions which are associated with that banking transaction or account. This is important because once accounts linked with the fraudulent activity have been identified those accounts can be closed to frustrate the fraudster from performing similar fraudulent transactions.

Upon receiving a unique identifier of the transaction between bank accounts <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b>, which has been reported as fraudulent, the method according to the present embodiment comprises performing a single lookup for that transaction in the storage unit B.

Typically, owing to the limited number of lookups required in response to a fraudulent transaction being reported, the identification of the linked transactions can be performed in a matter of milliseconds. As such those accounts linked with the fraudulent transaction can be rapidly closed or deactivated in order to frustrate the fraudster from performing any further fraudulent transactions.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Additional Modifications of the Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0139">As described above, when an account associated with a dispersion tree, it may be advantageous to include a timer such that only transactions from that account which occur within a predetermine time of the given transaction are identified as belonging to the same dispersion tree. Typically, as described above, the timer may be set to any value in period is between 24 and 148 hours for example. This period is statistically significant because this identifies the typically rapid diffusion of fraudulent transactions whilst ignoring the natural flow of non-fraudulent transactions such as utility bill payments or the like. Once all the accounts associated with a given dispersion tree have been removed from the mapping in storage A, no further transactions in the stream of transactions can be identified as belonging to that dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">Accordingly if, after a predetermined time, a dispersion tree is associated with only a single transaction, then it can be determined that no further transactions can be associated with that dispersion tree. For example, if after a predetermined time of a tree_id being added to the storage unit C that tree_id is mapped only to a single txn_id, then it can be determined that no further txn_id will be added to the mapping. It will be appreciated that the predetermined time can be set at any time, but should be set in accordance with the time set for the first timer associated with that dispersion tree described above.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">Once it has been determined that no further transactions can be associated with that tree_id, and that tree_id is mapped to only a single txn_id in the storage unit, then the method according to the present embodiment may comprise removing from C the corresponding tree_id. Furthermore, at this time, the method comprises removing from B the corresponding single txn_id which was associated with that tree_id. The data stored in B and C is thus reduced.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">Consider the case whereby a txn_id which has been removed from the mapping stored in B is subsequently reported as being linked to a fraudulent activity. According to the present embodiment, a single lookup will subsequently be performed in B in order to identify the dispersion tree with which that fraudulent transaction is identified; this dispersion tree would then be used in order to identify all the transactions which are associated through a lookup of that dispersion tree in the storage C. However, upon performing the initial lookup in B in response to the fraudulent activity being reported, no dispersion tree would be returned since the txn_id has been removed from the mapping stored in B. According to the present embodiment, it can then be determined that no further transactions occurred within the predetermined time of the fraudulent transaction or fraudulent activity. That is, it can be determined that no further fraudulent transactions are associated with that fraudulent transaction or fraudulent activity.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143">By removing the mapping between the from the txn_id and tree_id from the storage units B and C respectively, it is possible to significantly reduce the storage requirements necessary to perform the method of building a set of traceable messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment. Consider, for example, the stream of transactions between bank accounts in the UK. As previously stated, in an economy such as the UK, the number of transactions between accounts could reach a rate of around 300 transactions per second. Moreover, of these transactions, the vast number will be transactions of the kind above whereby, after a predetermined time, they are the only transaction associated with a given dispersion tree. As such, by removing these transactions and corresponding dispersion trees from the storage units Band C as according to the present embodiment, the storage requirements according to the present embodiment can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0144">While the method according to the present embodiment has been described with reference to financial transactions between bank accounts in a banking network such as that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that present disclosure is not so limited in this respect. That is, the messages according to the present embodiment could relate to any type of financial transaction between bank accounts or financial institutions made by any method such as Faster Payments, BACS transfers or the like. Alternatively, the method according to the present embodiment could be used to construct a set of traceable messages with relation to any message or transaction, and is not so limited to financial transactions. For example, the method according to the present embodiment could be applied to building a set of traceable messages through a mobile communications network or the like.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0145">Tracing Messages Through a Network of Nodes Using a Trace Request:</p><p id="p-0152" num="0146">As noted above, it is desirable to trace the dispersion of funds through a network as quickly as possible.

Accordingly a method for tracing a set of messages through a network of nodes is provided. The method of tracing messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment may be applied to the dispersion of funds through a network of financial institutions by transactions between bank accounts associated with those financial institutions. According to the present embodiment, the dispersion of funds through the network is determined quickly and substantially in real time, as the stream of transactions is received. Furthermore, according to this embodiment of the disclosure, the method of tracing messages can be applied by to a distributed system of nodes such that each the identification of the messages is performed locally at each node without the requirement for a central node or database thus reducing the integration costs and increasing network privacy and security.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary application of the method of tracing messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment of the disclosure.

That is, each of the respective financial institutions is in communication with, and capable of sending and receiving transactions to and from, all the other financial institutions in the network. Furthermore, each of the financial institutions may have a plurality of bank accounts associated with it. As such, for example, a transaction may be sent from a bank account associated with financial institution <b>1204</b> to a bank account associated with financial institution <b>1208</b> or <b>1212</b> respectively. It will also be appreciated that a transaction may relate to a transaction between two bank accounts associated with the same financial institution.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">Each of the financial institutions <b>1202</b>, <b>1206</b> and <b>1210</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be located in the same geographical area, or may alternatively be located in different geographical areas having distinct legislative or regulatory restrictions. That is, while the financial institutions are in communication with each other, such that transactions may be exchanged between them, there is no restriction upon the geographical locations of those institutions. By means of an example, financial institution <b>1202</b> may be located within a geographical area such as the UK, while financial institution <b>1206</b> or <b>1210</b> may be located in a different geographical area such as the USA. By providing the method according to the present embodiment in this distributed manner, the respective data held and processed by each financial institution can be governed by the legislative or regulatory restrictions of the area in which the financial institution is located, without any requirement to transfer the data or information to a central node or database of an analytics provider.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0149">That is there is no central node which performs the method of building a set of traceable messages as transactions are sent between the financial institutions. Rather, each financial institution is in communication with a local device belonging to that financial institution. That is, financial institution <b>1202</b> is in communication with device <b>1204</b>, financial institution <b>1206</b> is in communication with device <b>1208</b> and financial institution <b>1210</b> is in communication with device <b>1212</b>. The device may be integrated within the respective financial institution, or may be located outside the financial institution as illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. It will be appreciated that this device may be a device such as the device or apparatus described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0150">All the transactions which a financial institution such as <b>1202</b> engages in are notified to the respective device <b>1204</b>. That is, when the financial institution <b>1202</b> sends a transaction to financial institution <b>1206</b>, the device <b>1204</b> will be notified of transaction information regarding the sent transaction. Conversely, when financial institution <b>1206</b> receives the transaction, the device <b>1208</b> will be notified of transaction information regarding the received transaction. However, financial institution <b>1210</b> and corresponding device <b>1212</b> will not receive any notification of this transaction or transaction information at this stage. Accordingly, the devices <b>1204</b>, <b>1208</b> and <b>1212</b> receive transaction information relating to each transaction in which the corresponding financial institution participates.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">As previously stated, in an economy such as the UK, the number of transactions between accounts could reach a rate of around 300 transactions per second. Accordingly, when a transaction is identified as belonging to fraudulent activity it becomes difficult to identify other transactions with which that transaction is associated. This is, in part, because banks will typically only see money entering one account and leaving the same account a short time later; there is no indication to the bank that these transactions are linked. Additionally, as banking regulations are very tightly controlled, it is difficult to obtain information pertaining to an individual's bank account. This means tracking the money after the fraudulent activity has taken place can be very difficult. This is especially the case if the bank accounts in the fraudulent network are located in different countries.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0152">Furthermore, typically, the fraudster will utilise a transaction which allows money to be transferred between various bank accounts very quickly and within a matter of seconds or minutes. As such, once a transaction has been reported as fraudulent, it is necessary to rapidly identify the accounts and transactions linked with that fraudulent transaction, such that action can be taken to frustrate the fraudster from preforming further fraudulent transactions.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153">According to the present embodiment, when a bank or financial institution engages in a transaction, the device associated with that financial institution identifies a set of previous messages or transactions with which the transaction is associated. For example, as the financial institution <b>1202</b> engages in a stream of transactions, the device <b>1204</b> determines quickly and substantially in real time the set of previous transactions with which each transaction is identified. As such, quickly and substantially in real time, the financial institutions build a graph of the dispersion of funds through the network. In this example, each financial institution within the network is therefore a node of the network. As described above, the skilled person in the art may consider the network as a graph and, therefore, may implement graph theory in analysing the transactions between accounts in the network. Accordingly, a set of previous messages or transactions represents a tree of the dispersion of funds through the network, and may be referred to as a dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154">According to this embodiment of the disclosure, each financial institution constructs and stores only a portion of the dispersion tree that represents the flow of funds, via transactions between accounts, through the network <b>1200</b> as a whole. That is, in this example, the device <b>1204</b> associated with financial institution <b>1202</b> will know of and construct the portion of total dispersion tree of the network which relates to the transactions which financial institution <b>1202</b> has engaged in, while device <b>1208</b> will know of and construct the portion of the total dispersion tree of the network relating to the transactions in which financial institution <b>1206</b> has participated.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0155">In response to a transaction being reported as a fraudulent transaction, the person interested in obtaining information regarding transactions related to that fraudulent transaction may therefore send a request across the network <b>1200</b>. In response to receiving the request, the device connected to each financial institution may, as described in more detail below, provide information relating to the corresponding part of the dispersion tree which it holds. Accordingly, in this example, in response to a fraudulent transaction being reported, it is possible to rapidly identify any transactions or accounts related to a transaction or account which has been reported as being linked with fraudulent activity.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0156">Owing to the method of tracing messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment, the requirement for a centralised database and device is removed. As such, even if a single node or nodes are unavailable (owing to system failure or the like) at least a portion of the dispersion tree relating to a transaction of interest can still be obtained. Accordingly, since there is no single point of failure in the network, the robustness of the network is improved. In addition, since the information corresponding to the messages, such as the transaction information according to the present example, is controlled at the local level by each individual financial institution, enhanced levels of privacy and network security can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0157">Furthermore, the method of tracing messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment requires no additional data sharing agreements between the nodes of the network, since the only additional information communicated across the network is the dispersion tree identifier. As such, the implementation costs and data sharing agreements required for tracing messages through a network of nodes is reduced.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0158">The method according to the present embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0159">Tracing Messages Through a Network of Nodes:</p><p id="p-0166" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a method of tracing messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment of the disclosure. Step <b>1302</b> comprises receiving message information corresponding to a first outbound message, the message information comprising a first source identifier and a first destination identifier; step <b>1304</b> comprises determining whether the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages in a storage unit. Step <b>1306</b> comprises producing a trace request, the trace request comprising the first destination identifier and an identifier identifying the set of messages associated with the first source identifier when it is determined in step <b>1304</b> that the when the first source identifier is associated with a set of messages.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0161">As described above, in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the messages referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> may relate to transactions between a network of bank accounts. In this case, a set of previous messages corresponds to a set of connected transactions tracking the dispersion of a set of funds through the accounts of the network. In such an example, the information contained in a transaction between the bank accounts of one or more financial institutions must include a source account identifier (identifying the account from which the transaction originates) a destination account identifier (identifying the account to which the transaction is made), the time of the transaction and a unique transaction identifier which can be used in order to identify the transaction.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0162">Outbound Transaction</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">When a bank account associated with a financial institution <b>1202</b> generates a transaction, referred to as an outbound transaction, the transaction information is sent to the corresponding device <b>1204</b>. Upon receiving this transaction information (step S<b>1302</b>), the device must then determine whether the source identifier (the account from which the transaction originates) is associated with a set of messages stored in the storage unit (step S<b>1304</b>). That is, the device will determine whether the account has transaction is to be associated with a previous dispersion of funds through the network.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">When it is determined that the account is a traced account, that is, an account which is associated with a previous dispersion tree, then the device produces a trace request, the trace request comprising the first destination identifier (the account to which the message is being sent) and the dispersion tree identifier which is associated with the source identifier in the storage unit (step S<b>1306</b>). This trace request is subsequently sent to the financial institution receiving the transaction.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0165">According to the present embodiment, for each message which is produced by a financial institution which is associated with a previous set of transactions, a corresponding trace request is produced which associates the destination account with that previous set of transactions.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0166">As previously stated, in this example, the stream of transactions is consumed by each device (<b>1204</b>, <b>1208</b>, <b>1212</b>) as each transaction is generated quickly and substantially in real time. That is, a state is maintained at each device, mapping each account belonging to that financial institution to any corresponding dispersion trees. The mapping is stored in a storage unit A:</p><p id="p-0173" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>A=a</i>&#x2192;[tree_<i>id</i><sub>1</sub>,tree_<i>id</i><sub>2</sub>, . . . ]<i>a&#x3f5;B </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0174" num="0167">where a is an unique identifier of a bank account, tree_id is a unique identifier of a dispersion tree and B is the sent of accounts which belong to the corresponding financial institution. Therefore, if there is an outbound transaction with an account identifier stored in a (being an account which belongs to the set of account associated with that financial institution), then the method according to the present embodiment comprises determining the dispersion tree identifiers associated with that transaction, and producing a trace request with the destination identifier and any dispersion identifiers associated with that transaction. It will be appreciated that where a source account identifier is associated with a plurality of dispersion tree identifiers, the trace request will comprise the destination identifier and each of the plurality of dispersion tree identifiers which are associated with the destination identifier in A. Furthermore, at this stage, the transaction is identified as belonging to the dispersion tree with which the source account has been identified. This identification could be stored at the source financial institution or the receiving financial institution.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0168">In this manner, if an account is associated with a previous dispersion tree, the financial institution which receives the transaction will be informed of that association such that the dispersion of the funds throughout the network may be tracked quickly and substantially in real time. If further transactions are then sent from that destination account, then they will also be identified as belonging to the same dispersion tree as the original transaction and source identifier. In other words, by producing a trace request comprising a first destination identifier and a dispersion tree identifier as according to the present embodiment, the dispersion of funds through the network can be tracked locally at each node of the network leading to enhanced levels of privacy and network security.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Exemplary Modes of Tracking Dispersion</heading><p id="p-0176" num="0169">In some exemplary applications of the present embodiment, the method may comprise tracking all dispersion of funds through the network. In this case, if the source account is not associated with a previous set of messages a trace request comprising the first destination identifier and the identifier identifying the new set of messages will be produced. That is, where the account from which the transaction is being sent is not associated with a previous dispersion tree, then it is determined that the transaction relates to a new dispersion of funds through the network and a new dispersion tree is created having a new dispersion tree identifier (that is, a new tree_id). The identifier for this new dispersion tree is then included in the trace request which is produced according to the present embodiment in response to the outbound transaction.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0170">The new tree_id may be generated in accordance with transaction information corresponding to the outbound transaction. For example, the new tree_id may be generated based upon a unique transaction identifier identifying the received transaction or the like.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0171">In this example, each transaction for which the source identifier is not already associated with a dispersion tree in the storage unit A of the given bank or financial institution is treated as a trace request. That is, for each transaction for which the source identifier is not already associated with a dispersion tree in the storage unit A, a new tree_id will be created.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0172">In other exemplary applications of the present embodiment, it may only be required to trace the dispersion of funds through the network where those funds (or the account with which they are associated) have been identified as of particular interest. Such an exemplary application would be tracking only the dispersion of funds related to reported transactions or accounts (such as those which have been associated with fraudulent activity) through the network. In this case, if the source account of the outbound transaction is not associated with any previous dispersion tree, a trace request will not be produced. That is, a new tree_id will not be created, since the transaction between accounts is not a transaction of interest. In this manner, only dispersion of funds from accounts which have been indicated as accounts of interest will be traced through the network, reducing the total storage requirements of the network in order to trace the dispersion of funds through the network</p><p id="p-0180" num="0173">Inbound Transaction:</p><p id="p-0181" num="0174">According to the present embodiment, the trace request (or information regarding the destination identifier and the dispersion tree identifier as described above) is produced in response to an outbound transaction (that is, a transaction initiated with the financial institution with which the device that generates the trace request is associated). As such, when the transaction is received at the financial institution which owns the bank account to which the transaction is being sent, that financial institution will also receive the trace request which was generated by the method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> described above.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0175">When a trace request is received, the method according to the present embodiment comprises storing an association between the account identifier and the dispersion tree contained in the trace request in the storage unit A of that financial institution. That is, when a trace request is received, the mapping between that account and dispersion tree is added to the mapping stored in the storage unit A. If that account is already associated with previous dispersion trees, then the new association is added to that previous association. In this manner, it will be appreciated that a given account may be identified as being associated with a plurality of dispersion trees. However, if that account is not already associated with any previous dispersion trees, then a new association will be created in the storage unit A.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0176">In some examples according to the present embodiment, the receiving financial institution may store the identification of the received transaction in a storage unit. That is, a mapping between a unique identifier of the transaction, and the dispersion tree with which that transaction has been identified as belonging may be stored in a storage unit by the receiving financial institution or the device associated with that financial institution. However, as stated above, the storage of this identification could alternatively, or in addition, be stored by the financial institution or device linked to that financial institution from which the transaction was initiated.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0177">In this manner, any further transactions which are sent from that account will also be associated with that previous dispersion tree.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Exemplary Transaction</heading><p id="p-0185" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary transaction between two financial institutions according to the present embodiment.

Upon receiving the transaction information, the device then determines whether the source account identifier is associated with a previous dispersion tree. That is, the device performs a single lookup in the storage unit A<sub>1 </sub>in order to determine whether any mapping exists between the source account identifier a and any tree_id stored in the storage unit. It will be appreciated that the method or function used in order to determine whether any mapping exists between the source account identifier and any dispersion tree identifier stored in the storage unit is not particularly limited in this respect.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0180">In this example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, it is determined that a mapping does exist.

The device <b>1400</b> may be provided with the message information before, concurrently or immediately after the transaction between financial institution <b>1400</b> and financial institution <b>1404</b> has been sent. That is, given that the method according to the present embodiment requires a single lookup in A in order to determine any tree_id associated with the source account identifier, the production of the trace request occurs on a timescale much shorter than that of the transaction between <b>1400</b> and <b>1404</b> itself. Accordingly, even if the device <b>1400</b> is provided with the transaction information immediately after the transaction is sent, a trace request can still be produced and sent to <b>1404</b> before the transaction itself has been processed.

However, in other examples of the present embodiment, the method comprises only tracing the dispersion of transactions and funds where an account has been identified as an account of interest. In this example, if a transaction is sent from an account which is not associated with a previous dispersion tree, then no trace request will be produced.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0189">It will be appreciated that an account of interest could, for example, be an account that has been linked to fraudulent activity such as fraudulent transactions or the like.

In this example, this is determined by the financial institution <b>1202</b>. Financial institution <b>1202</b> then reports that the account has been reported as fraudulent to the device <b>1204</b> in the form of a trace initiation request. The trace initiation request comprises a unique account identifier identifying the account which has been linked to the fraudulent activity. Upon receiving this account identifier the device <b>1204</b> according to the present embodiment subsequently generates an identifier corresponding to a new set of messages.

For example, the new tree_id may be generated based upon a unique transaction identifier identifying the received transaction or the like.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0194">Once the tree_id has been generated, the method then comprises storing an association between the reported account identifier from the trace initiation request with the tree_id linked to the new set of messages in the storage unit A linked to that financial institution. As such, any further transactions which are sent from that account will be associated as belonging to the same dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0195">In this manner, a request can be made to trace the dispersion of funds from an account linked to suspicious or fraudulent activity. The dispersion from that account can then be traced quickly and substantially in real time in a distributed manner without the requirement for a central database according to the method of the present embodiment increasing the level of privacy and network security.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0196">Application of a Timer:</p><p id="p-0204" num="0197">According to the above described method, once an account has been identified as belonging to a given dispersion tree, any further transaction from that account will be identified as belonging to that dispersion tree also. As such, a transaction from that account which occurs even after an extended period of time, such as several weeks or months after, will be associated as also belonging to that dispersion tree. However, in the example relating to the dispersion of funds through a banking network, as described above, typically, the fraudster will utilise a transaction which allows money to be transferred between various bank accounts very quickly such as within a matter of seconds or minutes for example. Therefore, in this situation, transactions which occur after a predetermined time has expired are not likely connected to the same dispersal of fraudulent funds through a network.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0198">In accordance with the present embodiment, the method may further comprise setting a first timer which will remove the association between the first account identifier and the set of messages after a predetermined time. That is, according to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, when the trace request is received by financial institution <b>1404</b>, and the mapping between the account identifier and tree_id in the trace request is created, then a timer is set which will remove the association between that account identifier and tree_id after a predetermined time has expired.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0199">In certain examples, the timer which will remove the association between the account and the dispersion tree may be set to any value in period is between 24 and 148 hours. This period is statistically significant because this identifies the typically rapid diffusion of fraudulent transactions whilst ignoring the natural flow of non-fraudulent transactions such as utility bill payments or the like. Of course other periods of time are envisaged such as 12 hours as well as various periods within this advantageous range of 24 to 148 hours for example.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0200">Accordingly, if further transactions are sent from that account after the predetermined time has elapsed, then those transactions will not be associated with the dispersion tree identified by tree_id. Rather, in the case of tracing all dispersion, a new dispersion tree and tree_id will be created and associated with that account.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0201">Each mapping in A between an account identifier a and a dispersion tree identifier tree_id may be associated with its own timer. Furthermore, if a further trace request is received comprising the account identifier a and the dispersion tree identifier tree_id before the timer associated with that mapping has expired, then the timer associated with that mapping will be reset. As such, further transactions from that account will continue to be linked with that dispersion tree, since that account is still active within the dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0202">When the timer expires, and the association between tree_id and a is removed, if it is determined that no further dispersion trees are associated with a in the storage unit A for that device, then a will also be removed from that storage unit. Use of the timer in this manner reduces the storage space required to trace messages through a network of nodes according to the present embodiment. It will be appreciated that storage of the identification between the transaction and the dispersion tree remains in the storage unit, such that the transactions associated with a given dispersion tree or set of previous transactions may be identified at a later stage as required.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0203">Furthermore, using a timer to remove the association between the account and dispersion tree according to the present embodiment further improves the ability to track fraudulent transactions through a banking network quickly and substantially in real time, since only transactions which occur within a statistically significant period will be identified as belonging to the same dispersion tree.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0204">Information Request:</p><p id="p-0212" num="0205">The method according to the present embodiment of the disclosure enables the transactions or messages between a network of nodes to be traced quickly and substantially in real time without the need for a central node or database.

At this stage, it is necessary to rapidly identify the dispersal of the funds from the fraudulent activity through the banking network, such that those accounts which are linked with the fraudulent activity can be identified and closed, for example, preventing the fraudsters from preforming any more transactions from that account.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0207">Consider, for example, that financial institution <b>1202</b> determines that an account a has been linked with fraudulent activity, and wishes to determine all the transactions which are associated with that account. Financial institution <b>1202</b> can only retrieve from device <b>1204</b> the subset of those transactions which have been sent or received by the financial institution <b>1202</b>, and can not ascertain all those accounts or transactions in the wider network which may be associated with that transaction by virtue of belonging to the same dispersion tree identified by a unique tree_id.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0208">As such, at this stage, the method according to the device associated with that financial institution transmits an information request across the network. In this example of the present embodiment, the information request comprises the unique tree_id which the reported account has been identified as being associated with. It will be appreciated that where that account is associated with a plurality of dispersion tree identifiers in the storage associated with financial institution <b>1202</b>, the information request will comprise the plurality of dispersion tree identifiers instead of the single tree_id.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0209">Once an information request has been received, by device <b>1208</b> for example, then the method according to the present embodiment comprises producing a list of the account identifiers associated with that dispersion tree identifier in the storage unit. This list of accounts will then be reported back to the device <b>1204</b> of the financial institution <b>1202</b> which made the initiation request. Alternatively, or in addition, upon receiving the information request, the method according to the present embodiment may comprise producing a list of those transactions associated with the dispersion tree identifier in the received information request which are held by that financial institution or corresponding device, and returning that list to the device <b>1204</b> or the financial institution <b>1202</b> which made the initiation request.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0210">It will be appreciated that the information request may comprise a unique account identifier of the account which has been reported as fraudulent. In this case, the unique account identifier is used to retrieve any related accounts or transactions from the financial institutions in the network</p><p id="p-0218" num="0211">Each device (<b>1202</b>, <b>1208</b>, <b>1212</b>) in the network receives the information request, and by producing a list of the associated accounts or transactions as according to the present embodiment, it is possible to construct the full dispersion tree for account throughout the network. That is, all those accounts or transactions which are associated with the fraudulent account or transaction can be rapidly identified.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0212">That is, because the dispersion of funds through the network has been constructed quickly and substantially in real time using the method according to the present embodiment, when a transaction has been reported as fraudulent no further calculations are required in order to trace the dispersion of funds through the network. Rather, the connected transactions can simply be retrieved through a small number of lookups performed by each financial institution or associated device. Typically, owing to the limited number of lookups required in response to a fraudulent transaction being reported, the identification of the linked transactions can be performed in a matter of milliseconds. As such those accounts linked with the fraudulent transaction can be rapidly closed or deactivated in order to frustrate the fraudster from performing any further fraudulent transactions.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0213">It will be appreciated that the level of disclosure which each financial institution wishes to provide in response to an information request can be determined by each financial institution, and this may vary in accordance with the entity which makes the information request. For example, if the information request originates from an institution with which the device receiving the information request has a high level of trust, then the device may provide additional transaction data with the list of linked accounts or transactions which further assist in the analysis of the fraudulent activity. In contrast, if there exists only a low level of trust, then only the minimum information need be provided. In other words, the distributed topology and network structure which are possible owing to the method of the present embodiment provide a graduated level of access permission enhancing the level of privacy and control afforded to each financial institution, or node, in the network.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0214">Furthermore, the method according to the present embodiment can be provided in a decentralised manner, without the requirement of a centralised database. As such, even if a single node or nodes are unavailable (owing to system failure or the like) at least a portion of the dispersion tree relating to a transaction of interest can still be obtained. Accordingly, since there is no single point of failure in the network, the robustness of the network is improved. In addition, since the information corresponding to the messages, such as the transaction information according to the present example, is controlled at the local level by each individual financial institution, enhanced levels of privacy and network security can be obtained.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Additional Modifications of the Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0215">While the present embodiment has been described with examples relating to fraudulent transactions throughout the network, it will be appreciated that the method according to the present embodiment is not so limited in this respect. That is, the messages according to the present embodiment could relate to any type of financial transaction between bank accounts or financial institutions made by any method such as Faster Payments, BACS transfers or the like. Alternatively, the method according to the present embodiment could be used to construct a set of traceable messages with relation to any message or transaction, and is not so limited to financial transactions. For example, the method according to the present embodiment could be applied to building a set of traceable messages through a mobile communications network or the like.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0216">Numerous modifications and variations of the present disclosure are possible in light of the above teachings.
