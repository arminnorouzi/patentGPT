As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, there is an inspection apparatus including a position adjusting unit that allows an operator to manually make fine adjustments of the tip position of a probe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a position adjusting unit <b>9</b> of a conventional inspection apparatus includes an X knob <b>91</b> by which fine adjustments of the X-direction position of a probe <b>97</b> are made, a Y knob <b>92</b> by which fine adjustments of the Y-direction position of the probe <b>97</b> are made, and a Z knob <b>93</b> by which fine adjustments of the Z-direction position of the probe <b>97</b> are made. An operator makes fine adjustments of the position of the probe <b>97</b> in such a way that the tip of the probe <b>97</b> makes contact with an electrode pad of a device by manipulating the X knob <b>91</b>, the Y knob <b>92</b>, and the Z knob <b>93</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, a method of making initial settings of a probe position with respect to an electrode pad of a device will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>1</b> to <b>8</b>B-<b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">First, the operator recognizes an electrode pad <b>80</b> of a device and the probe <b>97</b> using a microscope, a camera or the like. The operator makes position adjustments of the probe <b>97</b> in an XY plane by manipulating the X knob <b>91</b> and the Y knob <b>92</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>A-<b>2</b></figref> are plan views of a top surface of the electrode pad <b>80</b> viewed. from above. When the tip position of the probe <b>97</b> is not positioned roughly in the center of the electrode pan <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>1</b></figref>), the operator moves the tip of the probe <b>97</b> in a two-dimensional direction by manipulating the X knob <b>91</b> and the Y knob <b>92</b>, such that the tip position of the probe <b>97</b> lies in a nearly center position of the electrode pad <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, the operator lowers the tip position of the probe <b>97</b> in a Z direction by manipulating the Z knob <b>93</b>.
