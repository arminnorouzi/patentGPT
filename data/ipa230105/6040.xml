The wet etching process is, for example, selective etching of silicon.

In some traditional methods of forming nanowires, spacers need to be formed beside the substrate portion and the semiconductor portions to protect the substrate portion and the semiconductor portions from damage by subsequent processes (such as etching processes), and the formed nanowires are usually rectangular in the cross section. Compared with the comparative example in which spacers are required to protect the substrate portion and the semiconductor portions during the manufacturing process, the method for forming a nanowire according to an embodiment of the present application does not need to form spacers, and triangular nanowires can be formed directly through a wet etching process, so it can omit multiple processes, both in terms of process cost and time have been greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereafter, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the etching stop portions <b>102</b>A and <b>106</b>A and the hard mask portion <b>120</b>A can be removed by different etching processes, and the nanowires <b>1081</b>, <b>1082</b>, <b>1041</b>, <b>1042</b> and <b>1001</b> and the substrate protrusion <b>1002</b> can be remained, so as to form a semiconductor device <b>10</b>.

Compared with the conventional comparative example in which spacers are required to be formed beside the substrate portions and the semiconductor portions, the method for manufacturing the semiconductor device of the present invention can pattern the substrate portions and the semiconductor portions by a wet etching process, to form a plurality of nanowires including triangles in the cross section, it is not necessary to form spacers beside the substrate portions and the semiconductor portions, so the conventional complicated process can be simplified, and the process cost and time can be greatly improved. In addition, compared with the comparative example in which the amount of nanowires is n (n is a positive integer) when the amount of semiconductor layers is n, in the semiconductor device of the present invention, when the amount of semiconductor layers is n, the amount of nanowires can be 2n+1 (n is a positive integer), that is, the amount of nanowires can be larger, which can form the semiconductor device with more densely stacked nanowires. Further, there can be a larger contact area between the nanowires and the gate, so that the conducting effect can be increased, and the semiconductor device may have better electrical properties.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of the preferred embodiment(s), it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto.
