INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns a beverage preparation machine, particularly a machine for preparing a beverage product by mixing a fluid substance with an ingredient contained in a container, such as e.g. a sachet.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">All known systems for in-home preparation of beverages involve a machine that receives an ingredient storage container for storing an ingredient for the preparation of a beverage product. Generally, the ingredient container is introduced in the beverage preparation machine, and the machine passes a fluid (typically hot water) through a dose of the ingredient. The beverage product prepared by mixing the soluble ingredient and the fluid substance is then dispensed out of the container to a consumer receptacle (typically a cup).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, the fluid passed from the beverage preparation machine to the container is introduced either by a shower plate that is in contact with a fluid permeable side of the container. Alternatively, the beverage preparation machine comprises a fluid processing device that pierces through an inlet wall of the container and injects the fluid therein (generally under a certain pressure). In such beverage preparation machines known in the art, dispensing of the beverage product from the container is performed either by:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">a) building a fluid pressure inside the closed cavity of the container until a dispensing wall of the container self opens and lets the beverage product out, or</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0005">b) by piercing a dispensing wall of the container by a dispensing needle means (or other similar piercing means) of the beverage preparation machine, that is able to withdraw or let the beverage product out of the container vicinity.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0005" num="0006">In cases where the dispensing side of the container self opens, this can lead to variations in the pressure or manner of opening from one container to another, and to some undesirable variations in quality of the dispensed beverage product.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0007">In cases where the beverage preparation machine comprises a dispensing needle means for piercing a dispensing wall of the container, the technology of adding this dispensing needle means in addition to the fluid processing device used for injecting the mixing fluid into the container, adds complexity and cost to the beverage preparation machine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">There is therefore a need for a beverage preparation machine which obviates the above cited drawbacks of existing beverage systems, and in particular is simpler and offers more reproducible quality from one beverage product to another, overtime.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0009">The invention as claimed in claim <b>1</b> is a beverage preparation machine which comprises a fluid circulation system for a fluid substance, at least one container holder adapted for receiving a corresponding ingredient storage container and at least one fluid processing device which is part of the fluid circulation system.

idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates schematically the layout of a beverage preparation machine according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0050">The beverage preparation machine is indicated as a whole with reference numeral <b>1</b> and comprises a fluid circulation system for a fluid substance. The fluid substance is typically water, at cold state (between 4&#xb0; C. and 20&#xb0; C.), ambient state (between 20&#xb0; C. and 35&#xb0; C.) or hot state (between 35&#xb0; C. and 95&#xb0; C.). Preferably, the fluid substance is water at a temperature comprised between 40&#xb0; C. and 90&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0051">For example, the fluid circulation system preferably comprises at least one fluid source <b>2</b>, at least one fluid pump <b>3</b> and at least one fluid circulation conduit <b>6</b>. The fluid circulation system may also comprise at least one fluid heating element <b>4</b>. Such fluid circulation systems are known in the art. The fluid source <b>2</b> can be, for example, a detachable water reservoir that is connected to the fluid circulation system. Alternative fluid sources could comprise, for example, tap-water connections, a non-water edible fluid canister or a water-bottle connection. The fluid pump <b>3</b> can be, for example, a standard piston pump delivering a maximum output pressure of 20 bar. Obviously, alternative fluid pumps could be provided.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0052">The beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> comprises at least one container holder <b>7</b> adapted for receiving a corresponding container C. The container holder <b>7</b> is a mechanical element adapted for ensuring the static positioning of the container C within the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b>, at least during the time it actually operates for preparing a beverage, so that the corresponding fluid circulation system can be connected to the container C in a functional manner for injecting the fluid substance therein or therethrough. These container holders are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0053">The beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> further comprises at least one fluid processing device <b>10</b> which is part of the fluid circulation system and which comprises a fluid processing body <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The fluid processing body <b>12</b> comprises in turn at least one inlet means <b>18</b> for introducing the fluid substance into the container C for the preparation of a beverage product. Preferably, the fluid processing body <b>12</b> is a needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. With the term &#x201c;needle-shaped&#x201d; it should be intended that the fluid processing body <b>12</b> comprises at least one end portion <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> configured for perforating, and/or piercing, and/or tearing a specific portion or wall of the container C before the introduction of the fluid substance into said container C. The fluid processing body <b>12</b> is shaped in such a way as to be able to at least partially penetrate in the container C.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0054">The preparation of the beverage product is obtained by mixing of the fluid substance with an ingredient contained in the container C. Preferably, the ingredients are chosen within the list of roast and ground coffee, compacted or not, soluble powder coffee or leaf tea. Dairy ingredients (e.g. milk or creamer) could also be provided, as well as chocolate, fruit juices, soups, vegetable juices, bouillons, smoothies, purees, coulis, creams or a combination thereof, in powdered soluble form, liquid concentrated form having various viscosities or in gel form. With the expression &#x201c;mixing of the fluid substance with an ingredient&#x201d; it should be intended that all the ingredients contained in the container C are in a form which is compatible with a generic mixing operation (dissolution, extraction or infusion) with the fluid substance (typically water) to obtain the beverage product.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0055">According to the invention, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> comprises at least one outlet means <b>20</b> for dispensing the beverage product from the container C. The beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> is provided with at least one movement means <b>54</b>, <b>64</b> for separately moving the fluid processing device <b>10</b> and the container C relatively one to another between:<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0056">a fluid introduction position, wherein the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> protrudes inside the internal volume of the container C for introducing therein the fluid substance, and</li>        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0057">a beverage dispensing position, wherein the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is at least partially withdrawn from the internal volume of the container C to allow dispensing of the beverage product from the container C through the outlet means <b>20</b>. Optionally, in the beverage dispensing position, the fluid substance can be simultaneously introduced into the container C by the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> when the beverage product is dispensed from the container C. Optionally, during the fluid introduction position the fluid substance and/or the beverage product may partially leak downwards on the outlet means <b>20</b> of the fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0046" num="0058">According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> further comprises at least one sealing means <b>22</b> to be engaged with the container C for preventing leakage of the fluid substance and/or the beverage product from the container C at least when the fluid substance is introduced into the container C. In other words, in case of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is provided with sealing means <b>22</b>, in the fluid introduction position these sealing means <b>22</b> are engaged with the container C to block dispensing of the fluid substance and/or beverage product from the container C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>). In the beverage dispensing position these sealing means <b>22</b> are not engaged with the container C to allow full dispensing of the beverage product from the container C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>). However, it should be noted that the sealing means <b>22</b> are not an essential feature of the invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0059">According to the embodiment of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> comprises an inlet portion <b>14</b> and an outlet portion <b>16</b>. The inlet means <b>18</b> for introducing the fluid substance into the container C are provided at the inlet portion <b>14</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, whereas the outlet means <b>20</b> for dispensing the beverage product from the container C are provided at the outlet portion <b>16</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. The inlet means <b>18</b> and the outlet means <b>20</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> are preferably separate one to another and allow, with a single fluid processing device <b>10</b>, both to introduce the mixing fluid substance (typically hot water) into the container C and to dispense the beverage product formed inside the container C.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0060">Preferably, according to the embodiment of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> comprises a first end portion <b>26</b>, which is provided at the inlet portion <b>14</b> of said needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and which is configured for opening (e.g. by tearing, piercing and/or perforating) a specific portion of the container C, and a second end portion <b>28</b>, which is provided at the outlet portion <b>16</b> of said needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. The needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> further comprises at least one inlet conduit <b>30</b> arranged therein. The inlet conduit <b>30</b> is in fluid communication with the first end portion <b>26</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and with a second inlet conduit <b>36</b> of a second fluid processing body <b>34</b>, as it will be described in detail hereinafter. The inlet conduit <b>30</b> and the first end portion <b>26</b> are thus comprised in the inlet means <b>18</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. More precisely, the inlet conduit <b>30</b> is a closed conduit in the form of a tube, embedded in the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, that allows the fluid substance to be inserted into the container C without being exposed to the air.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0061">As shown in the embodiment of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the sealing means <b>22</b> are preferably provided between the first end portion <b>26</b> and the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. Preferably, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is a vertically oriented elongated body, more preferably a point shaped body, wherein its first end portion <b>26</b>, its second end portion <b>28</b> and the sealing means <b>22</b> are coaxially arranged about a vertical axis A. More preferably, as shown in the drawings, the first end portion <b>26</b> is upwardly oriented with respect to the position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> within the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b>. Even more preferably, the first end portion <b>26</b> and/or the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> are point shaped portions respectively. The point shaped first end portion <b>26</b> is thus configured for opening, e.g. by perforation, piercing or tearing, a specific portion of the container C to inject the fluid substance therein, as it will be explained in detail hereinafter. The point shaped second end portion <b>28</b> is downwardly oriented with respect to the position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> in the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b>, so as to precisely direct the flow of the beverage product into the user's cup.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0062">The outlet means <b>20</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> comprises the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and at least one outlet conduit <b>32</b> which is distinct from the inlet conduit <b>30</b> of the inlet means <b>18</b>. More specifically, according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, each outlet conduit <b>32</b> is obtained in the form of a grooved channel provided on the outer surface of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. Each grooved channel is thus in fluid communication with the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0063">Preferably the sealing means <b>22</b>, that are configured to be engaged with the container C for preventing leakage of the fluid substance and/or the beverage product from said container C in the operative condition of the fluid processing device <b>10</b>, consists of an enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. More specifically, this enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is comprised between the first end portion <b>26</b> and the second end portion <b>28</b> of said needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and has a cross-sectional area which is larger than any cross-sectional areas of the portion of said needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> comprised between its first end portion <b>26</b> and the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A itself. This enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the fluid processing body <b>12</b> could be at least partially covered with an elastomeric material to ensure better sealing properties. This enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is thus configured for adhering against a wall of the container C at the portion of said container C opened by the first end portion <b>26</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0064">Conveniently, each outlet conduit <b>32</b> in the form of a grooved channel is provided on the outer surface of the vertically oriented needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, in a portion thereof comprised between its first end portion <b>26</b> and its enlarged portion <b>22</b>A. A beverage guiding element <b>50</b> for guiding the beverage to the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is thus provided between the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A and said second end portion <b>28</b>. Preferably, the beverage guiding element <b>50</b> has a tapered cross-sectional area which decreases from the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A to the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. More preferably, the beverage guiding element <b>50</b> has a cone-shape. Even more preferably, the beverage guiding element <b>50</b> a truncated cone-shape, with an additional pointed element at the outlet portion <b>16</b>. The beverage product extracted from the container C is thus guided by the outlet conduit <b>32</b> to the second end portion <b>28</b> through the beverage guiding element <b>50</b>, so as to precisely direct the flow of this beverage product into the user's cup placed below said beverage guiding element <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0065">The fact that the outlet means <b>20</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> are placed externally with respect to the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, together with the fact that said outlet means <b>20</b> are obtained in the form of grooved channels, i.e. with an open cross section instead of a closed-loop cross section (which is typical of conventional cylindrical channels), leads to a specific advantage in processing beverage products based on a mixture of a fluid substance and a soluble ingredient. Actually, if the soluble ingredient contained in the container C mostly consist of solid particles, some of these solid particles (e.g. biscuit bits, etc.) remain in their solid state even after the mixing with the fluid substance (e.g. hot water), so as to be properly ingested by the user. Therefore, the open cross section of the outlet means <b>20</b> allows these particles to pass, together with the fluid substance, into the user's cup, without the risk of blocking an otherwise designed dispensing cylindrical channel.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0066">Additionally, the grooved channels could have a variable open cross section, which increases or decreases from the first end portion <b>26</b> to the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. In other words, the grooved channels can be optionally manufactured with a specific profile (i.e. ramp) from their top to their bottom so that, depending on the height position of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> into the container C, the open cross section of grooved channels increases or decreases to adapt the flow rate of the beverage product going out to the cup, and also the fluid pressure inside the container C during mixing.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0067">Optionally, the fluid processing device <b>10</b> could be provided with at least one air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b>, which is in fluid communication with the inlet means <b>18</b> and which, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, is located on the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> between the first end portion <b>26</b> and the sealing means <b>22</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> is in the form of a through hole obtained on a side wall of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and is placed in fluid communication with the inlet conduit <b>30</b> for the fluid adduction. As it will be explained in detail hereinafter, the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> allows the inlet conduit <b>30</b> to be in contact with the outer environment in certain operation conditions of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> and allows the aspiration of a predefined amount of air or gas, to be mixed with the fluid substance and to be introduced into the container C through the inlet conduit <b>30</b>, by means of the Venturi effect.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0068">In the case in which the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is provided with the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b>, the movement means <b>54</b>, <b>64</b> of the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> are configured for separately moving the fluid processing device <b>10</b> and the container C relatively one to another in at least one of the following intermediate positions, i.e.:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0069">a first intermediate position, wherein the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> is located outside the internal volume of the container C and the sealing means <b>22</b>, if provided, are not engaged with the container C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>), and</li>        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0070">a second intermediate position, wherein the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> is located inside the internal volume of the container C and the sealing means <b>22</b>, if provided, are still not engaged with the container C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0057" num="0071">More specifically, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref> the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is configured for being moved between the first intermediate position and the second intermediate position, so as to selectively obtain or not the Venturi effect. In another possible embodiment, the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is configured for always maintaining its gas inlet bore <b>24</b> outside the internal volume of the container C, so as to always obtain the Venturi effect. Preferably, in this possible embodiment of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> the gas inlet bore <b>24</b> can be located between the sealing means <b>22</b> and the second end portion <b>28</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. More preferably, in this possible embodiment of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> the sealing means <b>22</b> are not provided on the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0072">The fluid processing device <b>10</b> preferably comprises a second fluid processing body <b>34</b> connected to the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> described so far. More preferably, the second fluid processing body <b>34</b> is integrally manufactured with the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> at a conjunction end <b>44</b> thereof. The second fluid processing body <b>34</b> is internally provided with the second inlet conduit <b>36</b> placed in fluid communication with the inlet conduit <b>30</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0073">According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>B and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the second inlet conduit <b>36</b> is a convergent conduit having a decreasing cross-sectional area towards the inlet conduit <b>30</b>. More specifically, the second inlet conduit <b>36</b> is preferably provided with at least a first conduit portion <b>38</b>, having a first predefined cross-sectional area, and with a second conduit portion <b>40</b>, having a second predefined cross-sectional area which is smaller than the first predefined cross-sectional area of the first conduit portion <b>38</b>. The second conduit portion <b>40</b> is placed downstream of the first conduit portion <b>38</b> and is in fluid communication with the inlet conduit <b>30</b> obtained in the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0074">Additionally, at least one through hole <b>42</b> could be interposed between the inlet conduit <b>30</b>, obtained in the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, and the second inlet conduit <b>36</b>, obtained in the second fluid processing body <b>34</b>. Conveniently, the through hole <b>42</b> has an average cross-sectional area which is smaller than both the average cross-sectional area of the inlet conduit <b>30</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and the average cross-sectional area of the second inlet conduit <b>36</b> of the second fluid processing body <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0075">The specific configuration of the second fluid processing body <b>34</b>, with its convergent cross-sectional profile, and the presence of the through hole <b>42</b> allow to properly set the speed of the fluid substance introduced into the container C by the fluid processing device <b>10</b>. Actually, the convergent cross-sectional profile of the second fluid processing body <b>34</b> allows a speed increase of the fluid substance pumped by the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> into the fluid processing device <b>10</b>. Additionally, the through hole <b>42</b> is provided for further increasing the speed of the fluid substance before it runs out of the inlet conduit <b>30</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. The presence of the through hole <b>42</b> ensure a good dissolution of the ingredient(s) and beverage product reconstitution. The through hole <b>42</b> defines the flow and the pressure of the fluid substance during the beverage product reconstitution. The through hole <b>42</b> may also have an &#x201c;anti-backflow&#x201d; function, so as to reduce the risk of fluid substance going back from the container C into the fluid line consisting of the sequence of the inlet conduit <b>30</b>, the through hole <b>42</b> itself and the second inlet conduit <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0076">According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the second fluid processing body <b>34</b> is orthogonally disposed with respect to the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, so that the inlet conduit <b>30</b> is substantially orthogonal with respect to the second inlet conduit <b>36</b>. Therefore, when the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is properly connected to the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> in its operative condition, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is oriented along a substantially vertical direction (shown by the axis A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), with its first end portion <b>26</b> located at the top and its second end portion <b>28</b> located at the bottom, whereas the second fluid processing body <b>34</b> is substantially horizontal.

In this embodiment the outlet means <b>20</b>, i.e. the outlet conduits <b>32</b> in the form of grooved channels, are provided on the side wall of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> in a position which is above the position of the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of said needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. In this way, in the fluid introduction position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> the outlet conduits <b>32</b> are completely inserted into the container C and, due to the sealing engagement between the sealing means <b>22</b> and said container C, no leakage or few leakage of any fluid substance and/or other substances from the container C is allowed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0081">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is a point shaped body provided with a first point shaped end portion <b>26</b> at its inlet portion <b>14</b>. Therefore, this point shaped end portion <b>26</b> is configured for perforating, and/or piercing, and/or tearing a specific portion of the container C to inject the fluid substance therein. However, as it will be explained hereinafter, other embodiments of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> could be envisaged, with an inlet portion <b>14</b> configured in a different way for reaching the first operative condition of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> in a different way, for example the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, described in more detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0082">In the specific embodiment of the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> shown in the figures the container C is preferably manufactured from a multilayer flexible material, more preferably made essentially of a paper layer. Preferably, this container C is thus internally provided, in its lower portion, i.e. at the portion that is engaged by the fluid processing device <b>10</b>, with an additional layer L of a substantially rigid material. This substantially rigid material can be, for example, a compostable plastic capable of forming a barrier against oxygen and moisture. Compostable means that the whole container C can be discarded after usage together with fruit and vegetable peels. Other embodiments of the container C are however possible, but it is preferable that, in the specific embodiment of the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> shown in the figures, such a container C has a substantially rigid portion at the contact area with the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, since the relative rigidity of at least a portion of the container C is advantageous for cooperating with the sealing means <b>22</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0083">The preferably substantially rigid layer of the container C is provided, at its bottom, with an injection hole having a cross-sectional shape (e.g. a circular cross-sectional shape) that is compatible with the cross-sectional shape of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>, i.e. the cross-sectional shape of the point shaped body. In the non-operative condition of the fluid processing device <b>10</b>, the injection hole is closed (preferably in an air tight mode) by a bottom portion of the multilayer flexible material of the container C. In case of circular cross-sectional shape, the diameter of the injection hole is greater than the average diameter of the point shaped body, but is smaller or equal than the maximum diameter of the sealing means <b>22</b> (if these sealing means <b>22</b> are provided on the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>), i.e. of the enlarged portion <b>22</b>A of the point shaped body. With this configuration the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is capable of being introduced into the container C through the injection hole (breaking or tearing the portion of the multilayer flexible material that closes said injection hole), during the movement of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> towards the container C, until the sealing means <b>22</b> have reached their sealing position against the circumferential edge of said injection hole. In this sealing position no further movement between the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> and the container C is allowed, thus obtaining the fluid introduction position described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, in a first perspective view, in a cross-sectional view and in a second perspective view respectively, the first intermediate position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is shown. In this first intermediate position at least a portion of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> still protrudes inside the container C, similarly to what happens in the fluid introduction position described above, but the sealing means <b>22</b> are not in tight contact with the bottom wall of the container C. In other words, in this first intermediate position a smaller portion of the fluid processing body <b>12</b>, compared to the fluid introduction position, protrudes inside the container C (this fact is also visible from a comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>), so that both the fluid substance can be introduced inside the container C by the inlet means <b>18</b> and, simultaneously, the resulting beverage product can go out through the outlet means <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0085">More specifically, in this first intermediate position the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> protrudes inside the container C in such a way that its air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> remains outside said container C. Therefore, in this first intermediate position, injection of air or gas into the container C is possible together with the injection of fluid substance by means of the Venturi effect. It should be noted that the Venturi effect, which is obtained due to the simultaneous injection of fluid substance and air or gas into the container C, occurs only when the injection of fluid substance into the container C is carried out by the inlet means <b>18</b>. Actually, as soon as the injection of fluid substance into the container C through the inlet means <b>18</b> stops, the Venturi sucking effect through the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> cannot work anymore. Therefore, no Venturi effect occurs in the extraction mode only, i.e. when the beverage product has been fully prepared and flows out through the outlet means <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0086">Basically, the Venturi effect is the fact that when the fluid substance circulates at high speed within the inlet means <b>18</b> of the fluid processing device <b>10</b>, it pulls in a quantity of air or gas through the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b>. This is due to an aspiration which is a physical property known in the field of fluid mechanics. When air or gas is pulled in (i.e. sucked) into the flow of fluid substance which is injected into the container C, this air or gas too is mixed with the soluble ingredient. The mixture consisting of soluble ingredient, fluid substance and air or gas creates a foaming boost, which is needed for foamy beverage products (foamed milks, creamy chocolates, etc.).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0087">Obviously, the sucking effect of air or gas together with the fluid substance can only work if the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> is located outside the container C. Therefore, the Venturi effect can be stopped if the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is sufficiently inserted within the container C so that the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> is located inside the container C, such as in the second intermediate position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, in a first perspective view, in a cross-sectional view and in a second perspective view respectively, the second intermediate position of the fluid processing device <b>10</b> is shown. This second intermediate position is basically similar to the first intermediate position described above, except for the fact that the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is inserted within the container C so that the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b> too is located inside the container C (see in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>), whereas the sealing means <b>22</b> are once again not in tight contact with the bottom wall of said container C.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0089">Therefore, in this second intermediate position both the fluid substance can be introduced inside the container C by the inlet means <b>18</b> and, simultaneously, the resulting beverage product can go out through the outlet means <b>20</b> towards the cup. However, no Venturi effect occurs in this second intermediate position and no air or gas is injected into the container C through the air or gas inlet bore <b>24</b>, but just fluid substance is introduced into the container C during the injection phase.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0090">Regardless of the Venturi effect, both in the first intermediate position and in the second intermediate position the fluid substance is injected into the container C through the inlet means <b>18</b> of the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b>. The fluid substance injected into the container C is mixed with the soluble ingredient (e.g. coffee powder) to create the beverage product. In these intermediate positions also, the needle-shaped fluid processing body <b>12</b> is partly out of the container C so that the dispensing grooved channels are always at least partially located outside of the container C (i.e. the dispensing grooved channels are open), and therefore they are able to let the beverage product out of the container C, into the user's cup. Therefore, simultaneously with the injection of fluid substance into the container C, beverage product is also dispensed towards the user's cup.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref> illustrate further embodiments of the fluid processing device <b>10</b>.

Preferably, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, no sealing means <b>22</b> of any kind are provided between the fluid processing body <b>12</b> and the container C, with the result of a small or negligible leakage of fluid substance that falls into the user's cup during beverage preparation.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0093">Advantageously, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref> the outer surface of the fluid processing body <b>12</b> is tapered.

Since the pins <b>70</b> of the second locking means <b>72</b> are engaged with the corresponding holes <b>60</b> provided in the container C, this container C is thus vertically moved with respect to the fluid processing device <b>10</b> (which is fixed) between all the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>. It should be noted that the container C is detachable from the container holder <b>7</b>, and thus from the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b>, only in the non-engaged position of the pin <b>70</b> with respect to the corresponding hole <b>60</b>. It should also be noted in this embodiment, other locking means could be provided in place of the second locking means <b>72</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. For example, the first locking means <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C</figref>, wherein a mobile fluid processing device <b>10</b> and a fixed container C are shown, could also be used instead of the second locking means <b>72</b> in connection with the third gear and/or leverage mechanism <b>68</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B and <b>18</b></figref>, wherein a fixed fluid processing device <b>10</b> and a movable container C are shown. For the same reason, the second locking means <b>72</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B and <b>18</b></figref> could also be used instead of the first locking means <b>52</b> in connection with first gear and/or leverage mechanism <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C</figref>. Finally, it should be noted that this embodiment too of the third gear and/or leverage mechanism <b>68</b> is described and illustrated with explanatory purposes only, and further embodiments of this third gear and/or leverage mechanism could be provided.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0102">Last but not least, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, in addition to a first container holder and fluid processing device as described in detail above, the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> comprises a second container holder and fluid processing device (not illustrated in the drawing). Preferably, the second fluid processing device is connected fluidly to the same fluid circulation system that is also connected to the first fluid processing device described above. This brings the advantage that the machine is less complex and costly to manufacture and operate. However, of course, a second fluid circulation system, independent but similarly constructed to the first one, can be included in the same beverage preparation machine.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0103">In this embodiment, a preferred set-up is that the first container adapted to be inserted in the first container holder and processed with the first fluid processing device is a sachet (an embodiment of which is described here above) that is constructed to contain a soluble ingredient for mixing with a fluid (e.g. water), said ingredient being for instance a dairy composition, tea-based compositions, chocolate-based compositions, soups, fruit compositions such as smoothies, and the like. The sachet can also contain a leaf-tea ingredient, or plant-based soluble or infusable ingredient. Generally, the fluid processing in the sachet-type container is performed at a low pressure, as provided in the description here above.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0104">The second container adapted to be inserted in the second container holder and processed with the second fluid processing device, is preferably a rigid or semi-rigid container, such as a capsule or a pod, containing an ingredient adapted to be extracted at a higher fluid pressure than the fluid pressure used with the first fluid processing device. Such an ingredient is typically a roast and ground coffee, which is extracted according to the coffee extraction techniques known in the art, by circulating pressured water therethrough. The fluid that circulates through the coffee grounds is preferably, but not necessarily hot water (generally hot water for coffee extraction circulates through the ingredient at a temperature of between 75 and 95&#xb0; C.). Water at room temperature, or even chilled water can however be used for so-called &#x201c;cold brew coffee&#x201d; preparation. In this case, the container holder is preferably a brewing chamber comprising two elements movable relatively one to another to be able to open said chamber for insertion or removal of the container, and then close said chamber for extraction of the ingredient contained in said container. No further details are provided in the present description, since such brewing chambers are known in the art of beverage machines.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0105">In order to control the preparation of different ingredients, the beverage machine comprises a control panel (either attached to said machine casing, or in a remote device) and a control chip board that is able to operate the fluid processing devices, and fluid circulation system for either simultaneous, or sequential preparation of the beverages from the first and second containers.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0106">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiment of the beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention covered by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
