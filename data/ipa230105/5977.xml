id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">It is possible to curb noise, color mixing, and the like. An imaging apparatus includes: a semiconductor; a photoelectric conversion unit that is provided on the semiconductor substrate and generates electrical charge in accordance with the amount of received light through photoelectric conversion; an electrical charge holding unit that is disposed on a side closer to a first surface of the semiconductor substrate than the photoelectric conversion unit and holds the electrical charge transferred from the photoelectric conversion unit; an electrical charge transfer unit that transfers the electrical charge from the photoelectric conversion unit to the electrical charge holding unit; a vertical electrode that transmits the electrical charge generated by the photoelectric conversion unit to the electrical charge transfer unit and is disposed in a depth direction of the semiconductor substrate, and a first light control unit that is disposed on a side closer to a second surface that is a side opposite to the first surface of the semiconductor substrate than the vertical electrode, is disposed at a position overlapping the vertical electrode in a plan view of the semiconductor substrate from a normal line direction of the first surface, and has a T-shaped section in the depth direction of the substrate. The first light control member includes a first light control portion and a second light control portion extending in mutually intersecting directions in an integrated structure.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="94.91mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230005978A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

present disclosure will be described in detail. An imaging apparatus according to the present disclosure is a backside irradiation-type image sensor of a global shutter scheme using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor, for example. The imaging apparatus according to the present disclosure receives, at each pixel, light from an object, performs photoelectric conversion thereon, and generates a pixel signal that is an electric signal.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The global shutter scheme is a scheme in which a start and an end of exposure of all pixels are performed at the same time. Here, all pixels mean all pixels forming an effective image, and dummy pixels and the like that do not contribute to image formation are excluded. Also, the start and the end may not necessarily be performed at the same time as long as image distortion and an exposure time difference are sufficiently small to such an extent that no problem occurs. A case in which an operation of performing simultaneous exposure in units of a plurality of rows (such as several tens of rows) is repeated with a shift in units of a plurality of rows in a row direction, for example, is also included in the global shutter scheme. Also, a case in which simultaneous exposure is performed only on a part of the pixel region is also included in the global shutter scheme.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The backside irradiation-type image sensor is an image sensor in which a photoelectric conversion unit such as a photodiode that receives light from an object and converts the light into an electric signal is disposed for each pixel between a light receiving surface on which light from the object is incident and a wiring layer in which a wiring of a transistor or the like for driving each pixel is provided.

The Si{111} substrate in the present disclosure includes a substrate or a wafer in which a crystal orientation deviates by several degrees, for example, a substrate or a wafer in which the crystal orientation deviates by several degrees in the closest [110] direction from the {111} plane.

However, the &#x3c;110&#x3e; direction in the present disclosure is limited to the direction that perpendicularly intersects the {111} plane that is the element formation plane and the direction that is parallel to the element formation plane. In other words, a combination between the element formation plane in the Si{111} substrate and the orientation in which etching is performed on the Si{111} substrate in the present disclosure is selected from any of the combinations indicated with circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0355">Also, the above first embodiment illustrates, as an example, the case in which the etching advances in the X-axis direction while the etching does not advance in the Y-axis direction and the Z-axis direction, using the Si{111} substrate.

If the back bonds are described by exemplifying <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, for example, the back bonds represent combined hands extending in a negative direction on the side opposite to the Si uncombined hand with respect to a normal line of the Si{111} plane on the assumption that the side of the Si uncombined hand is a positive side.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0358"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> illustrates an example of three back bonds at &#x2212;19.47&#xb0; to +19.47&#xb0; with respect to the {111} plane. Specifically, in a case in which the photoelectric conversion unit, the horizontal light shielding portion, and the electric charge holding unit are provided in the Si{111} substrate, the horizontal light shielding portion includes a first surface along the first crystal plane of the Si{111} substrate that perpendicularly intersects the first direction and is represented by a plane index {111} and a second surface along the second crystal plane of the Si{111} substrate that is inclined with respect to the first direction and is represented by the plane index {111}. Also, electronic equipment according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the aforementioned imaging apparatus.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0359">The Si{111} substrate according to each of the aforementioned embodiments includes a substrate worked such that the substrate surface has an off angle with respect to the &#x3c;112&#x3e; direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, for example. The relationship that the etching rate in the &#x3c;110&#x3e; direction, that is, the direction in which one Si back bond is included is sufficiently high relative to the etching rate in the &#x3c;111&#x3e; direction, that is, the direction in which three Si back bonds are included is maintained even in a case of the substrate with the off angle in a case in which the off angle is equal to or less than 19.47&#xb0;. Since the number of steps increases and density of micro step differences increases as the off angle increases, the off angle is preferably equal to or less than 5&#xb0;. Note that although the case in which the substrate surface has an off angle in the &#x3c;112&#x3e; direction has been exemplified in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the substrate surface may have an off angle in the &#x3c;110&#x3e; direction, and the direction of the off angle does not matter. Additionally, the Si plane orientation can be analyzed using an X-ray diffraction method, an electron beam diffraction method, an electron beam backscatter diffraction method, or the like. Since the number of Si back bonds is determined by the crystal structure of Si, it is also possible to analyze the number of back bonds through the analysis of the Si plane orientation.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0360">(Example of Application to Electronic Equipment)</p><p id="p-0362" num="0361"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration example of a camera <b>2000</b> as electronic equipment to which the present technology is applied.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">The camera <b>2000</b> includes an optical unit <b>2001</b> including a lens group and the like, an imaging apparatus (imaging device) <b>2002</b> to which the aforementioned imaging apparatus <b>101</b> or the like (hereinafter, referred to as an imaging apparatus <b>101</b> or the like) is applied, and a digital signal processor (DSP) circuit <b>2003</b> that is a camera signal processing circuit.

Further, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can set an inter-vehicle distance which is to be guaranteed in advance from a preceding vehicle and perform automated brake control (also including following stop control) or automated acceleration control (also including following start control). In this way, it is possible to perform the coordinated control for automated driving or the like in which autonomous travel is performed without an operation of a driver.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can classify and extract three-dimensional object data regarding three-dimensional objects into two-wheeled vehicles, ordinary vehicles, large vehicles, pedestrians, and other three-dimensional objects such as utility poles on the basis of distance information obtained from the imaging units <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> and use the three-dimensional object data for automatic avoidance of obstacles. For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> classifies obstacles in the vicinity of the vehicle <b>12100</b> into obstacles that can be visually recognized by the driver of the vehicle <b>12100</b> and obstacles that are difficult to visually recognize. Then, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can determine a risk of collision indicating the degree of risk of collision with each obstacle, and can perform driving assistance for collision avoidance by outputting a warning to a driver through the audio speaker <b>12061</b> or the display unit <b>12062</b> and performing forced deceleration or avoidance steering through the drive system control unit <b>12010</b> when the risk of collision has a value equal to or greater than a set value and there is a possibility of collision.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">At least one of the imaging units <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> may be an infrared camera that detects infrared light.
