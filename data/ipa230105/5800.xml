Therefore, when the conventional semiconductor module provided with the partition section is deformed in the forward warping direction and the sealing resin is peeled from the connection section side of the partition section, the wires embedded in the sealing resin are subjected to a force in a direction away from the partition section. As a result, the wires are subjected to a force in a direction away from the connection sections of the control terminals arranged in the partition section, so that the wires are broken in the connection sections, causing open defects in the conventional semiconductor module in some cases. When the wires are broken, a gate pulse signal and a reference signal are not input into an inverter circuit from a control circuit, and therefore the conventional semiconductor module does not perform predetermined operations and cannot supply power to a motor, for example, to be driven.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In contrast thereto, in the semiconductor module <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the sealing resin <b>61</b><i>u </i>and the sealing resin <b>61</b><i>v </i>are connected by the sealing resin <b>62</b> formed in each of the plurality of through holes <b>101</b><i>c </i>formed in the partition section <b>101</b>.
