id="p-0006" num="0005">Semi-autonomous vehicles that have been recently released basically perform driving, braking, and steering on behalf of a driver to reduce fatigue of the driver.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case of semi-autonomous driving, unlike fully autonomous driving, the driver has to stay focused on driving such as continuously holding a steering wheel and the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, the semi-autonomous vehicles are being sold with a highway driving assist (HDA) function, a driver status warning (DSW) function that determines driver carelessness and state abnormalities such as drowsy driving, distraction, and the like to output a warning alarm through a cluster and the like, a driver awareness warning (DAW) function that determines whether the vehicle crosses a line and travels unstably through a front camera and the like, a forward collision-avoidance assist (FCA) or an active emergency brake system (AEBS) function that performs sudden braking when detecting a forward collision, and the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A logistics transportation technology of an autonomous driving truck may be being actively developed to solve problems such as a manpower shortage, environmental pollution, fuel efficiency, and the like that the cargo transportation industry is facing recently. In addition, a possibility of mass production of the logistics transportation technology of the autonomous driving truck is also increasing. In a logistics system using such an autonomous driving truck, research focusing on energy efficiency and fast movement is in progress. Further, in a case of a truck with a relatively high center of gravity of the vehicle, when transporting a lot of cargo, because the truck is vulnerable to rolling during traveling in a turning section, braking for securing safety may simultaneously lower the energy efficiency and cause delivery time delay. In a case of the autonomous driving truck for unmanned logistics transportation, because there is no need to consider comfort of an occupant, a need for a method for securing energy efficiency and fast movement using this within a range where vehicle overturning stability is ensured is emerging.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates to a device and a method for controlling autonomous driving.

pertains.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a device for controlling autonomous driving includes a roll angle estimated value calculation device that calculates a roll angle estimated value of an autonomous vehicle based on a height of a center of gravity of the autonomous vehicle, a sprung mass, a spring constant of a suspension, a target speed,

maintenance control of the autonomous vehicle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one implementation, the controller may increase the drive torque when the target speed is higher than the speed of the autonomous vehicle, maintain the drive torque when the target speed is equal to the speed of the autonomous vehicle, and reduce the drive torque when the target speed is lower than the speed of the autonomous vehicle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one implementation, the controller may increase the braking torque when the target speed is lower than the speed of the autonomous vehicle.</p><p

radius of a preceding section of a traveling road of the autonomous vehicle as an initial value of the target turning radius, and receive feedback of at least one of the target speed and/or the target turning radius from the controller.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one implementation, the roll angle estimated value calculation device may calculate the roll angle estimated value of the autonomous vehicle to be proportional to a lateral acceleration determined based on the target speed and the target turning radius, the sprung mass, and the height of the center of gravity, and to be inversely proportional to the spring constant.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one implementation, the reference roll angle calculation device may calculate the reference roll angle to be proportional to a preset safety factor and the wheel tread, and to be inversely proportional to the height of the center of gravity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for controlling autonomous driving includes calculating, by a roll angle estimated value calculation device, a roll angle estimated value of an autonomous vehicle based on a height of a center of gravity of the autonomous vehicle, a sprung mass, a spring constant of a suspension, a target speed, and a target turning radius, and adjusting, by a controller, at least one of the target speed and/or the target turning radius of the autonomous vehicle by comparing a roll angle of the autonomous vehicle with a preset reference roll angle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one

target speed and/or the target turning radius of the autonomous vehicle may include decreasing, by the controller, the target speed when the roll angle estimated value is greater than the reference roll angle, maintaining, by the controller, the target speed when the roll angle estimated value is equal to the reference roll angle, and maintaining, by the controller, the target speed when the roll angle estimated value is smaller than the reference roll angle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one implementation, the adjusting, by the controller, of at least one of the target speed and/or the target turning radius of the autonomous vehicle may include increasing, by the controller, the target turning radius when the roll angle estimated value is greater than the reference roll angle and lane change is possible, maintaining, by the controller, the target turning radius when the roll angle estimated value is equal to the reference roll angle, decreasing, by the controller, the
