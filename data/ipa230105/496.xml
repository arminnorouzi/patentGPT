id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The volume of a hyperinflated lung compartment is reduced by sealing a distal end of the catheter in an airway feeding the lung compartment. Air passes out of the lung compartment through a passage in the catheter while the patient exhales. A one-way flow element associated with the catheter prevents air from re-entering the lung compartment as the patient inhales. Over time, the pressure of regions surrounding the lung compartment cause it to collapse as the volume of air diminishes. Residual volume reduction effectively results in functional lung volume expansion. Optionally, the lung compartment may be sealed in order to permanently prevent air from re-entering the lung compartment.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="146.56mm" wi="85.60mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="189.57mm" wi="157.73mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="189.74mm" wi="154.86mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="162.98mm" wi="87.63mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="160.61mm" wi="93.22mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="162.64mm" wi="95.08mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="107.53mm" wi="66.21mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="201.68mm" wi="164.85mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="210.14mm" wi="141.99mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="217.59mm" wi="136.23mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="210.14mm" wi="135.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="210.14mm" wi="135.38mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="181.02mm" wi="150.45mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="223.60mm" wi="128.44mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="241.13mm" wi="125.90mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="235.46mm" wi="171.11mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="183.39mm" wi="127.42mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="183.39mm" wi="127.25mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="197.44mm" wi="106.43mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00019" num="00019"><img id="EMI-D00019" he="187.28mm" wi="171.62mm" file="US20230000497A1-20230105-D00019.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for endobronchial residual lung volume reduction by passive deflation of hyperinflated segments with functional lung volume expansion as a result.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a significant medical problem affecting 16 million people or about 6% of the U.S. population. Specific diseases in this group include chronic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, and emphysema. While a number of therapeutic interventions are used and have been proposed, none is completely effective, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains the fourth most common cause of death in the United States. Thus, improved and alternative treatments and therapies would be of significant benefit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Of particular interest to the present invention, lung function in patients suffering from some forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can be improved by reducing the effective lung volume, typically by resecting diseased portions of the lung. Resection of diseased portions of the lungs both promotes expansion of the non-diseased regions of the lung and decreases the portion of inhaled air that goes into the lungs but is unable to transfer oxygen to the blood. Lung volume reduction is conventionally performed in open chest or thoracoscopic procedures where the lung is resected, typically using stapling devices having integral cutting blades.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While effective in many cases, conventional lung volume reduction surgery is significantly traumatic to the patient, even when thoracoscopic procedures are employed. Such procedures often result in the unintentional removal of healthy lung tissue and frequently leave perforations or other discontinuities in the lung, which result in air leakage from the remaining lung. Even technically successful procedures can cause respiratory failure, pneumonia, and death. In addition, many older or compromised patients are not able to be candidates for these procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As an improvement over open surgical and minimally invasive lung volume reduction procedures, endobronchial lung volume reduction procedures have been proposed. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,258,100 and 6,679,264 describe placement of one-way valve structures in the airways leading to diseased lung regions. It is expected that the valve structures will allow air to be expelled from the diseased region of the lung while blocking reinflation of the diseased region. Thus, over time, the volume of the diseased region will be reduced and the patient condition will improve.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While promising, the use of implantable, one-way valve structures is problematic in at least several respects. The valves must be implanted prior to assessing whether they are functioning properly. Thus, if the valve fails to either allow expiratory flow from or inhibit inspiratory flow into the diseased region, that failure will only be determined after the valve structure has been implanted, requiring surgical removal. Additionally, even if the valve structure functions properly, many patients have diseased lung segments with collateral flow from adjacent, healthy lung segments. In those patients, the lung volume reduction of the diseased region will be significantly impaired, even after successfully occluding inspiration through the main airway leading to the diseased region, since air will enter collaterally from the adjacent healthy lung region. When implanting one-way valve structures, the existence of such collateral flow will only be evident after the lung region fails to deflate over time, requiring further treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide improved and alternative methods and apparatus for effecting residual lung volume reduction in hyperinflated and other diseased lung regions. The methods and apparatus will preferably allow for passive deflation of an isolated lung region without the need to implant a one-way valve structure in the lung. The methods and apparatus will preferably be compatible with known protocols for occluding diseased lung segments and regions after deflation, such as placement of plugs and occluding members within the airways leading to such diseased segments and regions. Additionally, such methods and devices should be compatible with protocols for identifying and treating patients having diseased lung segments and regions which suffer from collateral flow with adjacent healthy lung regions. At least some of these objectives will be met by the inventions described hereinbelow.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Background Art</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Methods for performing minimally invasive and endobronchial lung volume reduction are described in the following patents and publications: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,026; 6,083,255; 6,258,100; 6,287,290; 6,398,775; 6,527,761; 6,585,639; 6,679,264; 6,709,401; 6,878,141; 6,997,918; 2001/0051899; and 2004/0016435.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides methods and apparatus for passively reducing the residual volume (the volume of air remaining after maximal exhalation) of a hyperinflated or otherwise diseased lung compartment or segment. By &#x201c;passively reducing,&#x201d; it is meant that air can be removed from the diseased lung region without the use of a vacuum aspiration to draw the air from the region. Typically, such passive reduction will rely on a non-implanted one-way flow structure, which permits air to be exhaled or exhausted from the lung region while preventing or inhibiting the inspiration of air back into the lung region. Thus, the methods of the present invention will not require the permanent implantation of valves or other structures prior to actually achieving the desired residual lung volume reduction, as with the one-way implantable valve structures of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The methods and apparatus of the present invention can be terminated and all apparatus removed should it appear for any reason that the desired residual lung volume reduction is not being achieved. Commonly, such failure can be the result of collateral flow into the diseased lung region from adjacent healthy lung region(s). In such cases, steps can be taken to limit or stop the collateral flow and allow resumption of the passive lung volume reduction protocols. In other cases, it might be desirable or necessary to employ open surgical, thoracoscopic, or other surgical procedures for lung resection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Patients who successfully achieve residual volume reduction of hyperinflated or other diseased lung regions in accordance with the principles of the present invention will typically have those regions sealed permanently to prevent reinflation. Such sealing can be achieved by a variety of known techniques, including the application of radiofrequency or other energy for shrinking or sealing the walls of the airways feeding the lung region. Alternatively, synthetic or biological glues could be used for achieving sealing of the airway walls. Most commonly, however, expandable plugs will be implanted in the airways leading to the deflated lung region to achieve the sealing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a first aspect of the present invention, methods for reducing the residual volume of a hyperinflated lung compartment comprise sealingly engaging a distal end of a catheter in an airway feeding the lung compartment. Air is allowed to be expelled from the lung compartment through a passage in the catheter while the patient is exhaling, and air is blocked from re-entering the lung compartment through the catheter passage while the patient is inhaling. As the residual volume diminishes, the hyperinflated lung compartment reduces in size freeing up the previously occupied space in the thoracic cavity. Consequently, a greater fraction of the Total Lung Capacity (TLC), which is the volumetric space contained in the thoracic cavity that is occupied by lung tissue after a full inhalation, becomes available for the healthier lung compartments to expand, and the volume of the lung available for gas exchange commonly referred to in clinical practice as the lung's Functional Vital Capacity (FVC) or Vital Capacity (VC) increases, the result of which is effectively a functional lung volume expansion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The hyperinflated lung compartment will usually be substantially free of collateral flow from adjacent lung compartments, and optionally the patient can be tested for the presence of such collateral flow, for example using techniques taught in copending, commonly assigned application Ser. Nos. 11/296,951 (Attorney Docket No.: 017534-002820US), filed on Dec. 7, 2005; 11/550,660 (Attorney Docket No. 017534-003020US), filed on Oct. 18, 2006; and application Ser. No. 11/428,762 (Attorney Docket No. 017534-003010US), filed on Jul. 5, 2006, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, the methods of the present invention for reducing residual lung volume can be performed in patients having collateral flow channels leading into the hyperinflated or other diseased lung compartment. In such cases, the collateral flow channels may first be blocked, for example, by introducing glues, occlusive particles, hydrogels or other blocking substances, as taught for example in copending application Ser. No. 11/684,950 (Attorney Docket No. 017534-004000US), filed on Mar. 12, 2007, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In other cases, where the flow channels are relatively small, those channels will partially or fully collapse as the residual lung volume is reduced. In such cases, the patient may be treated as if the collateral flow channels did not exist. The effectiveness of reduction in hyperinflation, however, will depend on the collateral resistance between the hyperinflated compartment and the neighboring compartments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, where residual volume reduction is negligible when the resistance to collateral flow R<sub>coll </sub>is very small (significant collateral flow channels) and maximally effective when R<sub>.sub. </sub>coll is very high (no collateral flow channels).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In all of the above methods, it may be desirable to introduce an oxygen-rich gas into the lung compartment while or after the lung volume is reduced in order to induce or promote absorption atelectasis. Absorption atelectasis promotes absorption of the remaining or residual gas in the compartment into the blood to further reduce the volume, either before or after permanent sealing of the lung volume compartment or segment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a second aspect, the present invention provides catheters for isolating and deflating hyperinflated and other diseased lung compartments. The catheter comprises a catheter body, an expandable occluding member on the catheter body, and a one-way flow element associated with the catheter body. The catheter body usually has a distal end, a proximal end, and at least one lumen extending from a location at or near the distal end to a location at or near the proximal end. At least a distal portion of the catheter body is adapted to be advanced into and through the airways of a lung so that the distal end can reach an airway that feeds a target lung compartment or segment to be treated. The expandable occluding member is disposed near the distal end of the catheter body and is adapted to be expanded in the airway that feeds the target lung compartment or segment so that said compartment or segment can be isolated, with access provided only through the lumen or catheter body when the occluding member is expanded. The one-way flow element is adapted to be disposed within or in-line with the lumen of the catheter body in order to allow flow in a distal-to-proximal direction so that air will be expelled from the isolated lung compartment or segment as the patient exhales. The one-way flow element, however, inhibits or prevents flow through the lumen in a proximal-to-distal direction so that air cannot enter the isolated lung compartment or segment while the patient is inhaling.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For the intended endobronchial deployment, the catheter body will typically have a length in the range from 20 cm to 200 cm, preferably from 80 cm to 120 cm, and a diameter near the distal end in the range from 0.1 mm to 10 mm, preferably from 1 mm to 5 mm. The expandable occluding member will typically be an inflatable balloon or cuff, where the balloon or cuff has a width in the range from 1 mm to 30 mm, preferably from 5 mm to 20 mm, when inflated. The one-way flow element is typically a conventional one-way flow valve, such as a duck-bill valve, a flap valve, or the like, which is disposed in the lumen of the catheter body, either near the distal end or at any other point within the lumen. Alternatively, the one-way flow element could be provided as a separate component, for example provided in a hub which is detachably mounted at the proximal end of the catheter body. In other instances, it might be desirable to provide two or more one-way flow elements in series within the lumen or otherwise provided in-line with the lumen in order to enhance sealing in the inspiratory direction through the lumen.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a third aspect of the present invention, a method for determining whether collateral ventilation of a hyperinflated lung compartment is present may involve: sealing a distal end of a catheter in an airway feeding the lung compartment; allowing air to be expelled from the lung compartment through a passage in the catheter while the patient is exhaling; blocking air from entering the lung compartment through the catheter passage while the patient is inhaling; comparing an image of the lung compartment with an earlier image of the lung compartment acquired before the sealing step; and determining whether collateral ventilation is present in the lung compartment, based on comparing the image and the earlier image. In one embodiment, the compared images are CT scans, although in other embodiments alternative imaging modalities may be used, such as MRI, conventional radiographs and/or the like. Typically, though not necessarily, the before and after images will be compared based on size, with a smaller size after catheter placement indicating a lack of significant collateral ventilation and little or no change in size indicating likely significant collateral ventilation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Optionally, one embodiment may involve advancing the catheter through a bronchoscope to position the catheter distal end in the airway before sealing. In one such embodiment, the method may also involve: detaching a hub from a proximal end of the catheter; removing the bronchoscope from the airway by sliding it proximally over the catheter, thus leaving the catheter in the airway; and acquiring the image of the lung compartment. The catheter may be left in the airway for any suitable amount of time before acquiring the image&#x2014;for example in one embodiment between about five minutes and about twenty-four hours. In some embodiments, where it is determined that there is minimal or no significant collateral ventilation of the lung compartment, the method may further include treating the airway to permanently limit airflow into the lung compartment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These and other aspects and embodiments are described in further detail below, with reference to the attached drawing figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an isolation and deflation catheter constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate alternative placements of one-way flow elements within a central lumen of the catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the trans-tracheal endobronchial placement of the catheter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an airway leading to a diseased lung region in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref> illustrate use of the catheter as placed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for isolating and reduction of the volume of the diseased lung region in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph showing the relationship between collateral resistance R<sub>coll </sub>and residual volume reduction in an isolated lung compartment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a minimally invasive method in which a catheter is advanced to the feeding bronchus of a target compartment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrate embodiments of a catheter connected with an accumulator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> depict a graphical representation of a simplified collateral system of a target lung compartment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C</figref> illustrate measurements taken from the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> illustrate a circuit model representing the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B</figref> illustrate measurements taken from the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D</figref> illustrate graphical comparisons yielded from the computational model of the collateral system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> illustrates a two-compartment model which is used to generate a method quantifying the degree of collateral ventilation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> illustrates an electrical circuit analog model.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>C-<b>16</b>E</figref> illustrate the resulting time changes in volumes, pressures and gas concentrations in the target compartment and the rest of the lobe.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an endobronchial lung volume reduction catheter <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention includes an elongate catheter body <b>12</b> having a distal end <b>14</b>, a proximal end <b>16</b>, and an expandable occluding member <b>15</b>, such as an inflatable balloon, mounted near the distal end <b>14</b>. Catheter body <b>12</b> also includes at least one lumen or central passage <b>18</b> extending generally from the distal end <b>14</b> to the proximal end <b>16</b>. Lumen <b>18</b> has a distal opening <b>19</b> at or near the distal end <b>14</b> in order to permit air or other lung gases to enter the lumen <b>18</b> and flow in a distal-to-proximal direction out through the proximal end of the lumen <b>18</b>. Optionally, a hub <b>20</b> will be provided at the proximal end <b>16</b>, but the hub <b>20</b> is not a necessary component of the catheter <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The catheter <b>10</b> is equipped to seal the area between the catheter body <b>12</b> and the bronchial wall such that only the lumen <b>18</b> is communicating with the airways distal to the seal. The seal, or isolation, is accomplished by the use of the occluding member <b>15</b>, such as an inflatable member, attached to (or near) the distal tip <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>10</b>. When there is an absence of collateral channels connecting the targeted isolated compartment to the rest of the lung, the isolated compartment will unsuccessfully attempt to draw air from the catheter lumen <b>18</b> during inspiration of normal respiration of the patient. Hence, during exhalation no air is returned to the catheter lumen. In the presence of collateral channels, an additional amount of air is available to the isolated compartment during the inspiratory phase of each breath, namely the air traveling from the neighboring compartment(s) through the collateral channels, which enables volumetric expansion of the isolated compartment during inspiration, resulting during expiration in air movement away from the isolated compartment to atmosphere through the catheter lumen and the collateral channels. If it is desired to perform Endobronchial Volume Reduction (EVR) on a lung compartment, the lung compartment may be analyzed for collateral ventilation prior to treatment to determine the likelihood of success of such treatment. Further, if undesired levels of collateral ventilation are measured, the collateral ventilation may be reduced to a desired level prior to treatment to ensure success of such treatment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention relies on placement of a one-way flow element within or in-line with the lumen <b>18</b> so that flow from an isolated lung compartment or segment (as described hereinbelow) may occur in a distal-to-proximal direction but flow back into the lung compartment or segment is inhibited or blocked in the proximal-to-distal direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in one embodiment a one-way flow element <b>22</b> may be provided in the lumen <b>18</b> near the distal end <b>14</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>, immediately proximal of the distal opening <b>19</b>. In an alternative embodiment, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the same one-way flow element <b>22</b> may be provided in the lumen <b>18</b> more proximally (either still near the distal end <b>14</b> or even more proximally in some embodiments). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the one-way flow element <b>22</b> may be a duck-bill valve, which opens as shown in broken line as the patient exhales to increase the pressure on the upstream or distal side of the valve <b>22</b>. As the patient inhales, the pressure on the upstream or distal side of the valve is reduced, drawing the valve leaflets closed as shown in solid line.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively or additionally, the one-way flow element <b>22</b> could be provided anywhere else in the lumen <b>18</b>, and two, three, four, or more such valve structures could be included in order to provide redundancy. In some embodiments where the one-way flow element <b>22</b> (or elements) is located within the lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>, the hub <b>20</b> may be removable, or alternatively the catheter <b>10</b> may not include a hub. As will be explained further below, this may facilitate leaving the catheter <b>10</b> in a patient for diagnostic and/or treatment purposes. For example, if the catheter <b>10</b> is advanced into a patient through a bronchoscope, the hub <b>20</b> may be detached to allow the bronchoscope to be removed proximally over the catheter <b>10</b>, thus leaving the catheter body <b>12</b> with the one-way flow element <b>22</b> in the patient.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a third option, a one-way valve structure <b>26</b> in the form of a flap valve could be provided within the hub <b>20</b>. The hub <b>20</b> could be removable or permanently fixed to the catheter body <b>12</b>. Other structures for providing in-line flow control could also be utilized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the catheter <b>10</b> may be coupled with a one-way valve, a flow-measuring device or/and a pressure sensor, all of which are external to the body of the patient and are placed in series so as to communicate with the catheter's inside lumen <b>18</b>. The one-way valve prevents air from entering the target lung compartment from atmosphere but allows free air movement from the target lung compartment to atmosphere. The flow measuring device, the pressure sensor device and the one-way valve can be placed anywhere along the length of the catheter lumen <b>18</b>. The seal provided by the catheter <b>10</b> results, during expiration, in air movement away from the isolated lung compartment to atmosphere through the catheter lumen <b>18</b> and the collateral channels. Thus, air is expelled through the catheter lumen <b>18</b> during each exhalation and will register as positive airflow on the flow-measuring device. Depending on the system dynamics, some air may be expelled through the catheter lumen <b>18</b> during exhalation in the absence of collateral channels, however at a different rate, volume and trend than that in the presence of collateral channels.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Use of the endobronchial lung volume reduction catheter <b>10</b> to reduce the residual volume of a diseased region DR of a lung L is illustrated beginning in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Catheter <b>10</b> is introduced through the patient's mouth, down past the trachea T and into a lung L. The distal end <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> is advanced to the main airway AW leading into the diseased region DR of the lung. Introduction and guidance of the catheter <b>10</b> may be achieved in conventional manners, such as described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,287,290; 6,398,775; and 6,527,761, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the catheter may be introduced through a flexible bronchoscope (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>, functioning of the one-way valve element in achieving the desired lung volume reduction will be described. After the distal end <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> is advanced to the feeding airway AW, the expandable occluding element <b>15</b> is expanded to occlude the airway. The expandable occluding element may be a balloon, cuff, or a braided balloon as described in copending applications Ser. Nos. 60/823,734 (Attorney Docket No. 017534-003800US), filed on Aug. 28, 2006, and 60/828,496 (Attorney Docket No. 017534-003900US) filed on Oct. 6, 2006, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. At that point, the only path between the atmosphere and the diseased region DR of the lung is through the lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter <b>10</b>. As the patient exhales, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, air from the diseased region DR flows outwardly through the lumen <b>18</b> and the one-way valve element <b>22</b>, causing a reduction in residual air within the region and a consequent reduction in volume. Air from the remainder of the lung also passes outward in the annular region around the catheter <b>10</b> in a normal manner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, in contrast, when the patient inhales, no air enters the diseased regions DR of the lung L (as long as there are no significant collateral passageways), while the remainder of the lung is ventilated through the region around the catheter. As the patient continues to inhale and exhale, the air in the diseased region DR is incrementally exhausted, further reducing the lung volume as the external pressure from the surrounding regions of the lung is increased relative to the pressure within the diseased region.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, after some time, typically seconds to minutes, air flow from the isolated lung segment will stop and a maximum or near-maximum level of residual lung volume reduction within the diseased region DR will have been achieved. At that time, treating the patient may comprise occluding the airway AW feeding the diseased region DR, by applying heat, radiofrequency energy, glues, or preferably by implanting an occluding element <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>. Implantation of the occluding element may be achieved by any of the techniques described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,287,290; and 6,527,761, the full disclosures of which have been previously incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, before more permanently occluding the airway, treating the patient may comprise aspirating the target lung compartment. When accessing a lung compartment through an occlusal stent, volume reduction therapy may be performed by aspirating through the catheter and stent. The catheter is then removed and the volume reduction maintained.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/296,951, from which the present application claims priority and which has been previously incorporated by reference, a catheter <b>10</b> as described herein may also be used to determine whether collateral ventilation is present in a lung. The '951 application describes a number of methods and devices for use in determining such collateral ventilation. Additionally or alternatively to those methods/devices, in one embodiment a catheter <b>10</b> (as described above) may be advanced through a bronchoscope and deployed as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref> of the present application. In this embodiment, the catheter <b>10</b> includes at least one one-way flow element <b>22</b> within the lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. The hub <b>20</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> may then be detached, and the bronchoscope may be removed proximally over the catheter body <b>12</b>, leaving the catheter body <b>12</b> in place in the patient. After a desired amount of time (anywhere from several minutes to twenty-four hours or more), an imaging study such as a CT scan may be taken of the patient's lung to see if the residual volume of the diseased lung compartment has decreased. Typically, this CT scan or other imaging study will be compared to a similar study taken before placement of the catheter <b>10</b> to determine if placement of the catheter has caused a reduction in residual volume in the lung compartment. If a reduction is noted, this may indicate that collateral ventilation is absent or minimal. This type of assessment may be used to help decide whether to treat a lung compartment further, such as with an implantable valve or blocking element.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an alternative embodiment, the hub <b>20</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> may be left on, and the catheter <b>10</b> and bronchoscope may be left in the patient for a short time while an imaging study is performed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various alternatives, modifications, and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention which is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Minimally invasive methods, systems and devices are provided for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing collateral ventilation in the lungs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a minimally invasive method in which a catheter <b>10</b> is advanced through a tracheobronchial tree to the feeding bronchus B of the target area C<sub>s</sub>, the compartment targeted for treatment or isolation. The catheter <b>10</b> comprises a shaft <b>12</b> having at least one lumen therethrough and an occlusion member <b>15</b> mounted near its distal end. The catheter <b>10</b> is equipped to seal the area between the catheter shaft <b>12</b> and the bronchial wall such that only a lumen inside the catheter which extends the entire length of the catheter is communicating with the airways distal to the seal. The seal, or isolation, is accomplished by the use of the occlusion member <b>15</b>, such as an inflatable member, attached to the distal tip of the catheter <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the opposite end of the catheter <b>10</b>, external to the body of the patient, a one-way valve <b>16</b>, a flow-measuring device <b>48</b> or/and a pressure sensor <b>40</b> are placed in series so as to communicate with the catheter's inside lumen. The one-way valve <b>16</b> prevents air from entering the target compartment C<sub>s </sub>from atmosphere but allows free air movement from the target compartment C<sub>s </sub>to atmosphere. When there is an absence of collateral channels connecting the targeted isolated compartment C<sub>s </sub>to the rest of the lung, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, the isolated compartment C<sub>s </sub>will unsuccessfully attempt to draw air from the catheter lumen during inspiration of normal respiration of the patient. Hence, during exhalation no air is returned to the catheter lumen. In the presence of collateral channels, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>D</figref>, an additional amount of air is available to the isolated compartment C<sub>s </sub>during the inspiratory phase of each breath, namely the air traveling from the neighboring compartment(s) C<sub>s </sub>through the collateral channels CH, which enables volumetric expansion of the isolated compartment C<sub>s </sub>during inspiration, resulting during expiration in air movement away from the isolated compartment C<sub>s </sub>to atmosphere through the catheter lumen and the collateral channels CH. Thus, air is expelled through the catheter lumen during each exhalation and will register as positive airflow on the flow-measuring device <b>48</b>. This positive airflow through the catheter lumen provides an indication of whether or not there is collateral ventilation occurring in the targeted compartment C<sub>s</sub>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">This technique of measuring collateral flow in a lung compartment is analogous to adding another lung compartment, or lobe with infinitely large compliance, to the person's lungs, the added compartment being added externally. Depending on the system dynamics, some air may be expelled through the catheter lumen during exhalation in the absence of collateral channels, however at a different rate, volume and trend than that in the presence of collateral channels.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments, the catheter <b>10</b> is connected with an accumulator or special container <b>42</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D, <b>6</b></figref>. The container <b>42</b> has a very low resistance to airflow, such as but not limited to e.g. a very compliant bag or slack collection bag. The container <b>42</b> is connected to the external end or distal end <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> and its internal lumen extending therethrough in a manner in which the inside of the special container <b>42</b> is communicating only with the internal lumen. During respiration, when collateral channels are not present as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, the special container <b>42</b> does not expand. The target compartment Cs is sealed by the isolation balloon <b>14</b> so that air enters and exits the non-target compartment C. During respiration, in the presence of collateral channels as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C-<b>9</b>D</figref>, the special container <b>42</b> will initially increase in volume because during the first exhalation some portion of the airflow received by the sealed compartment C<sub>s </sub>via the collateral channels CH will be exhaled through the catheter lumen into the external special container <b>42</b>. The properties of the special container <b>42</b> are selected in order for the special container <b>42</b> to minimally influence the dynamics of the collateral channels CH, in particular a highly inelastic special container <b>42</b> so that it does not resist inflation. Under the assumption that the resistance to collateral ventilation is smaller during inspiration than during expiration, the volume in the special container <b>42</b> will continue to increase during each subsequent respiratory cycle because the volume of air traveling via collateral channels CH to the sealed compartment C<sub>s </sub>will be greater during inspiration than during expiration, resulting in an additional volume of air being forced through the catheter lumen into the special container <b>42</b> during exhalation.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Optionally, a flow-measuring device <b>48</b> or/and a pressure sensor <b>40</b> may be included, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The flow-measuring device <b>48</b> and/or the pressure sensor <b>40</b> may be disposed at any location along the catheter shaft <b>12</b> (as indicated by arrows) so as to communicate with the catheter's internal lumen. When used together, the flow-measuring device <b>48</b> and the pressure sensor <b>40</b> may be placed in series. A one-way valve <b>16</b> may also be placed in series with the flow-measuring device <b>48</b> or/and pressure sensor <b>40</b>. It may be appreciated that the flow-measuring device <b>48</b> can be placed instead of the special container <b>42</b> or between the special container <b>42</b> and the isolated lung compartment, typically at but not limited to the catheter-special container junction, to measure the air flow rate in and out of the special container and hence by integration of the flow rate provide a measure of the volume of air flowing through the catheter lumen from/to the sealed compartment C<sub>s</sub>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It can be appreciated that measuring flow can take a variety of forms, such as but not limited to measuring flow directly with the flow-measuring device <b>48</b>, and/or indirectly by measuring pressure with the pressure sensor <b>40</b>, and can be measured anywhere along the catheter shaft <b>12</b> with or without a one-way valve <b>16</b> in conjunction with the flow sensor <b>48</b> and with or without an external special container <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, a constant bias flow rate can be introduced into the sealed compartment C<sub>s </sub>with amplitude significantly lower than the flow rate expected to be measured due to collateral flow via the separate lumen in the catheter <b>10</b>. For example, if collateral flow measured at the flow meter <b>48</b> is expected to be in the range of 1 ml/min, the bias flow rate can be, but not limited to one tenth (0.1) or one one-hundredth (0.01) of that amount of equal or opposite amplitude. The purpose of the bias flow is to continuously detect for interruptions in the detection circuit (i.e., the working channel of the bronchoscope and any other tubing between the flow meter and catheter) such as kinks or clogs, and also to increase response time in the circuit (due to e.g. inertia). Still, a quick flush of gas at a high flow rate (which is distinguished from the collateral ventilation measurement flow rate) can periodically be introduced to assure an unclogged line.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to determining the presence of collateral ventilation of a target lung compartment, the degree of collateral ventilation may be quantified by methods of the present invention. In one embodiment, the degree of collateral ventilation is quantified based on the resistance through the collateral system R<sub>coll</sub>. R<sub>coll</sub>can be determined based on the following equation:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <semantics definitionURL="">       <mo>&#x2758;</mo>       <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[LeftBracketingBar]"</annotation>      </semantics>      <mfrac>       <mover>        <msub>         <mi>P</mi>         <mi>b</mi>        </msub>        <mo>_</mo>       </mover>       <mover>        <msub>         <mi>Q</mi>         <mi>fm</mi>        </msub>        <mo>_</mo>       </mover>      </mfrac>      <semantics definitionURL="">       <mo>&#x2758;</mo>       <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[RightBracketingBar]"</annotation>      </semantics>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>R</mi>       <mi>coll</mi>      </msub>      <mo>+</mo>      <msub>       <mi>R</mi>       <mi>saw</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0060" num="0000">where R<sub>coll </sub>constitutes the resistance of the collateral channels, R<sub>saw </sub>characterizes the resistance of the small airways, and <o ostyle="single">P<sub>b</sub></o> and <o ostyle="single">Q<sub>fm</sub></o> represent the mean pressure and the mean flow measured by a catheter isolating a target lung compartment in a manner similar to the depictions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">For the sake of simplicity, and as a means to carry out a proof of principle, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> depict a graphical representation of a simplified collateral system of a target lung compartment C<sub>s</sub>. A single elastic compartment <b>31</b> represents the target lung compartment C<sub>s </sub>and is securely positioned inside a chamber <b>32</b> to prevent any passage of air between the compartment <b>31</b> and the chamber <b>32</b>.

The air storage capacity of the alveoli confined to the isolated compartment <b>31</b> representing C<sub>s </sub>is designated as a capacitance element <b>60</b>. The pressure gradient (P<sub>s</sub>&#x2212;P<sub>b</sub>) from the alveoli to atmosphere via the catheter's inside lumen <b>37</b> is caused by the small airways resistance, R<sub>saw</sub>, and is represented by resistor <b>64</b>. The pressure gradient from the alveoli to atmosphere through the collateral channels is generated by the resistance to collateral flow, R<sub>coll</sub>, and is represented by resistor <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0068">Accordingly, the elasticity of the isolated compartment <b>31</b> is responsible for the volume of air obtainable solely across R<sub>coll </sub>during the inspiratory effort and subsequently delivered back to atmosphere through R<sub>saw </sub>and R<sub>coll </sub>during expiration. Pressure changes during respiration are induced by the variable pressure source, P<sub>p1 </sub>representing the varying negative pleural pressure within the thoracic cavity during the respiratory cycle. An ideal diode <b>66</b> represents the one-way valve <b>16</b>, which closes during inspiration and opens during expiration. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B</figref>, the flow measured by the flow meter (Q<sub>fm</sub>) is positive during expiration and zero during inspiration, whereas the pressure recorded on the pressure sensor (P<sub>b</sub>) is negative during inspiration and zero during expiration.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0069">Evaluation of Eqs. 1 &#x26; 8 by implementation of a computational model of the collateral system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> yields the graphical comparisons presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> displays the absolute values of mean Q<sub>fm</sub>(<o ostyle="single">|Q<sub>fm</sub>|</o>) and mean Q<sub>coll</sub>(<o ostyle="single">|Q<sub>coll</sub>|</o>) while the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> shows the model parameters R<sub>coll</sub>+R<sub>saw </sub>plotted together with |<o ostyle="single">P<sub>b</sub>/Q<sub>coll</sub></o>| as a function of R<sub>coll</sub>.

The values denote independent realizations of computer-generated data produced with different values of R<sub>saw </sub>while R<sub>coll </sub>is kept constant at 1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O/(ml/s). It becomes quite apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref> that the flow is maximal when R<sub>coll</sub>&#x2248;R<sub>saw </sub>and diminishes to zero as R<sub>coll </sub>approaches the limits of either &#x201c;overt collaterals&#x201d; or &#x201c;no collaterals&#x201d;. Accordingly, small measured flow Q<sub>fm </sub>can mean both, very small and very large collateral channels and hence no clear-cut decision can be made regarding the existence of collateral ventilation unless R<sub>coll</sub>+R<sub>saw </sub>is determined as |<o ostyle="single">P<sub>b</sub>/Q<sub>fm</sub></o>|. The reason for this is that when R<sub>coll </sub>is very small compared to R<sub>saw</sub>, all gas volume entering the target compartment via the collateral channels leaves via the same pathway and very little gas volume is left to travel to atmosphere via the small airways as the isolated compartment empties. The measured pressure P<sub>b</sub>, however, changes accordingly and effectively normalizes the flow measurement resulting in an accurate representation of R<sub>coll</sub>+R<sub>saw</sub>, which is uniquely associated with the size of the collateral channels and the correct degree of collateral ventilation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0070">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>C-<b>15</b>D</figref> supplement <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref> as it shows how the measured flow Q<sub>fm </sub>continuously diminishes to zero as R<sub>saw </sub>becomes increasingly greater than R<sub>coll </sub>and furthermore increases to a maximum, as R<sub>saw </sub>turns negligible when compared to R<sub>coll</sub>. When R<sub>saw </sub>is very small compared to R<sub>coll</sub>, practically all gas volume entering the target compartment via the collateral channels travels back to atmosphere through the small airways and very little gas volume is left to return to atmosphere via the collateral channels as the isolated compartment empties. Thus, determination of |<o ostyle="single">P<sub>b</sub>/Q<sub>fm</sub></o>| results in an accurate representation of R<sub>coll</sub>+R<sub>saw </sub>regardless of the underlying relation amongst R<sub>coll </sub>and R<sub>saw</sub>. In a healthy human, resistance through collateral communications, hence R<sub>coll</sub>, supplying a sublobar portion of the lung is many times (10-100 times) as great as the resistance through the airways supplying that portion, R<sub>saw </sub>(Inners 1979, Smith 1979, Hantos 1997, Suki 2000). Thus in the normal individual, R<sub>coll </sub>far exceeds R<sub>saw </sub>and little tendency for collateral flow is expected. In disease, however, this may not be the case (Hogg 1969, Terry 1978). In emphysema, R<sub>saw </sub>could exceed R<sub>coll </sub>causing air to flow preferentially through collateral pathways.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0071">Therefore, the above described models and mathematical relationships can be used to provide a method which indicates the degree of collateral ventilation of the target lung compartment of a patient, such as generating an assessment of low, medium or high degree of collateral ventilation or a determination of collateral ventilation above or below a clinical threshold. In some embodiments, the method also quantifies the degree of collateral ventilation, such generating a value which represents R<sub>coll</sub>. Such a resistance value indicates the geometric size of the collateral channels in total for the lung compartment.
