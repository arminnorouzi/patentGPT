Based on the provision notification message received from the resource recovery apparatus <b>200</b>, the server apparatus <b>300</b> identifies the discarding time when the article is discarded.

This allows the information regarding the nutrients, the calories, and the allergic substances taken in by consumers to be more accurately managed.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0225">When the communicator <b>310</b> receives, from the communication apparatus <b>400</b>, the information indicating that two or more consumers have suffered health damage (for example, food poisoning), the processing unit <b>330</b> acquires, from the storage <b>320</b>, the consumption history information corresponding to the consumer identifier of each of the two or more consumers. Based on the consumption history information regarding each of the two or more consumers, the processing unit <b>330</b> may estimate, as the cause of the health damage, the product (product name) taken in by the two or more consumers in common. The processing unit <b>330</b> may estimate the product <b>50</b> that is the cause of the health damage taking into account the sale location information and/or the production location information included in the product information. For example, the processing unit <b>330</b> may estimate, as the cause of the health damage, the product <b>50</b> purchased at the same sale location by the two or more consumers. The processing unit <b>330</b> transmits, to the communication apparatus <b>400</b> via the communicator <b>310</b>, the causal product information indicating the determination result (estimation result) of the product <b>50</b> that caused the health damage.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0226">When the communicator <b>310</b> receives, from the communication apparatus <b>400</b>, information indicating a problem (for example, foreign matter contamination) is discovered in a particular product, based on the consumption history information managed by the processing unit <b>330</b>, the processing unit <b>330</b> determines whether the consumer has consumed (taken in) a related product that is of the same type as the type of the particular product (that has the same product name as the product name of the particular product) and that is related to the particular product. For example, when foreign matter contamination is discovered in a product with the product name &#x201c;abc&#x201d;, the processing unit <b>330</b> identifies consumers who have taken in the product with the product name &#x201c;abc&#x201d; based on the consumption history information of a plurality of consumers managed by the processing unit <b>330</b> and the product information managed by the processing unit <b>330</b>. Based on the production location information included in the product information, the processing unit <b>330</b> may identify consumers who have taken in products having the product name &#x201c;abc&#x201d; and produced in the same lot (related products). The processing unit <b>330</b> transmits, to the communication apparatus <b>400</b> via the communicator <b>310</b>, the related consumer information indicating the identified consumers.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0227">Operation Example of Resource Recovery System</p><p id="p-0238" num="0000">An operation example of the resource recovery system <b>1</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an operation example of the resource recovery system <b>1</b>.
