For example, resin films formed from acrylic resins or urethane resins are used in interlayer films for laminated glass because of being high in transparency. Such an interlayer film for laminated glass is placed between two glass plates, and used in order to integrate the resultant as laminated glass.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Resin films, while are often formed from single resin components when used in applications where transparency is required, are studied in order to have multiple functions by composite formation of two resins and thus formation of phase separation structures such as sea-island structures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, PTL 1 discloses a resin film comprising an acrylic polymer comprising at least nitrogen-containing monomer as a monomer unit, and a crosslinked urethane polymer, in which a sea-island structure is formed by the acrylic polymer and the urethane polymer. The resin film is indicated to not only be excellent in transparency, heat resistance, weather resistance, strength and flexibility, but also have self-restoring ability for self-restoring due to heating.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, PTL 2 discloses a resin particle comprising a (meth)acrylic polymer containing no active hydrogen, and a urethane polymer, in which a phase separation structure is formed from these polymers. The resin particle disclosed in PTL 2 is indicated to be excellent in soft-focus effect without any loss in slipping ability and transparent feeling, due to adjustment so that the refractive index of the resin in each phase satisfies a predetermined relationship, and to be suitably used in external preparations for cosmetics and the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">PTL 1: JP 2015-160866 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">PTL 2: JP 2017-066306 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">However, such resin films formed by composite formation of two resins, while have multiple functions, are low in transparency, in particular, are remarkably reduced in transparency in a region of temperatures lower than room temperature and have room for improvement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a resin composition comprising a continuous phase and a dispersion phase, the resin composition being excellent in transparency at not only room temperature, but also low temperature, as well as a resin film comprising the resin composition, and a glass laminate comprising the resin film.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The present inventors have made intensive studies.

The glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic resin B is also obtained in the same manner, and corresponds to a peak temperature at tan &#x3b4;, obtained by producing a film-shaped sample comprising the thermoplastic resin B and subjecting the sample to dynamic viscoelasticity measurement.

The reason for this is because, when the affinity between the thermoplastic resin A and the thermoplastic resin B is good, the glass transition temperatures of the resins are closer to each other in the case of the resin composition.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">(Glass Transition Temperatures Tg1 and Tg2)</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">In the resin composition of the present invention, the absolute value of the difference between a glass transition temperature Tg1 and a glass transition temperature Tg2, which are each in a range of &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. or more and 50&#xb0; C. or less, is 17&#xb0; C. or less. If the absolute value of the difference between Tg1 and Tg2 is more than 17&#xb0; C., the resin composition is reduced in transparency at low temperature even if favorable in transparency at room temperature.

A common thermoplastic resin is easily changed in refractive index at about the glass transition temperature thereof.

The hot-water bath was installed at 80&#xb0; C., and a polyurethane resin (AG8451) dissolved in ethyl acetate was loaded into the separable flask. The concentration of the polyurethane resin (AG8451) in such an ethyl acetate solution was 25% by mass. Next, the hot-water bath was installed at 70&#xb0; C., and thereafter the monomer component for the acrylic resin (acrylic monomer), mixed at a compounding ratio shown in Table 1, was loaded into a reactor, and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes to thereby remove oxygen in the container. Here, the amounts of compounding were adjusted so that the mass ratio (A/B) between the acrylic resin obtained from the monomer component and the polyurethane resin was a proportion shown in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">Next, a reaction was performed at 70&#xb0; C. for 6 hours with addition of a solution of a polymerization initiator in ethyl acetate into a reaction container in several portions. The polymerization initiator was here sequentially added at the start of the reaction and every lapse of 1 hour thereafter. The total amount of the polymerization initiator loaded was 0.77 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the monomer component forming the acrylic resin. After completion of the reaction, the temperature of the hot-water bath was raised to keep boiling of a reaction liquid for 1 hour, thereby completely decomposing the polymerization initiator in the reaction system. Thereafter, ethyl acetate was added to the reaction container, the temperature was dropped to 23&#xb0; C., and a polymer solution was recovered. The polymer solution obtained was allowed to pass through a filter cloth for removal of a floating object and the like.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0230">Ethanol and toluene were added to the polymer solution obtained above, and the solution was adjusted so that the solid content fraction was 15% by mass and the mixing ratio (mass ratio) in the solvent satisfied ethyl acetate: ethanol:toluene=80:10:10, thereby obtaining a diluted product of the resin composition.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">(Production of Resin Film)</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">A PET release film (trade name &#x201c;PET50&#xd7;1&#x2212;C&#x201d;, manufactured by Nippa Co., Ltd.) was tightly attached to an upper surface of coating glass by ethyl acetate so that a release treatment surface thereof faced up. The release treatment surface of the PET release film was coated with the diluted liquid of the resin composition, obtained above, so that a predetermined thickness was achieved, and thereafter the solvent was removed by drying with a sequential rise of temperature at 30&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, at 50&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, at 80&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, and at 110&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, to form a film including the resin composition, on the PET release film. The film formed was peeled from the PET release film, and a plurality of such films peeled were laminated, to thereby obtain a resin film having a thickness of 800 &#x3bc;m. The resin film was stained as described above to provide an ultrathin section and the section was observed, and thus the resin composition forming the resin film was found to have a sea-island structure (phase separation structure in the present invention), have an average shorter size and an average longer size, with respect to the island (dispersion phase), of 50 nm and 1.2 &#x3bc;m, respectively, and have an aspect ratio of 24.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Examples 2 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 2</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0233">Each resin film was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the type and the compounding ratio of the monomer component for the acrylic resin were changed as in Table 1.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 5</heading><p id="p-0236" num="0234">A resin film was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that a polyurethane resin synthesized using each component described in Table 1 below was used instead of the polyurethane resin used in Example 1 and the type and the compounding ratio of the monomer component for the acrylic resin were changed as in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">(Synthesis of Polyurethane Resin)</p><p id="p-0238" num="0236">Dicyclohexylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate was used as the isocyanate component, polytetramethylene ether glycol (&#x201c;PTMG1000&#x201d; manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, number-average molecular weight 1000) was used as the long-chain polyol component, ethylene glycol was used as the short-chain diol, and triethylenediamine (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was used as the catalyst.
