Photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may consist of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, Ill-Vs (such as but not limited to gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), gallium aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs)), silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (GIGS), quantum dots (OD), copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), and/or perovskites photovoltaic cells.

A flexible photovoltaic device <b>110</b> may have a low stiffness (e.g., less than 5 N/m) and may contain materials with a Glass Young's modulus smaller than 50 GPa. In some embodiments, a flexible photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be disposed onto a flexible substrate <b>114</b>, wherein the flexible substrate <b>114</b> may be made of polymers/thermoplastics (e.g., polyimide and polyester films, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polycarbonate), composite/multilayered films, willow glass, acrylic, metal/metal alloy foils, paper, fabrics/textiles, and/or other flexible materials. In other embodiments, photovoltaic device <b>110</b> may be rigid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be optimized for any light spectrum, such as sunlight or artificial light (e.g., LED, fluorescent, incandescent, grow lights, neon lights, mercury vapor, metal halide, high-intensity discharge, bioluminescent, chemiluminescent), to increase the energy harvesting from solar for a target spectrum. For example, for a given light spectrum, the optimization could target a specific level of light, ranging from 1 lux to 150,000 lux. In some embodiments, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be optimized for indoor light, ensuring that whether photovoltaic device <b>110</b> is indoors or outdoors, there will be enough light to power photovoltaic device <b>110</b> even if photovoltaic module <b>111</b> is not optimized for outdoor light.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, optimizing photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may involve changing layers structure, changing layers thickness, and/or adding layers. For example, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be highly tunable to the light spectrum in varying applications. Internally, color and transparency of photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be tuned by increasing or decreasing device layer thicknesses, choosing photoactive materials based on their spectral absorption properties, varying the ratio of photoactive materials, and adding or removing layers. Externally, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be tuned to a specific light spectrum using anti-reflective coatings, distributed Bragg reflectors, micro-patterning, and other light-trapping structures. In some embodiments, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be engineered such that its absorption spectrum may accept the emission spectrum of the light source. This may be tuned by varying the bandgap of an individual sub-cell (e.g., one of the junctions of photovoltaic module <b>111</b>), or by adding multiple junctions to photovoltaic device <b>110</b> such that the combined absorption spectrum of photovoltaic module <b>111</b> is matched to the light source&#x2014;thereby increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic module <b>111</b>. For example, in inorganic photovoltaic cells, elements may be added to the base photovoltaic cell (e.g., adding N to GaAs) to adjust the bandgap.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, photovoltaic module <b>111</b> may be fabricated in custom shapes to serve functional and/or aesthetic purposes. Substrate <b>114</b>, photovoltaic module <b>111</b>, and protective encapsulation <b>115</b> may take any shape, e.g., a polygon, circle, or any shape made from combinations of straight and curved edges.

Different radios may be used for different applications. For example, some radios which have a shorter range and require lower power may be used indoors (e.g., BLE) where the signal range does not have to be long, while others which have a longer range and require more power may be used outdoors (e.g., LoRa radio for farms, or LTE for moving vehicles).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the electronics device may attach the following components to a backside or topside of photovoltaic module <b>111</b> enabled by exposed top contact <b>112</b> and bottom contact <b>113</b>: batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, thermoelectric devices, light-emitting devices, LEDs, power management chips, logic circuits, microprocessors, microcontrollers, integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, transistors, inductors, diodes, semiconductors, optoelectronic devices, memristors, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, varistors, antennas, transducers, crystals, resonators, terminals, vacuum tubes, optical detectors/emitters, heaters, circuit breakers, fuses, relays, spark gaps, heat sinks, motors, displays (such as, but not limited to, liquid crystal displays (LCD), light-emitting diode (LED), microLED, electroluminescent displays (ELD), electrophoretic displays, active matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), quantum dot (OD), quantum light-emitting diode (QLED), cathode ray tube (CRT), vacuum florescent displays (VFD), digital light processing (DLP), interferometric modulator displays (IMOD), digital microshutter displays (DMS), plasma, neon, filament, surface-conduction electron-emitter displays (SED), field emission displays (FED), Laser TV, and carbon nanotubes), touch screens, external connectors, data storage, piezo devices, speakers, microphones, security chips, and user input controls such as, but not limited to buttons, knobs, sliders, switches, joysticks, directional-pads, keypads, and pressure/touch sensors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the electronics components may be flexible, or they may be rigid components such as die electronics components or larger chips, consistent with disclosed embodiments.
