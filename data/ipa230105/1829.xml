A conventional infant car seat includes a seat unit, a carry handle that is rotatably mounted to the seat unit and that is used by an adult to carry the infant car seat, and a canopy that is also rotatably mounted to the seat unit via a pivoting bow, which can be placed in any number of positions, and that is permitted to provide shade for an infant reclining in the seat unit. Because the carry handle and the canopy usually rotate about the same axis and function independently from one another, they may interfere with one another as they rotate relative to the seat unit. In addition, it becomes difficult to return the canopy back to its usable positions once the canopy rotates beyond its functional limits.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide an infant car seat that can alleviate at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the disclosure, the infant car seat includes a seat main body that has a handle mount, a canopy unit that is operable to positionally cover the seat main body, and a handle that is mounted to the handle mount of the seat main body.

The seat main body <b>2</b> is for placing an infant thereon, and has two handle mounts <b>21</b> respectively disposed on two opposite sides of the seat main body <b>2</b> (only one is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, each of the handle mounts <b>21</b> is formed with a limiting groove <b>211</b> that extends about a mounting axis (A) and has two wall segments <b>212</b> that respectively define opposite ends of the limiting grooves <b>211</b>. In one embodiment, each handle mount <b>21</b> may have only one wall segment <b>212</b> that defines one end of the limiting groove <b>211</b> thereof, and the other end of the limiting groove <b>211</b> is configured as an open end.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the handle <b>3</b> is for carrying the infant car seat, and has two positioning ends <b>31</b> that are respectively mounted to and rotatable relative to the handle mounts <b>21</b> about the mounting axis (A). Each of the positioning ends <b>31</b> of the handle <b>3</b> is formed with a plurality of positioning grooves <b>311</b> that are disposed about the mounting axis (A). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the handle <b>3</b> consists of two handle halves <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, with an installation groove <b>32</b> being formed at a seam between the handle halves <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> and extending along the handle <b>3</b>. The handle <b>3</b> is operably connected to the canopy unit <b>4</b>, so that rotation of the handle <b>3</b> relative to the handle mounts <b>21</b> drives the canopy unit <b>4</b> to move relative to the seat main body <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the canopy unit <b>4</b> includes a canopy bow <b>41</b> that is movable and able to be positioned relative to the handle <b>3</b>, and a canopy <b>42</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that is operable to positionally cover the seat main body <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> is rotatable about the mounting axis (A) and has two ring portions <b>411</b> (only one is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), each of which surrounds the mounting axis (A), and at least one detent <b>412</b> mounted to one of the ring portions <b>411</b>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, each of the ring portions <b>411</b> has a flexible arc segment <b>410</b> that is deformable in a circumferential direction thereof. While the flexible arc segment <b>410</b> has a serpentine structure in this embodiment, it can be of any shape in a modification of the embodiment, as long as it has a cross-section smaller than that of the remaining portion of the ring portion <b>411</b>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the detent <b>412</b> removably engages a selected one of the positioning grooves <b>311</b> of the positioning ends <b>31</b> to position the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the handle <b>3</b>. As such, the canopy bow <b>41</b> can be positioned at different positions relative to the handle <b>3</b>. As each of the ring portions <b>411</b> is deformable in a circumferential direction thereof, the detent <b>412</b> is permitted to be disengaged from the selected one of the positioning grooves <b>311</b> and to engage another one of the positioning grooves <b>311</b> when the canopy bow <b>41</b> is rotated relative to the handle <b>3</b>. In other words, in order to rotate the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the handle <b>3</b>, a user would have to pull on the flexible arc segment <b>410</b> to deform it first, so that the detent <b>412</b> is no longer locked in place and can be disengaged and re-engaged with any of the positioning grooves <b>311</b>. In one embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> may have a plurality of detents <b>412</b> that are mounted to the ring portions <b>411</b> and that respectively and removably engage the corresponding positioning grooves <b>311</b> of the positioning ends <b>31</b> to position the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the handle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the canopy bow <b>41</b> is movable and able to be positioned relative to the handle <b>3</b> via the deformation of the flexible arc segment <b>410</b> and the engagement between the positioning grooves <b>311</b> and the detent <b>412</b> in this embodiment, different types of positioning mechanisms may be employed in other embodiments, without utilizing the abovementioned elements. For example, in one embodiment, the opposite ends of the canopy bow <b>41</b> may be respectively in frictional contact with the positioning ends <b>31</b> of the handle <b>3</b>. By designing either the opposite ends of the canopy bow <b>41</b> or the positioning ends <b>31</b> with uneven, rougher surfaces, the frictional contact between the opposite ends of the canopy bow <b>41</b> and the positioning ends <b>31</b> is capable of positioning the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the handle <b>3</b>. In another embodiment, the opposite ends of the canopy bow <b>41</b> may be respectively and magnetically coupled to the positioning ends <b>31</b> of the handle <b>3</b> for the canopy bow <b>41</b> to be positioned relative to the handle <b>3</b>. In yet another embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> is rotatable about the mounting axis (A), and the infant car seat may further include a latch member that is movably mounted to the seat main body <b>2</b> and that is permitted to lock the canopy bow <b>41</b> in multiple positions. In other words, the latch member separably engages both of the handle <b>3</b> and the canopy bow <b>41</b> to position the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the handle <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, each of the ring portions <b>411</b> of the canopy bow <b>41</b> further has a limiting protrusion <b>413</b>. The limiting protrusion <b>413</b> is permitted to be inserted into the limiting groove <b>211</b> of a corresponding one of the handle mounts <b>21</b> of the seat main body <b>2</b>, and is movable along the limiting groove <b>211</b> between the wall segments <b>212</b>, so as to limit the range of rotational movement of the canopy bow <b>41</b> relative to the seat main body <b>2</b>. As such, the canopy bow <b>41</b> would not rotate beyond its functional limits, ensuring that the canopy unit <b>4</b> would remain in its usable positions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the canopy bow <b>41</b> is mounted to the handle <b>3</b> instead. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, in this modification of the embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> is directly mounted to the handle <b>3</b> at a point (B) spaced apart from the handle mounts <b>21</b> of the seat main body <b>1</b>. As a result, whenever the handle <b>3</b> rotates relative to the seat main body <b>2</b> about the mounting axis (A), the canopy bow <b>41</b> simultaneously rotates with the handle <b>3</b> about the mounting axis (A) as well.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, the canopy <b>42</b> has opposite first and second end portions <b>421</b>, <b>422</b> that are respectively connected to the handle <b>3</b> and the canopy bow <b>41</b>, and a main canopy portion <b>423</b> that is connected between the first and second end portions <b>421</b>, <b>422</b>. Specifically, the first end portion <b>421</b> is retained within the installation groove <b>32</b> of the handle <b>3</b>, and has a thickness greater than that of the main canopy portion <b>423</b>. As previously mentioned, since the handle <b>3</b> consists of the two handle halves <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, the first end portion <b>421</b> of the canopy may be preassembled alongside the two handle halves <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> of the handle <b>3</b>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in a modification of the embodiment in which the handle <b>3</b> is molded as a single piece, the installation groove <b>32</b> has an elongated opening <b>321</b> that has a width smaller than the thickness of the first end portion <b>421</b> of the canopy <b>42</b>, and an installation opening (not shown) that is in spatial communication with the elongated opening <b>321</b> and that permits the first end portion <b>421</b> of the canopy <b>42</b> to slide therethrough to be retained within the installation groove <b>32</b> after the assembly of the handle <b>3</b>. Furthermore, there are other means for connecting the first end portion <b>421</b> of the canopy <b>42</b> to the handle <b>3</b>, such as utilizing snaps, buttons or straps.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> may be configured such that, when the distal portion of the canopy bow <b>41</b> is located above the seat main body <b>2</b>, the handle <b>3</b> is located out of the path of the rotational movement of the canopy bow, so that the handle <b>3</b> and the canopy bow <b>41</b> are configured not to interfere with each other. As such, the distal portion of the canopy bow <b>41</b> is operable to be located ahead of the handle <b>3</b> or behind the handle <b>3</b> to provide various types of shade.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, while the canopy bow <b>41</b> of the canopy unit <b>4</b> is present in this embodiment, the canopy bow <b>41</b> may be omitted in other embodiments without hindering the functionality of the infant car seat (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this configuration of the embodiment, the first and second end portions <b>421</b>, <b>422</b> of the canopy <b>42</b> of the canopy unit <b>4</b> are respectively connected the handle <b>3</b> and the seat main body <b>2</b> instead. The second end portion <b>422</b> may be connected to the seat main body <b>2</b> via means similar to the connection method of the first end portion <b>421</b> to the handle <b>3</b>, such as utilizing snaps, buttons or straps.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Overall, the positioning mechanism established among the seat main body <b>2</b>, the canopy unit <b>4</b> and the handle <b>3</b> ensures that rotation of the handle <b>3</b> relative to the handle mount <b>21</b> drives simultaneous rotation of the canopy <b>4</b> relative to the seat main body <b>2</b> as well, so that the handle <b>3</b> and the canopy unit <b>4</b> do not interfere with one another during use, and that only intentional procedure performed on the canopy unit <b>4</b> would cause the canopy unit <b>4</b> to rotate relative to the handle. In addition, if the canopy unit <b>4</b> has a canopy bow <b>41</b>, the inclusion of the limiting protrusion <b>413</b> paired with the limiting groove <b>211</b> of the corresponding one of the handle mounts <b>21</b> prevents the canopy bow <b>41</b> from rotating beyond its functional limits, thereby maintaining its usability.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiment.
