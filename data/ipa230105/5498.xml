Data centers often utilize both tape storage and disk storage to complement each other. Tape storage is often used for backup and archival data storage. Disk storage is often used for more frequently accessed data storage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Magnetic tape data storage (&#x201c;data tape&#x201d;) uses digital recording on magnetic tape to store digital information. Tapes are packed in cartridges or cassettes. A tape drive performs read/write operations from/to the tape. A robotically-accessed tape library houses data tape cartridges to provide large quantities of data storage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Over time, data tape quality may degrade. Degradation may be a result of physical wear in the data tape or data tape cartridge. Alternatively, the degradation may be a result of media errors, or errors in the data stored on the data tape. Data tape libraries employ monitoring systems to detect errors in read/write operations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued.

General Overview</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0021">A storage tape analytics (STA) application monitors the operating status of media devices in a data tape library. Media devices include data tapes, data tape cartridges, and media drives. The STA application may also provide a user interface to allow a user to interact with a display of the media devices in the data tape library. The user interface may provide operational data, such as an operational status of a media device. The STA application may allow a user to perform media validation operations, including validating data tapes and calibrating and qualifying media drives. When a media validation operation is performed with a calibrated media drive, a system may associate any alerts resulting from the media validation operation with the data tape with a high level of confidence. For example, a read error may be associated with a default recommendation to clean the media drive used in a media validation operation. However, if the media drive is calibrated, the system may, with a high level of confidence, generate an alternative recommendation to check the data tape instead of cleaning the media drive.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">Calibrating a media drive includes performing a statistical analysis of the drive when a data tape cartridge of a known quality is inserted in the drive. Calibrating the media drive may result in a successful calibration or a calibration failure. A successful calibration occurs when a number or type of errors identified during the calibration operation is less than a predefined threshold. A failed calibration may result when the number or type of errors is greater than the threshold, or when insufficient data is available to complete the calibration.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">Successfully calibrating a media drive allows the STA application to perform a media validation of a tape drive using the calibrated media drive. Since the media drive has been calibrated, the STA application can identify the operational status of a tape drive with a high degree of confidence. For example, if a media validation operation on a tape drive inserted into the calibrated media drive indicates the data tape is degraded, the STA can indicate with a high degree of confidence that the detected degradation may be attributed to the data tape and not the calibrated media drive. Similarly, the STA application may generate recommended actions for a tape drive with a high level of confidence.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">One or more embodiments include a data tape system that generates action recommendations for a data tape based on a particular measured data quality value of the data tape. The particular data quality value may be measured using the calibrated media drive. The system may generate recommended actions based on the data quality value. The system may generate a confidence level for the recommended actions based on the calibration result of the calibrated media drive. The data tape quality value may be based on: (a) a particular data tape error correction value representing detected errors associated with the data tape, (b) a particular value representing an amount of data processed (read/write operations performed on the data tape), and (c) a scaling factor. In one or more embodiments, the data tape quality value is a data tape read quality value indicating a readability of the data tape. The scaling factor represents a relationship between the data tape error correction value, the value representing the amount of data processed in read/write operations of the data tape, and a degradation level of the data tape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">One or more embodiments include receiving a request to perform an action using a media drive. The action may be, for example, a media validation operation to validate an operating status of a data tape. The system determines whether the media drive is calibrated. If the media drive is not calibrated, the system performs a calibration operation to ensure the request is carried out on a calibrated media drive. For example, the system may perform a calibration operation of the media drive. If the calibration is successful (i.e., a calibration score exceeds a threshold), the system executes the requested operation on the media drive. If the calibration is unsuccessful, the system may execute the requested operation on another media drive that is calibrated. Alternatively, the system may generate a selectable notification on a user interface that permits selection of the media drive or an alternative media drive for carrying out the requested operation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">One or more embodiments include determining whether a media drive is calibrated by determining: (a) that the media drive has been calibrated, and (b) determining an amount of data that has been read from or written to data tapes using the media drive since the last calibration. Alternatively, the determination may be based on determining (b) an amount of time that has passed since the last calibration. Upon determining that a media drive has been calibrated and an amount of data processed, or an amount of time elapsed, exceeds a threshold, the system may perform a qualification operation on the media drive to re-calibrate the media drive.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">One or more embodiments include receiving a metadata message from a data tape library. The metadata message includes status indication of a data tape or media drive and a recommended action. The system determines a confidence level for the recommended action based on a calibration status of the media drive. For example, if the metadata message indicates the media drive cause the error, and if the system determines the media drive was successfully calibrated, the system may alter the recommendation or associate the recommendation with a low confidence score. For example, the system may identify a similar type of error associated with an error in data tapes. The system may alter the generated recommendation to recommend taking action on the data tape instead of the media drive. The system may transmit the altered recommendation to a user interface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">One or more embodiments include a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays data tape library data. The GUI allows a user to view and select data tapes, media drives, and operations to be performed using the data tapes and media drives. The GUI includes one or more fields specifying media validation values, data tape quality values, and calibration values for data tapes and media drives. The GUI may include one or more selectable user interface elements to initiate a calibration operation of a media drive, a media validation operation of a data tape, and a data tape quality calculation of the data tape.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">One or more embodiments described in this Specification and/or recited in the claims may not be included in this General Overview section.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">2. System Architecture</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>100</b> includes a data tape library <b>110</b>, a data tape control engine <b>120</b>, a user interface <b>130</b>, a data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b>, and a data repository <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">The data tape control engine <b>120</b> provides commands to the library controller <b>114</b> to perform a read or write operation on the data tape <b>112</b> of the data tape cartridge <b>111</b>. The library controller <b>114</b> controls a robot arm of the data tape library <b>110</b> to access the data tape cartridge <b>111</b> and insert the data tape cartridge <b>111</b> into a media drive <b>113</b> to perform the read or write operation. Once the data tape cartridge <b>111</b> is loaded into the media drive <b>113</b>, the data tape control engine <b>120</b> communicates with the media drive <b>113</b> to perform the read and/or write operations. During a read operation, the media drive <b>113</b> transmits read data from the data tape <b>112</b> to the data tape control engine <b>120</b>. During a write operation, the data tape control engine <b>120</b> transmits write data to the media drive <b>113</b> to write to the data tape <b>112</b>. Upon completion of the read and/or write operations, the library controller <b>114</b> de-mounts the data tape cartridge <b>111</b> from the media drive <b>113</b>. The library controller <b>114</b> detects, upon completion of the read and/or write operations, performance information, such as whether read and/or write operations were successful, error data, and other performance notifications. A data tape monitor <b>121</b> receives from the library controller <b>114</b> the performance information associated with the read and/or write operation. If the operation results in a hard error, such as an inability of the media drive <b>113</b> to write to, or read from, the data tape <b>112</b>, the data tape monitor <b>121</b> receives an alert from the library controller <b>114</b>. The alert may include a recommended action. Examples of alerts include hard error alerts, advisory alerts, and informational alerts. A hard error alert may be any error that prevents read/write operations, such as a total loss of the data tape, mechanical malfunction, media corruption, or extreme wear of the data tape.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">The library controller <b>114</b> transmits hard error alert data, advisory alert data, and informational alert data associated with read and/or write operations as metadata to the data tape control engine <b>120</b>. A hard error alert may be any error that prevents read and/or write operations, such as a total loss of the data tape, mechanical malfunction, media corruption, or extreme wear of the data tape.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">In one embodiment, the library controller <b>114</b> includes an application or program that analyzes the performance of the media drive <b>113</b> associated with a read and/or write operation and generates hard error alerts, advisory alerts, and informational alerts. The hard error alert may include a recommendation that the data tape should not be used to store data. The hard error alert may also include a notice that the data tape is unusable, and a read/write operation could not be carried out. An advisory alert may indicate that an error occurred during a read/write operation, but that the operation was able to be performed successfully. The advisory alert may also provide a notice that information included in the data tape should be moved to another data tape in the near future. An informational-type alert occurs when a read/write operation occurs without any errors. For example, the library controller <b>114</b> may be configured to generate an informational alert when it determines a particular distance of data tape has been read. For example, if an amount of data written to/read from a data tape corresponds to a full wrap (traversing the tape from one end to the other), the library controller <b>114</b> may generate an informational-type alert. Informational alerts may also indicate a type of data tape cartridge <b>111</b> being read from/written to, that a particular tape has been in use for a particular amount of time, or any other information that does not necessarily include a tape failure or data read/write error.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">In addition to generating commands to read from/write to a data tape <b>112</b> in the data tape library <b>110</b>, the data tape control engine <b>120</b> may also control operating modes and monitoring commands of the data tape library <b>110</b>. For example, in a data tape analysis operating mode, the data tape control engine <b>120</b> may issue calibration commands, qualification commands, data tape quality measurement commands, or media quality commands. For example, an operator may access a graphical user interface (GUI) displayed by the user interface <b>130</b> to request a media validation of a particular data tape <b>112</b> in the data tape library <b>110</b>. In the data tape analysis operating mode, the library controller <b>114</b> may return data about the state of the data tape <b>112</b> included in the media validation request without receiving any write data from the data tape control engine <b>120</b> and without transmitting any read data to the data tape control engine <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">The data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> analyzes data generated by the library controller <b>114</b> and the data tape monitor <b>121</b> of the data tape control engine <b>120</b>. The data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> includes a data tape quality value generator <b>141</b>, a data tape quality value tuning engine <b>143</b>, a media drive calibration and qualification engine <b>146</b>, and a data tape media validation engine <b>147</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">The data tape quality value generator <b>141</b> generates a data tape quality value based on a data tape quality value algorithm <b>142</b>. The data tape quality value algorithm <b>142</b> includes values representing (a) a particular data tape error correction value, (b) a particular value representing an amount of data processed (read/write), and (c) a scaling factor. In one embodiment, the data tape quality value is a data tape read quality value indicating a readability of the data tape. The data tape read quality value may include data associated with read operations while excluding data associated with write operations. In one embodiment, the particular data tape error correction value is a filtered &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value. The &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value represents a type of read error requiring physical rewinding of the data tape to re-read a portion of the data tape that was previously read, but which resulted in an error. Filtering the total corrected read errors value includes omitting from the value the re-reads that are not necessarily the result of read errors. For example, if a tape drive is known to re-read portions of the data tape when first beginning a read operation, the re-read operations at the beginning of the read operation may be omitted from the filtered &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value. Otherwise, the total corrected read errors value may be artificially inflated. The system may track an amount to data read from the data tape in read operations and/or written to the data tape in write operations to obtain the value representing an amount of data processed. Alternatively, the system may derive the value representing the amount of data processed by tracking a length of tape read from or written to, and deriving, based on a known amount of data per distance, the amount of data read from/written to the data tape.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">The scaling factor is a numerical value which represents a relationship between the data tape error correction value, the value representing the amount of data processed in read/write operations of the data tape, and a degradation level of the data tape. The data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> includes a data tape quality value tuning engine <b>143</b>. The data tape quality value tuning engine <b>143</b> adjusts the scaling factor for a particular data tape or set of data tapes based on data tape attribute data <b>161</b>. Example data tape attribute data <b>161</b> includes: a type of data tape, a brand of data tape, a material making up the data tape, dimensions of the data tape (such as thickness, width, length), media characteristics (such as compression levels, amount of data stored, number of over-writes on the data tape), and environmental attributes (such as humidity, temperature, light levels, and magnetic field strengths of an environment in which the data tape is stored). For example, for a particular brand of data tape, storage at a higher temperature and humidity may cause the data tape to degrade more rapidly when the data tape is frequently accessed for data re-reads and re-writes. In an embodiment in which a machine learning model generates a scaling factor, the data tape quality value tuning engine <b>143</b> provides feedback to the machine learning model engine during training of the model. Based on the feedback, the machine learning model engine updates a training data set and re-trains the model.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">In one embodiment, the data tape quality value algorithm <b>142</b> may be represented as:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">DTQ=90&#x2212;&#x3b1;*(2*TCREF/WR){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}&#x3b2;, where DTQ is the data tape quality value, &#x3b1; is a degradation co-efficient, TCREF is a filtered total corrected read error value, WR is a &#x201c;wraps read&#x201d; value, corresponding to the value representing the amount of read data tape, and &#x3b2; is the scaling factor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">In the above equation, the value &#x201c;90&#x201d; defines a range of values for the data tape quality value. However, embodiments encompass any range of values. The range of potential values for a data tape quality may be set by a user, for example. The degradation coefficient is a value less than 90 that defines how much the &#x201c;errors per distance&#x201d; calculations (raised to the scaling factor) will increase/reduce the data tape quality value. For example, if the degradation coefficient is set to &#x201c;20,&#x201d; then the final data tape quality value will be calculated as the &#x201c;errors per distance&#x201d; times 20. The degradation coefficient may be set by a user, for example, to cause the data tape quality values to fall along a desired range of values.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">In one embodiment, the data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> includes a machine learning engine <b>144</b> for training a machine learning model to generate, for a particular set of data tape attributes, a scaling factor value. For example, the machine learning engine <b>144</b> may generate a training data set from the data tape attribute data <b>161</b> to identify sets of data tape attributes and corresponding scaling factor values. The machine learning model may be trained to identify relationships among different data tape attributes and scaling factor values. In an alternative embodiment, the data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> maps a particular data tape attribute or set of attributes to a particular scaling factor using a mapping table <b>145</b>. The mapping table <b>145</b> may include, for example, fields representing ranges of values for data tape attributes and scaling factor values associated with the ranges of values.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">The media drive calibration and qualification engine <b>146</b> performs a media drive calibration on a designated media drive <b>113</b> in the data tape library <b>110</b>. For example, a data tape library <b>110</b> may include multiple media drives <b>113</b>. One or more of the media drives may be designated as &#x201c;validation&#x201d; drives. These drives may be calibrated, using a data tape cartridge <b>111</b> having known attributes, to ensure the media drive <b>113</b> designated as a validation drive meets a threshold operation status. In addition, the validation drive may be inaccessible to host applications that read from and write to data tapes <b>112</b> in the data tape library <b>110</b>. Instead, the validation drive may be accessible only by the library controller <b>114</b> for carrying out calibration, qualification (ensuring continued calibration of the media drive), and validation operations. Consequently, when a media validation is requested for a particular data tape <b>112</b>, the library controller <b>114</b> selects, from among the multiple media drives <b>113</b>, the media drive that is calibrated and designated as the validation drive. Since the validation drive has been calibrated, the result of the media validation operation is more likely to accurately reflect a state of the media, and not necessarily a state of the validation drive. In one or more embodiments, the library controller <b>114</b> uses a calibrated media drive <b>113</b> to perform a statistical analysis to generate the data tape quality value.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">The data tape media validation engine <b>147</b> determines an operating state of a particular data tape <b>112</b> in the data tape library <b>110</b>. The validation operation may be initiated by a user, by a pre-defined schedule, or by any triggering event detected by the library controller <b>114</b> or the data tape monitor <b>121</b>. For example, a data tape control engine <b>120</b> may store a set of rules for determining when a validation is performed. The set of rules may include one rule to perform a validation of the data tape <b>112</b> after a predetermined number of uses of a data tape <b>112</b>, another rule to perform a validation of the data tape <b>112</b> after a predetermined period of time has elapsed, and another rule to perform a validation of the data tape <b>112</b> after a predetermined number of read/write errors is detected when reading from or writing to the data tape <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">In one embodiment, the data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> includes a recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b>.

The machine learning model may be trained to identify relationships among different data tape attribute data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and metadata messages <b>165</b> and action recommendations. In addition, the machine learning engine <b>144</b> may train the machine learning model based on data indicating whether a prescribed action resulted in a successful correction of an error or not. For example, the training data set may include the data tape attribute data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and metadata messages <b>165</b>, as well as an indication of the historical action recommended for the set of data tape attributes and an indication of whether the historical recommended action resulted in successful resolution of a detected error.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">In an alternative embodiment, the data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> maps a particular set of data tape attribute data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and metadata messages <b>165</b> to a particular action recommendation using a mapping table <b>145</b>.

The library metadata message analysis engine <b>149</b> may analyze a library metadata message <b>165</b> and determine whether to bypass a machine learning engine <b>144</b>. For example, if the data tape control engine <b>120</b> controls the data tape media validation engine <b>147</b> to initiate a media validation of a particular data tape <b>112</b>, the library controller <b>114</b> may generate a hard error metadata message. The hard error metadata message may indicate that the selected data tape is no longer usable by host applications for read or write operations. Based on the particular type of library metadata message, the library metadata message analysis engine <b>149</b> may transmit the library metadata message directly to the recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> without applying a machine learning algorithm to an input data set including the library metadata message.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">In one embodiment, the recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> stores one or more tables indicating prescribed recommendations and actions for particular sets of data tape attributes data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and library metadata messages <b>165</b>. The one or more tables may be generated by a machine learning model trained by the machine learning engine <b>144</b> to function as an expert system. The machine learning engine <b>144</b> may train a machine learning model to analyze historical data including the data tape attribute data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and library metadata messages <b>165</b> associated with previously-encountered or analyzed data tapes. The historical data may also be obtained from additional sources, such as online libraries including historical data tape information. The machine learning engine <b>144</b> trains the machine learning model based on the historical data to generate, for different combinations of input data, corresponding action recommendations. The recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> stores the action recommendations in the one or more tables. Upon encountering a particular set of data tape attribute data <b>161</b>, data tape quality values <b>162</b>, and library metadata messages <b>165</b> resulting from a data tape media validation operation, the recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> consults the one or more tables to generate a recommendation or to initiate an action.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">In one embodiment, one or more of the library metadata messages <b>165</b> may include a default recommendation. For example, the library controller <b>114</b> may generate a library metadata message indicating that a particular read error occurred and recommending cleaning of a media drive. However, the recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> may generate a different recommendation by taking into account not only the library metadata message, but also a data tape quality value, a data tape media validation value, and a calibration value of a media drive. A machine learning model may determine that, for the particular set of input data cleaning the media drive would not necessarily resolve the error. Instead, the machine learning model may recommend cleaning a data tape.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">Examples of recommendations generated by the recommendation generator and action initiating engine <b>148</b> include: (1) use a different media drive for the requested operation, (2) migrate data from the data tape to another data tape, (3) an end-of-life metric has been detected: migrate data to another data tape, (4) data tape quality is less than quality required for the stored media&#x2014;replace the data tape with one of a higher quality grade, (5) wrong type of data tape detected for requested operation&#x2014;change data tape, (6) data drive is incompatible with data tape&#x2014;change to another data drive and repeat operation, (7) data tape read failure&#x2014;migrate data to another data tape and do not use data tape, (8) recommendation not possible&#x2014;type of error unknown, (9) clean media drive, (10) clean data tape, (11) re-run requested operation, (12) data encryption error encountered&#x2014;re-run requested operation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">In one or more embodiments, interface <b>130</b> refers to hardware and/or software configured to facilitate communications between a user and the data tape control engine <b>120</b> and data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b>.

Data Tape Media Action Recommendation Based on Media Drive Calibration</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example set of operations for generating action recommendations for data tape media based on media drive calibration in accordance with one or more embodiments. One or more operations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be modified, rearranged, or omitted all together. Accordingly, the particular sequence of operations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> should not be construed as limiting the scope of one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">A system receives a request to perform an operation (Operation <b>202</b>). For example, a user may select a user interface element on a GUI to select a particular data tape, a particular media drive, and a particular operation to be performed. According to one example embodiment, a user selects only a data tape for an operation, without selecting any particular media drive to perform the operation. For example, the user may request to write data X to memory location Y. The system may refer to an address table to identify the data tape associated with memory location Y. The system may designate, without any intervening user selection of any media drive, a particular media drive to perform the operation. According to another example, a data tape library may include one or more pools of media drives for performing read/write operations from/to data tapes. The system may select a media drive at random, based on an operational status of the media drive, based on a type of the data tape, or based on any other criteria.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061">The system determines if the requested operation is a validation operation (Operation <b>204</b>). A validation operation is a particular type of operation that causes a data tape library controller to perform a statistical analysis on a data tape to identify an operational state of the data tape. For example, the validation operation may result in a state of &#x201c;usable-good,&#x201d; &#x201c;usable-degraded,&#x201d; &#x201c;warning: migrate data,&#x201d; and &#x201c;unusable.&#x201d; According to an embodiment, a validation operation may be selected by an operator or system independently of other read, write, and erasure operations. For example, an operator or application may request a data read operation to read data from memory. The operator or application may request a data write operation to write data to memory. The operator or application may request a data erasure operation to erase data from memory. The read, write, and erasure operations may be performed without validating the data tape. In other words, the read, write, and erasure operations process data on a data tape without determining the operational state of the data tape.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">If the operation is not a validation operation, the system initiates the operation using the selected data tape and media drive (Operation <b>206</b>). For example, the system may initiate a read operation from the data drive or a write operation to the data drive using the selected media drive.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0063">If the requested operation is a validation operation, the system determines if a calibration value for the selected media drive meets a threshold value (Operation <b>208</b>). For example, a calibration value may be within a range from 0-100, with 100 being an error-free calibration operation, 75-100 being good condition, 40-75 being usable but not recommended, and 0-50 being unusable or unreliable. The system may determine whether the calibration score for the selected media drive is 75 or greater.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0064">In addition to determining a calibration value, one or more embodiments include determining whether a media drive is calibrated by determining: (a) that the media drive has been calibrated, and (b) determining an amount of data that has been read from or written to data tapes using the media drive since the last calibration. Alternatively, the determination may be based on (b) determining an amount of time that has passed since the last calibration. Upon determining that a media drive has been calibrated and an amount of data processed, or an amount of time elapsed, exceeds a threshold, the system may perform a qualification operation on the media drive to re-calibrate the media drive.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0065">If the calibration value meets the threshold value, the system may initiate the requested validation operation using the particular media drive (Operation <b>214</b>). If the calibration value does not meet the threshold value, the system may initiate a media drive calibration or qualification procedure (Operation <b>210</b>). For example, the system may determine that the media drive has not been calibrated. In response, the system may initiate an operation to calibrate the media drive. As another example, the system may determine that the media drive was calibrated previously, but that a certain amount of data has been written to/read from data tapes using the media drive, or that a certain amount of time has elapsed since the last calibration. Accordingly, the system may initiation a qualification operation of the media drive.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">The calibration or qualification operation may include providing the media drive with a calibration data tape having a known good operational status. The system may perform a statistical analysis of read and write operations of the media drive using the calibration data tape to perform the calibration or qualification operation. The system assigns a calibration status to the media drive based on the results of the statistical analysis. As discussed above, a calibration value may be within a range from 0-100, with 100 being an error-free calibration operation (&#x201c;Gold&#x201d; status), 75-100 being good condition (&#x201c;Good&#x201d; status), 40-75 being usable but not recommended (&#x201c;Usable&#x201d; status), and 0-50 being unusable or unreliable (&#x201c;Unusable&#x201d; status).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">In the case of a qualification operation to update the calibration status of the media drive, the system updates the calibration status of the media drive based on the results of the qualification operation. For example, an initial calibration status of the media drive may have been &#x201c;Usable.&#x201d; Subsequent to the qualification operation, the system may determine that the status of the media drive is &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; indicating the statistical analysis returned fewer errors than the initially-performed calibration operation. Alternatively, the system may determine that the status of the media drive is &#x201c;Unusable,&#x201d; indicating the statistical analysis returned more errors than the initially-performed calibration operation.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">According to yet another example, the system may initiate a calibration procedure by selecting a different media drive than the requested media drive for performing the media validation operation. For example, the particular media drive may be one media drive of a particular type among a pool of similar media drives. The system may determine that the requested media drive is uncalibrated or has an &#x201c;Unusable&#x201d; calibration status. The system may select another, calibrated, media drive from the pool of media drives for performing the validation operation. The system may select the alternative media drive based on the alternative media drive having a status of &#x201c;Good&#x201d; or &#x201c;Gold.&#x201d; The system may further generate a notification to a user interface to inform an operator of a change in a media drive. In one embodiment, the notification includes a selectable user interface element to allow the operator to select whether to replace the un-calibrated media drive with a calibrated media drive.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">The system obtains a data tape quality value associated with a data tape (Operation <b>212</b>). The system may retrieve a previously-stored data tape quality value. Alternatively, the system may calculate the data tape quality value using the requested calibrated media drive or another media drive. The data tape quality value may be based on: (a) a particular data tape error correction value representing detected errors associated with the data tape, (b) a particular value representing an amount of data processed (read/write operations performed on the data tape), and (c) a scaling factor. The scaling factor represents a relationship between the data tape error correction value, the value representing the amount of data processed in read/write operations of the data tape, and a degradation level of the data tape. According to one embodiment, the system calculates the data tape quality value based on an algorithm that includes a degradation coefficient. The algorithm may raise a product of (a) the particular data tape error correction value and (b) the particular value representing the amount data processed to an exponent value equal to the scaling factor. The degradation coefficient may be applied to the product of the data tape error correction value and the value representing the amount of data processed to indicate a weight applied to the product to generate the data tape quality value.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">In one embodiment, the data tape quality value is a data tape read quality value representing a readability of the data tape. The data tape read quality value may be generated without data representing write operations associated with the data tape. According to an alternative embodiment, the data tape quality value may include write data. A data tape quality value including write data may indicate a ratio of an actual density of recorded data to a maximum recordable density of data.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">The system may calculate the particular data tape error correction value based on tracking data tape errors associated with the data tape over time. The system may assign different weights to different types of errors. For example, the system may assign a greater weight to detected read errors that delay a read operation beyond a threshold delay time than to read errors that delay the read operation below the threshold delay time. For example, one read error may result in restarting a read operation, while another read error may be corrected using error correction processes without requiring restarting of the read operation. The system may store values representing types of read/write/erasure errors and a frequency of the errors. The system may calculate the particular data tape error correction value based on the stored information associated with the type and frequency of read, write, and/or erasure errors.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">In one embodiment, the particular data tape error correction value is a filtered &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value. The &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value represents a type of read error requiring physical rewinding of the data tape to re-read a portion of the data tape that was previously read, but which resulted in an error. Filtering the total corrected read errors value includes omitting from the value the re-reads that are not necessarily the result of read errors. For example, if a tape drive is known to re-read portions of the data tape when first beginning a read operation, the re-read operations at the beginning of the read operation may be omitted from the filtered &#x201c;total corrected read errors&#x201d; value. Otherwise, the total corrected read errors value may be artificially inflated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">The system calculates the value representing the amount to data processed by tracking the data tape usage over time. According to one embodiment, the value representing the amount of data processed is measured in units of data, such as bytes (e.g., gigabytes, terabytes, etc.) Alternatively, the system may derive the value representing the amount of data processed by tracking a length of tape read from or written to, and deriving, based on a known amount of data per distance, the amount of data read from/written to the data tape. For example, the system may track read and/or write operations spanning 100 meters over time. It is noted that the tracked read/write distance may be more than, or less than, a total length of the data tape. For example, if a data tape has a length of 10 meters, the system may track a series of operations over time, each of which corresponds to a read/write distance (e.g., the distance of the data tape passing over a read/write head of a media drive) less than 10 meters. The sum of the read/write distances associated with the series of operations may add up to 100 meters.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">The system generates the scaling factor by applying a trained machine learning model to attributes of a data tape. The model generates a scaling factor for a particular data tape based on the attributes of the particular data tape. The scaling factor may be set by either a preproduction process (default scaling factor) or later as a sensitivity adjustment by a user or service provider. The scaling factor may also be set by an expert system via machine learning. The system may derive the scaling factor from a set of exchanges between data tapes and media drives. In one embodiment, attributes of data tapes used to define a scaling factor for a particular data tape or set of data tapes is collected at the end of an exchange between a data tape and a media drive.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">The system performs the media validation operation (Operation <b>214</b>). The system provides the selected data tape to the selected media drive and performs a statistical analysis of the data tape to generate a media validation value for the data tape. The media validation value may be based, for example, on the data tape quality value and one or more additional metrics measured during the validation operation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">According to one embodiment, the validation operation includes measuring a frequency of a certain type of error encountered during the validation operation. Examples of the types of errors that may be encountered during a validation operation include the filtered &#x201c;total corrected read errors,&#x201d; errors that do not require rewinding of the data tape to be resolved, errors associated with code or data stored on the data tape, errors associated with a physical condition of a data tape, such as a damaged tape or damaged cartridge, and errors associated with a physical condition of a media drive.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">The system generates a recommended action based on the validation operation (Operation <b>216</b>). In one embodiment, the system refers to a table that maps media validation values to particular actions. For example, the table may indicate that if the media validation value is below a threshold level, the data on the data tape should be migrated to another data tape. The table may indicate that if the media validation value is above a threshold level, the data tape is in good condition. The table may recommend re-scheduling a media validation operation for a future time or after a threshold number of data access operations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">In one embodiment, the recommended action takes into account the calibration status of the media drive. For example, during, or subsequent to performing the validation operation (Operation <b>214</b>) or the requested operation (Operation <b>206</b>), a data tape library controller may generate a metadata message including a default recommended action based on a detected error during or after the validation operation (Operation <b>214</b>) or the requested operation (Operation <b>206</b>). The system may generate a recommended action that differs from the default recommended action generated by the data tape library. In one embodiment, the system is embodied as a data tape library platform including software and hardware for interfacing with the data tape library. The data tape library platform may correspond, for example, to the data tape analysis and action recommendation engine <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The data tape library platform may include software and hardware providing functionality to display to a user via a graphical user interface (GUI) information about data tape cartridges, data tapes, media drives, read/write/erasure operations, and recommendations for actions associated with the data tapes and media drives. The data tape library may generate a default recommendation based on software and hardware associated with the data tape library. The data tape library platform may generate the alternative recommendation that differs from the default recommendation based on the metadata generated by the data tape library as well as based on additional data measured and/or generated by the data tape library platform.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">For example, the data tape library may detect an error indicating that a read operation required rewinding and re-reading a particular portion of the data tape multiple times to complete the read operation. Based on the detected error, the data tape library may generate a default recommendation to clean or inspect a media drive. However, the system may determine, based on a high calibration value associated with the media drive, that the media drive has been found in good condition. Based on the calibration state of the media drive, the system may determine that the default recommendation to clean or inspect the media drive is not likely to address the detected error. Accordingly, based on the calibration state of the media drive, the system may generate an alternative recommendation to clean or inspect a data tape associated with the performed operation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080">According to another example embodiment, the system may generate a confidence score associated with a default recommendation. The system may generate a high confidence score when a default recommendation corresponds to both (a) a detected error, and (b) a calibration state of a media drive. The system may generate a low confidence score when a default recommendation has an inverse correspondence with one or both of (a) a detected error, and (b) a calibration state of a media drive.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">For example, the system may transmit a default recommendation, generated by a data tape library, to inspect a media drive to a data tape library platform to display on a graphical user interface (GUI). Based on a good calibration status of the media drive, the system may determine that inspecting the media drive is not likely to address the detected error. Accordingly, the system may generate a low confidence score associated with the default recommendation. The system may cause the GUI of the data tape library platform to display the confidence score together with the default recommendation. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may generate a warning or alert that the identified error status may not be accurate. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may present to a user both the default recommendation generated by the data tape library and the alternative recommendation generated by the data tape library platform. The system may further present confidence scores associated with the default recommendation and the alternative recommendation.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0082">According to one or more embodiments, a system may use a media drive for a read/write/erasure operation that the system would not recommend for a validation operation. For example, a media drive having a calibration status of &#x201c;poor&#x201d; may be used by a system to perform read and write operations on data tapes. The media drive may be one media drive in a pool of media drives, and the system may select the media drive based on one or more of: (a) requirements of a read/write operation, and (b) usage rates of the media drives in the pool of media drives. As an example, the system may alternate usage among the different media drives in a pool of media drives to extend the life of all the media drives in the pool of media drives. The system may identify priority levels of read/write operations to determine whether a read/write operation requires a media drive having a &#x201c;good&#x201d; calibration status. If the read/write operation does not require a media drive having a &#x201c;good&#x201d; calibration status, the system may select a media drive for performing a read/write operation based on usage rates among the media drives. If the system determines that a read/write operation requires a media drive having a &#x201c;good&#x201d; calibration status, the system may select a media drive having a &#x201c;good&#x201d; calibration status to perform the read/write operation, even if the selected media drive has a higher usage rate&#x2014;such as a higher total amount of data processed, or a higher total distance of data tape read to or written from&#x2014;instead of a media drive having a lower usage rate.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0083">According to one embodiment, the system may select a particular media drive to perform an operation according to the type of operation. For example, if the operation is a read/write operation other than a data tape validation operation, the system may select a media drive having a &#x201c;poor&#x201d; calibration status to perform a read/write operation. For example, as discussed above, the system may select the media drive from among a set of media drives based on usage rates of the respective media drives. On the other hand, if the operation is a data tape validation operation, the system may select from among a set of media drives having a &#x201c;good&#x201d; calibration status, and excluding media drives having a &#x201c;poor&#x201d; calibration status, to perform the data tape validation operation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> describes an embodiment in which a data tape quality value is considered when generating an action recommendation only for a particular class of metadata messages from a data tape library, in one or more embodiments, the system may always consider the data tape quality value when generating recommendations.

Another type of user input device is cursor control <b>416</b>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>404</b> and for controlling cursor movement on display <b>412</b>. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0122">Computer system <b>400</b> may implement the techniques described herein using customized hard-wired logic, one or more ASICs or FPGAs, firmware and/or program logic which in combination with the computer system causes or programs computer system <b>400</b> to be a special-purpose machine. According to one embodiment, the techniques herein are performed by computer system <b>400</b> in response to processor <b>404</b> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory <b>406</b>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <b>406</b> from another storage medium, such as storage device <b>410</b>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>406</b> causes processor <b>404</b> to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0123">The term &#x201c;storage media&#x201d; as used herein refers to any non-transitory media that store data and/or instructions that cause a machine to operate in a specific fashion. Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and/or volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <b>410</b>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>406</b>. Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge, content-addressable memory (CAM), and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0124">Storage media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media. Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media. For example, transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>402</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0125">Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <b>404</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <b>400</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus <b>402</b>. Bus <b>402</b> carries the data to main memory <b>406</b>, from which processor <b>404</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>406</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>410</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0126">Computer system <b>400</b> also includes a communication interface <b>418</b> coupled to bus <b>402</b>. Communication interface <b>418</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>420</b> that is connected to a local network <b>422</b>. For example, communication interface <b>418</b> may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface <b>418</b> may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <b>418</b> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0127">Network link <b>420</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>420</b> may provide a connection through local network <b>422</b> to a host computer <b>424</b> or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>426</b>. ISP <b>426</b> in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; <b>428</b>. Local network <b>422</b> and Internet <b>428</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>420</b> and through communication interface <b>418</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>400</b>, are example forms of transmission media.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0128">Computer system <b>400</b> can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <b>420</b> and communication interface <b>418</b>. In the Internet example, a server <b>430</b> might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet <b>428</b>, ISP <b>426</b>, local network <b>422</b> and communication interface <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0129">The received code may be executed by processor <b>404</b> as it is received, and/or stored in storage device <b>410</b>, or other non-volatile storage for later execution.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0130">In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation.
