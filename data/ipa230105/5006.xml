It will be apparent, however, to one ordinarily skilled in the art, that the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In consumer networks and the product advertising industry, fraud and error in coupon redemption costs hundreds of millions of dollars, annually. In addition to the direct economic loss, there is the negative environment generated by the divided liabilities associated with fraud. Particularly, the business relation between brand manufacturers and retailers become fraught and jaded, e.g., when a promotional campaign for a selected product becomes mired in fraudulent activity and invalidity claims. The advent and prevalence of mobile networks enabling electronic dissemination of offers, advertisements, and financial data, has only exacerbated the problem.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A system as provided herein is configured to solve the above problem by applying the technical solution offered by a centralized and decentralized network system that handles the brand manufacturer end and the retailer end of the coupon transaction (e.g., from offer to redemption of the coupon). Additionally, some embodiments include the added technical feature of a blockchain record representing each stage of the coupon transaction. The blockchain record may be generated by a blockchain host in a blockchain network, upon request by a server in the centralized and decentralized network system. It is desirable to maintain a low latency for recording the coupon transaction to the blockchain record. Accordingly, some embodiments include a robust and efficient communication with the blockchain host to avoid redemption issues. Embodiments as disclosed herein avoid the common problem of delivering a coupon to the user at the checkout lane when the coupon is not ready to be validated by a point of sale (POS) device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>10</b> configured for providing coupons <b>140</b> that a consumer <b>101</b> can redeem and account for through a network <b>150</b>, at a reduced fraud likelihood. More generally, a coupon <b>140</b> consistent with embodiments disclosed herein may be any promotion (e.g., coupons, vouchers rebates, and the like) associated with a selected product <b>122</b> (e.g., a branded product). Without limitation, network <b>150</b> may include mobile devices <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, household computers, television sets, and any other sensors and devices that connect to the Internet and remote servers such as a server <b>130</b>A, a server <b>130</b>B (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;servers <b>130</b>&#x201d;), and a database <b>152</b>, communicatively coupled to one another, wirelessly (e.g., cellular network, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the like) or through a wired channel (e.g., telephone line, Ethernet, and the like). The devices in servers <b>130</b>, and database <b>152</b>, may each include at least a memory circuit and one or more processor circuits. The memory circuits may include instructions which, when executed by the processor circuits, cause the devices, servers <b>130</b>, and database <b>152</b> to perform at least some steps in methods as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Server <b>130</b>A may include a publisher. Accordingly, server <b>130</b>A may be a publisher server that collaborates with a consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturer to promote and advertise products <b>122</b> through in-store printers <b>115</b> and a load-to-card network.

In some embodiments, server <b>130</b>A may also distribute coupons <b>140</b> to consumer <b>101</b> through network <b>150</b> (e.g., via consumer mobile device <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>), based on a loyalty card <b>130</b> certifying that consumer <b>101</b> is member of a network service provided by server <b>130</b>A.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, server <b>130</b>B may be part of blockchain network <b>155</b>. In some embodiments, server <b>130</b>B may create and host a blockchain record for each coupon <b>140</b>. Blockchain network <b>155</b> may be hosted by one or more CPG content distributors that work with CPG Brands to issue and distribute coupons <b>140</b> through promotional campaigns and the like. Accordingly, it may be desirable for one or more CPG content distributors to host blockchain network <b>155</b>, thus setting an industry standard.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The blockchain record may include a sequence of blocks corresponding to different steps in the coupon history: offer, validation, and redemption by a consumer. The blocks for the transaction are concatenated in a cryptographic linkage. More generally, servers <b>130</b> may provide any network service to consumer <b>101</b> including retail shopping, consumer brands, services, information, entertainment, travel, business, and the like.

Without limitation, multiple servers <b>130</b> may host multiple applications <b>122</b> installed in the devices, providing different network services to the user. In some embodiments, at least one of servers <b>130</b> may host a coupon <b>140</b> for consumer <b>101</b>, valid in the purchase of one of products <b>122</b> at POS <b>170</b>. The coupon may be a barcode or a QR code displayed on the consumer mobile device, that can be scanned by an ID device <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> or a POS device <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>, by a cashier <b>103</b> or automatically, when the selected product is included in a shopping basket <b>120</b>.

In general, events in diagram <b>300</b> may occur at an arbitrary time, simultaneously or overlapping, notwithstanding the specific embodiment illustrated in the figure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The manufacturer (e.g., server A) creates and submits a coupon (offer) to the consumer. The coupon may be a promotion associated with a selected product (e.g., a branded product) such as a voucher, or any other value added certificate. For example, the promotion may include a voucher for the purchase of the product (e.g., a S5.00 voucher), or a rebate (e.g., save $1.00!). The manufacturer then registers the coupon transaction with a blockchain host (e.g., server B) that opens a block thread for the offer. The coupon is thus assigned an ID, which is stored in a blockchain database together with the value, the product item associated with it, and an ID of the consumer to which the offer was made (and who presumably has accepted the offer).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At a later time, the consumer decides to use the coupon and presents the coupon at a POS of a retail store. The consumer may scan a barcode or a QR code with the coupon or offer, at the POS. The POS transmits the offer to the blockchain host where the coupon is clipped to confirm authenticity, first time use, the consumer ID, product quantity, terms and conditions of the offer, and other details included in the original coupon offer, according to the blockchain. The blockchain host validates the coupon redemption (barcode issued by manufacturer? Step <b>302</b>) and ensures that the barcode is not deemed fraudulent (step <b>304</b>), the barcode has not been previously used (step <b>306</b>), and that the purchase requirements have been met (e.g., payment complete, step <b>308</b>). Then, the blockchain host communicates a validation message to the POS. For any failure associated with the above, the consumer is denied the promotion discount (step <b>316</b>). In the case of completing all steps until the purchase requirements, the blockchain host also needs to validate that there aren't multiple offers for the same product (step <b>310</b>), and that multiple offers for the same product cannot be combined and used simultaneously. The decision of which offer to allow is determined by the blockchain host based on the promotion metadata and anti-stacking rules (step <b>312</b>). The system verifies which offers are allowed (step <b>314</b>). In the case where all previous gating rules and restrictions have been satisfied, the POS sends a message to the blockchain sever that the coupon, certificate, or voucher can be redeemed (step <b>318</b>). The blockchain host may then complete the blockchain sequence and store it a database, or delete it from memory. In some embodiments, the blockchain host may associate a &#x201c;redeemed&#x201d; label to the record for the coupon, certificate, voucher, or confirmation, and store the record in the database (step <b>318</b>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>400</b> including content providers <b>435</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>435</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>435</b>-<b>3</b> (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;content providers <b>435</b>&#x201d;), retailers <b>470</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>470</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>470</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>470</b>-<b>4</b> (hereinafter, collectively referred to as &#x201c;retailers <b>470</b>&#x201d;), a retail integrator <b>475</b>, and a coupon server <b>430</b>B, according to some embodiments.

Retailer <b>570</b> uses the private key to unlock the public address and validate the coupon data in the blockchain record (step <b>513</b>). Blockchain host <b>530</b>B prevents fraud for retailer <b>570</b> by verifying the coupon data with the associated blockchain record, using consensus of multiple parties. Thus, blockchain host <b>530</b>B can help retailer <b>570</b> quickly establish that a coupon can be trusted. Blockchain host <b>530</b>B handles redemption rules for the coupons. Accordingly, access or redemption of the coupon is provided through the private key, in the absence of which a coupon cannot be redeemed. When the credentials for the coupon presented to blockchain host <b>530</b>B are legitimate and the redemption rules are met, blockchain host <b>530</b>B adds a redeem block <b>525</b> with a new address and a new private key to the blockchain network and provides the new private key to retailer <b>570</b>.
