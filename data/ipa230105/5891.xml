With various advantages of light emitting diodes over conventional light sources, such as longer lifespan, lower power consumption, and rapid response, light emitting diodes have been replacing conventional light sources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Light emitting diodes have been generally used as backlight light sources in display apparatuses. However, LED displays that directly display images using the light emitting diodes have been recently developed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a display apparatus realizes various colors through mixture of blue, green, and red light. In order to display various images, the display apparatus includes a plurality of pixels each having sub-pixels corresponding to blue, green and red light, respectively. In this manner, a color of a certain pixel is determined based on the colors of the sub-pixels so that images can be displayed through combination of such pixels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since LEDs can emit various colors depending upon materials thereof, a display apparatus may be provided by arranging individual LED chips emitting blue, green, and red light on a two-dimensional plane. However, when one LED chip is arranged in each sub-pixel, the number of LED chips may be increased, which may require excessive time for a mounting process during manufacture.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, when the sub-pixels are arranged on a two-dimensional plane in the display apparatus, a relatively large area is occupied by one pixel that includes the sub-pixels for blue, green, and red light. Accordingly, an area of each LED chip may need to be reduced to arrange the sub-pixels in a restricted area. However, reduction in size of LED chips may cause difficulty in mounting the LED chips, as well as reducing luminous areas of the LED chips.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above information

for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various exemplary embodiments or implementations of the invention. As used herein &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d; and &#x201c;implementations&#x201d; are interchangeable words that are non-limiting examples of devices or methods employing one or more of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. It is apparent, however, that various exemplary embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with one or more equivalent arrangements. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring various exemplary embodiments. Further, various exemplary embodiments may be different, but do not have to be exclusive. For example, specific shapes, configurations, and characteristics of an exemplary embodiment may be used or implemented in another exemplary embodiment without departing from the inventive concepts.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated exemplary embodiments are to be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of some ways in which the inventive concepts may be implemented in practice. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the features, components, modules, layers, films, panels, regions, and/or aspects, etc. (hereinafter individually or collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;), of the various embodiments may be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and/or rearranged without departing from the inventive concepts.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The use of cross-hatching and/or shading in the accompanying drawings is generally provided to clarify boundaries between adjacent elements. As such, neither the presence nor the absence of cross-hatching or shading conveys or indicates any preference or requirement for particular materials, material properties, dimensions, proportions, commonalities between illustrated elements, and/or any other characteristic, attribute, property, etc., of the elements, unless specified. Further, in the accompanying drawings, the size and relative sizes of elements may be exaggerated for clarity and/or descriptive purposes. When an exemplary embodiment may be implemented differently, a specific process order may be performed differently from the described order. For example, two consecutively described processes may be performed substantially at the same time or performed in an order opposite to the described order. Also, like reference numerals denote like elements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When an element, such as a layer, is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, connected to, or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. When, however, an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. To this end, the term &#x201c;connected&#x201d; may refer to physical, electrical, and/or fluid connection, with or without intervening elements. Further, the D1-axis, the D2-axis, and the D3-axis are not limited to three axes of a rectangular coordinate system, such as the x, y, and z-axes, and may be interpreted in a broader sense. For example, the D1-axis, the D2-axis, and the D3-axis may be perpendicular to one another, or may represent different directions that are not perpendicular to one another. For the purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;at least one of X, Y, and Z&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one selected from the group consisting of X, Y, and Z&#x201d; may be construed as X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more of X, Y, and Z, such as, for instance, XYZ, XYY, YZ, and ZZ. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc. may be used herein to describe various types of elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;higher,&#x201d; &#x201c;side&#x201d; (e.g., as in &#x201c;sidewall&#x201d;), and the like, may be used herein for descriptive purposes, and, thereby, to describe one elements relationship to another element(s) as illustrated in the drawings. Spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of an apparatus in use, operation, and/or manufacture in addition to the orientation depicted in the drawings. For example, if the apparatus in the drawings is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the apparatus may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and, as such, the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting.
