Marketplaces have evolved, where energy and utilities are traded, on a current basis and via various financial instruments, including futures contracts, options, and various forms of derivative securities. Platforms involving information technology, including &#x201c;smart grid&#x201d; elements, middleware, software, and other elements, have evolved to help parties like large enterprises manage energy and utility usage, such as by managing demand for energy to heat or cool buildings based on the price and availability of energy at any given time and by managing the water supply. However, despite these highly complex technologies that balance overall supply and demand for power and other utilities and that enable sophisticated trading of energy and other utilities based on current and future pricing, for the typical retail consumer these variable characteristics of the infrastructure remain almost entirely opaque. A consumer may receive a period report indicating the per unit price of energy or other utilities and the amount consumed, but there is little or no visibility into the sources used to produce the energy or other utility, the actual price of the energy or other commodities to the utility that services the consumer, or many other factors that characterize the marketplace from which the consumer's power, water, or the like is provided. As consumers become increasingly interested in the sources of energy or other utilities (e.g., preferring renewable energy to fossil fuels) and continue to need control of their cost of consuming energy and other utilities, a need exists for methods and systems that provides greater visibility to consumers, that provides increased control for consumers with respect to their consumption of energy and other utilities, and that provides mechanisms for optimizing visibility and control to provide a higher value experience in the acquisition and consumption of energy and other utilities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transmission distribution service providers (TDSPs) for electrical power also face significant challenges. Because consumer reactions to changing prices are very slow (in part due to the absence of frequent updates in pricing information for consumers), TDSPs need to constantly invest in the grid and related protection infrastructure, to address higher peak demand, even though that demand may only ever be called upon to be used rarely, such as for an hour a year. This problem, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;gold-plating the grid,&#x201d; requires much greater capital investment than if consumer behavior could be shaped to reduce the frequency or extent of peak demand events. A need exists for methods and systems that allow consumers to react more quickly to changes in the grid, thereby reducing the need for spending on infrastructure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An automated marketplace platform for energy and other utilities, referred to in some cases simply as the utility marketplace, utility marketplace, the marketplace, or the platform, is disclosed herein, with various systems, components, modules, services, facilities and processes (these being collectively referred to herein for convenience as &#x201c;modules,&#x201d; &#x201c;components,&#x201d; or the like), including information technology components specifically configured to enable consumers, such as retail consumers of energy and other utilities, to purchase and consume utilities efficiently and according to their preferences and needs, and including characteristics (such as relating to current and future energy and utility prices, sources of energy or utilities of particular types, and the like) of the underlying energy or utility infrastructure and marketplaces that are managed by incumbent entities like utilities, energy companies, and independent service organizations (ISOs).

marketplace platform or marketplace <b>100</b>. A utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may match demand and supply. A utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may match consumer demand and available wholesale energy supply, including via the work of a real-time pricing engine. A real-time pricing engine may calculate prices using real-time usage data across an aggregated set of consumer users, as well as using real-time energy production data across multiple production types (and across the different real-time wholesale prices associated with each of the production types). Historically, consumer energy meters were read about once per month or once per calendar quarter. Meters were measured and multiplied over a month or more and consumption amounts were multiplied by a fixed price to generate prices. A utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may perform similar functions in much smaller increments (e.g., 15-minute increments), which may present vastly greater opportunities for consumers to obtain, and act upon, prices that are accurate in real time (i.e., on smaller time scales of as little as seconds, minutes, a fraction of an hour, an hour, a day, or the like). Real-time pricing handled in the real time pricing engine may reflect current market pricing and/or forward-looking market pricing, such as day-ahead pricing or pricing associated with other future time periods. In embodiments, the platform may separately handle forward-looking pricing, such as day-ahead pricing, using data from, for example, a day-ahead market in a manner similar to that depicted for real-time pricing. References to real-time pricing throughout this disclosure should be understood to encompass embodiments that use forward-looking pricing in combination with or as an alternative to current market pricing, except where context indicates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">In embodiments, the energy platform may use defined rules. These rules may be packaged, followed and passed back to consumers. In embodiments, smart meters <b>186</b> may provide consumption data in real-time or near real-time to the platform <b>100</b>. The energy platform <b>100</b> may then perform the required pricing calculations to present consumption costs to consumers and to present the anticipated cost of future consumption opportunities, among other things.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">In embodiments, a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may include a data repository <b>102</b>. A data repository <b>102</b> (which may comprise a unified data repository, such as a database, but in embodiments may be distributed across various data storage facilities, including one or more cloud platforms, proprietary networks, or other storage configurations) may include a wide range of types of data obtained from various sources. This may include energy usage data <b>146</b>, price data <b>148</b> and tax and credit data <b>154</b> (such as data relating to the availability of renewable energy credits, carbon credits, and the like). Price data <b>148</b> may include historical pricing data <b>150</b>, real-time pricing data <b>152</b>, and/or forward looking pricing data, such as day-ahead pricing data <b>190</b>. Price data <b>148</b> may also include energy cost data <b>170</b>, ancillary services cost data <b>168</b>, other independent system operator (ISO) generated cost data <b>166</b>, transmission utility price data <b>164</b>, generation utility price data <b>162</b>, and the like. Tax and credit data <b>154</b> may include federal tax and credit data <b>160</b>, state tax and credit data <b>158</b>, local tax and credit data <b>156</b>, and the like. In embodiments, integration of tax and credit data <b>154</b> may enable the utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> to facilitate comprehensive optimization of energy consumption by consumers <b>132</b>, including by accounting for taxes, renewable energy credits and the like at the federal, state and local level, so that consumers can act upon the &#x201c;real&#x201d; price (net of taxes and credits), when making energy consumption choices.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">Energy usage data <b>146</b>, price data <b>148</b> and tax and credit data <b>154</b> may include weather zone usage data <b>188</b>, energy mix data <b>172</b>, data from other sources <b>174</b> and data from ISO's <b>176</b>. ISO's <b>176</b> may connect to transmission utilities <b>178</b> and generation utilities <b>180</b>. Energy usage data <b>146</b> may include consumer grid energy usage data, electric vehicle energy usage data, battery usage data and the like. Consumer grid energy data may include home energy data and enterprise energy data.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0333">In embodiments, energy usage data <b>146</b> may be received from an ISO 176. Energy usage data <b>146</b> may be received at intervals, for example a 15-minute interval. Energy usage data <b>146</b> may be received on an operating day (OD) plus 1. Energy usage data <b>146</b> may be made available to a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> in an energy efficiency device. The utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may use data sources, including energy usage data <b>146</b>, consumer behavior data, gamification data (such as from a gamification engine <b>138</b> or gamification UI), energy mix data <b>172</b>, weather zone usage data <b>188</b>, pricing data <b>148</b>, and other data sources <b>174</b> to predict various factors, including energy usage, prices, demand, production, and the like. Predicting various factors may include using data science and machine learning, such as provided by a prediction and machine learning engine <b>104</b>, prediction engine <b>106</b> and the like.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334">In embodiments, a retail consumer energy marketplace may work cooperatively with smart meters that may measure electrical energy usage, such as in a home, office, apartment, and the like. Smart meters may also communicate with usage reading and/or regulating devices within the home, effectively behind the meter from the perspective of the electrical grid. Usage reading and/or regulating devices behind the meter may receive energy usage information being measured by the meter. These devices may also connect through a network, such as a WiFi network (e.g., a WiFi network in the home and the like), a cellular-type network and the like with a platform operating the marketplace. These devices and the marketplace may exchange usage, real-time pricing, capacity, raw energy source utilization, and related information about the energy being provided through the smart meter.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">In embodiments, the usage reading and/or regulating devices behind the meter may use energy costs, capacity, raw energy sourcing, and related information to adjust how one or more devices that are associated with the usage reading and/or regulating device operate. Regulating how an energy consuming device operates, such as by controlling when it consumes energy and how much it consumes in a given timeframe, may contribute to regulation of consumption. Criteria may be set to guide the consumption of energy. In embodiments, criteria may include limits on cost of operation, carbon use (e.g., operating when renewable energy is used as a source of electricity), transmission and distribution grid congestion management, compliance with standards for electrical energy signal frequency, voltage, and the like.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">In embodiments, matching usage with renewable generation sources including renewable sources offered over the grid and those available behind the meter, such as when a homeowner has solar panels, energy storage (e.g., battery) functionality, and the like. Additionally, behind the meter usage reading and/or regulating may facilitate better regulation of energy provided over the energy distribution network (e.g., electrical grid) by, for example, coordinating use of behind-the-meter energy production and storage resources with local distributed resource, and where applicable large scale grid connected resources may facilitate improving grid stability and the like.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">Utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may integrate supply-side pricing data received from an ISO on a 15-minute interval. Utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may integrate price data received from an ISO 176 on an hourly basis for energy cost data <b>170</b>, ancillary services cost data <b>168</b>, and other ISO generated cost data <b>166</b>. Energy platform <b>100</b> may integrate price data from transmission utilities <b>178</b> and TDSP <b>184</b> for the energy grid infrastructure to deliver electricity to consumers <b>132</b>. Integration of pricing data may enable much more rapid responses by various players, including consumers, enabling them to save cost and enabling TDSPs to more efficiently use existing infrastructure and reduce the need for very expensive infrastructure improvements that are needed to address increasing peak demand levels.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">Energy mix data <b>172</b> may obtain and track information about what sources of energy are supplying a grid that will supply energy that can be purchased by a consumer. For example, energy mix data <b>172</b> may indicate that only 5% of the energy on the grid at a given time is from renewable energy sources, the rest being from traditional sources like fossil fuels, in which case an environmentally sensitive consumer may refrain from using energy, such as by turning off appliances that consume a large amount of energy. Conversely, the energy mix data <b>172</b> may show that a high percentage (e.g., 50%) of energy on the grid comes from renewable sources, in which case the consumer may conclude it is a good time to consume energy to meet &#x201c;green&#x201d; or environmental objectives. This data <b>172</b> may allow a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> to make a mix of energy production types visible in real-time to the end consumer <b>132</b>. A consumer <b>132</b> may see the mix of energy that is available to be consumed at any point in time and may adjust behavior accordingly, such as to shift usage from when fossil fuels are the primary production types to times when renewable sources are predominant.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0339">The data repository <b>102</b> may also connect to a supply-side portal <b>144</b>, payment processing engine <b>140</b>, gamification engine <b>130</b> and/or recommendation engine <b>136</b>, such that any of the foregoing can consume data stored in the repository <b>102</b> and any of them may feed data to the data repository <b>102</b>. The payment processing engine <b>140</b> may include processing of fees paid to energy merchants, such as utilities and other providers. Merchant fees <b>142</b> may be paid by credit card, debit card, wire transfer, PayPal, and other fee mechanisms. In embodiments, fees may account for or include payments via other forms of currency or value, such as points (such as obtained in games or contests managed by the gamification engine, loyalty points, or the like), distributed ledger-based currencies (e.g., Bitcoins, such as using the Blockchain system), and credits (e.g., renewable energy credits, carbon credits, pollution abatement credits, and other credits that may have identifiable monetary value and therefore may be exchanged or taken as or in lieu of merchant fees <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0340">The data repository <b>102</b> may also connect to a machine learning engine <b>104</b>, which may include a prediction engine and/or connect to one or more separate prediction engines <b>106</b>. The prediction engine <b>106</b> may use various data, such as current state and condition data from various systems connected to the platform <b>100</b> and historical data from various sources in the repository <b>102</b>, to make predictions of future states of various conditions of the marketplace served by the platform <b>100</b>, such as the likely mix of energy sources at a given time period (e.g., predicting availability of wind sources if weather data indicates a likelihood of steady wind conditions, predicting availability of solar sources if weather data indicates the likely presence of a high pressure system, and the like), the likely price (such as based on historical pricing factors, such as when demand is typically high and when supply might be constrained (such as based on unavailability of renewable sources like solar power at night), the likely demand, the likely supply and other factors. The prediction engine can feed predictions to the machine learning engine <b>104</b> (or may be incorporated in it), so that predictions can be used, along with other data, such as current state data, to undertake machine learning with respect to any of a wide range of capabilities of the platform <b>100</b>. For example, the machine learning engine <b>104</b> may be used to optimize recommendations made to consumers, to optimize the quality of predictions made by the prediction engine <b>106</b>, to optimize user interfaces or message that are intended to affect consumer behavior, to optimize gamification features (such as by adjusting rewards based on their effectiveness in inducing favorable behaviors), to optimize financial outcomes (such as pricing, profits, cost savings, or the like), and others. Each of these items can be optimized by feeding state data, historical data, and the like to the engine, along with a model, map, rule, policy, or other representation or control mechanism for the activity or capability that is to be improved by machine learning, and the machine learning system <b>104</b> may adjust parameters, permutations, or other characteristics of the representation, rule, or the like based on measures of success that may be selected or specified by users of the platform, such as whether a given set of parameters tends to produce desired outcomes, such as inducing desired consumer behaviors, causing reduction in energy consumption, causing improvements in the energy mix, or others.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0341">The data repository <b>102</b> may also connect to a pricing and billing engine <b>108</b>, which may be used to provide prices (optionally automated and optionally optimized by machine learning) and to automatically handle billing, including on a micro-period basis, such as billing based on the wholesale energy prices applicable to the energy sources that were used to produce power for the applicable portion of an energy grid that supplied a consumer over a short period of time, such as in 15 minute periods or less.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0342">The data repository <b>102</b> may also connect to a demand management engine <b>110</b>. To manage demand via the demand management engine <b>110</b>, a machine learning engine <b>104</b> may derive insights based on and related to various characteristics that may affect demand, such as time of day, season, geography, generator source distance to a consumer premises, gamification patterns, price patterns, production patterns, weather patterns, user behavioral information based on individual usage patterns and the like. These factors may allow identification of combinations of pricing, points, messages, and other factors that may affect demand.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0343">The data repository <b>102</b> may also connect to and provide data to or collect data from an energy usage calculator <b>112</b>. For example, the usage calculator <b>112</b> can calculate the energy mix associated with the energy consumed/purchased by the consumer, in order to provide overall usage and energy mix usage information for purposes of pricing, billing, prediction, award of points, tracking of credits, and other items handled by the platform <b>100</b> that are affected by the mix or overall usage of energy.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0344">In embodiments, the machine learning engine <b>104</b> may optimize gamification features of a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. Optimization of gamification features of a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may assist in producing desired modifications of the behaviors of consumers <b>132</b>, such as causing reduction in overall energy usage, reduction in the cost of energy usage to consumers (such as by time-shifting usage to lower-cost time periods), improvements in the mix of energy to include a greater fraction of renewable energy sources, cleaner sources, or the like, causing greater responsiveness of the consumers to information, and many other factors. This may include optimizing points, credits, rewards, financial incentives, prices, or the like that are awarded or provided in connection with consumer activities, by optimizing messages, interfaces, or presentations to consumers relating to features that compose a game or game-like process, and by optimizing rules and other parameters of a game or game-like feature. For example, a machine learning system may randomize reward patterns among various possible patterns to determine what pattern of awards has the greatest impact on a consumer <b>132</b> or collection of consumers.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0345">In embodiments, gamification may involve various forms of games, contests, and competitions. Competitions may be defined among customers that are represented by a meter (be that a residential meter, or larger meters for businesses), as well as between subsets of customers that share a meter. For instance, embodiments may include allowing members of one family (such as the kids in the family) to compete against each other by being able to track points, such as awarding points when a kid undertakes an action to react to a price signal, or the like. Through the user interface of the mobile application or a browser, the platform may engage with the individual players, who may become the beneficiaries of the points, which may encourage them to continue to use the platform, resulting in benefits for the whole family, including cost savings. In embodiments, the game may be designed to encourage specific behaviors, such as having players like kids do the work of turning devices in the home down or off at different times of the day, rather than installing electronic devices that achieve the same thing.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0346">In embodiments, a machine learning engine <b>104</b> may be used to optimize gamification features based on what UI features work best, for example by determining what messages, what arrangements of icons, what timing of messages, and/or what graphics work best and what amounts of points, rewards, credits, price reductions, or the like should be awarded to produce desired modifications of behaviors of consumers <b>132</b>. Feedback to optimize a machine learning engine <b>104</b> may be based on desired objectives, such as reducing overall energy usage, reducing the cost of energy, shifting the mix of energy production/consumption to a greener profile, reducing carbon footprint, or other metrics. It may be noted that greener energy is also typically less expensive, because green sources like wind and solar power have low marginal costs of production when environmental conditions allow them to produce power and because total supply is lower when these resources are available, among other reasons.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0347">A machine learning engine may include machine pattern recognition. Using a machine learning engine for pattern recognition may improve a prediction engine <b>106</b>, based on data collected in a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. In embodiments, machine learning may improve the prediction engine <b>106</b> based on pattern recognition, which may recognize patterns that reflect many factors. Factors may include real-time pricing data, historical energy usage data, day-ahead pricing data, patterns in user behavior and patterns in other relevant factors like weather, aging of utility infrastructure, changes in energy infrastructure and storage, and many others. Patterns in consumer <b>132</b> behavior may be analyzed with machine pattern recognition, such as patterns relating to responses to price changes, responses to gamification incentives, responses to messages, and the like. Relevant factors may include weather-based patterns, patterns in time-of-day or weekly consumption, seasonal patterns, and many others.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0348">In embodiments, various elements of the platform <b>100</b> may connect to and feed a notification engine <b>114</b> or take notifications from a notification engine <b>114</b>. These may include the energy usage calculator <b>112</b>, the pricing and billing engine <b>108</b>, and various elements by which one or more entities or constituencies may interface with the platform. For example, the notification engine <b>114</b> may provide or receive notifications via an application programming interface (API) <b>116</b>, a portal (such as a demand-side portal <b>134</b>), or by an interface to a consumer's mobile device.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0349">In embodiments, the pricing and billing engine <b>108</b> may include member-configured pricing alternatives. Member-configured pricing alternatives may provide various forms of pricing alternatives or packages that the users of the platform <b>100</b> (e.g., utilities and other merchants that supply energy) may wish to present to consumers <b>132</b>. Pricing alternatives may be based on any one or a combination of one or more of the wholesale cost of energy, a retail price that includes a markup, one or more ancillary services costs, day-ahead market prices, real-time market prices, utility costs, smart-meter interval data, member-specific pricing, adjustments based on various reports (e.g., costs reported by the ISO ERCOT), adjustments based on all utility costs, applicable taxes and credits, payment processing fees, location of production, cost of transmission and the like.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0350">In embodiments, real-time pricing and short time-interval (e.g., hourly and the like) pricing adjustment may present challenges associated with allocation of costs and charges that may be aggregated, may vary over different time frames (e.g., over many days, fixed time periods, several months and the like). In a consumer retail energy distribution network, some costs, such as independent service organization fees, regulatory fees, actual fees for estimated fees, and the like may be calculated and made available to an energy marketplace platform at times other than individual time intervals. Some fee information may be retroactive, such as when an estimated price is used for a specific time interval, operating day or the like and an actual price is provided after the time interval closes, such as in the case of an operating day interval the day after the operating day, although an actual price may not be available for several days or longer.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0351">Ensuring pricing integrity of the platform may require handling these time-varying charges with algorithms that account for time variance in some cost information. In embodiments, an initial estimated charge for a consumer for a time interval, such as an operating day and the like may be calculated based on initial estimated usage information provided from an energy utility or the like (e.g., a retail energy service provider) that may have direct access to the consumer's energy meter and based on initial real-time energy pricing information for the energy designated by the consumer for the billing time interval, plus an estimate of other costs, such as regulatory and the like. In embodiments, these other estimates may be based on historical data and the like. Real-time price estimates may be based on geographic or other sectioning of a retail energy distribution network, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;load zone.&#x201d; Real-time prices may be updated more frequently than a billing time interval. In an example, real-time prices may be updated every 15 minutes, whereas a billing time interval may be an operating day, such as a contiguous 24-hour period of consumption, and the like.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0352">In embodiments the initial estimated charge for a consumer for a billing time interval may be based on an estimate of usage received from an energy consumption measuring device or devices that measure energy consumption for some portion of the consumer's house hold and the like. Updates to the estimated consumption may be provided after the billing time interval from a utility or other source, such as the consumer's smart meter and the like. This updated information may replace or be used to adjust the initial estimated charge by recalculating consumption charges for the billing time interval. Other charges, such as ISO fees and the like may be provided as an aggregate for all consumers participating in the marketplace who receive energy service from the ISO. This fee may be spread over some portion of the consumers participating in the marketplace based, for example, on whether the consumer was participating in the marketplace for the billing interval to which the aggregated ISO fee applies. In an example, this fee, which is merely an example of other charges that may be retroactively provided to the platform, may be allocated across consumers of the marketplace based on consumption of energy during the billing time interval for which the fee applies.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0353">In embodiments, some fees and/or adjustment to fees may only be available well after a consumer has been billed for and paid for a billing time interval. In an example, a fee adjustment may be received for a billing time interval (such as a day or the like) several months after the close of the billing time interval. Such a fee adjustment may be designated for a billing time interval that included consumers of the marketplace who are no longer consumers of the marketplace (e.g., consumers may have closed their account because they have moved to a different address and the like). In these cases, the fee adjustment may be an aggregate fee adjustment that may preferably be applied to all consumers who were consumers participating in the marketplace during the billing time interval that the fee adjustment applies to. This aggregated fee adjustment is divided into equal amounts for all customers of the marketplace during the billing time interval to which the fee applies. Those consumers who remain consumers of the marketplace may be charged the equal amount and any remaining portion may be charged to an operator of the marketplace.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0354">In embodiments, reconciling of timing of charges on the account of the consumer may include different billing, invoices, true-ups, fees, and the like that may be accepted on different days but otherwise represent costs for the same operating day. By way of these examples, a customer's total costs for a single day may be made up of usage, price and true-up data that comes in anywhere from the day before to 180+ days after usage. The platform is able to manage these timing and reconciliation issues automatically. In many examples, the consumer for any operating day (OD) may be &#x201c;shadow-billed&#x201d; for the next day (<b>0</b>D+1) based on the initial estimated usage from the utility, initial real-time price data from the ISO, and other costs that may be estimated internally based on historical data. Over the next four days, those initial estimates may be finalized and the costs accrued on the OD may be revised. Over the next few months, the platform may receive from the utility or ISO true-up adjustments to usage, ancillary services costs, etc. that apply to the OD. It will be appreciated in light of the disclosure that these adjustments may be handled to keep data consistent across monthly billing statements and monthly/daily/hourly usage reports, while also allowing for adjustments that come to charges for customers after they are no longer consumers on the platform.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0355">In embodiments, the platform may receive initial and final usage data per meter/customer. The platform may also receive market price data for each 15-minute interval or the like by geographic &#x201c;load zone.&#x201d; In embodiments, the platform may receive a single line-item charge from the ISO for each OD, which may be aggregated across the entire customer pool (or certain portions thereof), for energy consumed. This single charge may be incorporated in what the platform is configured to calculate based on usage and interval wholesale prices or may be averaged and parsed across the existing pool of customers. In embodiments, a single line-item charge from the ISO for each OD may be received by the platform and aggregated across the entire current customer pool for each type of ancillary services charge. The platform may then allocate these charges across the customer pool on a pro-rata basis according to usage. All of the above charges may be received and calculated within 5 days of OD, and the platform may allocate them to the appropriate OD. In many examples, finalization of the charges may not occur until OD+5. By way of this example, a customer's previous month's charges may not be final until the 5th of the following month or the like. The platform may further receive true-ups, updates, further information, or the like to the prices, usages and ancillary services charges and may typically occur within 180 days of OD, but may occur even later than that. In many examples, when the platform receives charges that are a sufficient period after OD (i.e., a stale charge), the charges may be socialized across the pool of existing customers who were active customers on the OD no longer be current with the platform.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0356">In embodiments, the pricing and billing engine <b>108</b> may include a pay-as-you-go billing infrastructure and offer pay-as-you-go billing to consumers <b>132</b>. This may help eliminate or mitigate costs associated with billing and collections, which may help keep membership fees paid by consumers, low. Pay-as-you-go billing may optionally require consumers <b>132</b> to establish an account balance at the time the consumer signs-up to establish an account on a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. For example, a consumer may establish an account balance between $75-$500 when signing up to establish an account. This initial balance may be debited (e.g., daily or more frequently) based on the energy consumption of the consumer <b>132</b>. When the balance reaches a minimum amount, the account may be automatically recharged or may be recharged based on input or approval from a consumer <b>132</b>. The utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may allow the consumer <b>132</b> to see how much energy is being used and how much of the account balance is spent each day. The utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may also project when the next recharge to the account will occur.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0357">A utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> which offers pay-as-you-go billing may be of major assistance to consumers <b>132</b> with payment difficulties or in hardship cases. The assistance provided by such a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may also provide a benefit to regulators, who are typically responsible for consumers <b>132</b> that get into financial difficulty, while continuing to consume energy. Pay-as-you-go billing may match cost with the capacity of a consumer to pay. A primary benefit of matching energy cost with capacity to pay is that consumers <b>132</b> may have more control over their circumstances, which is consistent with large retailers' stated policy objective, although such retailers typically have difficulty actually correcting or addressing hardship cases. Consumers <b>132</b> in hardship may need to figure out how they can stay on track or get back on track with the ongoing cost of energy supply. In the event a consumer <b>132</b> cannot recharge an account balance, an energy retailer operating a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> (much faster than an energy retailer not operating a utility marketplace), may become aware of a potential for payment difficulties and may be on notice that the consumer <b>132</b> may find the need for hardship help. This means an energy retailer operating a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may offer a hardship policy and consequential plan that shows flexibility to assist a consumer <b>132</b> in bringing cost and the consumer's capacity to pay in line as fast as possible.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0358">An additional benefit of a pay-as-you-go policy is to avoid a debt building up without stakeholders, including the consumer <b>132</b>, being aware of the scale of that debt. Post-pay retailers have to wait (e.g., up to 75 days) before they know if a consumer <b>132</b> is in difficulty, by which time further debt has accumulated by virtue of another substantial period of supply and consumption. It may be much easier to manage consumers <b>132</b> out of hardship or payment difficulties if there is no pre-existing debt, and it may be much more preferable for consumers to avoid large debt entirely, rather than finding out about the debt when it is too late to control it.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0359">The policy of an energy retailer operating a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may be far more proactive than an energy retailer not operating a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. For example, an energy retailer operating a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may offer to consumers <b>132</b> whose balance gets to $10 or less, to apply for a hardship plan. A hardship plan may show flexibility in recharge amounts so that the recharge amount may be reduced to $5, for example, or some other level agreed to with the consumer <b>132</b>, from the current level. Showing flexibility with repayment is in essence shortening the collection cycle. If a consumer goes onto a hardship plan, after contacting the energy retailer operating a utility marketplace and being offered the plan, this plan may then be monitored, with the primary objective of avoiding a debt for which the consumer <b>132</b> would need to garnish future income to pay off. An energy retailer operating a utility marketplace may also encourage consumers <b>132</b> to come off of the hardship plan by increasing the consumer <b>132</b> account back to the pre-agreed levels.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0360">In embodiments, the demand management engine <b>110</b> may connect to various mechanisms for communicating with the platform, such as the notification engine <b>114</b>, one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) <b>116</b> and the demand-side portal <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0361">In embodiments, the demand management engine <b>110</b> may provide automated, for example machine-based, management of demand for the utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>, including managing real-time prices presented to consumers <b>132</b>, managing access to the platform by providers and suppliers (including managing costs and rules of participation), managing gamification features, and managing other features that may affect demand for energy.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">In embodiments, the notification engine <b>114</b> may also connect to one or more APIs <b>116</b> and a demand-side portal <b>134</b>. The APIs <b>116</b> may include a supplier API <b>118</b> and a consumer API <b>120</b>. A supplier API <b>118</b> may also connect to one or more systems or interfaces of supplier entities that connect with the platform <b>100</b>, such as transmission utilities <b>178</b>, generation utilities <b>180</b> and the like, which may interact (e.g., machine-to-machine) directly or programmatically via the API <b>118</b> or may interface with a supply-side portal <b>144</b> or other interface that includes components for human or human-aided interaction.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0363">In embodiments electricity supply to retail customers, while provided over a fixed distribution grid, can be arranged to be provided through one of a plurality of retail electricity suppliers, such as retail suppliers who are authorized to do so through a regulatory body and the like. A retail electricity supplier facilitates logical access to energy provided over the grid (e.g., such as by arranging an agreement with energy providers to receive payment for the energy that a retail consumer consumes. An energy marketplace may be operated by a platform that performs a range of functions as described herein. In embodiments, integrating an energy marketplace with one or more retail energy suppliers may facilitate access by consumers to the benefits and features of the marketplace within today's current energy supply processes. A single marketplace may serve a plurality of consumers who contract with various retail electricity suppliers. A marketplace may be integrated into a retail electricity supplier. Alternatively, a single marketplace may be integrated into a plurality of electricity suppliers. Integration may enable retail consumers of the retail electricity supplier access to the features and benefits of the marketplace and/or the marketplace platform as described herein. An integrated marketplace platform may be privately branded so that the retail energy supplier appears to be the marketplace. In embodiments, an authorized supplier of energy such as a regulated retailer can integrate a portion or all of the platform. In embodiments, the platform may be configured as a real-time marketplace platform within the supply of electricity by an authorized retail electricity supplier. It will be appreciated that most electricity supply chains require retail electricity supply to be made available to retail customers only by way of retailers authorized to do so by an electricity regulator.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0364">In embodiments, a consumer API may connect to and support interactions with a mobile app <b>122</b>, such as for enabling the mobile app to be supplied with current data, such as to support activities of consumers <b>132</b> in the mobile app on the consumer's <b>132</b> mobile device. The mobile app <b>122</b> may include or reference a consumer profile <b>124</b> that may be used to configure elements of the mobile app, such as based on stated consumer preferences, demographics, geographic information, or other factors. The mobile app <b>122</b> may include gamification features, such as rendered in a gamification user interface (UI) <b>126</b> by which the consumer may engage in games, contests, or game-like interactions that make the platform <b>100</b> highly engaging and that influence consumer behavior with respect to energy consumption. This may include games that induce various kinds of behavior, such as time-shifting use of energy-demanding appliances, turning down heating and cooling, turning off lights, and the like. Games may encourage competition between customers with different meters (including in categories, such as by region, by type of customer (retail versus business), and the like, as well as between customers with the same meter (such as among members of the family). The gamification interface <b>126</b> may present a point system <b>128</b>, a contest system <b>130</b> or the like, such as by expressing rules or guidelines for participating in game or contest. The mobile app <b>122</b> may run on iOS devices, Android devices or devices adapted for other mobile device operating systems.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0365">In embodiments, a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may manage a point system <b>128</b>. The point system <b>128</b> may encourage favorable energy consumption behavior by consumers <b>132</b>. A point system may award different types of points. Different types of points may include a sign-on bonus, energy points, carbon points, gold hour points, and the like, each determined by a calculation that may factor in energy usage, the mix of sources, pricing, and other factors. With respect to a sign-on bonus, every consumer <b>132</b> connected to the utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may receive a number of points (e.g., 1,000 points) upon sign-up to the utility marketplace. With respect to energy points, consumers <b>132</b> may receive energy points for responding to price signals and shifting their usage from high-price hours to low-price hours. Each day, their hourly usage profile (as a percentage of their total daily usage) may be compared to that of the overall market. A consumer may receive energy points when hourly usage is higher than the overall market in low-price hours and lower than the overall market in high-price hours (i.e., reacting to Green Hours or Brown Hours). With respect to carbon points, consumers <b>132</b> may receive carbon points for responding to emissions signals and by shifting their usage from high-emission hours to low-emission hours (i.e., again reacting to Green Hours and Brown Hours). Each day, their period (e.g., hourly) usage profile (such as a percentage of their total daily usage) may be compared to that of the overall market. A consumer <b>132</b> may receive carbon points when hourly usage is higher than the overall market in low-emission hours and lower than the overall market in high-emission hours. For the purposes of this calculation, emission levels may be based upon the percentage of total system load being served by wind generation, as published by the ISO. A gold hour may be a demand response program that rewards consumers <b>132</b> for curtailing usage during specific hours of high system demand. This may be administered through a third party contracted to a provider of a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. Consumers <b>132</b> may be alerted to an upcoming gold hour and, if they participate by reducing usage during that hour, may earn substantially larger rewards on top of any energy points and carbon points earned. A utility marketplace platform <b>100</b> may perform points calculations.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">In embodiments, the platform can deliver value to customers by helping control demand (as customers armed with price signal knowledge can do), including the ability to undertake arbitrage between day-ahead prices and real-time prices, which, as noted above, can be handled by the platform. In embodiments, the platform may include a feature (such as embedded within a demand response feature of the mobile application or other interface) providing the ability for customers to set the price for energy that will be consumed the next day by electing the next day's price on the day-ahead market. If, when the next day comes, the real-time price is lower, the consumer may choose to elect to reduce demand, buy back that amount of consumption at the real-time price, and capture the price difference.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">Points calculations may take many forms, including the following.

As previously described, a consumer <b>132</b> may be required to establish an account balance upon establishing an account on a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. The consumer account may be recharged when the balance becomes reduced below a specified threshold. This pay-as-you-go billing structure may reduce total potential exposure (TPE) of an ISO. TPE is calculated by adding the unsecured credit limit of a consumer to the financial security of a consumer. An operator of a utility marketplace may only be subjected to total potential exposure any (TPEA) <b>910</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. TPEA <b>910</b> may be based on the settlement impact from various market activities. Various market activities may be trades <b>1002</b>, day-ahead market (DAM) <b>1004</b>, real-time pricing changes <b>1006</b> and congestion revenue rights (CRR) <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0390">In embodiments, other activities outside of a utility marketplace may be optimized based on information from the marketplace platform <b>100</b>. This may include optimizing rooftop solar generation usage based on real-time retail energy market information. Because solar output may be favorable in the platform, it may make sense for consumers to optimize usage of rooftop solar generation at the home (or other local production capabilities, such as small-scale wind, geo-thermal and hydro-power), where consumption is behind the meter, rather than exporting energy to the grid, depending on price signals and current/projected usage. For example, the platform <b>100</b> might signal to a consumer to either consume its own energy, store it, or provide it to the grid, based on pricing conditions and other factors known in the platform <b>100</b>. In embodiments, this may include optimizing across multiple local solar generators to get the best cost for the participating members. This in effect can be an optimized, virtual grid, which may comprise an element of a larger set of sources of supply that are understood by the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0391">In embodiments, the platform <b>100</b> may include extensions to further help consumers reduce or optimize energy consumption. For example, given that a price signal is handled in the platform <b>100</b>, an extension of the platform <b>100</b> may provide control of devices <b>198</b> in a user's home remotely to react to price signals. This may occur in the mobile application <b>122</b> by a device control interface <b>190</b> or automatically under control of the platform <b>100</b>, including through one or more device APIs <b>192</b>, which may include APIs provided by one or more device manufacturers or installers <b>196</b> for control of devices). An example of a device that may benefit from control of usage timing is an electric vehicle, which if used frequently can double or treble the electricity usage of an average household, depending on when it is used. In embodiments, a household may be armed with a battery (e.g., a Tesla Powerwall&#x2122; battery), in which case electricity use control can be important, including cases where the user has its own energy generation (e.g., solar) and other cases where storage may be useful. Such embodiments can extend to include other high energy consuming devices in the home, such as the water heater, A/C systems, heating systems, dishwasher, dryer, and washing machine, among others.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0392">In embodiments, the savings enabled by the platform may be sufficiently great to allow coverage of the capital cost of providing a battery, an electric vehicle, or the like. In embodiments, the platform <b>100</b> may be extended to provide control over such systems, which may be provided to members (or financed by financiers or manufacturers), such as under a fixed fee structure, or the like. In embodiments, financiers/manufacturers <b>196</b> may bid (such as through a bidding system <b>194</b> of the platform) to supply such items to members, who can choose to select them. Thus, the platform <b>100</b> may include a market pricing algorithm and matching system to match equipment suppliers with users, then manage individual energy use throughout the life of that product. As such, the platform <b>100</b> may extend to form an energy and transport supply platform <b>100</b>, without requiring the operator to own a power station or electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0393">In embodiments, a smart home system, such as a system that enables interaction among and control of home systems, such as energy-related systems (e.g., heating, air conditioning, ventilation, sunlight control, and the like) may interface with an energy marketplace platform to enable automated demand management of energy provided over a consumer energy distribution network, such as an electricity grid. Energy providers, may send production source information, such as the types of raw energy being used or predicted to be used to provide energy over the energy distribution network, to the platform. This information may be used by the platform to coordinate with smart home systems and the like to automatically adjust energy demand. By signaling to a home control system when energy costs are low/high or when distributed energy from raw renewable energy is or is predicted to be available, a home system may adjust demand of energy consuming systems in or associated with the home. In an example of automated demand management, energy from wind may be estimated to be available at a future time, thereby offering the option of reducing consumption of energy from other/non-renewable sources. This future availability of wind-based energy may be signaled to the platform that may coordinate with a home system to adjust operation of energy consuming devices, such as heating and cooling systems and the like to best use the renewable energy. IN another example, during a summer cooling season, a forecast of sunlight may also signal available solar-based energy being available over the distribution network. This combination of availability of energy and sunlight may be coordinated with a home control system to close automated window covers (e.g., skylight shades and the like) during the intense sunlight while adjusting the timing and/or operation of the home's air conditioning system to leverage the renewable energy.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0394">In embodiments, a smart home system may further coordinate with the platform for optimizing a benefit to the home owner of returning energy generated by an energy production system under the homeowner's control (e.g., solar panels and the like) to the energy grid (e.g., electricity generated by solar panels, stored electricity, and the like). Energy costs, and therefore reimbursement from an energy company for providing energy to the grid by a homeowner may be affected by demand, typically being higher when demand is higher. Therefore, by providing demand-related signals from the platform, such as based on demand information captured by the platform from participants in the platform and the like, a smart home system may control timing of producing, storing, and returning energy to the grid. In an example, returning energy to the grid when energy costs (e.g., driven by demand) are high may provide a greater financial benefit to the homeowner than returning energy to the rid when energy costs are low.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0395">Users of the platform may include customers with their own power generating capacity, such as from rooftop or other solar energy systems, as well as other systems such as small-scale wind power, hydropower, or geothermal power. References to solar power generation should be understood to encompass these other types of renewable energy generation, except where context indicates otherwise. Armed with price signals, customers with power generating capacity can manage usage in response. For example, if real-time prices are high, customers may reduce usage and increase electricity exports. Also, if the customer participates in the day ahead market (committing to provide energy the next day when tomorrow's prices are high), the customer has the option to, when the hour approaches and real-time prices are lower, consume energy in a normal way, buy back the generation sold the day before in the day-ahead market, and capture the benefit. The rooftop solar installation market has become highly competitive, essentially comprising a commodity (like many sources of electricity supply). In embodiments, solar installation and ongoing optimization may be undertaken using the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0396">Installers/financiers <b>196</b> may bid to supply/manage installations to consumers <b>132</b>, and the operator of the platform <b>100</b> may optimize with price signals the best economic outcome, taking into account grid prices versus battery storage capacity versus electric vehicle charging needs, household consumption needs, and the need to export to the grid, as the case may be.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0397">Thus, the platform may factor in, and optimize, various forms of generation, in particular rooftop solar but also including technologies such as nano-paints, solar windows etc., as well as small scale wind energy, bio-energy, hydropower, thermal energy, and the like.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0398">The platform <b>100</b> may also factor in the presence and availability of various storage technologies, such as batteries, phase change materials, and building materials, so that the system becomes a total energy management platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0399"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a price comparison and reference screen <b>1010</b> for a mobile app <b>122</b> for a utility marketplace platform <b>100</b>. A comparison may be made between a current price of energy and one or more reference prices. For example, a screen may show comparison of current cost to a wholesale reference price <b>1012</b>, such as established by the average price by volume of the top five energy wholesale providers in that specific geographical area, or the like. Similarly, the reference price may be a user reference price <b>1014</b>, such as showing the average price the user has paid for energy when using the platform. Various reference prices can thus allow a user to determine whether the current price being paid is relatively high or low, as compared to the general energy market price and/or the user's own experience. The comparison information can include additional information, such as the consumer's savings <b>1018</b> (e.g., by day, by month and by year), such as measured against the reference price. Reference prices may take various forms, such as including rolling averages, such as an average price paid by the consumer over a defined period (e.g., three months), a rolling average wholesale energy price over a defined period, and the like. Reference prices may be aggregated across providers or shown separately for each provider. Comparison may also be by device, such as showing the cost of energy used by a given appliance, vehicle, or the like, compared to others and compared to reference prices.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0400">In embodiments, a savings calculator may combine various cost metrics to produce a savings estimate based on actual charges for energy consumes in real-time. A savings may be calculated for each time interval for which the various cost metrics are available and may be accumulated over time to generate a running savings calculation for a consumer of energy over a retail energy distribution network or grid. In an example, real-time whole rates for energy may be compared to a benchmark rate, such as fixed average rates for each time interval. A savings calculation may be a result of referencing these rates and the actual rates experienced. A savings for each time interval may be calculated and displayed in a user interface. A running savings total over time may also be calculated and displayed. In embodiments, such a savings calculation may indicate a potential savings available to the consumer based on actions taken by the consumer, such as by the user selecting one or more sources of raw energy and the like.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0401">The various embodiments disclosed herein produce data that can be mined for a myriad of value-producing purposes, including device design by manufacturers, device selection and replacement at the consumer's home, grid management by the ISOs, and power station optimization. Home automation of energy use can be effected through increased control (such as enabled by the IoT), using information from the platform. Also, investment in grid infrastructure (such as new peak load investment as infrastructure needs replacement and new infrastructure projects reflect changes in population densities and usage habits) can use information from the platform <b>100</b>, such as to predict changes in peak demand that may result from aggregate changes in user behavior. In embodiments, real time data mining may be used to better match generation operation with load demand, sidestepping or complementing the conventional ISO function of using marginal cost to balance the grid. Also, as rooftop solar becomes a bigger part of the energy mix in high solar markets, data collection on the generation side at the home can be collected, aggregated and fed into the real-time generation/load balancing process.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0402">In markets where deregulation has not as yet taken hold (such as California and many other US states), utilities supply power on a regulated basis, meaning the price is set and approved by the regulator from as short as monthly to as long as once per year. Utilities often have some recognition of the need for time of day-based pricing blocks, but these blocks typically lack immediate reference to real-time market prices; instead, they rely on a backward looking formula to approximate when load is likely to exceed conventionally priced generation. However, these blocks often lag real changes in generation and load profiles, sometimes by years. This has been true, for example, in California, where there are many cases of actual negative wholesale prices (such as during good solar generation times of the day), but the utilities still have peak load pricing at those time.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0403">Also, the utilities often use multiple tariff structures (e.g., a utility may offer as many as 1,000 or more different residential plans across its territory, including multiple plans for residential customers, which in turn are different if the customer has solar on the roof, which in turn are different depending which district the customer lives in). There is typically no automatic process to put the customer on the best tariff, leaving the customer to choose a plan that may or may not be the best fit for the consumer. In embodiments, the platform <b>100</b> may help facilitate the billing process for a consumer, including putting the consumer on the plan that comes closest to approximating a more frequent (e.g., hourly) price signal.

Such a network may be used to model or exhibit dynamic temporal behavior, such as involved in dynamic systems, such as a wide variety of the conditions, states, and systems described throughout this disclosure, such as involving behavior of a consumer <b>132</b> in response to dynamic conditions, such as the shift of energy mix, energy pricing, situations in a game, weather, or the like.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0413">Combinations among any of the pairs, triplets, or larger combinations, of the various neural network types described herein, are encompassed by the present disclosure. This may include combinations where an expert system uses one neural network for recognizing a pattern (e.g., a pattern in weather, a pattern in consumer behavior, a pattern in pricing for energy, a pattern in the mix of sources of energy available, a pattern within a game managed by the gamification engine <b>138</b>, or the like) and a different neural network for self-organizing an activity or work flow based on the recognized pattern (such as providing an output governing autonomous control of one or more of the systems, workflows, or other components of the platform <b>100</b> in response to the recognized condition or pattern).

For example, the leaderboard <b>1802</b> might show standings or final results for a gaming involving energy consumption. In embodiments, a game may involve overall consumption of energy, so that the consumer <b>132</b> with the lowest consumption wins. For such a game, the gamification engine <b>138</b> may provide rewards to the top player, to a top set of players, or the like. As the goal of such a game may be to help consumers generally reduce energy consumption, the platform <b>100</b> may experiment with different reward systems, such as varying total rewards, the pattern of allocation of rewards, and the like, to determine which reward patterns induce the desired outcome. This may include varying reward patterns using AB testing, genetic programming, or similar techniques, where results from a set of trial games are returned to a system to select favorable approaches and de-select unfavorable approaches, so that favorable approaches emerge over time. In embodiments the variation and selection may be managed by the machine learning system <b>104</b>. In embodiments, a game may be optimized by managing the gamification engine <b>138</b> under the control of or with input from the machine learning system <b>104</b>, such as by having the machine learning system <b>104</b> learn to vary game parameters, such as user interface elements, reward allocations, timing of games, duration of games, and other elements.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0416">In embodiments, the gamification engine <b>138</b> may enable a challenge-based game, where a consumer <b>132</b> or group of consumers <b>132</b> is challenged to achieve an objective, such as achieving a threshold level of energy consumption for a given time interval, achieving a given level of production of energy consumption for a given time interval, achieving a target fraction of utilization of renewable energy with in the mix of energy consumed by the consumer <b>132</b>, achieving a reduction in the fraction of energy consumed from fossil fuels by the consumer <b>132</b>, and the like. Challenges may include ones similar to &#x201c;hyper-miling,&#x201d; where vehicle drivers attempt to achieve maximum levels of gas mileage by virtue of favorable driving patterns. This may include, for example, operating a household of a certain type with a minimal amount of overall energy consumption, operating a household with a minimal amount of fossil fuel energy consumption, achieving a set of regular tasks with the lowest amount of energy consumption for the most favorable fraction of renewable energy consumption, and the like.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0417">In embodiments, the gamification engine <b>138</b> may enable content production challenges, such as contests in which consumers <b>132</b> are prompted to produce content that may be helpful in achieving one or more overall goals of the platform, such as reduction of overall consumption of energy or improvement in the mix of energy consumed by a group of consumers.

Such contests may also tend to improve the behavior of the participating consumers <b>132</b>, as psychological research suggests that individuals tend to act in ways that confirm their prior statements in response to surveys. As with other games, variation of the parameters of a content production challenge (such as type and allocation of rewards, type of content produced, timing of the game, and the like) may be managed using machine learning <b>104</b> including based on feedback, such as based on the effect of content produced on behavior, the effect of running the contest on behavior, the effect of rewards on behavior, or the like.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0418">In embodiments, the gamification engine <b>138</b> may enable question-based games (including surveys, quizzes, trivia contests, multiple choice questions, and others), such as contests in which consumers <b>132</b> are prompted to answer questions relevant to topics that may be relevant to one or more overall goals of the platform, such as reduction of overall consumption of energy, increasing production of renewable energy by consumers, improvement in the mix of energy consumed by a group of consumers, or the like. This may include questions on facts about energy consumption (such as relating to consumption by using particular devices or appliances, the effects of weather on energy consumption, and the like), energy conservation (such as relating to home insulation practices), energy production (such as relating to the mix of energy sources, the effects of weather on production and the like), impacts of energy usage (such as effects of burning fossil fuels, benefits of saving energy), the energy grid (such as helping understand impacts of reaching peak capacity, causes of blackouts and brownouts, and the like) and others. Such games may tend to improve the behavior of the participating consumers <b>132</b>, as individuals acquire knowledge that may cause them to shift behavior (such as to an energy mix that is better for the environment, or to a consumption pattern that saves the consumer money spent on energy, in turn reducing peak demand for energy that may allow infrastructure savings for grid providers.

For example, an individual consumer <b>132</b> might be challenged to increase energy provided to the grid by 20% over the course of a month and might be rewarded by a benefit within the platform (such as a credit for purchase of energy, or the like). In another example, a group of consumers <b>132</b> might be challenged to determine which consumer can achieve the greatest amount of energy production by solar power for the grid over the period of a week.

This may include games involving overall energy production and games involving specific types of consumption and/or production. For example, an individual consumer <b>132</b> may be challenged to increase energy provided to the grid by 20% over the course of a month and reduce energy consumed from the grid by 20% during the month, and the consumer <b>132</b> may be rewarded by a benefit within the platform (such as a credit for purchase of energy, or the like, including any of the reward types or allocations described throughout this disclosure). In another example, a group of consumers <b>132</b> might be challenged to determine which consumer can achieve the greatest amount of energy production by solar power for the grid over the period of a week while not increasing consumption of power from the grid during the week.

Such location-based games may involve tracking specific consumption activities (such as described in connection with the description of consumption-based games above or other consumption activities and behaviors mentioned throughout this disclosure) and specific production activities (such as challenging users to achieve a target level of energy production from available energy sources under control of the consumer <b>132</b>, such as renewable energy sources like rooftop solar installations, wind power installations, hydropower installations, and the like), as well as net energy activities involving calculations involving consumption and production. Location-based games may account for geographic locations of consumers, such as involving homes within a location. Location-based games may account for geographic locations users of the mobile application described herein, such as involving consumers who are using devices located within a geo-fence, are within range of a known location such as based on location of a cellular infrastructure element, an access point, a beacon, or the like. A wide variety of location technologies known to those of skill in the art may be used to determine the location of a consumer, such as GPS tracking, cellular triangulation, beacons, access points, lighting systems with proximity detection, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and others. Location-based games may account for grid location, such as involving consumers <b>132</b> who receive energy from the same grid, or consumers <b>132</b> who receive energy that is provided from the same raw energy sources. For example, consumers <b>132</b> in a region served by the same grid with the same raw energy sources may be assigned to a game (of any of the types described throughout this disclosure) with other such consumers <b>132</b>, so that competition in a game is against similarly situated players. This may be of particular value for leaderboard games involving the mix of energy, where consumers may time their consumption to improve their energy mix, but do not benefit relative to other players just because the energy mix on an applicable grid is favorable overall. Location-based games can also factor in weather, such as assigning players to a game based on the players being located in locations that are currently experiencing similar weather, such as heat, humidity, temperature, wind (such as influencing heating consumption as affected by wind chill and influencing wind energy production for production or net energy games), sunlight (such as influencing the ability to produce solar energy in production or net energy games), rainfall (such as influencing the ability to produce hydropower or solar energy), and the like. Location-based games may include combinations of the above, such as involving players from different locations that have similar current grid conditions (e.g., involving similar energy mix, energy prices, and the like, as well as combinations thereof), that have similar weather, and the like. As with other games, variation of the parameters of a location-based game (such as the locations involved, the size of locations involved (including geographic locations, geo-fence locations, grid locations, weather regions, and the like), the number of consumers, the type and allocation of rewards, type of challenge conducted, timing of the game, duration of time intervals involved in a game and the like) may be managed using machine learning <b>104</b>, including based on feedback, such as based on the effect of the game on behavior, the effect of different rewards on behavior, the effect of a game for consumers in a given location (such as contrasting with playing the same game in another location) and the like.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0423">In embodiments, the gamification engine <b>138</b> may enable timing-based games (including challenges, question-based games, location-based games, and others, optionally with leaderboard or similar features), where the game is configured to induce changes in the timing of energy consumption and/or energy production patterns of consumers <b>132</b>. Timing may be relevant to overall goals of the platform <b>100</b>, such as shifting consumption away from times of peak demand (to reduce the incidence of blackouts, brownouts and the like), shifting production of energy delivered to the grid to such times or peak demand (also to reduce incidence of blackouts, brownouts or the like), shifting consumption to times where the mix of energy sources used to power the grid s move favorable for environmental reasons (such as times where the fraction of renewable sources is higher relative to fossil fuel sources), shifting consumption to times where energy prices are more favorable, and the like. Timing-based games may include games that reward activities that indicate time-shifting, such as running appliances during late night hours during periods of hot weather or during daytime hours during very cold weather. This may include rewarding or favoring shifts in consumer behavior relative to historical patterns, relative to patterns for similar consumers, or the like. Such games may tend to improve the behavior of the participating consumers <b>132</b>, as individuals acquire habits that may cause them to shift behavior (such as to an energy mix that is better for the environment, or to a consumption pattern that saves the consumer money spent on energy, in turn reducing peak demand for energy that may allow infrastructure savings for grid providers). As with other games, variation of the parameters of a timing-based game (such as type and allocation of rewards, type of questions asked or challenges presented, timing of the game, and the like) may be managed using machine learning <b>104</b> including based on feedback, such as based on the effect of such games on behavior, the effect of particular timing rewards on behavior, the effect of allocation of rewards on behavior, or the like.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0424">In any of the embodiments described herein, a game (including question-based games, location-based games, timing-based games, consumption-related games, production-related games, net energy games, and others) may be configured with one or more weights, such as applying to one or more of the factors by which a user may gain points or otherwise improve performance. The weights may be applied, for example, to particular questions, to consumption behaviors, to production behaviors, or the like. For example, among a wide range of possible weights, a net energy game may weight each kilowatt of consumption with a coefficient of one and each kilowatt of energy produced by a consumer <b>132</b> for return to the grid with a weight of one-half. In all such embodiments, such weights may optionally be managed using machine learning <b>104</b> including based on feedback, such as based on the effect of such weights on overall outcomes, on behavior of various types, or the like. In embodiments, weights may be adjusted by random variation and testing, such that weights used in games with favorable outcomes are promoted and others are de-selected, resulting on continuous improvement of the weighting of game elements to achieve an outcome.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0425">As noted with respect to location-based games, various types of games described herein (including question-based games, location-based games, timing-based games, consumption-related games, production-related games, net energy games, and others) may be filtered to involve contests or challenges among groups of similar users, such as based on various factors, which may include age, gender, location (geographic, geo-fence, or grid-based), weather, type of home, size of home, price of home, demographic category, occupation category, and others. For example, a game may be configured such that a leaderboard is presented that presents a user against all users, or against a cohort of similar users that is configured by applying one or more filters. In one such illustrative example, a user may be challenged to achieve the lowest possible net energy score (subtracting production from consumption) and may filter the leaderboard to see how the user compares to other users on the same grid who have similar production capabilities (e.g., solar panels rated within a range of kilowatt capacity). In embodiments, an operator of the platform <b>100</b>, a sponsor, or the like may configure a game that offers rewards that are based on a game that is targeted to a filtered set of users, such as users in large homes in a geographic area. As with other elements, application and selection of filters, and combinations thereof, may be managed and improved by the machine learning system <b>104</b>, such as by varying filters over a number of trials and selecting filters that tend to promote overall outcomes, such that favorable combinations of filters are selected/advanced and other combinations are demoted/de-selected.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0426">Various aspects of the platform <b>100</b> may use an understanding of the similarity of a consumer <b>132</b> to other consumers <b>132</b>, such as selection of filters to establish a group for game, allocation of rewards to the highest performing consumers among similar consumers within a game, presentation of similar users on a leaderboard, and the like. Similarity may be based on various factors described in connection with filters above, such as age, gender, location (geographic, geo-fence, or grid-based), weather, type of home, size of home, price of home, demographic category, occupation category, behaviors (such as indicating price sensitivity, concern for particular environmental topics) and others. This may include various clustering techniques by which each consumer <b>132</b> is represented as an object having a set of attributes, and within a cluster the position of a node representing a consumer <b>132</b> is determined by calculating a distance from another user by applying weights to each of the attributes, such that similar consumers are found near each other within a cluster and different consumers are farther apart in the cluster. Similarity may be determined by a similarity model, such as one involving a calculation of similarity that applies weights to various attributes. Similarity may be determined by collaborative filtering, such as by having consumers <b>132</b> answer questions about various topics and grouping consumers <b>132</b> who have similar responses.

Notifications may facilitate taking action by the recipient to achieve an energy objective, such as reducing energy consumption, energy cost savings, improving the environment, producing energy, and the like. Notifications may be based on a range of energy-related aspects including, without limitation energy pricing (e.g., real-time, estimated, forecast, predicted, and the like), energy availability (e.g., from various sources, such as renewable and non-renewable sources), energy demand (e.g., current, estimated, forecast, and the like), energy-impacting events, and the like. Notifications may be based on changes in energy-related aspects, such as a change in a price for energy, a change in mix of energy sourcing, a change in demand for energy and the like.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0491">In embodiments, notifications may be made to consumers of energy provided over a consumer energy distribution network via computing devices that the user commonly uses, such as a personal mobile device (e.g., a smart phone) and the like. Notifications may be presented to a consumer in a user interface that may include one or more selectable display elements to collect a response from the consumer to the notification. In addition to the selectable display elements facilitating collection of consumer response to a notification, consumer selection of a display element may cause one or more actions related to at least one of consumption and production of energy by the consumer to be performed by the platform, optionally in cooperation with energy consuming and/or energy producing devices under control of the consumer, such as behind-the-meter smart home devices, energy measurement and/or control devices, household and appliances, energy producing devices such as solar panels that the consumer owns and/or operates, electric and/or hybrid electric vehicles and charging stations, and the like.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0492">In embodiments, notifications may be made directly to automated energy control devices, such as energy production systems, energy consumption devices, energy regulating systems and the like. In an example, notification of a decrease in demand for fossil fuel-based energy may be sent to an energy production system that uses fossil fuel to produce the energy. The fossil fuel-based production system may take an action, such as reducing production output, diverting production output to storage or to a portion of the grid that is not experiencing a reduction in demand, and the like. Similarly, a reduction in demand for fossil fuel may trigger an automatic action, such as notification to the platform, service organizations, and the like of a reduction in the price of such fuel charged by the production facility, such as to attempt to mitigate or reverse the reduction in demand.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0493">In embodiments, notification to behind-the-meter devices may include notification to a renewable energy production system under the control of a consumer, such as a solar energy production system to increase production of electricity even though demand for electricity behind-the-meter is being met and to return excess produced electricity to the grid.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0494">In embodiments, methods and systems of energy-related notification may include gathering pricing information, raw energy source information, consumer utilization thereof for calculation of projected costs of energy from different raw energy sources and automatically notifying select consumers. In an example of such energy-related notification, a method may include gathering prices for energy provided over a consumer energy distribution network from providers who use different sources of raw energy to produce the energy provided over the consumer energy distribution network. The prices may cover a plurality of future time intervals for which the providers indicate providing energy over the consumer energy distribution network. Projected costs for the energy may be calculated based one or more of the gathered prices for each of a plurality of consumers consuming energy over the consumer energy distribution network, such as consumers in a geographic region who consume electricity over an energy distribution network that serves the region. Projected costs may be calculated for a plurality of the future time intervals and may include energy and transmission related costs for each of a plurality of raw energy sources. Cost savings automatic notification may be made, such as by a transmission of a signal to a mobile device of each of the consumers who have requested notification when the calculation of projected costs results in a cost savings opportunity. Notification may be directed to select consumers who receive energy derived from a raw energy source that is impacting the cost savings. The notification may include a means by which the consumer can select a different raw energy source and/or a mix of raw energy sources for one or more of the future time intervals.</p><p id="p-0502" num="0495">In embodiments, providers of the energy may indicate providing energy over the consumer energy distribution network based on an estimate of demand for energy sourced from the type of raw energy source used by the providers, such as from renewable energy sources. The estimate of demand may be calculated based on an indication of consumer demand resulting from consumers in the consumer energy marketplace selecting a raw energy source for their energy consumption needs. The consumer selection may be for one or more future discrete time intervals. Raw energy sources available for selection by a consumer in the energy marketplace may include a fossil fuel source, a coal source, an oil source, a natural gas source, a nuclear source, a renewable source, a wind source, a solar source, a hydropower source, a stored energy source, a battery source, and a gravity power source.</p><p id="p-0503" num="0496">In embodiments notification in a consumer retain energy marketplace may include giving consumers an opportunity to adjust a selection of energy sources in response to the notification. Allocation of energy demand from these consumers may be impacted based on the consumer responses. In an example, prices of a consumer accessible energy-type produced by different energy producers may be tracked by accessing real-time energy pricing information for each of the different energy producers. The price information may be accessed through an energy supply information interface of a retail consumer energy marketplace platform. In the example, price notification thresholds for consumer notification may be set for a plurality of raw energy sources. Different energy producers may be associated with at least one raw energy source. The platform may track prices from the energy produces for one or more raw energy sources and, in response to a tracked price crossing the price notification threshold, the platform may send a price alert communication signal to a consumer. The signal may be sent to a consumer personal device, such as a mobile phone through which the consumer accesses the marketplace. The signal may activate a user interface function of the consumer device through which the consumer is enabled to select one of a plurality of raw energy sources. Selecting may result in increasing and/or decreasing an allocation of demand for the energy-type selected to be provided by an energy producer associated with the selected raw energy source. In the example, an increase in allocation of energy demand may be proportional to an estimate of energy usage by consumers of the energy type. Also in these examples, raw energy sources from which energy may be produced, prices may be tracked, and price thresholds may be set may include a fossil fuel source, a coal source, an oil source, a natural gas source, a nuclear source, a renewable source, a wind source, a solar source, a hydropower source, a stored energy source, a battery source, and a gravity power source.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0497">In embodiments, price-related notification may be affected by estimates of consumption demand at least by the estimates of consumption demand impacting pricing of energy directly or indirectly. As described herein, energy pricing may be based on, among other things demand for the energy. Notifications may include an option by which a consumer may indicate his/her preference or specific selection of a raw energy source for the energy they consume. This indication may be aggregated among a plurality of consumers to produce a change in demand or a new demand for energy sourced from a particular raw energy source. This changed/new demand may be communicated from the platform to energy providers who may adjust production capacity and/or pricing based on the demand. If production capacity is available, production capacity may be increased in response to increasing demand. If production capacity is not available, prices for the energy may be increased in response to the increasing demand. Providing a feedback system that is integrated with pricing notification may include estimating a demand for a raw energy-specific consumer energy-type by calculating energy usage for consumers who have indicated a desire to consume energy produced from a specific raw energy type. The calculation may include consumers who are currently or have indicated a change from consuming energy produced from a different raw energy type. The demand estimate may be submitted to an energy supplier. The supplier may send a revised price for energy produced from the specific raw energy type. Based on a comparison of the revised price to a price notification threshold associated with the specific raw energy type, a notification may be sent to consumers. In embodiments, estimating a demand for a raw energy-specific consumer energy-type may include determining factors that impact the demand, gathering measures of the factors from a plurality of sources, and applying the measures to an energy consumption model that estimates energy demand based on the factors. Consumers who are consuming energy produced from a different raw energy type may be notified of an opportunity to switch to the specific raw energy type at a price that may be different than the price of they are paying. Consumers who are consuming energy produced from the affected raw energy type may be notified of a price change.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0498">In embodiments, methods and systems are provided herein
