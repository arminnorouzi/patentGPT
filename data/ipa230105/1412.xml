Due to the heterogeneity seen in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell populations, analyzing a single cell can make it possible to discover mechanisms not seen when studying a bulk population of cells. In single-cell analysis, changes in single cells can be tracked or observed at the level of genes, proteins, or other cellular components. For example, in cancer, where cells may be mutating, it can be of interest to see how cancers change at the genetic level. These patterns of somatic mutations and copy number aberrations can be observed using single-cell sequencing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recognized herein is a need for compartmentalizing components of a biological sample to perform one or more assays on an individual component within a compartment.

For example, genetic material from a cell can be analyzed separately from, or in combination with, genetic materials from other cells. While analyzing components of a sample individually may generate data with higher resolution and less noise or cross-contamination, this approach can be costly and time consuming. On the other hand, analyzing a sample or a plurality of samples in bulk can be cost and time efficient but may generate undesired, or less desired, output (e.g., due to heterogeneity). For example, a particular datum may not be trackable to a source in the sample. A spatial association of the sample components may also be lost. For example, two components of a sample may be adjacent to one another in their biologically relevant state but after pooling a plurality of samples or components of a sample, the spatial information between the two components may be lost.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">To avoid generating heterogenous samples, individual components of the sample may be compartmentalized. This can allow individual components of a sample to be processed simultaneously, or substantially simultaneously, while retaining spatial information intact and reducing processing steps. Additionally, by preventing cross-contamination and loss of material during extraneous sample processing, the generated data may be of higher quality (e.g., the data may have a higher signal to noise ratio as appropriate). Some methods may preserve spatial information by barcoding individual or groups of compartments in a sample. These methods may combine the barcoded components and may not perform multiple assays on the same component within a compartment or analysis chamber. Some of these methods may require nucleotide amplification steps that can introduce biases in the generated data.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">In order to compartmentalize individual components of a biological sample, a polymer matrix (e.g., a hydrogel matrix) can be formed adjacent to or around at least of portion of an individual component in a fluidic device. The hydrogel matrix may be selectively generated to surround a component after the system detects the component or hydrogel matrices can be generated according to a predefined pattern in a fluidic device. The hydrogel matrix may allow reagents and smaller entities to pass while retaining the individual component of the biological sample in place. Because one or more individual components can be localized within a fluidic device (e.g., encapsulated) and the localized components be exposed to one or more reagents and/or washing solutions during and/or in between analyses, multiple assays can be performed within the compartments (e.g., simultaneously, substantially simultaneously, serially, etc.).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">Different assays may be performed in different locations of the fluidic device, for example, to test effects of different treatment conditions. Additionally, because components are not generally mixed and combined, low concentrations of components (e.g., due to dilution) can be prevented. For example, when analyzing genomic material, an amplification step can be avoided due to the preservation of the genetic material in each compartment. By having two or more components within a compartment, interactions between components can be studied as well. The polymer matrix can be degradable &#x201c;on demand&#x201d; allowing for controlled localization and release mechanisms. The solutions provided herein can retain spatial information of the components and generate data on a cellular, proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic level. Since spatial information is retained, the data can be associated (e.g., linked) with phenotypic data. Further, the solutions provided herein can retain spatial information of the components and link data (e.g., phenotypic data) on a cellular, proteomic, transcriptomic, or genomic level.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">While various embodiments of the invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">Whenever the term &#x201c;at least&#x201d; precedes the first numerical value in a series of two or more numerical values, the term &#x201c;at least&#x201d; applies to each of the numerical values in that series of numerical values.

The biological sample can be obtained (e.g., extracted or isolated) from or include blood (e.g., whole blood), plasma, serum, urine, saliva, mucosal excretions, sputum, stool, and tears. The biological sample can be a fluid or tissue sample (e.g., skin sample). In some instances, the sample may be derived from a homogenized tissue sample (e.g., brain homogenate, liver homogenate, or kidney homogenate). In certain embodiments, the sample may include a specific type of cell (e.g., a neuronal cell, muscle cell, liver cell, or kidney cell). The sample may comprise or be acquired from a diseased cell or tissue (e.g., a tumor cell or a necrotic cell), In some embodiments, the sample may include or may be from a disease-associated inclusion (e.g., a plaque, a biofilm, a tumor, or a non-cancerous growth). In certain embodiments, the sample may include or may be obtained from a cell-free bodily fluid, such as whole blood, saliva, or urine. In various embodiments, the sample can include circulating tumor cells. In some cases, the sample may include or may be an environmental sample (e.g., soil, waste, or ambient air), industrial sample (e.g., samples from any industrial processes), or a food sample (e.g., dairy product, vegetable product, or meat product). The sample may be processed prior to loading into a microfluidic device. For example, the sample may be processed to purify a certain cell type or polypeptide and/or to include reagents.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0195">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymer matrix&#x201d; generally refers to a phase material (e.g., continuous phase material) that comprises at least one polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix refers to the at least one polymer as well as the interstitial space not occupied by the polymer. A polymer matrix may be composed of one or more types of polymers. A polymer matrix may include linear, branched, and crosslinked polymer units. A polymer matrix may also contain non-polymeric species intercalated within its interstitial spaces not occupied by polymer chains. The intercalated species may be solid, liquid, or gaseous species. For example, the term &#x201c;polymer matrix&#x201d; may encompass desiccated hydrogels, hydrated hydrogels, and hydrogels containing glass fibers. A polymer matrix may comprise a polymer precursor, which generally refers to one or more molecules that upon activation can trigger or initiate a polymeric reaction. A polymer precursor can be activated by electrochemical energy, photochemical energy, a photon, magnetic energy, or any other suitable energy. As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymer precursor&#x201d; includes monomers (that are polymerized to produce a polymer matrix) and crosslinking compounds, which may include photo-initiators, other compounds necessary or useful for generating polymer matrices, and the like.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">As used herein, the term &#x201c;physical photomask&#x201d; generally refers to a physical structure having a plurality of apertures or holes through which light may be projected. Physical photomasks can be used to create hydrogel matrices as described herein by causing the polymer precursor solution to polymerize and forming three-dimensional structures that correspond to the pattern on the photomask. A physical photomask can be patterned with a specific layout or geometric pattern. A physical photomask may be adhered to the upper surface of a flow cell.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0197">In some embodiments, as used herein, the term &#x201c;local parameter&#x201d; means a value of a parameter (such as, pH) in or immediately adjacent to a chamber formed by polymer matrix walls.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0198">As used herein, the term &#x201c;on demand&#x201d; means an operation may be directed to individual, discrete, selected locations (e.g. a spatial location of polymer precursor solution; or a selected polymer matrix chamber). Such selection may be based on manual observation of optical signals or data collected by a detector, or such selection may be based on a computer algorithm operating on optical signals or data collected by a detector. Manual observation of optical signals or data collected by a detector can include either real-time detection or detection at a time period prior to modulating a unit of energy to polymerize polymer precursors or degrading a chamber. For example, a subset of chambers (all formed with photo-degradable polymer matrix walls) may be pre-selected for releasing and removing their contents based on position information and the values of optical signals from an analytical assay carried out in the chambers. The pre-selected chambers may be photo-degraded by selectively projecting a light beam of appropriate wavelength characteristics (for example, with the spatial energy modulating element) to degrade the polymer matrix walls of the pre-selected chambers. In another example, a plurality of chambers may be observed in real-time (e.g. via fluorescent microscopy) for detection of an analyte of interest and one or more chambers of the plurality of chambers is selected, in real-time, upon detection of the analyte of interest, for degradation.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0199">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;microfluidic&#x201d; and &#x201c;nanofluidic&#x201d; in reference to devices are used interchangeably herein, each means an integrated system for capturing, moving, mixing, dispensing or analyzing small volumes of fluid, including samples (which, in turn, may contain or comprise cellular or molecular analytes of interest), reagents, dilutants, buffers, or the like. Generally, reference to &#x201c;microfluidics&#x201d; and &#x201c;nanofluidics&#x201d; denotes different scales in the size of devices and volumes of fluids handled. In some embodiments, features of a microfluidic device have cross-sectional dimensions of less than a few hundred square micrometers and have passages, or channels, with capillary dimensions, for example, having maximal cross-sectional dimensions of from about 500 &#x3bc;m to about 0.1 &#x3bc;m. In some embodiments, microfluidics devices have volume capacities in the range of from 1 &#x3bc;L to a few nL, e.g. 10-100 nL. Dimensions of corresponding features, or structures, in nanofluidics devices are typically from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude less than those for microfluidics devices. One skilled in the art would know from the circumstances of a particular application which dimensionality would be pertinent. In some embodiments, microfluidic or nanofluidic devices have one or more chambers, ports, and channels that are interconnected and in fluid communication and that are designed for carrying out one or more analytical reactions or processes, either alone or in cooperation with an appliance or instrument that provides support functions, such as sample introduction, fluid and/or reagent driving means, such as positive or negative pressure, acoustical energy, or the like, temperature control, detection systems, data collection and/or integration systems, and the like. In some embodiments, microfluidics and nanofluidics devices may further include valves, pumps, filters and specialized functional coatings on interior walls, e.g. to prevent adsorption of sample components or reactants, facilitate reagent movement by electroosmosis, or the like.

In some embodiments, a functional assay is performed using bright-field phase contrast or fluorescent imaging of the analyte. In some embodiments, a cell may be lysed, and a functional assay will be performed on a component thereof. Because one or more individual components can be localized within a fluidic device (e.g., encapsulated) and the localized components be exposed to one or more reagents and/or washing solutions during and/or in between analyses, multiple assays can be performed within the compartments (e.g., simultaneously, substantially simultaneously, serially, etc.).

The transcriptome may be captured by target capture probes on the surface. The capture probe can include a barcode which decodes the location of the biological component and differentiates the source biological component.

Step <b>1801</b> may further comprise inserting one or more adapters <b>1803</b>/<b>1804</b> (e.g., a sequencing primer R2) to one or both ends of the DNA fragments. A denatured DNA fragment <b>1811</b> carrying one or more adapter sequences may then be captured on a surface <b>1802</b> of the fluidic channel using a capture element (step <b>1810</b>).

The captured DNA may then be tagged, extended (step <b>1820</b>) and amplified (e.g., via PCR) (step <b>1830</b>). The barcode region <b>1813</b> of the capture element may ensure that the genomic material of a biological component may be uniquely tagged and later identified using, for example, sequencing.

In some cases, the biological component may comprise a cell. The cell may be an animal cell (e.g., a human cell), a plant cell, a fungal cell, a bacterial cell, or any other type of cell capable of producing proteins. In step <b>1901</b>, biological components can be collected to be introduced into or provided to a fluidic device. In some embodiments, a capture step <b>1902</b> may use capture elements, as described herein, to capture and/or couple a biological component to a surface of a channel disposed within the fluidic device. Capture elements may comprise a functional group, fibronectin, RGD peptides, antibodies, or other molecules as described herein. The capture element may be capable of capturing or coupling the biological component or suspected biological component. In an encapsulation step <b>1903</b> a polymer matrix may be formed adjacent to the biological component. In some embodiments, the biological component may be encapsulated entirely by the polymer matrix (e.g., hydrogel) or a portion thereof. In another embodiment, the biological component is encapsulated by the pattern of the hydrogel, or a portion thereof, and one or more surfaces of the fluidic device or channel. The polymer matrix (e.g., hydrogel) may be porous and allows transfer of reagents.</p><p id="p-0595" num="0589">A reagent may comprise a cell incubation solution. The reagent may be provided into the channel and into the polymer matrix compartment. The cell incubation reagent may promote the biological component to growth and/or to produce and secrete a secretome. In some embodiments, a secretome comprising antibodies produced and secreted from the biological component may be localized within the polymer matrix (step <b>1904</b>). In step <b>1905</b> proteins produced by and/or secreted from the biological component may be captured and tagged. A molecular barcode (e.g., fluorescent labeled antibody) may be used for tagging the protein. In step <b>1906</b>, the biological component may be lysed to release genetic material (e.g., mRNA) from within the biological component, for example, by introducing of a lysis buffer into the polymer matrix compartment. In certain embodiments, an average pore size of the polymer matrix may permit, or may be induced to permit, the flow of reagents into the polymer matrix compartment. In step <b>1907</b>, the genetic material released from the biological component may be captured by capture agents on a surface of the channel. The hydrogel may then be dismantled to allow further chemical processing (step <b>1908</b>). For example, the captured nucleic acids may comprise ribonucleic acids (e.g., mRNA). Reverse transcription may be performed to generate a complementary DNA (cDNA) and cDNA may be extended in step <b>1909</b>. In step <b>1910</b>, template switching can be performed to add additional primers to cDNA molecules. Template switching may occur prior to further denaturation and extension (step <b>1911</b>). The resulting nucleic acid strands may be tagmented (step <b>1912</b>). The protein tags and cDNA molecules may be amplified (steps <b>1913</b> and <b>1914</b>) and then eluted from the surface of the channel either sequentially or in parallel (e.g., simultaneously). The genomic and proteomic material may then be pooled (step <b>1915</b>) and further processed. Further processing may comprise nucleic acid amplification, addition of more primers, gene sequencing, and/or protein analysis processes.
