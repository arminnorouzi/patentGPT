One or more suitable AM techniques and source materials (e.g., feedstock) may be utilized for making articles (e.g., such as by creating one or more patterns directly on a substrate). The AM approach usually includes a step of selectively depositing material layer by layer. Each layer is formed by tracks of activated materials (e.g., molten materials, liquids, pastes, binders, photosensitive compounds, etc.) deposited with prescribed trajectories.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0026">AM techniques, based on various processes (e.g., fused deposition modeling (FDM), powder bed fusion, material/binder jetting, and photopolymerization), and materials (e.g., metals, polymers, glass, silica, and ceramics), provide a novel ability and flexibility for on-site (local) manufacture of intricate parts and products with mesoscale features from 10 s microns (&#x3bc;m) to several millimeters (mm) and overall sizes up to meters-scale. Thus, it is dubbed a free-form method, implying that the complexity of a product is limited only by the resolution of its manufacturing machine. As a result, AM techniques are often attractive to avoid the need for manufacturing expertise, training, machining, mold making, or tooling.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0027">However, this level of article geometric complexity significantly increases the risk of quality compromises and poses unique and critical defect detection and qualification challenges, requiring specialized Non-Destructive Evaluation/Testing (NDE/NDT) approaches. Significant variability in part quality in AM is often observed due to its line-tracing and layer-by-layer discrete production processes in creating and solidifying streaks of materials. Thus in AM, the development of novel inspection techniques for manufacturing quality assurance is necessary.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0028">Methods of detecting and classifying defects in AM can generally be divided into traditional non-destructive defect detection techniques based on first-principles physics and defect detection technology based on heuristics and Machine Learning (ML). The NDE/NDT of detection technology focuses on abnormality in feedstock (source materials) by detecting the characteristic quantities and works best when an accurate defect model is available. When no such model is available, the adoption and utilization of phenomenological and ad hoc models are needed. As noted by Yao et al. (2018), Grasso et al. (2017), and Abdelrahman et al. (2017), AM defect detection with ML has emerged as a technology that uses advanced equipment and artificial intelligence, and deep learning methods to conduct in-process imaging for defect identification. In Goh et al. (2021)'s view, based on their extensive literature review of current ML techniques, which they categorize into four groups as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforced learning, the in-situ real-time monitoring of AM processes will significantly benefit from the object detection ability of ML. In AM, multiply physical field variables (e.g., thermal, mechanical, and electrical) interact in a highly nonlinear manner for creating complex solid geometries; thus, the use of deterministic first-principles physical models is extremely limited. Out of all these factors that complicate the in-situ real-time monitoring of AM, geometric complexity is the only factor that can be reduced to simplify the quality monitoring task. A method, a system, and a device are described in the present invention as to how this challenge is overcome by utilizing test artifacts with simple, regular geometries.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0029">In AM-made articles, various types of post-production defects have been observed and reported: layer defects, zones with lack of fusion, isolated and clustered porosity, voids, residual stresses, and high-density inclusions/contaminations (see Felix et al. (2015) for a review and classification of currently known defect types in metal AM and Chen et al. (2021) for typical defect inspection technologies in AM). In addition to such defects, microstructure that changes as a function of location may hamper NDE/NDT inspectability. Such effects need to be taken into account when selecting and validating appropriate inspection approaches. While various post-processing techniques (e.g., stress relief, HIP (Hot Isostatic Pressing), and heat treatment) have been proposed and utilized, many quality challenges remain.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0030">The well-documented critical shortcomings of AM are often summarized as (i) poor surface quality, (ii) low bonding quality and mechanical strength and layer delamination, (iii) limited source material choices, (iv) significantly slow processes compared to some other manufacturing methods such as forging, stamping, or molding techniques, (v) substantial residual stress build-up, (vi) inadequate dimensional tolerances and warpage (due to residual stresses), (vii) internal material defects and irregularities and uncontrolled porosity, (viii) limited process and production repeatability, and (ix) dimensional and form errors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0031">In filament fusion AM machines, the root causes of fabrication issues can often be traced to the mechanical/defect states of load-carrying fiber-to-fiber/layer-to-layer bonds. In the case of Metal Laser Sintering, root causes of porosities, contaminations, micro-cracks, etc., are still under research, and the disclosed method could help diagnose. If extensive post-production offline quality inspections are required for complex articles, the on-site fabrication advantage offered by AM is no longer attractive.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0032">Another critical quality-related shortcoming of AM is that it is difficult or impractical to inspect the article before completion due often to a hostile production environment and/or the geometric complexity of the article. This situation may result in machine time and material waste, causing a substantial reduction in manufacturing throughput and profitability. Even after an article is completely fabricated, using current NDE/NDT techniques, it may be difficult or impossible to inspect the article due to its geometric complexity and uneven materials and properties distributions. Thus, an article may have a latent defect undetected in a post-manufacturing quality evaluation and may be installed on a machine only to fail, leading to economic losses subsequently. While process control could limit such variability, its effectiveness is often impeded by a lack of adequate process understanding and measurement techniques.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0033">Consequently, current process control is frequently based on heuristics, human experience, and experimental data, yielding limited improvements in quality output. AM lacks in-situ quality inspection capability, which seriously limits the realization of its full potential as a practical on-site manufacturing modality. Currently, its widespread industrial adoption in critical applications is often challenged by quality and consistency concerns. If extensive post-production offline quality inspections are required for a complex article, the on-site fabrication advantage that AM offers is no longer attractive. Moreover, virtually all existing standard NDE/NDT techniques today are of limited values to AM, as they are developed for relatively simple geometries and waveguides (e.g., plates, disks, pipes, etc.), as irregular boundaries pose serious detection difficulties for NDE/NDT techniques based on wave propagation. There also remains a need for a system that provides real-time automatic alteration of processing conditions based on monitoring information about the layer manufacturing of a 3D article, leading to an independent closed-loop system. Such a system would have the potential to reduce the complexity and overall size of the AM machine.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0034">As detailed in a series of recent review articles by Everton et al. (2016) and Grasso and Colosimo (2017), and technology reports by Mani et al. (2015) of NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology), Waller et al. (2014) of NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration), Chen et al. (2021), and Vafadar et al. (2021) on in-situ process monitoring, currently quality issues form a serious roadblock for high-value products and its wide-scale adoption. Felix et al. (2018) of NIST has conducted and published a list of defect types observed in metal AM. In addition, various standard and roadmap development efforts are reported (for example, see AMSC (the Additive Manufacturing Standardization Collaborative) Roadmap and ASTM (the American Society for Testing Materials) Work Item (Number 56649)). In the AMSC Roadmap, various aspects of the disclosed method, system, and device have been identified as technology gaps.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0035">At present, there are methods and systems for monitoring and assessing AM processes based on the utilization of test artifacts. Manufacturing a test artifact enables a composite test since most of the errors present in the materials, AM machine, and processes contribute to the errors in the final product. Several test artifacts for formal standardization have been proposed and utilized, as summarized and discussed in a NIST report by Moylan et al (2012). With such a well-designed standardized artifact, the performances of different machines and processes, or source materials that produce the same standardized artifact may be compared.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0036">The utilization of testing witness coupons in AM is particularly valuable as part of an AM production process and as a post-production quality assessment technique. In this testing approach, a standard design for a testing coupon (see a NIST report by Moylan et al. (2012) for specific coupon examples), which is small compared to the actual article to be built, is often examined before and after production to make certain that the utilized AM machine, AM processes, and material(s) are performing as expected. This approach is adopted to receive relatively rapid feedback on whether or not the AM machine is producing acceptable results from a defect and mechanical properties perspective. In addition, coupons, which are cut directly from articles, could also give a more direct indication of AM process stability and article quality.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0037">However, presently, the ultimate function of an available test artifact is limited to test the ability of an AM machine in its reproducing geometric features, not necessarily other critical properties such as mechanical strength, bonding strength, fusing strength, structural integrity, internal defect types and states, and optical and electromagnetic properties, and their spatial distributions. Thus, its utilization is limited.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0038">The present invention seeks to improve upon a prior test artifact-based quality monitoring method for AM processes and machine learning algorithms by providing a unique method, system, and device for inspection of articles utilizing a novel class of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) test artifacts with periodic internal and surface structures, which are to be built in an AM machine while its progress is monitored with the aid of elastic waves and near- and broad-field sensors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0039">As the following discussion will illustrate, the present teachings relate to a method, system, and device for performing real-time in-situ inspection and quality monitoring of a 3D test artifact comprising several disclosed steps, and offers a method for making the uses deterministic first-principles physical models and ML techniques as predictive tools possible in AM. In an embodiment, a design method of the test artifact is provided. The spectral characteristics of waves propagating in the artifact's interior are altered by its propagation medium's mechanical, physical, and geometric properties. Consequently, the analysis of the spectral response of the artifact has the potential to reveal information about both its internal structures and surface patterns and the properties of materials. However, the spectral analysis of complex geometries and its direct application offers limited insight; thus, special care needs to be taken in designing test artifacts. It is known that a periodic structure can disperse waves and create pass- and stop-bands in its frequency spectrum depending on its geometric arrangement, interfacial properties, and mass distribution, as well as defect states, even if materials involved do not necessarily include any imperfections and/or dissipation mechanisms. In addition, even minor perturbation level defects in a periodic structure may have significant observable effects in its spectral response, thus can be detected from the properties of received waves.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0040">In another embodiment, a real-time in-situ monitoring method utilizing the spectral and dispersive characteristics of wave propagation and field sensor data in a specially designed test artifact consisting of repeating sub-structures is disclosed. For example, it may be utilized to monitor and assess the fiber-to-fiber and layer-to-layer bond quality and strength&#x2014;not only for geometry but also for mechanical strength and physical defects. While the embodiments of the invention described in the present invention refer to the formation of a pass and stop bands in spectral-domain as a sensing mechanism, the present invention is not so limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0041">As detecting waves travel significantly faster than typical AM deposition speeds, the disclosed approach may lead to rapid real-time monitoring with no or minimal interactions with the fusion process. At process control, monitoring, and inspection levels, the probing knowledge required to implement such an approach is generally absent. The disclosed invention provides a method, system, and device for this unfulfilled real-time in-situ monitoring need.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0042">Those skilled in the art will appreciate the scope of the disclosure and realize additional aspects thereof after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments associated with the accompanying drawing figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0043">The accompanying figures, in which like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally-similar elements throughout the separate views and which are incorporated in and form an article of the specification, further illustrate the present invention, and together with the detailed description of the invention, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.

Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawing figures, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the disclosure and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0056">Reference will be made below in detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference characters used throughout the drawings refer to the same or like parts, without duplicative description. Although exemplary embodiments of the invention disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/731,366 are described with respect to fused deposition modeling (FDM) with a filament made of the material of Poly(lactic acid) (PSL) and test artifacts made by FDM, embodiments of the invention are also applicable to sintering and to other AM processes and techniques and test artifacts made by those processes and procedures. Although exemplary embodiments of the described 3D artifacts are in the shapes of cube and cuboid, embodiments of the invention are also makeable with other 3D geometric shapes. In other embodiments, surface structures and features such as single tracks or complex two geometric patterns on the surface of a multi-mode waveguide are also usable as two-dimensional (2D) test artifacts. Moreover, embodiments of the invention are not limited to industrial applications and may generally be instrumental for AM and 3D printing. In addition to FDM, particular embodiments may be suitable for use with Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Direct Metal Laser Melt (DMLM), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), Vat photopolymerization, Material Jetting, Binder Jetting, Sheet Lamination, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical product printing, and bioprinting and biofabrication AM techniques.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0057">Elastic wave motion in a medium with a mass density distribution in which, when its particles are displaced, a force proportional to the displacement acts on the particles to restore them to their original position. If the particles in a particular region are set in vibratory motion, an elastic wave propagates. Elastic wave motion is often a multi-mode propagation depending upon its wavelength and the geometry of its conduit. An infinite solid medium supports only two wave modes (referred to as pressure and shear) traveling at their unique velocities. These modes are often referred to as bulk waves. However, a plate supports two infinite sets (referred to as symmetric and anti-symmetric) of Lamb wave modes, whose velocities depend on the relationship between wavelength (or frequency) and plate thickness. Other guided wave modes of elastic wave propagation included surface acoustic waves (SAW) in a half-space and interface or boundary (Stoneley) waves along with the interface of two bonded half-spaces. Rayleigh waves are a type of surface wave that travel near the surface of solids. Rayleigh waves include both longitudinal and transverse motions that decrease exponentially in amplitude as the distance from the surface increases. There is a phase difference between these component motions. This type of multi-mode elastic waves is often known as guided waves.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0058">A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. A piezoelectric transducer can convert electrical energy into a traveling strain wave pulse and vice versa. To image, test, or interrogate a large volume of material, a conventional (single-element) probe (transducer) must be physically scanned (moved or turned) to sweep the beam through the area of interest. In contrast, the beam from a phased array probe (transducer) can be focused and swept electronically without moving the probe. The beam is controllable because a phased array probe comprises multiple small elements, each of which can be pulsed individually at a computer-calculated timing. Multi-mode wave propagation can be initiated by a single-element transducer or a phased-array probe/transducer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0059">Conventional single-element piezoelectric transducers with crystal and composite material active elements are used mainly in ultrasound and NDE/NDT applications. While lead zirconate titanate (PZT) crystal and composite materials have been widely used in traditional piezoelectric devices due to their favorable piezoelectric properties, they have several disadvantages, such as the lead component in the compound, aging deformation, and high annealing/deposition temperature. Therefore, their fabrication process is CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) micro-processing/manufacturing incompatible. In the past two decades, micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs) have been developed and utilized in several medical imaging and consumer electronics applications, such as handheld/catheter-based medical devices and fingerprint sensors for smartphones. In general, MUTs operate in two different mechanisms, capacitive force or piezoelectric sensing-actuation as in capacitive force micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT) and piezoelectric micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (PMUT), respectively (see Qiu et al. (2015) and Brenner et al. (2019) for processing details and applications). PMUTs and CMUTs are both in the category of flexural transducers. CMUT and PMUT transducers can be fabricated as phased array probes for multi-mode elastic wave generation and/or for beamforming and focusing. MUTs have been introduced as competitors to the conventional piezoelectric transducers due to their key advantages in modern applications, including the ease of integration with front-end electronics (CMOS integration), impedance matching, wide bandwidth, and high coupling coefficient. Additionally, MUTs are fabricated using conventional low-temperature micro-machining techniques making the CMOS-MUT integration process substantially easier and cheaper at scale than bulk piezoelectric-CMOS integration.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0060">Electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) is a type of transducer for non-contact acoustic/ultrasonic elastic wave generation and reception in conducting materials. Its effect is based on electromagnetic mechanisms, which need no direct coupling or contact with the material's surface. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMATs are particularly useful and desirable in harsh and extreme environments (such as hot, cold, clean rooms, and/or dry).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0061">Electric arcs or sparks are produced by applying a high voltage between a short point-to-point gap in the air. The generation of ultrasonic pressure pulses with electric arcs is possible.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0062">An interferometer is an instrument that compares the position or surface structure of two objects, thus used for surface motion and topography measurements. Various types of interferometry (such as electronic speckle pattern, holographic, self-mixing laser, low coherence) are available. A vibrometer often refers to a two-beam laser interferometer that measures the frequency (or phase) difference between an internal reference beam and a test beam. A Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is a scientific instrument used to make non-contact vibration measurements of a surface. The LDV laser beam is directed at the surface of an object, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the reflected laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0063">For thermographic (thermal) imaging, several significant limitations have been reported: (i) Emissivity is often different for the melt-pool, unconsolidated powder, and solidified surface, so a thermal image composed of all three components could give ambiguous temperature predictions, (ii) only radiation sensor systems with narrow bandwidth may be used accurately, and (iii) debris from the heat-affected zone can block a viewport used in an AM imaging system and alter temperature measurements by changing radiation transmission. Residual stress measurements have also been considered for determining the mechanical state of a build. Still, it is highly challenging to apply direct methods (e.g., neutron transmission/diffraction, X-ray diffraction) due to difficulties associated with cost, limited availability, and bulky equipment size. Indirect methods monitor physical attributes manifesting strains and residual stresses, such as surface distortion and strain gage measurements (offline/in situ). Unfortunately, such methods are often impractical for real-time in-situ monitoring applications, as sensor bonding to the build is required and/or instruments are bulky and slow.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0064">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>; however, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.

A scanning sensor performs the sensing of a sensor task over a line, surface, or space as well as time. In this context, imaging is defined as the action or process of producing an image of a part of an object by various techniques and based on multiple field effects. A scanning field sensor scans a geometric domain for a physical field variable (e.g., temperature, electric field, electromagnetic emission) and captures an image(s) of the area over the geometric domain. Each sensor and device could include a data port and signal connector or both to be interfaced with a monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0090">Part quality for metal AM parts is often evaluated on dimensional, volumetric, metallurgical, and surface finish compliance, where each evaluation area makes up a portion of the part quality attributes. Depending upon inspection and quality objectives, various sensing techniques can be adapted to monitor specific aspects of the build quality space. Each technique has its own strengths and deficiencies.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0091">Sensing techniques for local (also referred to as near-field or narrow field-of-view) properties are used to generate real-time monitoring data, typically measuring process by-products that may indirectly infer a quality condition in a point-wise manner, which refers to a small measurement probe spot size compared to the size of the measurement field. For example, in AM, near-field photodetectors and spectrometers measure light intensity and wavelength content, respectively, from the laser plume and/or the melt zone of an AM process. Various types of spectroscopy (such as near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR), Terahertz (far-infrared), Raman) are available. Thermal melt pool imaging captures infrared by-products from the melt pool and heat-affected zone to produce a calibrated image of the melt pool. Both temperature and spatial melt pool metrics can be linked to AM process stability and eventual volumetric defect formation. On the other hand, sensing techniques for global properties (also referred to as areal, far-field, or wide field-of-view) typically acquire data on a layer-by-layer basis, where the data directly infers a quality condition. For example, visible spectrum build area imaging (e.g., machine vision) captures top view images of the build area before a layer is processed and after a layer is processed. Pre-processing images may identify irregularities in the powder spread (such as angled spreading, waviness, and troughs from blade damages) or poor coverage due to part distortion or poor processing on the previous layer. Post-processing images may directly measure geometric compliance and irregular surface conditions. Laser profilometry and three-dimensional structured light microscopy also produce surface topography data. Laser profilometry is a non-contact, non-destructive testing technique used to scan and map the surface of an object with a laser beam. A three-dimensional structured light microscope (a structured-light 3D scanner) is a three-dimensional scanning device for measuring the three-dimensional shape of an object using projected light patterns and a camera system. Data can be acquired pre-process and post-process and utilized to directly measure geometric and surface finish compliance. Thermal imaging (also referred to as infrared thermography (IRT), thermography, thermal video, and thermal imaging infrared camera) is a process where a thermal camera captures and creates an image of an object by using infrared radiation emitted from the surface of the object in a process. A thermal imaging infrared camera captures infrared by-products from the melt pool and heat-affected zone to produce calibrated images of the melt pool. Both temperature and spatial melt pool metrics can be linked to process stability and eventual volumetric defect formation. Thermographic cameras usually detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum and produce images of that radiation. Thermal build area-imaging captures the top view temperature maps of the build domain throughout processing and post-processing to determine heat flow. This type of measurement, in combination with computational modeling techniques, is used to predict the metallurgical state as a function of three-dimensional position within the build and/or time. Other non-destruction testing (NDT) methods can also be adopted for surface scanning. For example, eddy current arrays could be employed to scan over the metal build to measure both surface topography variation and sub-surface irregularities, cracks, and voids.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0092">A focused X-ray generator is a vacuum tube that converts electrical input power into focused X-rays. The X-ray generator is a device that acts as the primary control mechanism for the entire fluoroscope. It is through the X-ray generator that current is allowed to flow into the X-ray tube. The main function of adjusting the voltage differential and current of the X-ray tube is to control automatically to maintain optimal contrast and brightness. High X-ray flux densities on the samples being investigated are achieved by focusing the divergent beam from the X-ray source onto the sample using one out of a range of focusing optical components. This source is also useful for scanning probe techniques such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and scanning X-ray fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0093">Eddy current array is a non-destructive testing technique that provides the ability to electronically drive multiple eddy current coils, which are placed side by side in the same probe assembly.
