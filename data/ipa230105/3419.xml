In some example embodiments, the system, apparatus, and methods can relate to remote control of a fossil fuel-based heating device and an electrical heating device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical power systems are typically operated so that power is generated to meet the demand for power. The demand for power is met using a combination of different electrical power generating sources such as, but not limited to, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, coal, biofuels, geothermal, wind, and solar. Such electrical power generation can variously be considered non-varying, dispatchable, or intermittent sources. For example, nuclear power plants may typically operated as non-varying sources as changes to their power output can compromise efficiency. In contrast, renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are typically intermittent sources as their output is limited by the availability of wind and sun. Meanwhile, hydroelectric and natural gas are typically dispatchable sources as their output can be controllably varied relatively quickly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although supply can, to some extent, be dispatched to meet demand, there can still be an oversupply of electricity. Oversupply can often occur during off-peak periods such as at nighttime, when human activity is low. Oversupply can also occur seasonally, such as the winter when air conditioners are not operating and instead heating needs are met by fossil fuels. When there is an oversupply of electricity, excess electricity may be exported to neighboring electricity markets. Exportation of electricity can bear additional costs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The various embodiments described herein generally relate to methods (and associated systems configured to implement the methods) for controlling a plurality of heating devices in one or more sites.

The site can be any type of facility, including but not limited to residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional, that has a building and a plurality of heating devices to heat space within the building. For example, the site can be a house having a furnace and an electrical heater, both of which can heat the house.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">When there is an oversupply of electricity, existing practices of the electrical system operator can involve exporting excess electricity to neighboring electricity markets in order to balance the grid. However, while electricity is being exported, many buildings within the electricity grid are using fossil-fuel based heating devices for heating.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The systems, apparatus, and methods described herein can be used to balance the grid by diverting the excess electricity to heat buildings within the electricity grid. This can reduce the export of excess electricity and reduce the use of fossil-fuels for heating. This approach can be particularly desirable when electricity within the grid is generated from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, because the use of renewable energy sources can effectively displace the use of fossil-fuel for heating.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which illustrates a block diagram <b>100</b> of components interacting with an example management system <b>110</b>.

Typically, the primary heat source has the capacity to heat the space alone. For example, a house of approximately 2200 ft<sup>2 </sup>may have a furnace providing approximately 60,000 BTU/h, or approximately 18 kW (kilowatts). Typically, the blower fan <b>214</b> can provide a minimum air flow of approximately 500 CFM to approximately 1000 CFM.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The electrical heating device <b>220</b> can be considered the secondary heat source for the site. The secondary heat source can be sized to have a similar capacity to heat the space alone. In this manner, the secondary heat source can be an alternative to the primary heat source. For example, the electrical heating device <b>220</b> can have a power rating of about 18 kW to about 20 kW. With the blower fan <b>214</b> providing approximately 1000 CFM, an electrical heating device <b>220</b> having a power rating of 18 kW can heat a 2200 ft<sup>2 </sup>space by 10&#xb0; C. in approximately an hour.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In at least one embodiment, the secondary heat source may not be sized to have the capacity to heat the space alone.

For example, the electrical heating device <b>220</b> can have a power rating of about 1.5 kW to about 3.5 kW.

A stand-alone electrical heater can include a heater fan to move the air warmed by the electrical heater. In at least one embodiment, the stand-alone electrical heater can be positioned to push the warm air into return duct <b>302</b> or supply duct <b>308</b> of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>. The warm air can be distributed by the forced air circulation of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>, that is, blower fan <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In at least one embodiment, air warmed by the stand-alone electrical heater may not directly enter the warm air into return duct <b>302</b> or supply duct <b>308</b> of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>. Instead, the stand-alone electrical heater can be positioned in a location that aligns with natural air ventilation. For example, the electrical heating device <b>220</b> can be in a lower level of the site. Warm air from the electrical heating device <b>220</b> can move to an upper level of the site with natural air ventilation through convection and diffusion. Furthermore, warm air from the electrical heating device <b>220</b> may enter the return duct <b>302</b> through air inlets.

In other embodiments, the management system <b>110</b> can perform other functions related to monitoring and control of the electrical power system, in addition to implementing method <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Method <b>400</b> can begin at <b>410</b>. One or more sites within an electrical power system can have a plurality of heating devices, including at least a fossil fuel-based heating device, such as the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>, and an electrical heating device, such as the electrical heating device <b>220</b>, to heat the same space within the site. A management processor <b>112</b> associated with the electrical power system can determine whether a current system supply is greater than a current system demand.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">At <b>420</b>, in response to determining that the current system supply is greater than the current system demand, the management processor <b>112</b> can identify at least one site to receive an opportunity to use electrical heating.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can identify at least one site to receive an opportunity to use electrical heating by determining a current system oversupply. For at least one power generator contributing to the current system supply, the management processor <b>112</b> can select one or more sites within a grid proximity to the at least one power generator to receive the opportunity to use electrical heating such that a total power demand of the one or more sites corresponds at least a portion of the current system oversupply. That is, the management processor <b>112</b> can select one or more sites that are within the grid proximity to a power generator that is operating.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Grid proximity can be a measure of connectivity and geographical proximity. For example, a first site may be located geographically near a power generator but be connected through a large series of switches, disconnects, and/or interconnects. A second site may be located geographically further from the power generator but not connected through as many switches, disconnects, and/or interconnects. The second site can be considered to have a greater grid proximity to the power generator and the first site can be considered to have a lesser grid proximity to the power generator. Furthermore, a third site may be located closer to the power generator than the second site and be connected through a similar number of switches, disconnects, and/or interconnects. The third site can be considered to have greater grid proximity to the power generator than the second site.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In at least one embodiment, the grid proximity of a site to each power generator can be pre-determined. Furthermore, a pre-determined grid proximity threshold can be used to select one or more sites that have a grid proximity that is within the pre-determined grid proximity threshold of a power generator. In at least one embodiment, the pre-determined grid proximity threshold is dependent on the power generator. For example, a first power generator can have a greater pre-determined grid proximity threshold than a second power generator.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In at least one embodiment, a site can be within the pre-determined grid proximity threshold of a plurality of power generators. In at least one embodiment, a site may not be within the pre-determined grid proximity threshold of any power generators.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can allocate substantially all of the current system oversupply to electrical heating. That is, the total power demand for electrical heating of the one or more sites can substantially match the current system supply. In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can allocate only a portion of the current system oversupply to electrical heating.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In selecting potential sites to use electrical heating, the management processor <b>112</b> can also account for the power transmission losses to each site. That is, the total power demand of the sites that will receive an opportunity includes the size of the load of the site itself as well as the power transmission losses associated with delivering power to the site.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In at least one embodiment, the size of the load is an approximation that is based on the type of site. For example, all single residential homes can be assumed to have an approximate load size while a multi-residential building can be assumed to have another approximate load size. Furthermore, each type of size can have a plurality of load sizes (e.g., large commercial building, small commercial building etc . . . ).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can select one or more sites to receive the opportunity to use electrical heating based previous opportunity assignments and/or actual usage. Considering previous opportunity assignments and/or actual usage can ensure that the benefits using electrical heating is shared amongst participants.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">For example, if a site receives an opportunity signal in a first instance of system oversupply, the site may not receive an opportunity signal in subsequent instances of system oversupply until all other participating sites have also received opportunity signals.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">However, although a site may receive an opportunity signal to use electrical heating, the site may not have used electrical heating in response to receiving the opportunity signal. In at least one embodiment, if a site receives an opportunity signal and uses electrical heating in a first instance of system supply, the site may not receive an opportunity signal in subsequent instances of system oversupply until all other participating sites have also used electrical heating in response to receiving opportunity signals or have received a pre-determined number of opportunity signals.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">At <b>430</b>, the management processor <b>112</b> can transmit an opportunity signal to the local controller <b>150</b> of each of the at least one site.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The opportunity signal can be transmitted from the management processor <b>112</b> to the local controller <b>150</b> via the network. In at least one embodiment, the opportunity signal can be transmitted via one or more intermediaries, such as a local distributor, a substation, or a neighborhood node.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In at least one embodiment, the method <b>400</b> can be multi-resolutional. That is, the management processor <b>112</b> can be associated with a market operator that allocates a portion of the current system oversupply to a local distributor. In turn, a management processor <b>112</b> of the local distributor can identify one or more sites to receive an opportunity electrical heating and transmit the opportunity signal to the local controller <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In at least one embodiment, the method <b>400</b> can be iterative. For example, the management processor <b>112</b> can identify and transmit the opportunity signal to one or more local controllers <b>150</b>. The management processor <b>112</b> can determine whether the current system demand increases in response to the opportunity signal transmitted. If the current system oversupply still exists or has not been sufficiently reduced, the management processor <b>112</b> can identify and transmit opportunity signals to other local controllers <b>150</b>. The management processor <b>112</b> can continue to identify and transmit opportunity signals to additional local controllers <b>150</b> until the current system oversupply has been sufficiently reduced.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can receive data from a local controller <b>150</b> of a first site indicating a heating status at the first site. The heating status may indicate that electrical heating would not be used. For example, the heating status may include data indicative that the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> is not in use.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Given data indicating that heating is not in use at a first site, the management processor <b>112</b> can in turn select a different site to receive the opportunity to use electrical heating. In at least one embodiment, local controllers <b>150</b> can transmit the heating status in response to receiving an opportunity signal. In at least one embodiment, local controllers <b>150</b> can periodically transmit the heating status to the management processor <b>112</b> and the management processor <b>112</b> would not transmit an opportunity signal to the respective local controllers <b>150</b> in the first place.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">At <b>440</b>, the local controller <b>150</b> of each of the at least one site can receive the opportunity signal from the management processor <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In at least one embodiment, the local controller <b>150</b> receives the opportunity signal via network <b>140</b>. As such, a loss of connectivity to network <b>140</b> results in the site not using the electrical heating device <b>220</b> and only using the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">At <b>450</b>, the local controller <b>150</b> can generate one or more signals to control an operation of at least one of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> or the electrical heating device <b>220</b> of the site based in part on the opportunity signal. For example, the local controller <b>150</b> can turn on the electrical heating device <b>220</b>. Furthermore, if the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> is operating, the local controller <b>150</b> can turn off the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> to discontinue operating, or at least discontinue use of the primary heat source. That is, the heat exchanger <b>212</b> of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> may discontinue operating but the blower fan <b>214</b> of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> may continue operating to circulate warm air heated by the electrical heating device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In at least one embodiment, the local controllers <b>150</b> can determine the heating status of the site prior to operating the electrical heating device <b>220</b>. The heating status can indicate whether any heating should be provided. That is, the local controllers <b>150</b> can determine the heating status of the site. For example, the local controllers <b>150</b> can receive a current temperature from a temperature sensor located within the site. The local controller <b>150</b> can compare the current temperature with a local temperature setting. The local controller <b>150</b> can determine whether the current temperature is less than a local temperature setting; and in response to determining that the current temperature is less than the local temperature setting, the local controller <b>150</b> can determine that heating should be provided. In turn, the local controller <b>150</b> can generate a signal to operate the electrical heating device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In at least one embodiment, the local controller <b>150</b> can store data indicative of actual usage of the electrical heating device <b>220</b> of the site in response to the opportunity signal. For example, the local controller <b>150</b> can log when the electrical heating device <b>220</b> is signaled to operate. The local controller <b>150</b> can also obtain the actual usage of the electrical heating device <b>220</b> from the electrical heating meter <b>230</b> and associate the actual usage data with opportunity data received from the management processor <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In at least one embodiment, the local controllers <b>150</b> may not discontinue use of the primary heat source. The fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> and the electrical heating device <b>220</b> can be operated simultaneously. For example, the secondary heat source may not be sized to provide the full heating capacity of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> and as such, the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> can continue to supplement the heating provided by the electrical heating device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In at least one embodiment, the local controllers <b>150</b> may continue use of the primary heat source only. That is, the local controllers <b>150</b> may not generate a signal to discontinue operating the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>, nor generate a signal to operate the electrical heating device <b>220</b>. The local controller <b>150</b> can estimate a current operating time for the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>. If the current operating time for the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> is short (i.e., the fossil-fuel based heating device <b>210</b> recently turned on), the local controller <b>150</b> may determine that the fossil-fuel based heating device <b>210</b> should continue to operate in order to avoid excessive wear on the fossil-fuel based heating device <b>210</b> from switching on and off.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can determine that the current system oversupply no longer exists and transmit an expiration signal to one or more of the local controllers <b>150</b> that began using electrical heating in response to an opportunity signal. Upon receipt of the expiration signal from the management processor <b>112</b>, the local controller <b>150</b> can generate one or more signals to control the operation of at least one of the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> or the electrical heating device <b>220</b> of the site based in part on the expiration signal. For example, the local controller <b>150</b> can turn off the electrical heating device <b>220</b> and turn on the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In at least one embodiment, the local controller <b>150</b> may not turn off the electrical heating device <b>220</b> and turn on the fossil fuel-based heating device <b>210</b> upon receipt of an expiration signal. The local controller <b>150</b> can estimate remaining duration of the current heating status of the site. If the remaining duration of the current heating status is short (i.e., heating will only be provided for a short period of time), the local controller <b>150</b> may determine that the electrical heating device <b>220</b> should continue to operate in order to avoid excessive wear on the fossil-fuel based heating device <b>210</b> from switching on and off.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In at least one embodiment, the opportunity to use electrical heating can be distributed on a rotating or rolling basis. For example, the management processor <b>112</b> can select a first site to receive the opportunity to use electrical heating for a first duration and select a second site to receive the opportunity to use electrical heating for a second duration after the first duration. The management processor <b>112</b> can transmit an opportunity signal to a local controller <b>150</b> of the first site for the first duration. Following the first duration, the management processor <b>112</b> can transmit an expiration signal to the local controller <b>150</b> of the first site and an opportunity signal to a local controller <b>150</b> of the second site for the second duration. In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can select the second site before the first duration or towards the end of the first duration (and prior to the second duration).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In at least one embodiment, the expiration signal can be the same signal, or transmitted on the same channel as the opportunity signal. For example, the opportunity signal can be indicated by a leading edge of a pulse while the expiration signal can be indicated by the trailing edge of a pulse. That is, the opportunity/expiration signal can relate to a single bit.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In at least one embodiment, the management processor <b>112</b> can select the first site and second site to share a rotation based on the grid proximity to one another. For example, the first site and the second site can be two sites on the same street and connected to the same disconnect or substation. Selecting sites that share grid proximity can help maintain a balanced grid and avoid the large voltage/current spikes within the transmission system as loads are disconnected and connected.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In at least one embodiment, instead of determining determine whether a current system supply is greater than a current system demand, the management processor <b>112</b> can determine that a renewable energy source, such as wind or solar, is available and contributing electricity to the current system supply. The management processor <b>112</b> can proceed to identify one or more sites to receive an opportunity signal to use electrical heating. In this case, the use of electrical heating from a renewable energy source can displace the use of fossil fuel-based heating.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">It will be appreciated that numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example embodiments described herein.
