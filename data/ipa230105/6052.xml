Generally, a field effect transistor formed of a compound semiconductor having particularly high electron mobility in terms of physical properties is used as an electronic device having good high-frequency characteristics.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The field effect transistor described above includes a semiconductor substrate, a semiconductor stacked structure formed on the semiconductor substrate, a gate electrode formed on a surface of the semiconductor stacked structure, and a source electrode and a drain electrode formed on both sides of the gate electrode. In particular, a high electron mobility transistor having excellent high-frequency characteristics includes a buffer layer, a channel layer, a barrier layer, a stopper layer, a cap layer, and a passivation layer sequentially stacked on the semiconductor substrate. Further, a carrier supply layer is formed on the barrier layer side or on the buffer layer side with respect to the channel layer. In this configuration, a position of the carrier supply layer or the amount of doping of impurities is designed according to a design of element characteristics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this type of field effect transistor, when a potential is applied to the gate electrode, a concentration of two-dimensional electron gas formed by carriers being supplied from the carrier supply layer to the channel layer is modulated according to an intensity of the applied potential, and electrons move through a conduction channel formed between the source electrode and the drain electrode. The carrier supply layer and the channel layer in which the conduction channel through which the electrons (carriers) move (travel) is formed are spatially separated, and scattering due to impurities in the carrier supply layer is curbed. Thus, in the above-described field effect transistor, electron mobility can be improved and high-frequency operation can be realized.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of applications of the above-described field effect transistor to a high-frequency circuit may include good high-frequency characteristics of the transistor alone. Further, from a viewpoint of practical use, long-term reliability of the field effect transistor is required. In order to improve the high-frequency characteristics of the field effect transistor, it is effective to have a fine gate length, reduce a parasitic capacitance, and reduce a gate resistance at the time of a high-frequency operation. In particular, in order to reduce the gate resistance at the time of the high-frequency operation, it is important to employ a material having high conductivity for the gate electrode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, in order to improve reliability of the field effect transistor, a portion of the gate electrode in contact with the barrier layer is formed of a conductive material containing a metal that does not easily diffuse into a semiconductor so that mutual diffusion is prevented between the gate electrode and the barrier layer to which a voltage is always applied. Examples of such a metal include a high melting point metal such as tungsten or molybdenum. Further, a nitride of such a metal, for example, is used as the above-described conductive material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, while this type of conductive material does not easily diffuse into a semiconductor, a conductivity thereof is not very high (resistivity is high). In particular, in a high-frequency operation, a so-called skin effect in which an applied signal propagates only on a surface of the gate electrode becomes a problem in a gate electrode for which such a kind of conductive material is used. Because the skin effect becomes remarkable particularly at high frequencies, characteristics of a high-frequency circuit are greatly impaired.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, when this kind of conductive material is used for the gate electrode, a layer of, for example, gold having high conductivity, in addition to a layer of a conductive material used for preventing diffusion, is stacked as the gate electrode. For example, a layer proximate to the barrier layer is formed of tungsten silicide, and a layer formed of a highly conductive metal material containing platinum or gold is formed as a gate electrode on the tungsten silicide layer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">NPL 1: T.

However, when the dimensions of the second mask opening <b>112</b><i>a </i>are fine, the second mask opening <b>112</b><i>a </i>may be blocked by a deposit in the sputtering method.
