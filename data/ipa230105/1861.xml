Furthermore, infrastructure projects are sometimes performed in or near densely populated areas such that noise occurring during for example loading/unloading may be perceived as bothersome and authorities may issue restrictions regarding noise levels and limitations as to at what time work may be performed. Normally, on-road truck beds are made from steel which causes high noise levels, especially during loading of material using e.g. front loaders or excavators. Further, the truck beds are subjected to excessive wear reducing lifetime of the truck bed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An object of the invention is to overcome, or at least lessen the problems involved with prior art on-road truck beds. A particular object is to provide an on-road truck body lining for protecting an on-road truck body from wear and reduce environmental stress, by reducing noise. The on-road truck body lining comprises a plurality of main lining elements and a plurality of edge lining elements arranged to be fixated to the truck body. Each main lining element comprises a load-facing portion and one or more transition sides, each transition side being adapted to meet a corresponding transition side of an adjacent edge lining element of the plurality of edge lining elements and a truck body facing portion which is arranged opposite to said load facing portion. The truck body facing portion comprises one or more end portions which protrude from a respective transition side such that when in use of the on-road truck body lining, the one or more end portions of the truck body facing portion are each arranged to be covered by a respective adjacent edge lining element such that the respective adjacent edge lining element, upon being fixated, clamps the main lining element to the on-road truck body. The use of lining for an on-road truck bed greatly reduces the noise and vibrations during e.g. loading of the truck and it also reduces the amount of carry-back, i.e. the amount of material sticking to the truck bed after unloading. By using the edge lining elements to clamp the main lining elements to the truck bed, it is possible to reduce the number of bolts or other fastening means to mount the lining.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with an embodiment of the on-road truck body lining, the edge lining elements are arranged to extend over and be fixated to the on-road truck body at edge portions thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an embodiment of the on-road truck body lining, edge lining element forms a lining transition between non-parallel main lining elements of said plurality of main lining elements. Edge portions of the truck bed, such as the transition between side wall and bottom wall, are suitable for arranging the edge lining elements since the edge lining element can be designed to cover the transition between e.g. a horizontal bottom wall and a vertical side wall.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an embodiment of the on-road truck body lining, the plurality of main lining elements comprises at least one side lining element which is arranged to extend over a side surface of the on-road truck body. The at least one side lining element has one transition side and wherein the at least one side lining element comprises a mounting means for mounting the side lining element to the on-road truck body and wherein the mounting means are arranged distally to the transition side. This solution has the advantage that only the side being distal to the transition side requires dedicated mounting means for mounting the side lining element to the on-road truck body. Therefore, mounting means on the truck bed are also only required at a corresponding location, whereas the transition side of the side lining element is clamped to the truck bed by the edge lining element.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the plurality of main lining elements comprises at least one bottom lining element arranged to extend over a bottom surface of the on-road truck body, wherein the at least one bottom lining element has two transition sides arranged opposed each other and each comprising an end portion protruding from a respective transition side. This allows for the bottom lining elements to be clamped to the truck bed along both end portions, hence no mounting holes are corresponding fastening means at all are required for the bottom lining elements, neither in the bottom lining elements themselves, nor in the bottom part of the truck bed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the plurality of main lining elements comprises at least one front lining element arranged to extend over a front surface of the on-road truck body, wherein the at least one front lining element has one transition side and wherein the at least one front lining element comprises a mounting means for mounting the at least one front lining element to the on-road truck body, said mounting means being arranged distally to the transition side. Similar to the side lining elements, the front lining element of the present invention reduces the requirements for mounting means, such as bolts and holes for bolts and similar, in the front lining element as such as well as in the truck bed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the one or more end portions are made from the same material as the load facing portion. This allows for an uncomplicated and less cost intensive manufacturing of the lining element in comparison with previously known solutions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the load facing portion comprises an elastomer, such as rubber. This makes it easy to adapt the lining element to truck bodies having different shapes. For example, the end portions will easily accommodate the transition from e.g. a horizontal bottom of the truck bed to a vertical side wall or front wall of the truck bed. Often, this transition is achieved by means of an oblique transition edge in the truck bed, for example along an edge which is inclined at approximately 45 degrees to both the side wall and the bottom wall of the truck bed. Such transition edges are provided to reduce so called carry-back, i.e. the amount of material that sticks to the truck bed also after unloading. It is of big importance to reduce the amount of carry-back since it can greatly reduce the transportation capacity of an on-road truck and it has been found that avoiding straight angles between side and bottom walls is one way of achieving this. It should be noted that an inclination of 45 degrees is merely an example and the inclination may vary considerably between different truck beds and may vary depending on the intended material to be transported. The end portions of the present embodiment will be capable to adapt to basically any inclination of such transition edges or any other shapes of the truck body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, a main lining element has at least one connection side adapted to meet a corresponding connection side of an adjacent main lining element, and wherein a connection side forms an oblique angle with a load-facing front surface of the main lining element such that a main lining element partially extends over an adjacent main lining element located rearward thereof. This has the advantage that during unloading of the truck bed, where the transported material slides over the surface of the lining elements, it can be avoided, or at least to a great extent reduced, that the material will hook into the connection side facing forwardly. The current solution creates an obtuse angle between the load-facing front surface of the main lining element and the upstream, or forward, connection side of the same main lining element. Correspondingly, the present invention will create a pointy angle between the load-facing front surface of the main lining element and the downstream, or rearward, connection side of the same main lining element. If perpendicular angles are chosen, the risk is greater that material sliding over the surface during e.g. unloading will hook into and pry open the joint between adjacent lining elements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, each edge lining element comprises a plurality of mounting holes for mounting the edge lining element to the truck body. By arranging the mounting holes in the edge lining elements, the number of mounting means that need to attach to the truck bed can be greatly reduced. Such mounting means comprises e.g. holes in the truck body for bolt and nut connection or bolts welded to the truck body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, at least a sub-set of the plurality of main lining elements comprises one or more recesses arranged on a back side of the main lining elements facing the on-road truck body, so as to provide a cavity between the on-road truck body and the main lining element. This solution has the advantage that the material of the main lining elements will deflect into the cavity when loaded with material to be transported. Then, during unloading of the material, the main lining elements will snap back, again creating a cavity at the rear side. This has the great advantage that any carry-back built up on the lining element will loosen when the element snaps back and can be unloaded together with the rest of the material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, at least a sub-set of the plurality of edge lining elements comprises one or more recesses arranged on a back side thereof facing the truck body, so as to provide a cavity between the truck body and the edge lining element. Similar to the main lining elements, this will greatly reduce the amount of carry-back sticking to the truck bed along the edge areas.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, stop plates are attached to the truck body such that said stop body protects a rear connection side of a rearmost main lining element and/or edge lining element. It is advantageous to protect the short side of the rearmost lining elements. Often, on-road trucks are provided with cover doors at the rear end of the truck bed to increase load capacity. If rock material or similar is left between the cover door and rearmost lining elements, the lining elements will otherwise be damaged as the door is closed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the mounting means of the at least one side lining element is arranged at an upper section of the at least one side lining element distally to the transition side and protrudes away from a load carrying surface of the side lining element. This solution has the advantage that the side lining element can be suspended from the upper edge of the on-road truck body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, a protruding part of the mounting means of the at least one side lining element is arranged to be welded to an upper edge of the on-road truck body. Welding provides a strong, reliable and cheap connection. Bolting is also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the mounting means comprises at least two parts which can be disassembled. By providing a mounting means that can be disassembled, replacement of a worn-out lining element is simplified. If one part of the mounting means is welded to the truck body, the lining element can be replaced by disassembly of the mounting means, removing one part connected to the load facing portion and leaving the part welded to the truck body.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with an embodiment of the truck body lining, the parts of the mounting means are assembled by means of a threaded connection and wherein the load facing portion is attached to one of the parts by means of a bolt and nut connection. Of course, other fastening means such as plug welding, gluing, Velcro etc. can be applied as well.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a method for installing an on-road truck body lining is provided. The method comprises the steps of positioning at least one bottom lining element on the bottom surface of the on-road truck body; positioning at least one side lining element on the side surfaces of the on-road truck body, mounting said plurality of side lining elements to the on-road truck body; positioning at least one front lining element on a front surface of the on-road truck body, mounting said front lining elements to the on-road truck body; positioning a plurality of edge lining elements along edge portions of the on-road truck body such that the plurality of edge lining elements cover one or more end portions of the at least one side lining, said at least one front lining and the at least one bottom lining, and mounting said plurality of edge lining elements to the on-road truck body, such that the plurality of edge lining elements clamps the at least one side lining element, said at least one front lining element and the at least one bottom lining element to the on-road truck body. This has the advantage in comparison with unlined truck beds that noise and vibrations during e.g. loading is greatly reduced. Further, thanks to the use of edge lining elements clamping the side lining elements, the front lining element and bottom lining element to the on-road truck body, the number of mounting means in lining elements and truck body can be greatly reduced. It should be noted that the order in which the bottom lining elements, front lining element and the side lining elements are positioned on the truck body is irrelevant. Important is that they are positioned prior to the edge lining elements which will clamp the bottom lining element, front lining element and the side lining elements to the truck body.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, a stop plate is attached at or near a rear end of the on-road truck body such that a rear connection side of a rearmost main lining element and/or edge lining element is protected from wear.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the at least one side lining elements is mounted to an upper edge of the on-road truck body by means of a mounting means arranged at an upper section of the at least one side lining element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the mounting means arranged at an upper section of the at least one side lining element protrudes away from a load carrying surface of the side lining element. This solution has the advantage that the side lining element can be suspended from the upper edge of the on-road truck body.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the mounting means is welded or bolted to the upper edge of the on-road truck body. Welding is a strong, reliable and cost effective way of fastening the lining to the truck body. Bolting has the advantage that it can easily be disassembled and reassembled for e.g. replacing the lining.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, attachment means are provided at the on-road truck body and wherein the edge lining elements are attached to the on-road truck body by means of these.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the attachment means comprises bolts which are welded to the on-road truck body having a centre to centre distance corresponding to that of corresponding openings in the edge lining elements. This solution has the advantage that bolts can be provided in advance such that the edge lining elements can simply be put in place and fastened during installation of the lining.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the attachment means comprises a plurality of bolts which are pre-attached to a common fastening plate and having a centre to centre distance corresponding to that of corresponding openings in the edge lining elements, wherein said fastening plate is welded to the on-road truck body. Pre-manufacturing of plates with bolts makes it easy to arrange the bolts with the correct center to center distance. Of course, it is also possible to arrange a single bolt to a single plate and wherein the plate/bolt is attached, by welding, gluing etc., to the truck body with a defined center to center distance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with an embodiment of the method, the bottom lining element is provided in a rolled up state to the on-road truck body and during installation the bottom lining element is rolled out. This provides a solution for time effective installation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, an on-road truck body having an on-road truck body lining in accordance with any of the embodiments of the on-road truck body lining described herein or an on-road truck body having an on-road truck body lining installed in accordance with any of the methods described herein is provided.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other objectives, features and advantages of the present invention will appear from the following detailed disclosure, from the attached claims, as well as from the drawings.

Welding, bolted connection or rivets may be used.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A plurality of edge lining elements <b>40</b> are also provided. These edge lining elements <b>40</b> can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. They are also made from rubber, polyurethane or other suitable polymer or other suitable lining material and may also comprise a reinforcement plate <b>42</b> arranged at the rear side, i.e. the side facing the truck body and may be made from metal or similar. The edge lining elements <b>40</b> comprises transition sides <b>45</b>, substantially extending along the long sides thereof. These transition sides <b>45</b> are adapted to meet and fit with the transition sides <b>15</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> of the bottom lining elements <b>10</b>, side lining elements <b>20</b> and front lining elements <b>30</b>, as the case may be. The transition sides <b>45</b> may have an inclination as required by the shape of the main lining elements and the inclination of the edge portion. The edge lining elements <b>40</b> further comprises one or more mounting holes <b>43</b> for attachment thereof to the truck body by attachment means <b>150</b>, e.g. bolts or rivet nuts. Further, sealing plugs <b>44</b> may be provided to cover the holes <b>43</b> to avoid wear and tear in the holes <b>43</b> during use.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> discloses the attachment means <b>150</b> which may be provided in the form of individual bolts <b>152</b> attached to a fixing plate <b>151</b> which is arranged to be welded <b>155</b> to the surface of the truck body <b>100</b> at centre to centre distance corresponding to that of the holes <b>43</b> of the edge lining elements <b>40</b>. Washer <b>153</b> and nut <b>154</b> is used for fastening the edge lining element <b>40</b> to the truck body. In an alternative embodiment, an elongated fixing plate <b>151</b> is provided onto which a plurality of bolts <b>152</b> are attached with a suitable centre to centre distance. At installation, the plate, which may even have a length corresponding to that of the truck body is arranged atvthe surface of the truck body and attached, e.g. by welding, thereto.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A preferred embodiment of the main and edge lining elements can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. An upstream side lining element <b>20</b> will be shaped at a pointy angle between its downstream connection side <b>27</b> and load facing surface whereas a downstream side lining element <b>20</b> will be shaped at an obtuse angle between its upstream connection side <b>28</b> and load facing surface. The will create an overlap of the upstream side lining element over the downstream side lining element. This has the advantage that as material slide over the load facing surface of the side lining elements during unloading, generally in the direction of the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, it is avoided that material pry the joint between two adjacent side lining elements <b>20</b> open. That would escalate wear of the lining elements and would also create material build-up and increase carry-back issues. Even though this overlapping solution has been described with respect to side lining elements, the same solution can be applied to other lining elements of the invention, e.g. adjacent bottom lining elements and adjacent edge lining elements.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A suggested way of mounting the on-road truck body lining of the present invention will now be described in relation to the figures. First, attachment means <b>150</b> are provided the truck body. These are preferably provided along an edge portion <b>102</b> extending along a transition between bottom wall <b>103</b> and side walls <b>104</b> as well as between bottom wall <b>103</b> and front wall <b>105</b>. Typically, this edge portion <b>102</b> is inclined towards the side walls <b>104</b>, front wall <b>105</b> and bottom wall <b>103</b>. The immediate transitions from bottom wall to edge portion, from side wall to edge portion and front wall to edge portion are provided in a smooth manner having a suitable radius. Any sharp edges will increase the risk of material build up and should be avoided. Then, the front lining element <b>30</b> may be attached to the truck body <b>100</b> by means of e.g. welding or bolts extending by means of mounting means <b>32</b> along an upper edge of the front lining element. No mounting means are provided along the side edges or lower edge of the front lining element <b>30</b>. Next, the bottom lining elements <b>10</b> is arranged on the bottom wall <b>103</b> of the truck body <b>100</b>. It should be noted that no drilling or similar in the bottom wall <b>103</b> is required with the present invention and hence, no bolting of the bottom lining element <b>10</b> is required. When the bottom lining element <b>10</b> has been arranged, the two side lining elements <b>20</b> are arranged along the side walls <b>104</b> of the truck body <b>100</b>. These are attached e.g. by welding or bolting using the mounting means <b>22</b> arranged along an upper edge of the side lining elements <b>20</b>. Front and side lining elements <b>30</b>, <b>20</b> may be hoisted in place using a crane attached to hoisting means <b>127</b> and bottom lining element <b>10</b> can be lifted onto the truck body in a rolled up condition using a fork lift and simply rolled out on the truck body. When this has been done, edge lining elements <b>40</b> are arranged bridging over between bottom lining elements <b>10</b> and side lining elements <b>20</b> as well as between bottom lining elements <b>10</b> and front lining element <b>30</b>. The bottom lining elements <b>10</b>, the side lining elements <b>20</b> and the front lining element <b>30</b> all comprise flange-like end portions <b>13</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>33</b> which extend into edge portion <b>102</b> of the truck body <b>100</b>. As the edge lining elements <b>40</b> are arranged and mounted by means of e.g. attachment means <b>150</b> to the edge portion <b>102</b>, the bottom lining elements <b>10</b>, the side lining elements <b>20</b> and the front lining element <b>30</b> will all be clamped to the truck body <b>100</b>. This solution has a great advantage in that it does not require drilling of individual mounting holes in load facing portion and the truck body for the parts of bottom lining elements <b>10</b>, the side lining elements <b>20</b> and the front lining element <b>30</b> extending into the edge portion <b>102</b>. Instead, it is sufficient to provide one set of attachment means <b>150</b> for the edge lining elements <b>40</b> only. The finished lining can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, where the single line of attachment means in the edge portion <b>102</b> can be seen. Here, stop plates <b>50</b> can also be seen. These are preferably arranged along a down stream connection side of the rearmost side-, bottom- and edge lining elements. They are advantageous in that they protect the lining elements from being damaged when a cover door of the truck body <b>100</b> is closed and there is still material left which will otherwise be pressed towards the lining elements <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, thus increasing wear.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When side or front lining needs to be replaced due, the mounting means <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> provides a major advantage. This since the first and second parts <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>134</b> can be split by opening the connections between the two parts. Thereafter, the load facing portion and the second part <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> can be removed and replaced without having to remove the first part <b>123</b>, <b>133</b> which typically is harder to remove due to welded connection. Removal of the load facing portion <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> is also conceivable but since it is usually made from rubber or similar and have an inherent lack of rigidity it will be easier to handle having a second part <b>123</b>, <b>133</b> attached thereto. It may also be complicated to access the rear side of the load facing portion <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> to remove and replace the nuts of the bolt and nut connection <b>121</b>. Since the openings of the second part <b>123</b>, <b>133</b> has internal threads, this is not a problem using the split mointing means <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> of the invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The skilled person realizes that a number of modifications of the embodiments described herein are possible without departing from the scope of the invention, which is defined in the appended claims. For example, the number and size of individual lining elements; the number of mounting holes; the size of openings in reinforcement plates; and thickness of load facing portions indicated in the drawings are only intended as examples and are in no way limiting. Further, and as mentioned earlier, the order in which the main lining elements are positioned on the truck bed is irrelevant. Important is that bottom, side and front lining elements are positioned prior to the positioning and fastening of the edge lining elements. This since the latter will clamp the main lining elements to the truck bed. Further, the load facing portion of a lining element may comprise a recess on the back side thereof. This recess creates a cavity between the load facing portion and the outer surface of the on-road truck body. When the truck is loaded with material to be transported, such as gravel or similar, the material of the load facing portion will deflect into the recess. Then, as the material is unloaded, the material of the load facing portion will spring or snap back again and resume its original shape. This will cause any material build-up to loosen from the side lining element, thus avoiding the problem of carry-back. This is a problem which greatly reduces the total transportation capacity.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the term on-road truck has been used throughout the application. Other terms are used in the field, such as road truck, infrastructure truck, lorry etc. and these are covered by the invention as well.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
