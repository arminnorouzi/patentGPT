id="p-0003" num="0002">Trailer wheel disc manufacturing typically includes a blanking process, a forming process and a spoking process. The forming process typically requires two separate hits from a hydraulic or mechanical press. Likewise, the spoking process requires the wheel disc to be pierced by a cutting tool for each spoke, one spoke at a time. Thus, an eight-spoke wheel requires eight additional hits by a cutting tool while a ten spoke wheel would require ten additional hits by the cutting tool. Each hit that is performed adds manufacturing time and cost.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application describes a system and method for producing a wheel disc for a trailer in three operations or hits. This is in contrast to standard wheel disc manufacturing processes that typically take upwards of eleven different operations or hits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the present application describes method for manufacturing a wheel disc for a trailer wheel. In an example, the method includes causing performance of a single blanking operation in which a diameter of a wheel disc, a center bore and a plurality of spokes are pierced into a wheel disc blank the same time. Each of the plurality of spokes has a first set of dimensions and the center bore has a first diameter. Upon completion of the blanking operation, an outer flange of the wheel disc blank is secured to a form die. A single forming operation is then performed in which at least a portion of a material of the wheel disc blank moves from the center bore toward the outer flange of the wheel disc blank and through a rib associated with a lug embossment in the formed torque ring. The forming process causes the plurality of spokes to have a second set of dimensions and also causes the center bore to have a second diameter. A single piercing operation is then performed in which a lug hole is formed in the lug embossment. The center bore may also be pierced to its final diameter in the single piercing operation. In an example, the final diameter may be greater than the second diameter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present application also describes a method for manufacturing a wheel disc for a trailer wheel. In an example, this method includes performing a blanking operation in which a center bore and a spoke, along with a shape and/or diameter of the wheel disc is pierced and/or cut to form a wheel disc blank. Upon the completion of the blanking operation, a forming operation causes a material of the wheel disc blank to move from the center bore toward an outer flange of the wheel disc blank through a rib associated with a lug embossment. A lug hole is pierced in each lug embossments in a piercing operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also described is a wheel disc for a trailer. In an example, the wheel disc includes a center hole defined by an inner portion of the wheel disc, a plurality of spokes are pierced around the center bore, and a torque ring is formed around the center bore. In an example, a conical angle of the wheel disc is at least fifteen degrees. Additionally, the center bore and the plurality of spokes are pierced in a single first operation, the conical angle of the wheel disc and the torque ring are formed in a single second operation, and the plurality of lug holes and a center bore are pierced in a single third operation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the present disclosure. Examples may be practiced as methods, systems or devices. Accordingly, examples may take the form of a hardware implementation, an entirely software implementation, or an implementation combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Trailer wheel disc manufacturing is a time-consuming process and typically includes multiple steps. For example, once a wheel disc blank is formed (e.g., using a die and a press) the wheel disc blank is placed on the form die for an initial forming process. During the forming process, a press (e.g., a mechanical press, a punching press, a hydraulic press) typically hits the wheel disc blank at least two different times in order to form the wheel disc blank into its' final conical shape (with torque ring). Once the wheel disc blank has been formed into the conical shape (with torque ring), a spoking process occurs.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">During the spoking process, a conical cutting edge of the press hits or otherwise contacts a first area of the wheel disc to pierce a first spoke. The wheel disc is rotated and the process repeats for the second wheel spoke. This cutting process continues until the desired number of spokes have been cut into the wheel disc. Thus, for an eight-spoke wheel disc, eight different hits are required. For a ten spoke wheel disc, ten different hits are required.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once the spoking process is complete, lug holes and a center bore are pierced in the wheel disc. This process requires the punching press to perform another hit on the wheel disc. Thus, in total, at least twelve different hits (e.g., at least one hit to create the wheel disc blank, two hits for the forming process, eight to ten hits for the spoking process and piercing the center bore and one hit for piercing the lug holes) on the wheel disc are typically required. Each required hit increases manufacturing time, increases the manufacturing costs and increases the wear and tear on the machinery (e.g., cutting tool, die) that is used to form the wheel disc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to address the above, the present application describes a three-hit process for forming a wheel disc for a trailer. Although the examples described herein relate to a wheel disc for a trailer, other implementations are possible.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be explained in greater detail below, the three-hit process includes a single blanking operation in which a press (e.g., a hydraulic press, a punching press, or other cutting/piercing mechanism) causes a wheel disc blank having an outer diameter to be pierced. In addition, during the blanking operation, a center bore and a plurality of spokes or windows are cut, pierced or otherwise formed into the wheel disc blank. The center bore has a first diameter and each of the spokes has a first set of dimensions. Once the center bore and the plurality of spokes have been pierced into the wheel disc blank, a single forming operation is performed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As part of the forming operation, an outer flange of the wheel disc blank is secured to a form die of a press. Because the outer flange of the wheel disc blank is secured to (or formed with) the form die, the metal (or other material(s)) that comprise the wheel disc blank flows from the center bore radially outward toward the outer flange of the wheel disc blank (instead of moving from the outside of the wheel disc blank toward the center of the wheel disc blank as is the case in current forming processes). In addition, a rib is formed adjacent to and/or integrated with a lug embossment that is also formed in the wheel disc blank. The forming process may also cause the plurality of spokes to have a second set of dimensions and may also cause the center bore to have a second diameter due to the flow of material. A single piercing operation is then performed in which a lug hole is pierced in the lug hole emboss. The single piercing operation may also pierce the center bore to a final diameter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other examples will be shown and described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wheel disc blank <b>105</b> for creating wheel disc <b>100</b> according to an example. In an example, the operations described herein may be used for wheel discs having a finished diameter greater than or equal to twelve inches discs made for wheels for 14 inches and above. (e.g. twelve point four inches, fourteen inches) and having a conical angle of fifteen degrees or more.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a center bore <b>120</b> and a plurality of spokes <b>110</b> have been pierced into the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> in single blanking operation. The single blanking operation may also define the outer diameter of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b>. In an example, the outer diameter of the wheel disc blank may be different than a diameter of the conical wheel disc (e.g., the wheel disc shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is shown with eight triangular spokes <b>110</b>, the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> may have any number of spokes in a variety of different shapes. For example, the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> may include ten circular spokes. In an example, the shape of the spokes and/or the number of spokes should not deform the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> to an extent that it is not usable due to material thinning beyond a threshold.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Unlike typical solutions in which individual spokes are added one at a time and after a forming process (e.g., after the wheel disc blank has been formed into a conical shape), the spokes <b>110</b> and the center bore <b>120</b> are pierced into or are otherwise defined by the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> prior to any forming operation. Additionally, each of the spokes <b>110</b> and/or the center bore <b>120</b> may be cut, pierced in the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> in a single operation or process. As discussed above, the diameter of the wheel disc blank may also be defined during this process.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, a substantially planar wheel disc blank <b>105</b> (or a piece of sheet metal or other material) may be mounted to a press (e.g., a hydraulic press, a mechanical press, a punching press) and/or an associated form die (e.g., the press <b>200</b> and associated form die shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Once the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> has been mounted to the press, the press performs a single blanking operation that blanks the outer diameter, the spokes <b>110</b> and/or the center bore <b>120</b> in the wheel disc blank <b>105</b>. Thus, the blanking operation blanks the outer diameter, the center bore <b>120</b> and/or each of the plurality of spokes <b>110</b> simultaneously or substantially simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Because the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is planar or substantially planar, the cutting tool that blanks the outer diameter, the spokes <b>110</b> and/or the center bore <b>120</b> may also be planar or substantially planar. This is in contrast to current solutions in which a conical disc is held at an angle to position a surface of the conical disc is substantially parallel with respect to a cutting too. The cutting tool then pierces the conical disc at that position. Additionally, in current solutions, the cutting die only cuts one spoke into a formed wheel disc at a time. In contrast, the present disclosure enables multiple spokes to be pierced, cut into the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> simultaneously or substantially simultaneously on a flat, or planer surface.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the single punching operation causes the center bore <b>120</b> to have a first shape and/or a first diameter (or other set of dimensions). Likewise, the single punching operation causes each of the spokes <b>110</b> to have a first shape and/or a first set of dimensions. In an example, the shape and/or associated dimensions of the center bore <b>120</b> and/or each of the spokes <b>110</b> is based, at least in part, on a desired shape and/or set of dimensions of the center bore <b>120</b> and/or the spokes <b>110</b> once a forming process (shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) has been completed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the wheel disc <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> after a single forming operation has been performed. In an example, the forming operation may cause a conical angle of wheel disc <b>100</b> to be fifteen degrees or more. When comparing the shape and/or first set of dimensions of the center bore <b>120</b> and/or the spokes <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the center bore <b>120</b> and/or the spokes <b>110</b> have a second diameter and/or a second set of dimensions. The change from the first set of dimensions to the second set of dimensions occurs as part of the single forming operation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, as the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is formed into the wheel disc <b>100</b> (e.g., a wheel disc <b>100</b> having a conical shape such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and a conical angle of fifteen degrees or more), an outer flange <b>150</b> of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is formed to the lower die. Forming the outer flange <b>150</b> of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> to the lower die locks the material between the upper and lower form tools and enables the forming operation to occur in a single hit or operation. As a result of the outer flange <b>150</b> of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> being formed to the die, a material (e.g., metal) from which the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is comprised, forms from the inside out (instead of from the outside in which is standard in current solutions) and locks the material in place such that the material takes the path of least resistance. During this forming operation, the dimensions of the spokes <b>110</b> and/or the center bore may change.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, as the substantially planar wheel disc blank <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is formed to the conical shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the metal of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> flows radially outward (e.g., from the inside of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> toward the conical face <b>160</b> of wheel disc blank <b>105</b>). As a result, a diameter of the center bore <b>120</b> becomes larger when compared with the first diameter of the center bore <b>120</b>. Additionally, the dimensions of the spokes <b>110</b> may change from having a first set of dimensions to a second set of dimensions or may remain relatively unchanged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example, the change in the diameter of the center bore <b>120</b> and/or the spokes <b>110</b> between the blanking operation and the forming operation may be measured or otherwise determined. Thus, if the resulting shape and/or dimensions of the center bore <b>120</b> and/or the spokes <b>110</b> is to be changed, an original shape and/or dimensions of the center bore and/or the spokes may be adjusted in the blanking process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The forming operation, in combination with the metal flowing from the inside out of the wheel disc <b>100</b> also enables the metal to flow over lug forming inserts of the form die to form one or more lug embossments <b>130</b> at or near a torque ring of the wheel disc <b>100</b>. The form die also enables the lug embossments <b>130</b> to be associated with or are otherwise formed with a rib <b>140</b>. The rib <b>140</b> extends from a base of the lug embossments <b>130</b> outward and/or toward the conical face <b>160</b> of the disc wheel <b>100</b>. This rib <b>140</b> assists the flow of metal during the forming operation such that the lug embossment <b>130</b> has sufficient material to prevent cracking. A torque ring embossment <b>170</b> may also be formed or otherwise extend between each of the lug embossments <b>130</b> and/or ribs <b>140</b>. The torque ring embossment <b>170</b> may serve as a stiffening feature for the wheel <b>100</b> and/or strengthen a rigidity of the lug protrusions <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an example, if the outer flange <b>150</b> of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> was not formed up in the form die, the metal of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> would flow from the outside in. As a result, there would not be enough metal to sufficiently flow over and around the die to provide a requisite amount of rigidity and strength for the lug embossments <b>130</b>. However, since the outer flange <b>150</b> of the wheel disc blank <b>105</b> is formed down in the form die, the metal flows radially outward (thereby enlarging the center bore <b>120</b>). Flow of the metal in this manner/direction helps ensure that enough material is present to form the lug embossments <b>130</b> and the torque ring embossment <b>170</b>. Additionally, the rib <b>140</b> of each lug embossments <b>130</b> also assists with the flow.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the wheel disc <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in which lug holes <b>180</b> have been pierced in each lug embossments <b>130</b> according to an example. Once the wheel disc has been formed, a piercing operation is performed in which lug holes <b>180</b> are pierced or cut in wheel disc <b>100</b>. As with the other processes described above, piercing, cutting or otherwise forming the lug holes <b>180</b> in each lug embossments <b>130</b> occurs in a single hit or operation. For example, a press may pierce and coin each lug hole <b>180</b> in each lug embossment <b>130</b> simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. In an example, the piercing operation may also pierce the center bore <b>120</b> such that the center bore <b>120</b> has a final diameter.

In an example, the method <b>300</b> may be used to form wheel discs having a diameter of twelve inches (e.g., twelve point four inches) or more and/or with a conical angle of fifteen degrees or more using a three-hit manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Method <b>300</b> begins when blanking operation pierces, cuts or otherwise defines a center bore, an outer diameter of the wheel disc blank, and/or one or more spokes (<b>310</b>) in a wheel disc blank. In an example, the blanking operation creates a center bore and/or the spokes in a single operation. For example, a press may pierce, cut or otherwise define the center bore and/or the spokes in the wheel disc blank in a single hit or operation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Upon completion of the blanking operation, the wheel disc blank is formed (<b>320</b>) into a conical/dish shape using a single forming operation or hit. In an example and as part of the forming process, an outer flange of the wheel disc blank may be formed or otherwise secured to an outer edge or portion of a form die associated with the press. As a result of this forming, material of the wheel disc blank may stretch and/or flow radially outward and/or around various portions of the form die that form the shape, protrusions (e.g., lug protrusions) and features (e.g., torque ring embossment and/or rib) of the wheel disc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the wheel disc is formed, a piercing operation pierces (<b>330</b>) lug holes in each lug protrusion and may also pierce the center bore. Like the other two operations described above, the lug holes in each lug protrusion and the center bore are pierced in a single hit or operation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The description and illustration of one or more aspects provided in this application are not intended to limit or restrict the scope of the disclosure as claimed in any way.
