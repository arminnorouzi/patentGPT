In each drawing, the same or corresponding components may be denoted by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof may be omitted. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, systems, and components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A substrate processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The substrate processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes a processing part <b>10</b>. The processing part <b>10</b> processes a substrate by supplying a processing liquid to the substrate. In the present embodiment, the processing part <b>10</b> is of a single-wafer type that processes substrates one by one.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The processing part <b>10</b> may be a batch type that processes a plurality of substrates at the same time. The batch type processing part <b>10</b> includes a processing tank, and the substrates are immersed in the processing liquid stored in a processing tank. In this case, the substrates W may be immersed in the processing liquid in a vertically standing state.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the single-wafer type processing part <b>10</b> includes, for example, a processing container <b>11</b>, a holder <b>12</b> configured to hold the substrate W horizontally, a rotation part <b>13</b> configured to rotate the holder <b>12</b> around a vertical rotation shaft <b>14</b>, and a nozzle <b>16</b> configured to eject liquid on the top surface of the substrate W held by holder <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The processing container <b>11</b> accommodates the substrate W therein. The processing container <b>11</b> includes a gate (not illustrated) and a gate valve (not illustrated) configured to open/close the gate. The substrate W is carried into the processing container <b>11</b> through the gate, processed with a processing liquid L inside the processing container <b>11</b>, and then carried out to the exterior of the processing container <b>11</b> through the gate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The holder <b>12</b> horizontally holds the substrate W carried into the processing container <b>11</b>. The holder <b>12</b> holds the substrate W horizontally such that the surface of the substrate W on which a polysilicon film is formed is oriented upward and the center of the substrate W coincides with the rotation center line of the rotation shaft <b>14</b>. The holder <b>12</b> is a mechanical chuck in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but may be a vacuum chuck, an electrostatic chuck, or the like. The holder <b>12</b> may be a rotatable spin chuck.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rotation part <b>13</b> includes, for example, a vertical rotation shaft <b>14</b> and a rotation motor <b>15</b> configured to rotate the rotation shaft <b>14</b>. The rotational driving force of the rotation motor <b>15</b> may be transmitted to the rotation shaft <b>14</b> via a rotation transmission mechanism, such as a timing belt or a gear. When the rotation shaft <b>14</b> is rotated, the holder <b>12</b> is also rotated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The nozzle <b>16</b> includes an ejection port configured to eject the processing liquid L to the substrate W held by the holder <b>12</b>. The nozzle <b>16</b> is disposed above the substrate W such that the ejection port is directed downward, and supplies the processing liquid L to the center of the substrate W. The processing liquid L is supplied to the central portion of the rotating substrate W and wet-spreads over the entire top surface of the substrate W by a centrifugal force to form a liquid film. The processing part <b>10</b> may include a moving part <b>19</b> configured to move the nozzle <b>16</b>.

Thereafter, when the actual value of the replenishment amount R became zero, the proportion of the eluate E in the processing liquid L increased as the circulation time became longer, and the number of particles adhering to the substrate W increased. From these points, it can be seen that by managing the replenishment amount Rat the set value R<b>0</b> or more, the increase of particles due to the circulation of the processing liquid L can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, an example of the processes of the second liquid exchange controller <b>109</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The processing after S<b>401</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is initiated when the second liquid exchange controller <b>109</b> receives a liquid exchange command for exchanging the processing liquid L in circulation. The liquid exchange command is transmitted from, for example, the host computer <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The processing liquid L in circulation is present, for example, the tank <b>20</b>, the circulation line <b>21</b>, the devices (the pump <b>23</b>, the flow meter <b>24</b>, the heater <b>25</b>, the thermometer, and the filter <b>26</b>) provided in the circulation line <b>21</b>, the branch line <b>22</b>, the devices (the flow meter <b>27</b> and the flow controller <b>28</b>) provided in the branch line <b>22</b>, the reflux line <b>30</b>, and the device (the opening/closing valve <b>31</b>) provided in the reflux line <b>30</b>. A ratio of the volume of the processing liquid L in the tank <b>20</b> to the total volume of the processing liquid L in circulation is not particularly limited, but is, for example, 30% to 50%.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">By exchanging the processing liquid L periodically, it is possible to suppress deterioration of the processing liquid L. An inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, is supplied to the upper space of the tank <b>20</b>, but the air may enter. Since the moisture in the air gradually dissolves in the processing liquid L, the processing liquid L is deteriorated. The concentration of moisture of the new processing liquid L may be lower than the concentration of moisture of the processing liquid L stored in the tank <b>20</b>, and may be substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">First, when receiving the liquid exchange command, the second liquid exchange controller <b>109</b> stops the pump <b>23</b> and stops the circulation of the processing liquid L (step S<b>401</b>). By stopping the pump <b>23</b>, it is possible to prevent the pump <b>23</b> from running idle in the process of emptying the tank <b>20</b>. The second liquid exchange controller <b>109</b> may stop the pump <b>23</b> and may also stop the heater <b>25</b>.

Since the circulation of the processing liquid L is stopped, the second liquid exchange controller <b>109</b> reduces the storage amount H by using the first discharge part <b>41</b> rather than the second discharge part <b>42</b>.

The first threshold value H<b>1</b> is used for the determination of the second determination part <b>106</b>. The second determination part <b>106</b> determines whether the storage amount H of the tank <b>20</b> is less than the first threshold value H<b>1</b> during the circulation of the processing liquid L.
