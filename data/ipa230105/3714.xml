id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods of inhibiting the proliferation of a cancer cell, and treating cancer in an individual are provided. Aspects of the subject methods include contacting a cancer cell with an azapodophyllotoxin derivative, where the contacting is effective to inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism to inhibit proliferation of cancer in the cell.

Kidney cancer is also one of the top most prevalent cancer types. However, currently, there is no cure for kidney cancer and only a handful of known cures for specific types of lymphomas (Rossi et al., <i>World Journal of Urology, </i>2018; 36(9):1341-53; and O'Hare et al., <i>Blood, </i>2007; 110(7):2242-9).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microtubules are cytoskeletal protein polymers composed of &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; tubulin heterodimers. They are involved in essential cellular processes such as migration, intracellular transport and mitosis (Wade, <i>Molecular biotechnology, </i>2009; 43(2):177-91; Bates et al., <i>British journal of clinical pharmacology, </i>2017; 83(2):255-68; Jordan et al., <i>Nature reviews Cancer. </i>2004; 4(4):253-65; Checchi et al., <i>Trends in pharmacological sciences, </i>2003; 24(7):361-5). Inhibition of microtubule polymerization leads to disruption of mitotic spindle formation, blocks mitosis and arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, leading to apoptosis. Thus, tubulin is considered as an important target for anticancer drug development. Most of the drugs that inhibit microtubule assembly e.g. paclitaxel (taxane), vinblastine and vincristine (<i>vinca </i>alkaloids) and podophyllotoxin (lignans) are derived from natural products (Negi et al., <i>Bioorganic </i>&#x26; <i>medicinal chemistry, </i>2015; 23(3):373-89; Steinmetz et al., <i>Trends in cell biology, </i>2018; 28(10):776-92; Schiff et al., <i>Nature, </i>1979; 277(5698):665-7). These drugs, despite their significant clinical relevance, possess serious problems in terms of pharmacokinetics, toxicity and resistance, which limits their therapeutic potential(Kavallaris, <i>Nature reviews Cancer, </i>2010; 10(3):194-204; Sparreboom et al., <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, </i>1997; 94(5):2031-5; Bates et al., <i>Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, </i>2004; 10(14):4724-33). Also, due to presence of complex ring systems and multiple chiral centers their structures are very complex which require difficult and laborious synthetic steps. This makes large-scale supply of these compounds challenging and impedes lead optimization process. Thus, there is a great interest in the development of new and structurally simple microtubule-binding anticancer agents that can be synthesized easily to overcome these limitations. Development of libraries of new microtubule-binding anticancer agents would lead to more informative SAR studies and expeditious structure optimization.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods of inhibiting the proliferation of a cancer cell, and treating cancer in an individual are provided. Aspects of the subject methods include contacting a cancer cell with an azapodophyllotoxin derivative, where the contacting is effective to inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism to inhibit proliferation of cancer in the cell. In certain cases, the cancer cell is a renal cancer cell (RCC) or a lymphoma cell. Aspects of the methods include administering to a subject an effective amount of an azapodophyllotoxin derivative to treat the subject for cancer, where the cancer is selected from renal cancer and lymphoma. In certain cases the administering is effective to inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism. Also provided is a method of monitoring tumor regression in an individual. The method of monitoring tumor regression includes assaying, in a sample obtained from the individual during a treatment regime for cancer, changes in tubulin protein levels, wherein a level of tubulin protein that is lower than a pretreatment level of tubulin indicates tumor regression. Also provided are methods of identifying a cancer suppressing compound. Aspects of the methods include contacting a cancer cell with a candidate compound; determining if tubulin protein levels are decreased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound; and determining if monoglycerol levels are increased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound, wherein a decrease in tubulin protein level and an increase in levels of monoglycerols identifies the candidate compound as a cancer suppressing compound. In some cases, the cancer is selected from renal cancer or lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These and other advantages and features of the disclosure will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading the details of the compositions and methods of use, which are more fully described below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

Aspects of the subject methods include contacting a cancer cell with an azapodophyllotoxin derivative, where the contacting is effective to inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism to inhibit proliferation of cancer in the cell. In certain cases, the cancer cell is a renal cancer cell (RCC) or a lymphoma cell. Aspects of the methods include administering to a subject an effective amount of an azapodophyllotoxin derivative to treat the subject for cancer, where the cancer is selected from renal cancer and lymphoma.

The method of monitoring tumor regression includes assaying, in a sample obtained from the individual during a treatment regime for cancer, changes in tubulin protein levels, wherein a level of tubulin protein that is lower than a pretreatment level of tubulin indicates tumor regression. Also provided are methods of identifying a cancer suppressing compound. Aspects of the methods include contacting a cancer cell with a candidate compound; determining if tubulin protein levels are decreased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound; and determining if monoglycerol levels are increased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound, wherein a decrease in tubulin protein level and an increase in levels of monoglycerols identifies the candidate compound as a cancer suppressing compound.

Microtubules are cytoskeletal protein polymers composed of &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; tubulin heterodimers. They are involved in essential cellular processes such as migration, intracellular transport and mitosis (Wade, <i>Molecular biotechnology, </i>2009; 43(2):177-91; Bates et al., <i>British journal of clinical pharmacology, </i>2017; 83(2):255-68; Jordan et al., <i>Nature reviews Cancer. </i>2004; 4(4):253-65; Checchi et al., <i>Trends in pharmacological sciences, </i>2003; 24(7):361-5). Inhibition of tubulin polymerization leads to disruption of mitotic spindle formation, blocks mitosis and arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, leading to apoptosis. Thus, tubulin is considered as an important target for anticancer drug development. Monoglycerol metabolism has also been implicated in cancer, due to the requirement for energy and building blocks of cancer cells.

Presenting symptoms usually include peripheral lymphadenopathy. Compared with Hodgkin lymphoma, there is a greater likelihood of disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis. However, NHL is not one disease but rather a category of lymphocyte malignancies. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types, and they can be formed from either B-cells or T-cells.

The monitoring methods include assaying a sample obtained from an individual during a treatment regime for cancer for changes in tubulin protein levels, where a level of tubulin protein that is lower than a pre-treatment level of tubulin indicates tumor regression.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0232">As both a way of quantifiably comparing the effects of an exemplary azapodophyllotoxin derivative at the protein level, and a way of monitoring changes in the proteomic landscape during treatment, a nano-fluidic proteomic immunoassay (NIA) can be used (Fan et al., <i>Expert opinion on investigational drugs. </i>2013; 22(11):1495-509; and Fan et al., <i>Nature medicine. </i>2009; 15(5):566-71). This therapeutic monitoring technique is a highly sensitive method for measuring protein expression in clinical samples. Herein, NIA is further developed to be able to analyze fine needle aspirates (FNA's) and core biopsies of transplanted xenografts to monitor changes in tubulin protein levels throughout the course of treatment of mice with an exemplary azapodophyllotoxin derivative to determine whether there is a significant quantifiable difference between the treatment group in comparison with the control.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0233">To monitor the effects of exemplary azapodophyllotoxin derivatives on cancer metabolism, ambient ionization mass spectrometry is utilized. Ambient ionization mass spectrometry is a collective term describing all mass spectrometric ionization methods that are capable of ionizing the constituents of natural samples under ambient conditions. In this regard, ambient mass spectrometry (MS) methods are well-suited for studying tissue samples, without having to use any chemical modification, ideally in vivo, giving outstanding significance to these methods in the field of cancer research. The first ambient MS method described was desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), which was implemented by directing a pneumatically assisted solvent electrospray onto the surface of interest. Herein, DESI-MS can be utilized to detect metabolomic changes in the mouse models, and to uncover the mechanism by which exemplary azapodophyllotoxin derivatives disrupt cancer progression metabolically.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Screening Methods</heading><p id="p-0261" num="0234">Aspects of the present disclosure also include assays configured to identify agents that find use in methods of the invention, e.g., as reviewed above. Aspects of the present disclosure include methods for identifying a candidate compound for suppressing cancer. In some instances, the method comprises: contacting a cancer cell with a candidate compound; determining if tubulin protein levels are decreased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound; and determining if monoglycerol levels are increased relative to the cancer cell in the absence of the candidate compound; wherein a decrease in tubulin protein level and an increase in levels of monoglycerols identifies the candidate compound as a cancer suppressing compound. In the subject methods, a decrease in tubulin protein is indicative of inhibition of tubulin polymerization; and an increase in monoglycerol levels is indicative of inhibition of monoglycerol metabolism.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0235">By assessing or determining is meant at least predicting that a given test compound will have a desirable activity, such that further testing of the compound in additional assays, such as animal model and/or clinical assays, is desired.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0236">The candidate agent is selected from: a small molecule, an oligonucleotide, an antibody and a polypeptide. In some instances, the determining step comprises detecting a cellular parameter, wherein a change in the parameter in the cell as compared to in a cell not contacted with candidate agent indicates that the candidate agent specifically inhibits tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism. In certain cases, the tubulin protein levels are determined by a nano-fluidic proteomic immunoassay (NIA). In certain cases, the monoglycerol levels are determined by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). In certain instances, the candidate agent is an azapodophyllotoxin derivative. In some instances the cancer is a renal cancer. In some instances, the cancer is lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0237">Drug screening may be performed using an in vitro model, a genetically altered cell or an animal. One can identify ligands that compete with, modulate or mimic the action of a lead agent. Drug screening identifies agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism. A wide variety of assays may be used for this purpose, including labeled in vitro binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, nano-fluidic proteomic immunoassay, mass spectrometry methods and the like.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0238">The term &#x201c;candidate compound&#x201d; as used herein describes any molecule, e.g., azapodophyllotoxin derivative, other small molecule, oligonucleotide, protein or pharmaceutical, with the capability of inhibit tubulin polymerization and monoglycerol metabolism.

Human and mouse lymphomas were all maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and Antibiotic-Antimycotic. All cell culture reagents used were obtained from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).</p><p id="p-0288" num="0261">In addition, murine renal cell carcinoma E28 cell line was used in this study.

Cell Counting</heading><p id="p-0289" num="0262">A 50 microliter volume of cells was taken from the culture medium and combined with an equal volume of 0.4% Trypan blue stain. Then, 10 microliters of this 1:1 mixture was pipetted onto a slide and placed into a hemocytometer for cell counting. The viable cell count was used for measuring cell proliferation in the sample.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">3. In Vivo Transplantation</heading><p id="p-0290" num="0263">Human T-ALL cell line CCRF was transplanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient NOD-scid gamma mice (NSG), which lack mature B-cells, T-cells and natural killer cells. Prior to transplantation, CCRF was cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, and Antibiotic-Antimycotic. On the day of transplantation, cells were centrifuged at 800 rcf for 5 minutes, the media was aspirated, and cells were resuspended in PBS solution. This was then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (Corning and BD Biosciences) and transplanted to each mouse using 100 microliter injection subcutaneously. The tumor was monitored for growth up until the size of 12-15 mm, which was the size at which treatment would begin. The mice were continuously monitored for tumor size throughout the course of treatment, and euthanized if tumor size ever reached the 20 mm limit as recommended by APLAC guidelines.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">4. Tubulin Polymerization</heading><p id="p-0291" num="0264">The Tubulin Polymerization Assay (EMD Millipore) was used to confer the mechanism of azapodophyllotoxin derivatives. The polymerization reaction was conducted in a 96-well plate. Paclitaxel was used as the non-tubulin-inhibiting negative control, and Nocodazole was used as the tubulin-inhibiting positive control. First, a solution of 99% pure bovine tubulin stock solution in 1&#xd7; polymerization buffer (PB) containing 1 mM GTP was made. Second, a 1:9 mixture of each drug and control with PB-GTP solution was also prepared. In each well, 60 microliters of the first solution (99% tubulin solution in 1&#xd7;PB and 1 mM GTP) was combined with 60 microliters of one of each of the prepared 1:9 drug to PB-GTP solutions. All solutions were prepared on ice prior to combining and placement into the spectrophotometer. Tubulin assembly was measured through turbidity variation (light scattering) in the spectrophotometer every 30 seconds at 350 nm (with shaking in between each reading) over the course of 90 minutes.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">5. Nano-Fluidic Proteomic Immunoassay (NIA) Protocol</heading><p id="p-0292" num="0265">NIA was performed using the ProteinSimple Nanopro 1000 machine. The final protein concentration loaded into each nano-fluidic capillary of the machine was 0.1 ug/uL. The primary antibody for Tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies) was diluted 1:100. The primary antibody for HSP70 (Santa Cruz Biosciences) was diluted 1:500. The secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugates were both diluted 1:100. Chemiluminescence signal was recorded after the addition of the detection reagent, which consists of a 1:1 ratio of luminol and peroxide. Analysis of the chemiluminescence data from NIA was performed via the ProteinSimple Compass software.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">6. FNA and Core Biopsy</heading><p id="p-0293" num="0266">Fine needle aspirations (FNAs) are defined to be biopsies performed via the aspiration of the tumor using a needle of 21 CCs or smaller. Core biopsies are any biopsies done using a needle larger than 21 CCs. Techniques for performing FNAs and core biopsies are similar. The needle tip is plunged into the tumor and retracted, in a fast and repetitive motion, while applying suction at the needle tip. This essentially utilizes the sharp sides of the needle tip to scrape off pieces of the tumor upon plunging the tip in, and during retraction, suction is used to draw the free pieces into the needle to be collected as specimens for analysis. This can be done at any time during the course of treatment, but was typically done at the midpoint of treatment, or before the tumors became too large and the mouse had to be euthanized.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">7. DESI-MSI</heading><p id="p-0294" num="0267">DESI-MSI functions by directing a pneumatically assisted solvent electrospray onto the surface of interest (Takats, Wiseman, Gologan, &#x26; Cooks, 2004). The electrosprayed solvent droplets dissolve certain chemical constituents off the surface investigated and also induce the formation of secondary charged-droplets that take off from the surface. These secondary droplets already contain constituents of the sample and produce molecular ions of the analytes upon evaporation in the atmospheric pressure interface of the mass spectrometer. This way, electrospray-like mass spectrometric information is obtained on the sample, featuring multiply charged ions and solvent adducts among other electrospray-specific spectral features.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 1: Compound Synthesis</heading><p id="p-0295" num="0268">Compounds may be prepared using any convenient method.

At 140 nM, NSC750212 causes two-fold suppression of proliferation when compared to 70 nM, and any higher concentration (280 nM) shows no further efficacy. NSC756089 was least sensitive of all four compounds.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0276">To further expand the structure activity relationship (SAR), six additional AZP derivatives were synthesized: AR-02, AR-03, AR-038, AR-051, AR-061 and AR-065, with different substituents on the C-4 phenyl ring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Having validated that exemplary AZP compounds show efficacy in our murine-derived RCC line, it was sought to determine if this finding could be relevant in human RCC line, A498. Exemplary compound NSC750212 and newly synthesized analogues were tested in A498 cell line (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Upon testing at 70 nM, it was found that two compounds with no substitution on the C-4 phenyl ring, AR-02 and AR-03 show worse efficacy (30% reduction in viability) as opposed to NSC750212 (95% suppression). Compounds AR-061 and AR-065 show roughly 83% and 80% reduction in viability, respectively, which bring their potency closer to that of NSC750212. The most potent of the newly synthesized compounds are AR-038 and AR-051, both have single bromine substitution on the C-4 phenyl ring, with 90% and 87% suppression, respectively.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0277">Activity of exemplary compounds against lymphomas was also investigated. It was observed that NSC750212 also shows dose-dependent suppression of proliferation in various human lymphoma lines of CCRF (T lymphoblast), DND-41 (child T lymphoblastic leukemia), and KOPT-K1 (human T-ALL), as well as in MYC-driven lymphoma lines (P4393, and 6780) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates proliferative responses of various human lymphoma lines, from left to right: CCRF, DND-41, KOPR, and MYC-driven lymphoma lines P493 and 6780, at doses of 70 nM, 140 nM, and 280 nM vs a control (DMSO). At the 70 nM dose, CCRF and 6780 show an almost 90% reduction in proliferation, while DND-41 shows close to 95% reduction. KOPT and P-493 still show a significant but much less suppression, at roughly 85%. At 140 nM, CCRF and 6780 show an increase in suppression at roughly 92% and 94%, respectively. DND-41 shows no dose response, possibly due to 70 nM being the maximally effective dose in this cell line. KOPT shows a slight increase to roughly 87% suppression, whereas P-493 shows a larger increase to over 90% reduction in proliferation. Finally, at the 280 nM concentration, 6780 shows maximal suppression, and CCRF and P-493 show a continued increase in suppression to about 96% and 98%, respectively. KOPT has also increased to roughly 89% reduction of proliferation. Overall, NSC750212 demonstrates a dose-dependent response in CCRF, KOPT, P-493, and 6780, while reaching maximal dose in DND-41 at 70 nM.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 3: AZP Derivative NSC750212 Causes RCC and Lymphoma Regression In Vivo</heading><p id="p-0308" num="0278">Having found the in vitro validation of NSC750212 efficacy in both lymphoma and RCC lines, it was sought to investigate if NSC750212 can impede cancer progression in vivo.

Using EMD Millipore Tubulin Polymerization Assay, NSC750212 was compared to a negative control, Paclitaxel, and a positive control, Nocodazole, to determine whether its mechanism is via the inhibition of tubulin polymerization. From this, our results indicate that NSC750212 can work through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, such that it is more efficacious than Nocodazole in preventing depolymerization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel A).</p><p id="p-0310" num="0280">To investigate if this mechanism is consistent in vivo, we used the Nano ImmunoAssay to analyze core biopsies and fine needle aspirates (FNA) of tumors during the course of treatment with NSC750212.

These results are shown and seem to concur with previous results comparing tubulin levels in control and NSC750212 treated mice. Tumors treated with NSC750212 showed a decrease in tubulin up to termination of treatment. NSC750212 treated tumors showed lowered levels of tubulin expression in both the FNA and the core biopsy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel B) by at least two-fold. Size blot depiction of NIA also shows dramatic reduction of tubulin levels in NSC750212 treated group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel C). There are no other charged isoforms of tubulin detected by NIA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel D). This further indicates that NSC750212 could work via the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in human lymphoma CCRF Xenografts.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0281">Though we expected a complete depletion of metabolism upon tubulin inhibition by NSC750212, our DESI-MSI analyses uncover a more interesting mechanism. RCC treated with NSC750212 shows elevated levels of monoglycerols compared to untreated RCC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Monoglycerol metabolism has been implicated in cancer, due to the high need of cancer cells of energy and building blocks. The inhibition of monoglycerols have been shown to impede tumor growth. This metabolic effect of NSC750212 is surprising, and may explain why NSC750212 functions superior to that of conventional tubulin inhibitors. As described herein, DESI-MSI is a valuable tool for use in uncovering the mechanism of action of exemplary azapodophyllotoxin derivatives.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">DISCUSSION</heading><p id="p-0312" num="0282">Natural products have been a major source of pharmaceutical development due to their intrinsic biological relevance and often been referred as privileged structures that are likely to possess multiple biological activities. However, their complex structure and difficult synthesis impedes the hit-to-lead generation process of natural product-based drugs. One such example is podophyllotoxin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, compound 1), which is a potent but highly toxic tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Herein a single step multi-component reaction (MCR) was used to synthesize structurally simple aza-analogues of podophyllotoxin referred here as AZP derivatives or azapodophyllotoxin derivatives. The screening of exemplary AZP derivatives showed high efficacy in murine and human RCC cell lines E28 and A498, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). SAR analysis suggest that compounds with unsubstituted phenyl ring were least active (AR-02 and AR-03) and the ones with tri-methoxy substitution on C-4 phenyl ring were most active (NSC750212). Compounds with halogenated substitution at C-4 phenyl ring also showed promising activity (AR-038 and AR-051). Compound NSC750212 also showed dose dependent inhibition in human lymphoma lines CCRF, DND-41, KOPT and MYC-driven lymphoma lines P493, and 6780 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0313" num="0283">The disclosure herein also demonstrates the importance of development of technologies to be able to assess drug mechanism of action as well as monitoring its therapeutic response using both NIA and DESI-MSI. NIA has been previously used to be able to detect the tissue origin of certain cancers, as well as the driving oncogene of the cancer from very small amount of sampling (Negi et al., <i>Bioorganic </i>&#x26; <i>medicinal chemistry, </i>2015; 23(3):373-89; Steinmetz et al., <i>Trends in cell biology, </i>2018; 28(10):776-92; Schiff et al. <i>Nature, </i>1979; 277(5698):665-7). Here NIA has been further developed to be able to make those measurements from preclinical studies to allow time course measurements of tumors in vivo. Moreover, this method can then be used to monitor therapeutic response of a certain drug by measuring key biomarkers to assess the novel drug's potency not only at the study's endpoint. In addition to the mechanism of NSC750212 as a tubulin disruptor, DESI-MSI has uncovered that NSC750212 can also act to inhibit monoglycerol metabolism. The dual mode of action of NSC750212 provides a potential explanation as to the high potency of NSC750212.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0284">Overall the above results demonstrate that the modification of natural compounds that are accompanied by nanoproteomic methods have been instrumental in developing lead compounds, such as NSC750212, a new tubulin and monoglycerol metabolic inhibitor for the treatment of cancers, such as RCC and lymphomas.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0285">Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0286">Accordingly, the preceding merely illustrates the principles of the invention.
