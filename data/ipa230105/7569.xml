In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Use of the term &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;near,&#x201d; &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and/or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; should be understood to mean including close to a target (e.g., design, value, amount), such as within a margin of any suitable or contemplatable error (e.g., within 0.1% of a target, within 1% of a target, within 5% of a target, within 10% of a target, within 25% of a target, and so on).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In wireless (e.g., cellular) communication, user equipment (e.g., a cell phone, a smartphone, a tablet, a wearable device, a laptop, and so on) may communicate on a channel of a frequency band (e.g., the n77 or 3.7 gigahertz (GHz) frequency band) with a network (e.g., a wireless communication network) through one or more communication nodes (e.g., base stations). In particular, according to the current Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, when establishing communication with the network via base station, the user equipment may detect network coverage (e.g., at a cell supported by the base station) and receive system information including a frequency of a channel from the base station. If the user equipment supports the frequency, the user equipment indicates as such to the base station, the network may allocate the channel to the user equipment, noting that the user equipment supports a frequency band (e.g., the n77 band) that includes the frequency of the channel. When performing a handover event (e.g., transferring network coverage of the user equipment from the base station to another base station) or requesting a secondary cell for carrier aggregation, the base station may indicate (e.g., to the other base station or the network) that the user equipment supports the frequency band based on the user equipment indicating that it supports the frequency of the channel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, if the frequency band is updated (e.g., to include additional or remove a frequency subrange), and the user equipment is not updated in kind, then communication with the user equipment may become less efficient or fail altogether. For example, the 3GPP currently restricts United States (U.S.) operation of the n77 band to the range of 3.7-3.98 gigahertz (GHz). Thus, user equipment may communicate using the n77 band if it complies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules governing the 3.7-3.98 GHz range. In particular, user equipment may be tested to confirm compliance with the FCC rules related to operate the 3.7-3.98 GHz range. However, if the 3GPP updates the n77 band to allow an additional range of frequencies, such as the 3.5 GHz subrange (e.g., 3.45-3.55 GHz) in the U.S., at least at the time of that update, currently operating user equipment may not comply with the newly added 3.5 GHz band, as the user equipment may not have been tested, and thus not comply, with the 3.5 GHz subrange.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While this may not cause a problem when the user equipment is initially connecting to the network, because the base station may indicate (e.g., to another base station or the network) that the user equipment supports the n77 band&#x2014;and not the subrange of the n77 band that the user equipment complies with (e.g., 3.7-3.98 GHz)&#x2014;to perform a handover event or request a secondary cell for carrier aggregation, the other base station may allocate a channel or the base station may allocate the secondary cell in the 3.5 GHz band for which the user equipment is not compliant. Accordingly, the handover event may fail, in which the user equipment may disconnect from the network, or the secondary cell may not be used by the user equipment, in which the user equipment may not be able to use the full bandwidth allocated to it for communication.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The presently disclosed embodiments enable the user equipment to indicate supported ranges of frequencies to the base station. In particular, when the base station sends system information to the user equipment based on the user equipment detecting network coverage provided by the base station, the system information may include one or more network signaling values indicative of one or more frequency ranges supported by the base station. For example, the one or more network signaling values may include the original 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency subrange of the n77 band, as well as the newly added 3.45-3.55 GHz frequency subrange of the n77 band. The user equipment may respond to the base station by indicating, using one or more modified maximum power reduction (MPR) behavior bits, which of the one or more frequency ranges are supported by the user equipment. For example, the user equipment may indicate that it supports the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency subrange, but not the 3.45-3.55 GHz frequency subrange. Accordingly, when performing a handover event or requesting a secondary cell for carrier aggregation, the other base station may allocate a channel or the base station may allocate the secondary cell in a frequency range supported by the user equipment. That is, in the above example, the other base station may allocate a channel or the base station may allocate the secondary cell in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency subrange.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, frequency bands may be updated (e.g., by the 3GPP) such that transmission and/or reception specification or requirements may change. For example, the n77 band includes the 3.45-3.55 GHz frequency subrange (the &#x201c;3.5 GHz subrange&#x201d;), which initially was used by federal incumbent users and was protected by the FCC by blocking any non-federal communications from occurring on the frequency subrange. The FCC further protected the 3.5 GHz subrange blocking any non-federal communications from occurring on the neighboring subrange of 3.55-3.7 GHz frequency subrange, also known as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, if the non-federal communications occurred in the same coverage area as those of the federal users. Moreover, if the non-federal communications occurred in a different coverage area as those of the federal users, then the FCC enforced a power backoff of user equipment on the CBRS band (referred to herein as a &#x201c;CBRS power backoff&#x201d;) that is greater or &#x201c;stricter&#x201d; than a power backoff of the user equipment when not using the CBRS band. This was implemented by setting a network signaling value in a system information block sent from a base station to the user equipment per the 3GPP standard.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, the FCC recently allowed non-federal networks and users to use the 3.5 GHz subrange in coverage areas where federal users are not using the subrange. That is, the non-federal networks may be deployed using the 3.5 GHz subrange in coverage areas where there are no federal users utilizing the 3.5 GHz subrange. Accordingly, in the case where user equipment is using the CBRS band, and the user equipment is not located in or adjacent to a coverage area where there are federal users using the 3.5 GHz subrange, then the user equipment may not operate to its full communication potential or efficiency, as the FCC regulations may force it to operate with a greater power backoff (e.g., under the assumption that there are only federal users in the 3.5 GHz subrange).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The presently disclosed embodiments enable a Spectrum Access System (SAS) controller that allocates spectrum resources in the CBRS band to determine, using Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) sensors, whether there are non-federal networks in coverage areas. For a coverage area that has non-federal networks (and thus may not have federal users) and are adjacent to coverage areas that have non-federal networks, the SAS controller may cause base stations in the coverage area to indicate (e.g., disable a network signaling value corresponding to the CBRS power backoff) to user equipment that it may operate using use the CBRS band with a default power backoff (e.g., less than the CBRS power backoff). In this manner, user equipment using the CBRS band may operate to its full communication potential or efficiency.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, a frequency band may have different regional regulatory specifications or requirements for the same or overlapping frequency subranges in the frequency band. For example, in the newly allocated 6 GHz frequency band, Korea has a low power indoor (LPI) regulatory specification in the 6.425-7.125 GHz subrange, while Brazil has a LPI and very low port (VLP) regulatory specification in the overlapping 5.925-7.125 GHz subrange. Networks may indicate this regulatory specification to user equipment in system information sent by a base station (e.g., via network signaling values). Upon receiving this indication, the user equipment may configure its transceiver to operate using the regulatory specification. However, the 3GPP has only allocated eight network signaling values, and the number of permutations of geographical regions and their regulatory specifications may be much greater than eight. As such, the eight network signaling values may be insufficient to provide the proper regional regulatory specification to the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some of the presently disclosed embodiments enable expanding the number of network signaling values beyond eight to accommodate for the full number of possible regulatory specifications for each geographical region. In additional or alternative embodiments, the eight network signaling values may correspond to regional regulatory specifications of the region that the user equipment and/or the base stations is located. As such, the user equipment may determine its location (e.g., as determined using a location sensor of the user equipment) or the location of the base station (e.g., as received from the base station, and so on), and determine the regulatory specification based on the network signaling value and the location of the user equipment. In this manner, the user equipment may configure its transceiver to operate using the appropriate regulatory specification.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device <b>10</b>.

In particular, the n77 band includes a subrange <b>52</b> between 3.55 GHz and 3.65 GHz (also referred to as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band), a subrange <b>54</b> between 3.45 GHz and 3.55 GHz (also referred to as the 3.5 GHz subrange), and a subrange <b>56</b> between 3.7 GHz and 3.98 GHz (also referred to as the C-band), among others.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the United States (U.S.), the FCC recently released new rules for the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> within the n77 band to allow for utilization of the subrange <b>54</b> in network communication, while current radio frequency requirements from the 3GPP restrict usage of the subrange <b>54</b> and limit the U.S. to the C-band <b>56</b>. As such, while user equipment that is currently in use have been tested for compliance with the FCC rules with respect to the C-band <b>56</b>, these user equipment may not been tested for compliance with the new FCC rules for the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>, and thus are not permitted to use the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. A potential change of the 3GPP specification to permit usage of the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> in the n77 band for U.S. operation may lead to two different types of user equipment that support the n77 band in the U.S., those which also support the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> (e.g., because such user equipment has been tested for compliance with the new FCC rules for the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>), and those that do not support the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. Because a network enabling communication on the n77 band may only assume that user equipment is operable on an entire frequency band (e.g., the n77 band) and not respective subranges of the frequency band (e.g., the C-band <b>56</b> vs. the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>), the network not be able to distinguish between these two types of user equipment and would only realize that the user equipment does not support 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> when performing a handover event (e.g., transferring network coverage of the user equipment from one base station to another base station) or requesting a secondary cell for carrier aggregation fails.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of a network <b>60</b> (e.g., a wireless communication network), according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the frequency band may include one or more frequency subranges (e.g. the CBRS band <b>52</b>, the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>, the C-band <b>56</b>, and so on).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, the base station <b>64</b> may broadcast a message on one or more supported frequency ranges or channels (e.g. in the n77 band) that are available to establish the connection to the user equipment <b>62</b> in the coverage area or cell <b>66</b>. If the user equipment <b>62</b> also supports the one or more supported frequency ranges or channels (e.g., in the C-band <b>56</b> of the n77 band), then the user equipment <b>62</b> may respond, and the base station <b>64</b> may establish the connection to the user equipment <b>62</b> using a channel of the one or more supported frequency ranges or channels. As illustrated, the base station <b>64</b> may establish the connection to the user equipment <b>62</b> using a channel in the C-band <b>56</b>. However, if the base station <b>64</b> is not aware of the subranges supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>, and only associates the channel that the user equipment <b>62</b> operates on with the entire frequency band (e.g., the n77 band), then the base station <b>64</b> may perform a handover event or request a secondary cell for carrier aggregation based on the entire frequency band, instead of the subrange supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>. If the user equipment <b>62</b> only supports the subrange (e.g., the C-band <b>56</b>) of the frequency band (e.g., the n77 band) and not another subrange (e.g., the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>) of the frequency band, then, if the handover event is performed or the secondary cell is implemented using the other subrange that is not supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>, the handover event or the implementation of the secondary cell may fail. In such cases, the user equipment <b>62</b> may disconnect from the network <b>60</b>, or the secondary cell may not be used by the user equipment <b>62</b>, in which the user equipment <b>62</b> may not be able to use the full bandwidth allocated to it for communication.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The presently disclosed embodiments include enabling the base station <b>64</b> to send a system information block to the user equipment <b>62</b> having one or more network signaling (NS) flags/values to communicate the frequency subranges supported by the base station <b>64</b>.

The user equipment <b>62</b> specification may define additional requirements which become applicable based on the NS flags. The user equipment <b>62</b> may establish communication with the base station <b>64</b> if the user equipment <b>62</b> supports the frequency band and the applicable NS flags.

In the example network <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the base station <b>64</b>A may support both the C-band <b>56</b> and the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>.

In particular, the user equipment <b>62</b> may utilize one or more modified maximum power reduction (MPR) behavior bits to indicate the frequency subranges supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>. The 3GPP specification provides that the MPR bits may specify an allowed decrease in maximum power transmitted by the user equipment <b>62</b> to enable the user equipment <b>62</b> to fulfill regional regulatory requirements (e.g., transmitter adjacent channel leakage ratio requirements). The 3GPP specification also provides that the modified MPR behavior bits may distinguish applicability of different A-MPR (Additional MPR) requirements for different types of user equipment <b>62</b> in particular frequency bands (e.g., n257 n260, and n261). In the disclosure embodiments, the user equipment <b>62</b> may set the modified MPR behavior bits corresponding to a frequency subrange (e.g., the C-band <b>56</b>, the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>, and so on) that the user equipment <b>62</b> supports to indicate to the base station <b>64</b> that the user equipment <b>62</b> supports the frequency subrange. In this manner, the base station <b>64</b> may be aware of and/or store the frequency subrange(s) supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>, and perform a handover event or allocate a secondary cell based on the supported frequency subrange, instead of the entire frequency band (e.g., the n77 band), which may not be supported by the user equipment <b>62</b> in whole, thus preventing disconnection from the network <b>60</b> or a drop in bandwidth usage.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the example network <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the user equipment <b>62</b> may receive the system information block from the base station <b>64</b>A indicating that the base station <b>64</b>A supports both the C-band <b>56</b> and the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>. However, the user equipment <b>62</b> may only support the C-band <b>56</b>. As such, the user equipment <b>62</b> may set modified MPR behavior bits corresponding to the C-band <b>56</b>, but not the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>, and send the modified MPR behavior bits (e.g., in a message) to the base station <b>64</b>A. Upon receipt of the modified MPR behavior bits, the base station <b>64</b>A may establish a primary cell <b>68</b> with the user equipment <b>62</b> on the supported C-band <b>56</b>. If the network <b>60</b> desires to perform carrier aggregation by establishing a secondary cell, the base station <b>64</b>A may not establish a secondary cell <b>70</b> using the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>, as the user equipment <b>62</b> has indicated that it does not support the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b>.

At block <b>94</b>, the user equipment <b>62</b> synchronizes to the base station <b>64</b> by aligning its timing with the timing alignment information of the base station <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>96</b>, the base station <b>64</b> broadcasts system information indicative of frequency subranges supported by the base station <b>64</b>. In particular, the base station <b>64</b> may indicate the frequency subranges in the NS flags that are used to indicate the capabilities of the base station <b>64</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the base station <b>64</b> may indicate the C-band <b>56</b> and the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b> in one or more NS flags of the broadcasted system information.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>98</b>, the user equipment <b>62</b> reads the system information, including the NS flags, received from the base station <b>64</b>.

In some embodiments, the user equipment <b>62</b> may store the system information in the memory <b>14</b> for future usage.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>100</b>, the user equipment <b>62</b> determines or receives the frequency subranges supported by the base station <b>64</b> from the system information block. By way of example, the one or more NS flags may include the C-band <b>56</b> and the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b> of the n77 band. At block <b>102</b>, the user equipment <b>62</b> indicates the frequency subranges supported by the base station <b>64</b> that are also supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>. In particular, the user equipment <b>62</b> may set one or more indicator bits corresponding to one or more frequency subranges that are supported by the user equipment <b>62</b>. In some embodiments, the indicator bits may include modified MPR behavior bits.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the NS flags for the n77 band may include a new NS flag (&#x201c;NS_X&#x201d;) corresponding to the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. For the new NS flag, the value for the A-MPR may be set to 0 decibels (thus rendering the NS flag irrelevant for purposes of MPR operation). A modified MPR behavior bit corresponding to the new NS flag may be defined, such that setting the modified MPR behavior bit indicates that the user equipment <b>62</b> supports the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. If the user equipment <b>62</b> does not set the modified MPR behavior bit, then the user equipment <b>62</b> is indicating that it does not support the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, the modified MPR behavior bit may correspond directly to 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. That is the 3GPP may define the modified MPR behavior bit to correspond directly to the n77 band, such that if the user equipment <b>62</b> sets the modified MPR behavior bit, then it implies that the user equipment <b>62</b> supports the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>. If the user equipment <b>62</b> does not set the modified MPR behavior bit, then it implies that the user equipment <b>62</b> does not support the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> (e.g. the user equipment <b>62</b> only supports the 3.7-3.98 GHz subrange). In such embodiments, the user equipment <b>62</b> may not receive a corresponding NS flag and/or setting the A-MPR to 0 decibels to indicate support for the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b> may be avoided. While this embodiment refers to the 3.5 GHz subrange <b>54</b>, it should be understood that any suitable frequency subrange of a frequency band, and particularly newly introduced subranges to existing frequency bands, are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>104</b>, the base station <b>64</b> configures its resources to the user equipment <b>62</b> within the frequency subranges supported by the user equipment <b>62</b> and the base station <b>64</b>. Once the resources are configured and a connection is established between the user equipment <b>62</b> and the base station <b>64</b>, the user equipment <b>62</b> and the base station <b>64</b> may send and receive user data <b>106</b> over the frequency subrange. In this manner, the method <b>90</b> may enable the user equipment to configure the transceiver <b>30</b> to conform to one or more applicable subrange of frequencies and communicate with a terrestrial network (e.g., including the base station <b>64</b> and/or the base station <b>64</b>B).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As discussed above, modifications and/or updates to the standards or regulations regarding non-federal networks and frequency bands may lead to inefficiencies. Initially, the 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b> was utilized by federal incumbent users. The 3.5 GHz band <b>54</b> is situated adjacent to the CBRS band <b>52</b> (3.55-3.7 GHz). To avoid interfering with the federal users, stricter requirements were introduced for the CBRS band <b>52</b> by the FCC. In particular, the FCC currently enforces a power backoff of the user equipment <b>62</b> using the CBRS band <b>52</b> (the &#x201c;CBRS power backoff&#x201d;) that is greater or &#x201c;stricter&#x201d; than a power backoff of the user equipment <b>62</b> when not using the CBRS band <b>52</b> (a &#x201c;default power backoff&#x201d;). The 3GPP has defined the power backoff as a maximum power by which the user equipment <b>62</b> is to back off (e.g., when approaching a power threshold, to meet out-of-band emission levels, and so on), while an actual power backoff value may be smaller and/or may depend on an implementation of the user equipment <b>62</b>. The CBRS power backoff may be referred to as a lower power mode, while the default power backoff may be referred to as a default power mode. Moreover, while the lower power mode refers to a greater power backoff than the default power backoff, it should be understood that the lower power mode, in other applications, may refer to any suitable power characteristics that cause the user equipment <b>62</b> to operate at less power than the default power mode, include decreased transmission power, decreased reception power, less maximum transmission power, less maximum reception power, and so on.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Table 1 below, provided by 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 38.101-1, illustrates different CBRS power backoff values (e.g., depending on, there are different cases A1-A8) that may be applied by the user equipment <b>62</b>. The numbers below are described in decibels (dB) as an amount of power that the user equipment <b>62</b> may backoff to meet regulatory requirements.

In some cases, these subranges corresponding to different regulatory requirements in different countries may overlap.
