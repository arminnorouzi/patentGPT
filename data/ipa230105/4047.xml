by reference in its entirety as part of the present application.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a direct-type backlight liquid crystal display device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Display device is divided into a light emitting display device with self-luminous properties and a non-light emitting display device including an additional light source. For example, the non-light emitting display device may include a liquid crystal display (LCD) device. The liquid crystal display device mainly uses a liquid crystal display panel to display. Because the liquid crystal display panel itself does not emit light, it is needed to provide a light source with sufficient brightness and uniform light distribution as a backlight component, so that the liquid crystal display panel can normally display images. In addition, after the liquid crystal display panel is combined with the backlight component, it is usually covered by an outer frame to protect the combination of the liquid crystal display panel and the backlight component.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The backlight component includes at least one of a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL), an external cathode fluorescent lamp (EEFL) and a light emitting diode (LED) as the light source. LED is widely used because of its advantages of small size, low power consumption and high reliability. Backlight component can be divided into two types according to their different structures, including: a side-type light backlight component and a direct-type (or a flat-type) backlight component. In the side-type light backlight component, the light source is arranged on a lateral side of the backlight component, and a light guide plate is used to enhance the control of a propagation direction of the light. However, because the propagation direction of the light is not easy to control, the display effect is usually poor when the side-type light backlight component is adopted. In contrast, the design of the direct-type backlight component places lamp tubes as the light source directly below the backlight component. Because the installation space of the backlight component becomes larger, more than two lamp tubes can be used to increase the intensity of the light source, which is more suitable for general liquid crystal display devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a direct-type backlight liquid crystal display device, which includes: a frame, including a main frame and a bottom plate, the main frame is connected with the bottom plate at an end face of the bottom plate;
