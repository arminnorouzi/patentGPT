image recording apparatus, a sheet may be clogged at least one of the inner conveyance path and the outer conveyance path. In the present specification, clogging of a sheet in the conveyance path is also referred to as a jam. In order to eliminate the sheet clogging, it is conceivable to provide a configuration that the inner conveyance path can be opened in conjunction with the opening of the outer conveyance path. However, in this configuration, even when the sheet is jammed in only the outer conveyance path, the inner conveyance path is also opened. Thus, the upper print engine stops the operation even though the image recording operation can be performed. That is, the operating rate of the image recording apparatus decreases.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the image recording apparatus, it is conceivable to provide a roller pair on the outer conveyance path in order to stably convey the sheet in the upper print engine. Further, in order to eliminate clogging (that is, a jam) of the sheet in the inner conveyance path, it is conceivable to provide an inner cover that opens the inner conveyance path. However, depending on the arrangement of the roller pair and the inner cover, it becomes difficult to open the inner conveyance path. That is, depending on the arrangement of the conveyance roller provided on one of the two conveyance paths and the cover provided on the other, it becomes difficult to open the other conveyance path.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In view of the foregoing, an aspect of an objective of this disclosure is to provide an image recording apparatus configured to suppress a decrease of the operating rate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another aspect of an objective of this disclosure is to provide an image recording apparatus in which a conveyance path is easily opened.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings as appropriate. In the following description, a vertical direction <b>7</b> is defined based on the installation state (the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>2</b>B</figref>) in which a printer <b>100</b> is usable, a front-rear direction <b>8</b> is defined with front surfaces <b>201</b>L and <b>201</b>R as the front side, and a left-right direction <b>9</b> is defined when the printer <b>100</b> is viewed from the front surfaces <b>201</b>L and <b>201</b>R side. The vertical direction <b>7</b>, the front-rear direction <b>8</b> and the left-right direction <b>9</b> are perpendicular to each other. In the following description, the direction from the start point to the end point of an arrow is expressed as an orientation, and the line connecting the start point and the end point of the arrow is expressed as the direction.
