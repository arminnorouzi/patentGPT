The double C-profile provides the hole pattern for all variants. All concepts are at least weight neutral compared to the currently use configurations. This is true in particular, if the C-profiles are made from CFRP. Further opportunity for weight reduction is identified by adding a plate for better load introduction from profile to plate and then from plate to cross beams. The double shell concept with its two plates leads to a stiff box design. Selected CFRP material cost may be compensated by higher automatization, reduced part count and non-recurring cost (NRC) (customization), fast ramp up and rate flexibility.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the disclosure herein are described in more detail making reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of an aircraft.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of an aft section.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a floor structure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a variant of the floor structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a mounting rail.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a head-on view of the mounting rail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an aircraft <b>10</b>.
