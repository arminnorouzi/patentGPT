While cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents continue to be the mainstay of cancer treatment, in recent years a variety of different immunotherapies have been developed for treating cancer. Many of these immunotherapies hold a significant promise to be able to reduce the burden of cancer disease, and in some cases treat cancers previously unresponsive to conventional treatments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of immunotherapies include therapies using monoclonal antibodies targeting specific molecules on cancer cells, cancer treatment vaccines and T-cell therapies. Immunotherapies using immune checkpoint inhibitors have also been recently developed which target specific regulators of the immune system that dampen the immune response to an immunological stimulus, and which some cancers use to protect themselves from an immunological response. Unfortunately, the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is generally limited to certain types of cancers and even for cancers that are responsive, such as melanoma, the long-term survival rates are still relatively low.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has also been recognised that targeting co-stimulatory receptors with co-agonist antibodies provides another route to treating some cancers. These immune agonists provide co-activating signals to immune cells, inducing immune cell infiltration into previously poorly infiltrated tumours, activating direct anti-tumour immunity, and increasing sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to enhancing anti-tumour immunity, immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune agonists also activate the immune system more broadly, leading to a range of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with them. Indeed, more than 80% of patients treated with an ICI will suffer from an adverse event.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of immune agonists, clinical trials of these agents have been hampered by serious immunotoxicity, ranging from dose-limiting toxicity that impairs their efficacy, to serious immune-mediated side effects in some patients (&#x2dc;15-30%) including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), liver damage, and even death. Further whilst clinical trials are currently being undertaken in an attempt to mitigate such side effects, many of these strategies are expected to come at the expense of anti-tumour efficacy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need to reduce the side effects associated with therapy using immune agonist antibodies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates to methods and products for reducing side effects associated with immunotherapy using immune agonist antibodies.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of reducing one or more side effects associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody in a subject suffering from a cancer, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby reducing the one or more side effects associated with the immunotherapy in the subject.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of reducing one or more side effects associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody alone, or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a subject suffering from a cancer, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby reducing the one or more side effects associated with the immunotherapy in the subject.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of reducing toxicity associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody in a subject suffering from a cancer, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby reducing the toxicity in the subject associated with the immunotherapy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of reducing one or more side effects associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody alone, or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a subject suffering from a cancer, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby reducing the one or more side effects associated with the immunotherapy in the subject.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of preventing and/or treating one or more side effects associated with treatment of a subject with an immune agonist antibody, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota of the subject prior to, concurrently with, and/or following treatment with the immune agonist antibody.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of increasing the dose of an immune agonist antibody able to be administered to a subject for immunotherapy by reducing one or more side effects associated with the administration of the immune agonist antibody, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby increasing the dose of the immune agonist antibody able to be administered to the subject.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of reducing one or more side effects associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody in a subject suffering from a cancer without substantially affecting efficacy of the immunotherapy, the method comprising modifying the gut microbiota in the subject and thereby reducing the one or more side effects associated with the immunotherapy in the subject without substantially affecting the efficacy of the immunotherapy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide use of bacteria capable of modulating the toxicity of an immune agonist antibody in the preparation of a medicament for treating toxicity in a subject associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide use of an agent capable of modifying the gut microbiota in the preparation of a medicament for reducing one or more side effects associated with immunotherapy using an immune agonist antibody.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method of treating a subject suffering from a cancer with an immune agonist antibody, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">treating the subject with the immune agonist antibody;

A major obstacle to their clinical translation, however, is dose-limiting toxicity and in a substantial proportion of patients, serious immune-mediated side effects including high grade and sometimes fatal liver damage, cytokine release and colitis. We found that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in mediating the immunotoxicity induced by the IAAs, anti-CD40 and anti-CD137. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice had significantly reduced IAA-induced cytokine release and were protected from organ damage induced by these therapies. Importantly, there was minimal impact on IAA anti-tumor efficacy, alone or in combination with the ICI, anti-PD1. Our results suggest microbiota-targeted therapies as a new approach to overcome the toxicity associated with IAAs.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0193">Introduction</p><p id="p-0177" num="0194">The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) against PD1/PDL1 and CTLA4 have revolutionized the treatment of cancer. ICIs can induce long-term, potentially curative, responses in some patients, particularly those suffering from advanced melanoma. Unfortunately, these outstanding results are only observed in a relatively small portion of patients and their activity is limited mostly to tumors types with a strong immune infiltrate. A recent study found that while 40% of all oncology patients in the USA are eligible for ICI therapy, less than 13% will respond to treatment. To improve response rates, approaches which combine ICIs with other immunotherapies, such as immune agonist antibodies (IAAs), are currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Unlike ICIs which block T cell suppressive pathways, IAAs target immune co-activating/co-stimulatory receptors such as CD40, CD137, CD28, CD27, GITR or OX40, which are expressed on a range of different myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. IAA binding to these receptors provides activating signals that induce a range of downstream cellular processes including enhanced immune cell proliferation, survival, antigen presentation and cytotoxicity. IAAs are therefore attractive cancer immunotherapies as they induce both direct anti-tumor immune responses and increase immune cell infiltration into tumors, boosting the efficacy of ICIs. Correspondingly, there are 70 recruiting or upcoming phase I-III clinical trials evaluating IAAs, predominantly in combination with other therapies such as ICIs (clinicaltrials.gov).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0195">As the co-activating receptors targeted by IAAs are critical modulators of immune function, IAAs also activate the immune system more broadly, leading to a range of undesirable immune-related adverse events in patients. Clinical trials of IAAs have been hampered by immunotoxicity, ranging from dose-limiting toxicities, to serious (grade 3 or higher) immune-mediated side effects in some patients (&#x2dc;15-30%) including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), liver damage, and even death. For example, clinical trials of several different CD40 agonists (ChiLob7/4, CP-870,893) have identified dose-limiting toxicity due to CRS and grade 3-4 hematological and liver toxicities. Trials of another IAA targeting CD137 (urelumab), were halted due to severe dose-dependent liver toxicity, while anti-CD28 was used in a catastrophic Phase I trial where every patient required long-term hospitalization due to severe CRS. Several strategies are now being trialed to manage the toxicity of IAAs including limiting the dose, co-administering immunosuppressive corticosteroids, or administering immune agonists locally to tumors. However, many of these strategies could come at the expense of anti-tumor efficacy by non-specifically dampening immune responses to therapy.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0196">As the liver is a common site of IAA toxicity, we hypothesized that the gut microbiota could play a critical role in mediating immunotoxicity induced by IAAs, particularly in the liver. Here, we report that antibiotic treated or germ-free mice were protected against the liver damage and cytokine release syndrome induced by treatment with the IAAs, anti-CD40 or anti-CD137. Importantly, antibiotic treatment had only a minor effect on the anti-tumor efficacy of IAAs, alone or in combination with the ICI, anti-PD1. Our data provides strong rationale to investigate if the composition of the microbiota can predict patients at risk of high grade immune agonist induced immunotoxicity and suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could substantially reduce the immunotoxicity associated with IAAs, overcoming a critical roadblock to their clinical application.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0197">Results</p><p id="p-0181" num="0198">Antibiotic Treatment Reduces the Immunotoxcity of Anti-CD40 without Reducing its Anti-Tumor Efficacy.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0199">Immune-mediated liver toxicity indicated by elevated liver enzymes in serum is one of the most common severe (&#x2265;grade 3) side effects observed with anti-CD40 treatment. Approximately 75% of the liver's blood supply is provided by the hepatic portal vein, which first passes through the gastrointestinal tract and carries a constant supply of bacterial products from the gut microbiota. We hypothesized that the liver toxicity and systemic cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with anti-CD40 could be modulated by signals from the gut microbiota. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of antibiotic treatment (ABX) on responses to the IAA, anti-CD40, in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Mice were treated via their drinking water with ampicillin and neomycin, starting &#x2dc;2 weeks prior to tumor inoculation and continuing for the duration of the experiment. These antibiotics have a broad spectrum of activity and reduced fecal bacterial load by &#x2dc;4 log-fold. In normally colonized specific and opportunistic pathogen free (SOPF) mice, treatment with anti-CD40 induced a rapid onset cytokine storm and liver damage that peaked 24 hours post therapy initiation. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver damage was significantly elevated following anti-CD40 treatment and was almost completely inhibited in ABX-treated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). ABX-treated mice also had significantly reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL6 and TNF&#x3b1;, in serum following anti-CD40 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C-D</figref>). Anti-CD40 treatment also induced elevated IFN&#x3b3; levels in serum, a key lymphocyte effector cytokine that is important for anti-tumor responses, which was not reduced by ABX treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). Histological analysis of livers collected 24 hours after anti-CD40 treatment revealed large areas, some wedge-shaped, of hepatocellular necrosis of varying size, with no discernible zonal pattern. A few necrotic areas were associated with thrombi in portal blood vessels, particularly portal veins, and all were dramatically reduced by ABX treatment, confirmed when livers were scored against published standards (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F-G</figref>).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0200">We also assessed whether antibiotic treatment reduced anti-CD40-induced tissue damage in other organs. We observed that anti-CD40 treated mice were reluctant to produce stool during monitoring 24 hours after treatment, suggesting that anti-CD40 could induce gastro-intestinal inflammation as has been reported clinically. Histological analysis of no ABX+ anti-CD40 treated colons identified numerous enterocyte-derived apoptotic bodies, particularly in the germinative (stem cell) region in the basal area of the glands and an observed increase in lymphocytes in the lamina propria, with intraepithelial T-cells were markedly increased in areas of substantial colonic injury. There was sometimes abundant mucus extrusion from goblet cells into the lumen and, in some segments, enterocytes were hyperplastic. While similar lesions were observed in ABX+anti-CD40 treated colons, they were much less severe and reduced in distribution within the colon. To quantitate damage to the colon, we assessed fecal lipocalin-2 levels in stool samples as a marker of intestinal inflammation Anti-CD40 treated mice had significantly elevated levels of lipocalin-2 in their stool samples and this was almost completely inhibited by ABX treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>). Histological analysis of lung or skin sections indicated that anti-CD40 did not significantly increase immune infiltration or damage in these organs.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0201">To investigate whether ABX treatment altered the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CD40 against established transplanted subcutaneous tumors, we inoculated mice treated with or without antibiotics with the MC38 colorectal cancer cell line or the AT-3 triple negative breast cancer cell line. Tumors were allowed to establish until &#x2dc;40-50 mm<sup>2 </sup>in size, before treatment with anti-CD40 and/or anti-PD1 was initiated. Critically, we found that ABX treatment had no impact on the efficacy of anti-CD40 in suppressing MC38 tumor growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Due to their ability to prime potent anti-tumor immune responses, IAAs are being actively investigated in combination with other anti-cancer therapies. In particular, there is significant pre-clinical evidence that IAAs strongly synergize with ICIs, which was also reported in results from early phase I clinical trials. As the efficacy of ICIs, such as anti-PD1, has been shown to be strongly reduced by ABX exposure, we evaluated the impact of ABX on the efficacy of anti-CD40/anti-PD1 combination therapy against the anti-PD1-insensitive AT-3 tumors. As expected, anti-PD1 was completely ineffective at suppressing AT-3 tumor growth alone. Treating mice with a single dose of anti-CD40 was sufficient to sensitize AT-3 tumors to anti-PD1 and tumor growth was potently suppressed by the anti-CD40/anti-PD1 combination therapy. Furthermore, the efficacy of anti-CD40/anti-PD1 combination therapy was not altered by ABX treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>J</figref>).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0202">In the experiments described above, mice were administered ABX prior to tumor inoculation, meaning that they were exposed to ABX for &#x2dc;3 weeks before anti-CD40 treatment. We next investigated whether a shorter course of ABX, starting only 3 or 7 days before the first anti-CD40 treatment was sufficient reduce immunotoxicity. Again, we observed that mice treated with ABX starting 3 or 7 days before anti-CD40 treatment had significantly reduced ALT levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Serum TNF&#x3b1; was only significantly reduced following 7 days ABX treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Anti-CD40-induced serum IL6 was significantly reduced in mice treated with ABX 3 or 7 days before anti-CD40 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). As we previously observed, IFN&#x3b3; levels in serum were not altered by antibiotic treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). ABX starting 3 or 7 days before anti-CD40 treatment also had no impact on the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CD40 against MC38 tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>).

Successful colonization of GF mice by FMT was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples collected 3 weeks after the first FMT, which demonstrated that the microbiota of GF+FMT mice had a similar composition and diversity to that of SOPF mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).

Anti-CD40 liver toxicity is driven by myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, while CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells are critical for anti-CD137 induced liver damage. These data suggested that the gut microbiota could modulate the liver damage induced by IAA treatment by altering immune cell infiltration and/or activation. To investigate this, we used flow cytometry to assess immune cell populations in livers collected 24 hours after the first anti-CD40 treatment (i.e. when anti-CD40-induced serum ALT was at its peak). Anti-CD40 treatment induced a rapid influx of immune cells into the liver, increasing the total CD45.2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> population in the liver by &#x2dc;50%. ABX treatment did not significantly alter the anti-CD40-induced infiltration of CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>cells into the liver, however, ABX treatment almost completely blocked the infiltration of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (macrophages and monocytes) into the liver following anti-CD40 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A-B</figref>).

These data are consistent with reports that CD137 ligation causes activation of induced cell death in NK cells. Taken together, these data indicate that antibiotic treatment reduces the liver immunotoxicity induced by anti-CD40 and anti-CD137 by blocking signals from the microbiota that are required for pathogenic immune cell infiltration into the liver following IAA treatment.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0211">Antibiotic Treatment Significantly Alters Anti-CD40 Induced Changes in Liver Gene Expression</p><p id="p-0195" num="0212">To further assess how antibiotic treatment modulates responses to anti-CD40 in the liver, gene expression in the livers of untreated and anti-CD40 treated mice (with and without antibiotic treatment) was profiled using RNA-Seq. A total of 1.18 billion reads were sequenced (mean 59 million single-end, 100-bp reads per sample). Multidimensional scaling analysis of the gene expression data revealed that the primary sources of variation in the data were driven by anti-CD40 treatment, followed by antibiotic treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Treatment with anti-CD40 profoundly altered gene expression in the liver, significantly changing the expression of more than 1,500 genes at least 2-fold (FDR&#x3c;0.05), in comparison to PBS treated control mice. Pathway analysis revealed that anti-CD40 treatment induced dramatic changes in the expression of a broad array of immune and metabolic pathways (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B-C</figref>) More specifically, anti-CD40 treatment led to a significant up-regulation of genes involved the immune and inflammatory responses including neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil and leukocyte chemotaxis, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cellular response to interferon-gamma, cellular response to interferon-beta, TNF signaling and TLR signaling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). Consistent with the well-established links between dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver inflammation and damage, anti-CD40 treatment led to a significant down-regulation of genes involved in metabolism including lipid/fatty acid metabolism, steroid &#x26; cholesterol metabolism, amino acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0213">Concomitantly treating anti-CD40 treated mice with antibiotics significantly altered the expression of more than 500 genes compared to mice treated with anti-CD40 alone.

Genes involved in chemotaxis that were down-regulated in ABX+anti-CD40 mice included Ccl3, Ccl4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>, G-F) (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1&#x3b1; and MIP-1&#x3b2;, respectively) and Ccr1 (encodes the receptor for MIP-1&#x3b1;), providing a plausible explanation for the significantly reduced infiltration of macrophages/monocytes observed in the livers of ABX mice following anti-CD40 treatment. MIP-1&#x3b1; and MIP-1&#x3b1; can also activate neutrophils and induce the synthesis of TNF&#x3b1; and IL6. Other key immune genes that were downregulated in ABX mice included Tlr4 and Il1&#x3b2;, as well as a host of other inflammatory response genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>, H-I).

We hypothesized that the effects of the gut microbiota on anti-CD40 induced immunotoxicity could be mediated via microbial signals sensed by these pathways. This hypothesis was supported by liver RNAseq data that revealed that anti-CD40 treatment induced the up-regulation of genes involved in TLR and NLR pathways, many of which were dampened by antibiotic treatment. We therefore evaluated anti-CD40 induced toxicity in Myd88<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> (an essential adaptor protein downstream of many TLRs), Tlr4<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> and Nod2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice.

Secondary bile acids are metabolized from primary bile acids by bacteria in the gut microbiota and can modulate the activity of NKT-cells and macrophages in the liver. RNAseq analysis also indicated that both anti-CD40 and antibiotic treatment led to significant alterations to the expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism in the liver. To investigate this further, we quantified primary and secondary bile acids in the livers of anti-CD40 or control (PBS) treated SOPF, antibiotic treated, and germ-free (GF) mice, using targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Secondary bile acids (&#x3c9;MCA, TDCA and T&#x3c9;MCA) were severely depleted in the livers of GF mice. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) Consistent with previous reports, we also observed that the primary bile acid, T&#x3b2;MCA, was significantly increased in GF mice. Administering an FMT from normally colonized SOPF mice to GF mice led to significant increases in the levels of secondary bile acids and a corresponding reduction in T&#x3b2;MXA levels in the liver. We observed a similar, although weaker effect on bile acids in SOPF mice treated with antibiotics. Interestingly, the secondary bile acid, TDCA, was significantly decreased following anti-CD40 in both GF+FMT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) and SOPF mice, suggesting that anti-CD40 treatment may be impacting the gut bacteria that produce TDCA</p><p id="p-0201" num="0218">To further examines the potential associations between bile acid metabolism and anti-CD40 induced toxicity in the liver, we performed a network-based correlation analysis, representing the statistically significant (P&#x3c;0.05) pairwise correlations between the levels of primary and secondary bile acids in the liver, the frequency of various immune cell populations in liver, and serum ALT and cytokine levels (which were all assessed in the same mice and were thus directly comparable). There were strong correlations between multiple different immune cell populations in the liver (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, cDCs and T-cells) and serum cytokine (TNF&#x3b1;, IL6, IFN&#x3b3;) and ALT levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B-C</figref>), suggesting that the CRS and liver damage induced by anti-CD40 is dependent on an anti-CD40 induced pathogenic immune cell infiltration into the liver. Clearly this immune cell infiltration is dependent on the gut microbiota as it is substantially reduced in antibiotic treated and GF mice and can be stored by FMT to GF mice. Interestingly, specific bile acids, such as T&#x3b2;MCA and TUDCA, were negatively correlated with the proportion of pathogenic immune cell populations (neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages) and with serum ALT</p><p id="p-0202" num="0219">To investigate whether there was a causative relationship between bile acid levels and anti-CD40 induced liver damage and CRS, we depleted bile acids in mice by feeding them a 2% cholestyramine diet to sequester bile acids in the GI tract. As anticipated, cholestyramine had a global impact on liver bile acids, significantly reducing both primary and secondary bile acids. Depletion of liver bile acids with cholestyramine, however, did not reduce the liver damage induced by anti-CD40 as measured by serum ALT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>). Interestingly, the CRS induced by anti-CD40 was partially dependent on bile acid metabolism, as mice fed the cholestyramine diet had significantly reduced anti-CD40 induced levels of IL6 but not TNF&#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E-F</figref>) and significantly increased levels of IFN&#x3b3; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>). Given that anti-CD40 induced ALT levels were not significantly reduced in these mice, but IL6 levels were, these data also suggest that anti-CD40 induced liver damage is not mediated by IL6, but could be mediated by anti-CD40 induced TNF&#x3b1;, which was not suppressed in mice fed the cholestyramine diet.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0220">Liver Damage Induced by Anti-CD40 is Driven by Macrophages, that Amplify Immune Inflammation Leading to Neutrophil Degranulation Through the Secretion of TNF&#x3b1;</p><p id="p-0204" num="0221">Given that macrophages are potent producers of TNF&#x3b1; and that both anti-CD40 induced macrophage infiltration into the liver and TNF&#x3b1; production are significantly reduced in antibiotic treated and GF mice, we hypothesized that the gut microbiota modulates the immunotoxicity induced by anti-CD40 by amplifying the macrophage response to anti-CD40 ligation, leading them to produce pathogenic levels of TNF&#x3b1;. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the toxicity of anti-CD40 in mice depleted of macrophages by i.v. injection of clodronate liposomes 1 day prior to anti-CD40 administration Mice injected with clodronate loaded liposomes had &#x2dc;70% fewer liver macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>&#x2212;</sup>F4/80<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) compared to mice injected with control, PBS loaded liposomes. Correspondingly, mice depleted of their macrophages had significantly reduced levels of anti-CD40 induced TNF&#x3b1; and ALT in serum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>), indicating that these mice were protected against anti-CD40 liver damage in a TNF&#x3b1; dependent manner. Confirming this, mice treated with an anti-TNF&#x3b1; blocking antibody, but an anti-IL1&#x3b2; one, prior to anti-CD40 treatment, had completely abrogated anti-CD40 induced serum ALT levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Interestingly, blocking TNF&#x3b1; did not alter anti-CD40 induced infiltration of macrophages or monocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>), rather it prevented their activation, almost completely blocking their upregulation of CD80 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>) and CD86. A similar effect on conventional dendritic cells was also observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> E-F).

These data demonstrate that anti-CD40 induces IL6 in a manner that is dependent on the gut microbiota, MyD88, and bile acid metabolism in the liver. Anti-CD40 induced liver damage is, on the other hand, mediated via TNF&#x3b1; and a pathogenic activation of macrophages into the liver, both of which are in turn dependent on co-activating signals from the gut microbiota.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0222">Antibiotics can Significantly Reduce Liver Immune Inflammation Induced by Anti-OX40</p><p id="p-0206" num="0223">A recent study evaluating the IAA anti-OX40 reported that OX40 was highly expressed on liver Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, and treatment with anti-OX40 initiated pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death) of liver NKT cells, inducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL1&#x3b2; and IL18 causing damage to the liver Another recent study demonstrated that antibiotic (ABX) treatment increased liver NKT numbers and function by modulating the secretion of secondary bile acids from gut bacteria.

To assess whether &#x3b1;OX40 could induce liver toxicity, formalin fixed sections of liver tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E) and were histologically scored for inflammation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>). Liver sections were scored based on portal inflammation (inflammation around the blood vessels), lobular inflammation (inflammation residing away from blood vessels and around hepatocytes) and necrosis (regions of hepatocyte death indicated by discoloration and lack of cell nuclei). The highest cumulative score is 9 with each type of inflammation contributing a maximum of 3 points. There was a significant increase in portal and lobular inflammation in the livers of anti-OX40 treated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>), but there was a lack of any visible necrotic regions and the histological score was modest indicating mild inflammation. Interestingly, we observed that ABX treatment significantly reduced the mild liver inflammation induced by &#x3b1;OX40 treatment.

Mice treated with antibiotics, or GF mice lacking a microbiota were protected from the liver damage, colitis and CRS induced by anti-CD40 and anti-CD137. In contrast to what has been observed with ICTs, we found that the gut microbiota had little impact on the anti-tumor efficacy of IAAs. These data demonstrate that, antibiotics, or other more targeted methods to inhibit the signals from the gut microbiota responsible, will improve the clinical safety of IAAs.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0227">We found that the gut microbiota impact on IAAs toxicity was mediated via the alteration of liver immune populations, with GF and ABX treated mice having reduced levels of anti-CD40 driven infiltration and activation of macrophages and cDCs. We have also demonstrated macrophages are causative for the liver damage induced by anti-CD40 Interestingly, we also demonstrated that the gut microbiota modulates anti-CD137 driven macrophages/monocytes and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration into the liver. We have also demonstrated the dependence of TNF, but not IL1&#x3b2; in the immunotoxicity of anti-CD40. Several recent studies also demonstrated TNF&#x3b1; blockade, but not IL6 also reduces the liver damage and colitis induced by anti-CD40. These studies are also supportive of our findings that IL6 is not required for anti-CD40 induced liver damage. However, we did identify that inhibiting bile acids or MyD88 signaling, both prominent pathways modulated by the gut microbiota, reduced IL6 secretion in response to anti-CD40. IL6 is a critical cytokine mediating the organ damage in a number of inflammatory conditions including sepsis, graft versus host disease and CRS induced by other immunotherapies such as blinatumomab or CAR-T cells. Therefore, there is potentially an important role of the gut microbiota signaling through bile acids and MyD88 in these conditions. In addition to the importance of TNF&#x3b1;, IL12 has recently been shown to be a critical cytokine in the immunotoxicity induced by anti-CD40. However, its ability to induce IL12 is critical for the anti-tumor activity of anti-CD40, particularly in combination with anti-PD1. We did not find IL12p40 secretion following anti-CD40 to be reduced by the gut microbiota (data not shown), nor an effect of ABX on the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CD40, suggesting the microbiota effect on anti-CD40 toxicity to be independent of IL12.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0228">While we have demonstrated the gut microbiota has a causative role in the immunotoxicity of anti-CD40 or anti-CD137, the pathways or species responsible for the full spectrum of toxicity remains to be determined. Mice deficient in MyD88 had a reduced anti-CD40 induced cytokine storm, with inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x3b1; and IL6 significantly reduced. However, despite demonstrating anti-CD40 toxicity is dependent on TNF&#x3b1;, liver damage and immune infiltration was similar between wildtype and Myd88<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, suggesting additional cytokines, or potentially TNF&#x3b1; production in liver macrophages may be the critical determinant in the toxicity of anti-CD40. There is also the possibility that the liver toxicity of anti-CD40 is dependent on signaling through both MyD88 and an additional pathway(s), supported by a recent study that found that triple deficiency in PRR adaptor molecules, MyD88, TRIF and CARDIF was required prevent the effect of the microbiota on priming DC activity. We also found MyD88 was not required for anti-CD40 anti-tumor activity. Other potential microbiota pathways contributing to the toxicity of IAAs may include short chain fatty acids, such as propionate, butyrate and acetate have been shown to modulate many different immune functions, including macrophage activation. Identification of the pathways/microbiota products responsible for increasing IAA toxicity will allow more targeted interventions, such as small molecule inhibitors of key bacterial genes or targeted antibiotics to deplete detrimental bacteria. Finally, there is the potential that some microbiota signals/species may dampen the toxicity of TAAs, allowing a probiotic approach to balance signals that increase IAA toxicity, with those that reduce their toxicity.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0229">The outcome of this study has immense clinical relevance as there are approximately 20 different IAAs targeting 8 different co-activating receptors currently in phase I-III clinical trials, several of which induce serious dose limiting toxicities. Understanding and characterizing the role or the gut microbiota in IAA toxicity development may prove a useful prognostic tool to identify patients at greater risk of serious side effects. Indeed, the development of severe irAEs by IAAs is not universal, with serious grade 3 or above side effects observed in &#x2dc;30% anti-CD40, and &#x2dc;20-60% of anti-CD137 treated patients dependent on dose used. Patient microbiota sequencing prior to treatment with IAAs to determine associations with increased liver damage, CRS and colitis will be of great interest to confirm the translatability of our findings. Additionally, blocking the microbiota pathways responsible for increasing the toxicity of TAAs via antibiotics or more targeted approaches may make them safer for use in patients, potentially allowing higher more effective doses to be used. For example, urelumab is considered the most potent anti-CD137 agonist in clinical development, however phase I-II trials were halted due to high rates of dose dependent liver toxicity, resulting in several deaths. Clinical trials using an approximately 3-30 times lower dose of 8 mg/patient, alone or in combination with anti-PD1 have reported overall disappointing results. If we could control the liver toxicity of urelumab by targeting the gut microbiota, patients could potentially be safely treated with higher, more effective doses, improving responses to therapy. This is also highly relevant to several anti-CD40 IAAs, with dose limiting toxicities identified in early clinical trials meaning most subsequent studies have utilised CD40 IAAs at lower doses. Apart from an anti-CD28 IAA which induced severe CRS in all patients tested, other IAAs currently in clinical development; anti-CD27, anti-ICOS, anti-GITR and anti-OX40 have not reported dose limiting toxicities in clinical trials to date. However, this does not mean that they will not induce toxicity in patients, as ICIs targeting PD1/L1 and CTLA4 also do not have dose limiting toxicities, however, induce a range of immune related adverse events (irAEs), generally of low grade that were not evident until they entered more widespread clinical use. Therefore, determining the impact of the microbiota on additional clinically advanced IAAs is warranted, both clinically and in pre-clinical models. Therapies that induce weaker irAEs, such as ICIs, are often difficult to identify in wildtype mice. Further IAA pre-clinical testing may benefit from use of mouse models that enhance irAEs development, such as mice transiently depleted of T-regs, mice with a humanized immune system, or mice pre-disposed to develop autoimmunity, such as non-obese diabetic mice. Finally, as we have demonstrated that the microbiota modulates liver damage induced by IAAs by preventing immune infiltration/activation, it may also modulate the liver damage induced by other therapies such as ICIs. While uncommon when used as monotherapies, severe grade 3 and above liver damage occurs in &#x2dc;20% of anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 combination treated patients.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0230">The path to clinical translation of IAAs has been hampered by a number of roadblocks including their induction of severe toxicity, less than ideal efficacy as a monotherapy and competition from ICIs, which have received far more attention from researchers and biotech companies over the last decade. However, with second generation ICIs demonstrating activity in similar tumor types to those already targeted by existing anti-PD1/L1/CTLA4 inhibitors, there is a chance they will not be any more effective than anti-PD1 in tumors that are not robustly infiltrated by immune cells. This will lead to a major gap in treatment options for numerous immunologically cold tumors, however due to their potent systemic activity, IAAs are ideal therapies to drive tumor immune infiltration. Because of this activity, research into IAAs is experiencing a resurgence of interest over the last few years. Results from high-profile clinical trials testing anti-CD40 and anti-PD1 combination therapies in pancreatic cancers insensitive to almost all cancer treatments are due shorty and are eagerly awaited. The progression of the IAA, anti-ICOS, to phase 3 clinical trials and expansion of IAA testing into 70 clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) also underscores this resurgence of interest. Despite these advances, the toxicity associated with IAAs remains a concern. This study has demonstrated that the gut microbiota is a critical mediator of the toxicity of IAAs. These novel data raise the prospect of several new clinical interventions including approaches targeting signals from the microbiota to reduce toxicity and to enhance increase the dose of IAAs that can be safely administered. It may be also possible to use data on a patient's microbiota to predict risk of IAA-induced toxicity. Further investigation to identify which microbiota species and host pathways are driving the immunotoxicity of IAAs, as well as clinical studies to determine the translatability of these exciting results are strongly warranted.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0231">Experimental Model and Subject Details</p><p id="p-0215" num="0232">Mice: Specific and Opportunistic Pathogen Free (SOPF) C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained under standardized conditions with regulated temperature, humidity and daylight at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI).
