Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (Prior Art), a conventional food waste disposer <b>10</b> is often mounted to a sink, such as a kitchen sink (not shown), and includes a food conveying section <b>12</b>, a motor section <b>14</b>, and a grinding section <b>16</b> disposed between the food conveying section and the motor section. The food waste disposer <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>18</b> that contains the food conveying section <b>12</b>, the motor section <b>14</b>, and the grinding section <b>16</b>. The food conveying section <b>12</b> includes an inlet <b>20</b> for receiving food waste and water. The food conveying section <b>12</b> conveys the food waste to the grinding section <b>16</b>, and the motor section <b>14</b> includes a motor imparting rotational movement to a shaft to operate the grinding section.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The grinding section <b>16</b> includes a grinding mechanism that accomplishes the comminution and is typically composed of a rotating shredder plate and a stationary grind ring.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (prior Art), one example of a known grinding section <b>16</b> is shown. The illustrated grinding mechanism <b>22</b> includes a grinding plate <b>24</b> with swivel lugs <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> and a stationary grind ring <b>28</b>. The grinding plate <b>24</b> is mounted to the shaft <b>30</b>. The stationary grind ring <b>28</b>, which includes a plurality of notches <b>32</b> defining spaced teeth <b>34</b>, is fixedly attached to an internal wall <b>44</b> of a housing <b>36</b>. In the operation of a food waste disposer having the grinding mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the food waste delivered by the food conveying section to the grinding mechanism <b>22</b> is forced by the swivel lugs <b>26</b> and <b>38</b> against the teeth <b>34</b> of the stationary grind ring <b>28</b>. The edges of the teeth <b>34</b> grind the food waste into particulate matter sufficiently small to pass from above the grinding plate <b>24</b> to below the grinding plate <b>24</b> via gaps between the rotating and stationary members. Due to gravity, the particulate matter that passes through the gaps between the teeth <b>34</b> drops onto the upper end frame <b>40</b> and, along with water injected into the disposer, is discharged through a discharge outlet <b>42</b>. Size control is primarily achieved through controlling the size of the gap through which the food particles must pass.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current household food waste disposers tend to have a grinding section that is fabricated as a molded part, and a circumferential grinding ring which is separately formed and mechanically inserted into the molded part at its inside diameter. The grinding ring is usually made of steel, and the portions of the steel ring which are not actively used in the grinding process represent potential material waste, especially to the extent they are not strictly necessary for the grinding process and are instead used to join the actual grinding features together in a connective capacity that is redundant within the overall structure of the disposer. Production of the grind ring as a single part (or a small number of relatively large, curved parts), also requires a separate material fabrication operation. The assembly of such a grind ring into the grind chamber or enclosure also requires an additional operation, with its corresponding capital, labor, and material-handling costs. Finally, the tooling costs and lead-times associated with a stationary grind ring can present barriers to quickly implementing meaningful and incrementally-adjustable changes in performance, through the variation (e.g. of the number and type) of the grind-engaging features, and the parallel usage of multiple such variant ring designs adds inventory cost.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Food waste disposers, grinding sections for food waste disposers, and method of manufacturing grinding sections for food waste disposers are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with at least one aspect a food waste disposer is provided that includes a grinding section having a grinding section housing that has an internal wall that defines a food receiving area.

Food waste disposers of the present technology may also have a rotating grinding plate, which may be the same as, similar to, or different from the rotating grinding plate <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, food waste disposers of the present technology have a grinding section that includes a grinding section housing. The grinding section housing has an internal wall that defines a food receiving area. A plurality of projections formed in the internal wall, which may be integrally formed in the internal wall, and face into the food receiving chamber. The grinding section also includes a plurality of grinding inserts, wherein each grinding insert is attached to one of the projections. In at least some examples, grinding sections of the present technology can be fabricated as a molded part including the internal wall and the projections.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Food waste disposers of the present technology do not have a conventional stationary grinding ring that is separately fabricated and then inserted into the grinding section housing. Instead, food waste disposers of the present technology may be fabricated by attaching grinding inserts to the projections during the molding operation. This may eliminate the need for connective material to form a complete ring, or ring segments, thereby saving the portion of that material which is redundant to the requirements of the disposer structure. It may also eliminate the need for a post-molding assembly operation for the insertion of a stationary grinding ring into the enclosure that forms the grinding section. The use of projections and grinding inserts may also simplify the introduction of incrementally-adjustable changes in grinding performance by permitting such changes to be a function of the introduction of grinding inserts (e.g. changes in number and/or type), in lieu of dedicated tooling to form each ring configuration. The use of grinding inserts may also allow multiple variants to be produced using each insert type, which may permit differentiation with regard to the grinding-feature system at lower inventory cost than if each such system were implemented with a different grinding ring.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref> illustrate one example of a portion of a food waste disposer <b>100</b> that has a grinding section <b>102</b>.

Additionally, the inserts can be attached to the projections using any suitable technique, such as: a snap-lock, staking, sonic welding, adhesive, or an overmold. An overmold could constitute an additional layer axially below and/or radially inside the projections, or could form some or all of the projections themselves, within a pre-existing molded housing, that would retain the inserted inserts and perhaps also fill any remaining voids in the insert slots.
