In many instances such information is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. In further instances the verification of such information requires the physical presence or attestation of parties to the events. Such processing is often wrought with delays and other inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a need exits to provide systems, computer-implemented methods, computer program products and the like for validated tracking of managing events associated with equipment during the entirety of the usage period, otherwise referred to as the usage lifetime. Specifically, the desired systems and the like should validate the occurrence of any events-related to the equipment and manage the occurrence of any actions that are triggered in response to the verified events.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments, nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention address the above needs and/or achieve other advantages by providing for validated tracking and management of events associated with equipment during the equipment's usage lifetime. In specific embodiments of the invention, the events include resource arrangement-related events associated with resource arrangements related to the equipment and property right-related events associated with changing in property rights related to the equipment are registered as data blocks within a distributed register/ledger of a distributed trust computing network. The registering of the events within the distributed trust computing network serves as a source of truth (i.e., verification that the events have, in fact, occurred or are otherwise authentic).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In further embodiments of the invention, a virtual registration object is generated including a virtual registration identifier and associated information. The virtual registration object is associated with the equipment throughout the usage lifetime and provides for automated equipment registrations as the equipment is transferred/moved from one registration jurisdiction to another registration jurisdiction. In this regard, the virtual registration object is registered in the distributed trust computing network by creating a data block within the distributed register/ledger that verifies the authenticity of the virtual registration object and its association with the previously registered equipment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, in specific embodiments, the invention is further capable of tracking other events associated with the equipment, such as resource arrangement-related events and the like. For example, the invention may track the occurrence of a change in property rights (e.g., tile transfer) associated with the equipment and register the event in the distributed register/ledger. Further, the distributed ledger may be configured with logic that recognizes the event and, in response, performs one or more predetermined actions (e.g., satisfying outstanding obligations associated with the resource arrangement, transferring title, resource transfers associated with registration, maintenance, indemnification or the like).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, embodiments of the present invention are able to provide access to the validated information stored on the distributed register/ledger to a plurality of different entities on a need-to-know basis.

The distributed trust computing network <b>200</b>, in other instances referred to a blockchain network, is a distributed database that maintains, e.g., a list of data records, or the like. In specific embodiments of the invention the data records may include universal tags linked to data files, which are verified by the distributed trust computing network in terms of (i) the authenticity of the data file, and/or (ii) the user associated with the data file (e.g., rightful possessor and/or creator of the digital file). The security of the data maintained within the trust network is enhanced by the distributed nature of the network. The distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> typically includes several decentralized nodes <b>210</b>, which may be one or more systems, machines, computers, databases, data stores or the like operably connected with one another. In some instances, each of the nodes <b>210</b> or multiple nodes <b>210</b> are maintained by different entities. A distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> typically works without a central repository or single administrator.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> provides numerous advantages over traditional storage networks/databases. A large number of the decentralized nodes <b>210</b> of a trust network may reach a consensus regarding the validity of resources or data maintained with a block of the distributed trust computing network, in the context of the present invention the validity of the location-changing events of equipment maintained on a distributed register/ledger <b>220</b> or the like. Additionally, when multiple different suspected location-changing events of the equipment exist on the distributed register/ledger <b>220</b>, multiple decentralized nodes <b>210</b> can converge on the most recent location-changing event, such that the most recent location-changing event is verified and reflects the current location of the equipment. For example, in the case of equipment location, any decentralized node <b>210</b> within the distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> that stores a record, such as location-changing event record, can determine within a level of certainty whether the record can be authenticated/verified and become final by confirming that no conflicting records are confirmed by the distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> typically has two primary types of records. The first type is the record type, which consists of the actual data stored in a block <b>230</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) within a distributed register/ledger <b>220</b>. The second type is the block type, which are records that confirm when and in what sequence certain events became recorded as part of the distributed trust computing network. Records, such as a location-changing event records, and the events associated therewith are created by participants using the distributed trust computing network in its normal course of business, for example, when a location-changing event is determined/detected, a data block(s) <b>230</b> is created by users known as &#x201c;miners&#x201d; who use specialized software/equipment to create data blocks <b>230</b>. Holders (also, referred to as users) of a store block <b>130</b> of the distributed trust computing network agree to store the data block <b>230</b> within the distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> and the related data clocks <b>230</b> are passed around to various nodes <b>210</b> of the distributed trust computing network <b>200</b>. A &#x201c;valid&#x201d; data block <b>230</b> or related event is one that can be validated based on a set of rules that are defined by the particular system implementing the distributed trust computing network <b>100</b>. For example, in the case of location-change events, a valid data block is one that authenticates data in the data block to which it is linked and/or the user/creator/owner of the data block and authorizes specific predetermined entities to access at least a portion of the distributed register/ledger <b>220</b> to gain access to the data contained in the data block <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A distributed trust computing network <b>200</b> is typically decentralized&#x2014;meaning that a distributed register/ledger <b>220</b> (i.e., a decentralized register/ledger) is maintained on multiple nodes <b>210</b> of the distributed trust computing network <b>200</b>.
