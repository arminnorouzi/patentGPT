id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a transport caster, and more particularly to a removable transport caster assembly for a data center cabinet.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data center cabinets typically include casters to allow the cabinet to be easily rolled around on a data center floor. Once the cabinet is in the desired position, the cabinet is usually raised off of the casters by extending leveling legs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, illustrate a data center cabinet with fixed casters located under the cabinet. Once the leveling legs are set, the cabinet remains in position in the data center. Thus, the casters are typically only used for a short time over the life of a cabinet. The fixed casters secured to the cabinet add to the overall cost of each cabinet. As a result, eliminating the fixed casters would reduce the overall cost of the data center cabinet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One solution is to install removable transport casters on cabinets instead of the fixed casters. Removable transport casters can be installed on the data center cabinets to relocate the cabinets. After the cabinet is moved, then the casters can be removed from the cabinet. The removable transport casters enable a customer to purchase only one set of transport casters and install them only when cabinets in the data center are required to be moved to a different location. Typically, transport casters are difficult to install as the installation of the casters require the cabinet to be lifted off of the ground for installation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result, it is desirable to provide removable transport casters that are easily installed on the cabinets in a data center.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to a removable transport caster assembly used to position a cabinet in a data center. The removable transport caster assembly includes A transport caster and a transport caster bracket secured to the transport caster. The transport caster includes a mounting plate, a mounting bracket extending from the mounting plate, a lifting plate pivotally connected to the mounting plate, a lifting lever pivotally connected to the mounting bracket and a wheel assembly. The transport caster bracket secures the transport caster to the cabinet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is also directed to a data center cabinet defined by a base frame with front vertical posts connected by side to side beams and back vertical posts connected by side to side beams. Front to back beams connect the front vertical posts to the back vertical posts. Transport caster assemblies are removably secured to the side to side beams or the front to back beams to facilitate the relocation of the data center cabinets in a data center.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
