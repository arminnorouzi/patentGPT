The present invention finds a specific application in the field of geothermal energy, but it can also apply to the field of petroleum exploration and exploitation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diversification of the different energy sources allows reduction of fossil fuel dependence and thus meeting the challenges of energy transition. In this context, the global market for geothermal power generation is expected to double in the next ten years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The geothermal resource exploits the natural geothermal gradient (temperature increase with depth) of the Earth, which may be very variable depending on the sites. Thus, to capture the geothermal energy, a fluid is circulated in the subsoil, at a greater or lesser depth depending on the desired temperature and according to the local thermal gradient. This fluid may be naturally present in the rock (aquifer) or it may be purposely injected into the subsoil. The fluid heats up upon contact with the subsurface rocks and flows back to the surface laden with calories (thermal energy), which is transmitted in a heat exchanger. The fluid is thereafter reinjected into the medium, once cooled and filtered.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerical simulation of subsurface flows provides essential information for optimal geothermal energy exploitation. First, such a simulation can be advantageously used prior to building a plant in order to determine the potential of a site considered for geothermal energy exploitation, or to determine the location, the geometry and the depth of injection/production wells. Numerical flow simulation can also be advantageously used for monitoring a geothermal site, notably in order to optimize production while preserving the geothermal potential of this site, or for monitoring interactions with surrounding aquifers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sites favorable to geothermal energy exploitation are often found in geologically active zones such as volcanic zones. Such zones are most often characterized by fracture networks, which have a very significant impact on fluid flows as fractures can act as drains or barriers to fluid flows. It is therefore important for the numerical flow simulators used to provide realistic modelling of the flows, including in the case of a fractured medium.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Now, accurate modelling of flows in a fractured medium would require extremely fine cells for modelling heterogeneities such as faults. In order to limit the computing time, approximate fracture medium models have been proposed in the literature relative to petroleum exploration and exploitation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following documents are mentioned in the description:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Aliyu, M.

This approach involves the fractured reservoir being broken into identical parallelepiped blocks, referred to as matrix blocks, delimited by an orthogonal system of continuous uniform fractures oriented in the principal directions of flow. In a dual porosity model (also referred to as dual medium model), the medium to be modelled is broken into a &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; medium and a &#x201c;matrix&#x201d; medium.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">With such a model, any elementary volume (reservoir model cell) of the fractured reservoir is associated with a fraction of matrix block(s). Fluid flow at reservoir scale occurs essentially through the fractures, fluid exchanges occur locally between the matrix blocks and the fractures, and the amounts of fluid are mainly stored in the matrices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show, by way of illustration, an example of an underground formation with a fracture network RF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and an equivalent dual porosity model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), having parallelepiped blocks B, delimited by a system of fractures RFX, RFY orthogonal to one another.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">This type of models is increasingly used in the field of geothermal energy, as described for example in the documents (Austria and O'Sullivan, 2015; Omagbon et al., 2016; Aliyu et al., 2017; Fugii et al., 2018).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">However, although the dual porosity model is in general particularly well suited for flow modelling in the petroleum sector, where convection is the main transport mechanism, the dual porosity model is not suited to geothermal fractured reservoirs where the thermal conduction mechanism plays a significant role.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">Indeed, the dual porosity model according to the prior art involves by construction that pressure and temperature are constants in a cell within the fracture medium. Although it can be assumed that pressure is locally a constant within the fracture medium, due to the high permeability in the fractures, such an assumption is not suitable for temperature because the thermal conductivity in the fractures is actually very low (as in the matrix). In other words, in a fracture medium, temperature diffusion is much slower than pressure diffusion in the fractures.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">Let us consider a square matrix block B as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, with a principal flow in direction X, i.e. F<sub>x</sub><sup>f</sup>&#x3e;&#x3e;F<sub>y</sub><sup>f</sup>, where F is the flow stream. Whatever the direction of flow, the pressure around this matrix block is nearly constant due to the high permeability in the fractures. Therefore, the exchange flow between the matrix and the fractures due to convection is quasi uniform around this block, for the mass flow as well as the heat flow. However, this is not always the case for the temperature and the heat flow due to conduction, notably when cold water is injected into a fractured medium at high temperature (200&#xb0; C. for geothermal production for example). Indeed, the water front progresses mainly along the fractures oriented in the principal direction of flow, i.e. in direction X. The temperature decreases first in the fractures parallel to direction X and the temperature in the fractures parallel to direction Y changes slowly, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> by the following relations for the temperatures in the fractures: &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub><sup>f</sup>&#x2248;&#x3b8;<sub>2</sub><sup>f</sup>&#x3c;&#x3c;&#x3b8;<sub>3</sub><sup>f</sup>&#x2248;&#x3b8;<sub>4</sub><sup>f</sup>, where &#x3c3;<sub>i</sub><sup>f </sup>is the temperature in a fracture i, with i=1, 4. Heat exchanges occur mainly between the matrix block and the fractures parallel to direction X due to the low fracture temperature thereof, while exchanges with the fractures parallel to direction Y are limited by the higher fracture temperature. Thus, the heat exchange due to conduction is not uniform in the fractures, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> by the following relations for heat exchanges through conduction: Q<sub>D1</sub><sup>mf</sup>&#x2248;Q<sub>D2</sub><sup>mf</sup>&#xbb;Q<sub>D3</sub><sup>mf</sup>&#x2248;Q<sub>D4</sub><sup>mf</sup>, where Q<sub>Di</sub><sup>mf </sup>is a heat exchange due to conduction between matrix and fracture for fracture i, with i=1, 4. The temperature in a fracture depends on the amount of cold water flowing therethrough and on the matrix-fracture exchange. Now, in a dual porosity model according to the prior art, it is not possible to have distinct temperatures depending on the direction of the fractures to calculate the matrix-fracture exchange through conduction. Simulations may therefore be inaccurate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">A dual porosity model according to the prior art thus does not enable proper modelling of the heat transfer by conduction between matrix and fractures. Besides, some authors (Fujii et al., 2018, for example) have observed that the cold water arrival time actually measured at a production well can sometimes be much faster than the time predicted by a numerical flow simulation based on a dual porosity model.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0022">The present invention aims to overcome these drawbacks. In particular, the present invention relates to a simulation of fluid flows in an underground formation comprising a fracture network, implementing a porosity model allowing improved modelling of heat transfer through conduction in relation to a dual porosity model according to the prior art. More precisely, the porosity model according to the invention breaks the medium to be modelled into a matrix medium, a first &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; medium representative of fractures oriented in a first direction and a second &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; medium representative of fractures oriented in a second direction orthogonal to the first direction.

flows in an underground formation comprising a fracture network.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">The fluid contained in the geological reservoir being studied can be essentially aqueous (water in particular), or it may comprise at least one of an oil phase, a gas phase, and an aqueous phase, and it can possibly contain a polymer or a surfactant.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The underground formation being studied can be a subterranean geological reservoir, fractured in the present case, intended to be subjected to geothermal exploitation for example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">According to a second aspect, the invention relates to a method of exploiting a fluid contained in an underground formation comprising a fracture network, by use of a fluid flow simulation method according to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">It is clear that the simulation method according to the first aspect of the invention is carried out in order to provide simulation results enabling exploitation of the fluid of the underground formation comprising the fracture network according to the second aspect of the invention, by way of non-limitative example, in a geothermal process or in a hydrocarbon recovery process.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The present invention requires:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0053">property measurements relative to the underground formation being studied: these are, on the one hand, petrophysical property measurements performed in situ or in the laboratory, such as porosity, permeability, lithology (i.e. rock type), relative permeability or capillary pressure. These measurements may have been obtained for example through laboratory analysis of core samples taken in situ, through logging operations carried out in wells traversing the underground formation studied, or through seismic acquisition surveys. On the other hand, these measurements relate to the properties of the fluids flowing through the underground formation studied, such as oil flow rate, water flow rate, pressure or saturation measurements. These measurements may have been obtained for example by producing the fluid in some wells traversing the underground formation being studied, during well tests or interference tests. Generally, such property measurements are well known in the field of flow simulation in an underground formation,</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0054">a grid representation representative of the underground formation being studied, which is also referred to as reservoir model in the petroleum industry and a subsoil model constructed in order to describe as precisely as possible the structure, the petrophysical properties and the properties of the fluids in the underground formation studied. This model is generally represented on a computer and has a grid, each cell of this grid comprises one or more property values relative to the reservoir being studied (such as porosity, permeability, saturation, geological facies, pressure, etc.). A reservoir model must verify as far as possible the properties collected in the field: logging data measured along wells, measurements performed on rock samples obtained via core drilling for example, data deduced from seismic acquisition surveys, production data such as oil flow rate, water flow rate, pressure variations, etc. Reservoir simulation specialists are fully aware of methods for constructing such a grid representation of a geological reservoir. It is noted that the reservoir model can merge with the geological model when the computing power is sufficient to allow numerical flow simulation calculations on a fine-cell grid. Otherwise, specialists can use an upscaling technique to convert a fine-cell model (geological model) to a model with coarser cells (reservoir model). This upscaling step can be carried out for example with the CobraFlow&#x2122; software (IFP Energies nouvelles, France). According to an implementation of the invention, a grid representation of the geological reservoir being studied comprises at least a saturation value, a pressure value, a temperature value, a composition of the fluid mixture, a permeability, a porosity, a capillary pressure, a relative permeability and a pore size in each of the cells thereof;</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0055">a flow simulator according to the invention: flow simulator is a numerical program executed on a computer, which is used to simulate fluid flows in a porous medium. Flow simulation, also referred to as reservoir simulation in the petroleum industry, notably allows numerically predicting the displacement over time of a fluid present in at least one of injected into an underground formation, and in particular the amount of fluid produced from a production well (towards which the fluid is displaced by pressure gradient and from where it can be extracted). The flow simulator according to the invention, which notably implements a porosity model according to the invention, is described in detail in step 4) hereafter.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">According to an implementation of the invention, the method according to the invention comprises at least the following steps:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">1) Fracture network characterization</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">2) Construction of a porosity model</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">3) Determination of flow parameters</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">4) Flow simulation</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">5) Exploitation of the underground formation fluid.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">According to an implementation of the invention, the method according to the first aspect of the invention comprises at least steps 2) to 4). According to an implementation of the invention, the method according to the second aspect of the invention comprises at least steps 2) to 5). Step 1) can be carried out a single time, for the underground formation considered, prior to applying steps 2) to 4) (optionally steps 2) to 5)) that can be repeated without repeating step 1).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">1) Fracture Network Characterization</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">This step characterizes the fracture network of the underground formation being studied, from the property measurements relative to the formation. Advantageously, this step may have been carried out beforehand, a single time, prior to carrying out at least steps 2) to 4) below.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">1.1) Determining Statistical Parameters</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">This substep determines statistical parameters (referred to as PSF) such as fracture orientation or fracture density, characterizing the fracture network of the underground formation being studied. This substep requires property measurements relative to the formation enabling direct or indirect fracture characterization. Information on the fracturation of an underground formation can be obtained via:<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0067">core samples taken from the formation being studied, from which a statistical study of the intersected fractures can be performed, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0068">outcrops, which have the advantage of providing a large-scale vision of the fracture network, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0069">seismic images allowing identifying major geological events and the geometry of the various structures of the formation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">Preferably, fracture statistical parameters are determined in order to best characterize the fractures present in the formation, and the parameters can be selected from among the density of the fractures observed, their length, spatial orientation, opening, permeability and distribution within the layer studied.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">Statistical parameters that describe the fracture network of the formation being studied are thus obtained. These parameters can be used to determine cells representative of the grid representation (see optional substep 1.2) and/or a discrete fracture network model (see optional substep 1.3), at the scale of a cell of the grid or of a cell representative of the grid.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">1.2) Determining Representative Cells (Optional)</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">This substep is optional and determines at least one cell representative of a group of cells of the grid.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">According to an implementation of the invention, a group of cells of the grid is set up according to a criterion based on the characteristics of the fracture network present in the cells, by means of a semblance measurement for example. Thus, the cells grouped into a group of cells have similar characteristics in terms of fractures. This semblance analysis can be carried out, without being limited thereto, from the statistical parameters that describe the fracture network, these parameters being determined in substep 1.1.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">According to an implementation of the invention, a representative cell is assigned to the group of cells of the grid thus set up. By way of non limitative example, any cell of the group of cells or a cell whose characteristics (fracture orientation for example) are close to the average of the characteristics of the group of cells considered can be assigned to the group of cells.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">According to an embodiment of the invention, after this step, a group of cells has been set up, so that any cell of the grid has been assigned to a group of cells, each group of cells being associated with a representative cell.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">It may be of advantage to consider a cell representative of a group of cells to save computational time and computer memory. Indeed, required calculations can for example be carried out in a step or a substep for the representative cell considered, and the result of these calculations can then be assigned to each cell of the group of cells, thus saving computational time and computer memory.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">1.3) Constructing a Discrete Fracture Network Model (Optional)</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">This substep is optional and constructs a realistic image of the fracture network characterized by the statistical parameters (PSF) determined in substep 1.1, using a discrete fracture network (DFN) model.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">This substep can be carried out for a cell of the grid or for a representative cell of a group of cells of the grid as appropriate (see optional substep 1.2), and it can be repeated for each cell of the grid or for each representative cell of groups of cells of the grid as appropriate (see optional substep 1.2).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0081">Thus, in this substep, a detailed representation (DFN) of the inner complexity of the network fracture, as faithful as possible to the direct and indirect reservoir observations, is associated with at least one given cell.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0082">Known softwares, such as the FRACAFlow&#xae; software (IFP Energies nouvelles, France), can be used to construct a discrete fracture network (DFN) model in at least one cell of the grid.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">2) Construction of a Porosity Model</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">This step constructs a porosity model (that is a model representative of porosity) of the underground formation comprising the fracture network (that is the fracture medium), from at least the fracture statistical parameters.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">In this step, a porosity model of the underground formation is constructed, which comprises a first medium representative of an unfractured matrix of the formation being studied, a second medium representative of the formation fractures oriented in a first direction, and a third medium representative of the formation fractures oriented in a second direction, the first and second directions being orthogonal to one another.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">In other words, in this step, the underground formation comprising the fracture network is broken into a set of unfractured matrix blocks (that is a block of a matrix only and comprising no fracture) delimited by two distinct fracture media orthogonal to one another. Thus, the porosity model according to the invention breaks the single fracture medium of the dual porosity model according to the prior art into two distinct fracture media.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0087">In the rest of the description, for the purpose of simplification, the first medium is referred to as &#x201c;matrix medium&#x201d;, the second and third media are referred to as &#x201c;fracture media&#x201d;, and the porosity model according to the invention is referred to as &#x201c;dual porosity-dual fracture model&#x201d;. Besides, the fracture medium representative of the fractures oriented in the first direction is referred to as &#x201c;X-fracture&#x201d; medium and the fracture medium representative of the fractures oriented in the direction perpendicular to the first direction is referred to as &#x201c;Y-fracture&#x201d; medium.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0088">It is clear that the dimensions of the parallelepiped blocks of the matrix medium can be different from the dimensions of the grid cells. Thus, in general, the dimension of a parallelepiped block of the matrix medium can be greater than or less than the dimension of a cell of the grid, and vice versa. Therefore, the boundaries of the parallelepiped blocks may not correspond to the boundaries of the cells of the grid.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0089">According to an implementation of the invention, one of the directions of the fracture media can correspond to the principal direction of flow, and the other direction corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the principal direction of flow. The principal direction of flow can be determined from the fracture statistical parameters determined at least from at least one of in step 1) and more generally from the property measurements relative to the formation being studied.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0090">According to an implementation of the invention, the size of the parallelepiped blocks of the unfractured matrix medium of the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention can be determined in a similar way to any of the methods implemented in the case of a dual porosity model according to the prior art. For example, the methods described in the documents FR-2,757,957, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,944 and FR-2,923,930, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 8,688,424 can be used, which describe a method of calculating the characteristic dimension of a matrix block, representative of unfractured rock blocks, from a discrete fracture network model, an image analysis and interpolation of an invasion curve. Alternatively, the method described in the document FR-3,045,868 (U.S. Pat. No. 10,641,923) can also be carried out.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0091">3) Determination of Flow Parameters</p><p id="p-0088" num="0092">In this step, flow parameters in each cell of the grid representation are determined from at least the porosity model according to the invention, the statistical parameters of the fracture network and the property measurements relative to the formation.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0093">According to the invention, the flow parameters determined in this step comprise at least:<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0094">between two neighboring cells of the grid in direction X, a fluid transmissibility by convection and a fluid transmissibility by conduction in directions X and Y in the X-fracture medium, fluid transmissibilities by convection and by conduction being zero in direction Y in the X-fracture medium;</li>        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0095">between two neighboring cells of the grid in direction Y, a fluid transmissibility by convection and a fluid transmissibility by conduction in directions X and Y in the Y-fracture medium, fluid transmissibilities by convection and by conduction being zero in direction X in the Y-fracture medium;</li>        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0096">within a cell of the grid, mass exchanges by convection, energy exchanges by convection and energy exchanges by conduction between the X-fracture medium and the Y-fracture medium, and between the matrix medium and the X-fracture medium, and between the matrix medium and the Y-fracture medium.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">Thus, the porosity model according to the invention allows describing distinct mass and energy exchanges depending on the direction of the fractures which is unlike the dual porosity model according to the prior art. Indeed, the first fracture medium allows describing exchanges in a first direction, and the second fracture medium allows describing exchanges in a second direction. The two fracture media are connected to each cell and the mass can be freely transferred by convection between the two fracture media within a cell. In addition, the porosity model according to the invention is suited to account for a slower temperature diffusion in one fracture direction than in the other.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0098">In detail hereafter embodiments are described wherein flow parameters are determined for a given cell i, or between a cell i and a neighboring cell j.

The fracture network spacing in direction X is 25 m and the fracture network spacing in direction Y is 100 m. The permeability in the fractures parallel to direction X is 4 D and the permeability in the fractures parallel to direction Y is 6 D. The permeability of the matrix is 0.0001 mD. The dimensions of the zone wherein flows are to be modelled are 500 m&#xd7;500 m&#xd7;10 m.

Thus, the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention constructed for this application example comprises a matrix medium, a first fracture medium whose fractures are oriented in direction X (X-fracture medium) and a second fracture medium, distinct from the first fracture medium, whose fractures are oriented in direction Y (Y-fracture medium).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a constant-depth section in the fractured medium considered for this application example, a depth at which two horizontal wells PI, PP (shown by two thick black lines at the edges of the fractured medium in direction X) are drilled, oriented in direction X and 300-m long, one of the wells being an injection well PI and the other being a production well PP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also shows the distribution of matrix blocks B, of fractures RFX oriented in direction X and fractures RFY oriented in direction Y of the porosity model constructed for this application example.

The pressure limit at the bottom of the production well is 50 bar.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0154">A reference model is generated to evaluate the quality of the flow modelling using the porosity model according to the invention. A flow simulation is therefore carried out on a grid representation where the cells are explicitly discretized. In other words, a flow simulation is performed using a grid representation with very fine grid cells (1 cm for discretizing the fault opening and about 10 cm for discretizing the matrix medium in the zone close to fractures), thus enabling realistic prediction of the flows in such a medium. It is clear that the computing times required for such a flow simulation cannot routinely be envisaged, unlike flow simulations performed using dual porosity or dual porosity-dual fracture type models, which allow coarser grid cells to be used.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0155">For comparison purposes, a dual porosity model according to the prior art, which breaks the underground formation into 100 m&#xd7;25 m&#xd7;10 m matrix blocks delimited by a single fracture medium, is also constructed.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> compares the evolution over time t (in days j) of temperature T of the water in the production well, simulated by means of a flow simulator implementing the dual porosity model according to the prior art (curve TAA), a flow simulator implementing the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention (curve TINV) and a flow simulator using directly the reference model (TREF) (without using an equivalent porosity model).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0157">The reference model shows a rather premature thermal breakthrough due to the high permeability in the fractures in direction Y.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0158">However, it is noted that the model obtained with the dual porosity model according to the prior art is characterized by a very late thermal breakthrough, compared with the reference model. Indeed, the heat exchange between matrix and fractures is overestimated due to the low temperature in the fracture cells of the dual porosity model. In addition, it can be seen that, after 10,000 days, the temperature of the produced water still is at the initial value of 200&#xb0; C., whereas the temperature in the reference model has decreased down to 180&#xb0; C. This can be explained by the fact that, with a dual porosity model according to the prior art, the cold water is assumed to flow through all the fractures of the single fracture medium, and the temperature decreases in all these fractures uniformly. Thus, the heat exchange between matrix and fractures is overestimated with a dual porosity model according to the prior art due to a lower fracture temperature. The cold water front is further heated by the overestimated transfer, and the thermal breakthrough is thus delayed.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0159">On the other hand, it can be observed that the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention provides a model that is closer to the reference model because this model makes it possible to calculate different fracture temperatures within a single cell, depending on their orientations, which allows a more accurate matrix-fracture exchange to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> respectively show the variations of temperature T and pressure P of the water in directions X and Y, obtained with the reference model after 1000 days. It can be noted that the cold water moves rapidly along the fractures oriented in direction Y between injection well PI and production well PP, because the exchange surfaces between a matrix block and the fractures in this direction are relatively small for heat exchange. The temperature along the fractures in direction X varies very slowly due to the large exchange surface with the matrix block and to poor thermal connections between the fractures in directions X and Y. The fracture temperature around a matrix block is thus very different depending on the fracture orientations. It can however be seen that the pressure front moves in a rather uniform manner and that the fracture pressure is also uniform around a matrix block, whatever the orientation of the fractures.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the variations of temperature T of the water in directions X and Y determined by the dual porosity model according to the prior art in the fracture medium, after 1000 days. It can be seen in this figure that the temperature front moves slowly from injection well PI to production well PP. In fact, in the reference model, the heat exchange between the Y fractures and a matrix block is relatively low, due to the small contact surface. The matrix cannot provide enough heat to heat the moving cold water. However, with the dual porosity model according to the prior art, the matrix-fracture exchange occurs uniformly with all the fractures surrounding the matrix block. The exchange with the fractures in direction X is more significant than with the fractures in direction Y because the contact surface is larger with the fractures parallel to direction X. In other words, the dual porosity model according to the prior art greatly overestimates the heat exchange between matrix and fractures in this example. Therefore, the cold water front cannot move very rapidly.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, (respectively <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B), show the variations of temperature T (respectively pressure P) of the water in directions X and Y determined using the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention, in the X-fracture medium (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, respectively <b>9</b>A,) and in the Y-fracture medium (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>; respectively <b>9</b>B), after 1000 days. It can be noted that, in the X-fracture medium, which represents the fractures oriented in direction X, the temperature front moves slowly from injection well PI to production well PP. This result is close to the temperatures in the fractures oriented along axis X predicted by the reference model. In the Y-fracture medium that represents the fractures oriented in direction Y, the cold temperature front moves rapidly, in a similar way (on average) to the front advancing in the fractures in direction Y of the reference model. Indeed, in the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention, exchanges between a matrix block and the fractures oriented in direction X and direction Y are considered separately. Therefore, the thermal breakthrough can be predicted more accurately. Besides, as observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b></figref>, left and right, the pressures in both X-fracture and Y-fracture media are nearly identical, and close to those predicted by the reference model, which clearly shows that the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention is also suitable for modelling pressures.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0163">Thus, the dual porosity-dual fracture model according to the invention enables more reliable simulation of fluid flows in fractured media wherein thermal exchanges through conduction are significant, in particular in the case of geothermal exploitation.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="13.72mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="7.03mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="13.72mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="7.03mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="15.83mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00006" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00006.NB"><img id="EMI-M00006" he="15.83mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00006.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00007" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00007.NB"><img id="EMI-M00007" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00007.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00008" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00008.NB"><img id="EMI-M00008" he="6.35mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00008.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00009" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00009.NB"><img id="EMI-M00009" he="15.49mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00009.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00010" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00010.NB"><img id="EMI-M00010" he="14.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00010.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00011" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00011.NB"><img id="EMI-M00011" he="14.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00011.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00012" nb-file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00012.NB"><img id="EMI-M00012" he="16.59mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003102A1-20230105-M00012.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-8" num="001-8"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>8</b>.
