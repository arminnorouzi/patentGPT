It more particularly concerns swimming pool cleaning apparatus including a device for cleaning the filter without the user having to soil their hands.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PREAMBLE AND PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention concerns apparatus for cleaning a surface immersed in a liquid, such as a surface formed by the walls of a pool, notably of a swimming pool. It is notably a question of a mobile swimming pool cleaning robot. Such a cleaning robot performs said cleaning by travelling over the bottom and the walls of the swimming pool, brushing those walls, and aspirating the debris toward a filter. Debris means all the particles present in the pool, such as fragments of leaves, micro-algae, etc., this debris normally being deposited on the bottom of the pool or stuck to the lateral walls thereof.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The robot is most usually supplied with power by an electrical cable connecting the robot to an external control and power supply unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are known, for example, in this field, the Applicant's patents FR 2 925 557 and 2 925 551 that are directed to immersed surface cleaning apparatus including a removable filter device. Such devices comprise a body, members for driving said body over the immersed surface, a filter chamber in the body and including a liquid inlet, a liquid outlet, a liquid circulation hydraulic circuit between the inlet and the outlet via a filter device. In these two patents, the filter device is removable to enable emptying out of the leaves and other debris without having to turn over the cleaning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This apparatus includes automatic programs for cleaning the bottom of the pool and possibly the lateral walls of the pool. Such a program determines cleaning of the swimming pool in a predetermined time, for example one and a half hours. The robot is generally removed from the water by the user at the end of the cycle or at regular intervals, when the filter is too full of particles (leaves, micro-particles, etc.), to clean it. In recent designs, the external control and power supply unit of the robot emits a luminous signal when this operation of cleaning the filter must be carried out.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In most modern swimming pool cleaning robot designs, cleaning the filter obliges the user to remove the filter from the robot and then to empty it and to wash it in plenty of water. These operations most often bring the user into contact with the filter sludge, which is disagreeable and not very hygienic.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A notable object of the invention is to remedy some of these drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention is also directed to swimming pool cleaning apparatus where cleaning the filter is greatly simplified.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is also directed to swimming pool cleaning apparatus in which the consumption of energy is low.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first aspect of the invention consists in swimming pool cleaning apparatus comprising:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a. a handle that is able to move between a first position and a second position;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">b. means for retaining the handle in the first position, and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">c. means for urging the handle towards the second position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Here &#x201c;swimming pool cleaning apparatus&#x201d; refers to apparatus for cleaning an immersed surface, i.e. typically apparatus mobile in or on the bottom of a swimming pool and adapted to collect and filter debris deposited on a wall. Such apparatus is commonly known as a swimming pool cleaning robot when it includes means for automatic management of movement over the bottom and the walls of the swimming pool to cover all of the surface to be cleaned.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">By an abuse of language, here &#x201c;liquid&#x201d; refers to the mixture of water and debris in suspension in the swimming pool or in the fluid circulation circuit in the cleaning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The handle is advantageously fixed directly or indirectly to the upper part of the body.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one particular embodiment the apparatus comprises a body having an upper part that includes a recess such that, in the first position, at least a part of the handle fits into said recess.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a result, the hydrodynamic profile of the cleaning apparatus is improved when the handle is retained in the first position and the apparatus therefore consumes less energy in order to move.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, in this position, a user cannot pull on the handle, which makes it possible to prevent untimely extraction, for example removal of the debris filter when the cleaning unit is operating.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one particular embodiment the means for retaining are designed to be moved manually so as to release the handle from the first position.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000">In another embodiment, possibly used in conjunction and intended to reduce the risk of inappropriate use, the means for retaining include automatic locking means responsive to the status of the cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">In one particular embodiment the handle rotates through about ninety degrees from the first position to the second position. As a result, said handle becomes perfectly easy to grasp in the hand and the force to remove the filter is perpendicular to the initial plane of the handle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In one particular embodiment the swimming pool cleaning apparatus further includes a body and a debris filter, at least a part of the debris filter being positioned in a chamber of the body when the cleaning unit is in use and the filter basket being removable from the housing in the body of the cleaning unit by pulling on the handle when the handle is in the second position. This embodiment corresponds to the use of such a retractable handle for inserting and removing the debris filter.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">In this case, in one particular embodiment when the handle is retained in the first position, the filter basket is fixed inside the chamber, and when the handle is in the second position, the filter basket is released from the chamber.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In one particular embodiment the handle extends approximately along the width of the body.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The means for urging comprise at least one spring, for example a torsion spring.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">The cleaning apparatus advantageously comprises (a) a body, (b) means for moving the body in a swimming pool, and (c) a motor for driving the movement means.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In another aspect the invention consists in swimming pool cleaning apparatus comprising:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">a. a body;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">b. a debris filter, at least a part of which is disposed inside the body;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">c. an indicator, mobile from a first position to a second position, the indicator being visible from outside the body when it is in the second position, and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">d. means for urging the indicator towards the second position when the debris filter contains a predetermined quantity of debris.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In another aspect the invention consists in swimming pool cleaning apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0034">a cleaning unit intended to be immersed in the swimming pool,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0035">at least one liquid filter circuit between at least one liquid inlet and at least one liquid outlet via a filter chamber removable from the body of the cleaning unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">The cleaning unit advantageously comprises:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0037">means for forcing a flow of water between the water inlet and the water outlet via the filter circuit,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0038">means for controlling movements of the cleaning unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">The filter circuit comprises at least one filter chamber removable from the body of the cleaning unit, comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0040">a cover,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0041">a filter basket.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">The cover includes releasable means for fastening the filter basket and means for locking the filter chamber to the body of the cleaning unit. These means for locking are releasable and, when released, i.e. in practice when the filter is dirty, cause an extraction handle to be deployed from the filter chamber and urged towards a predetermined position.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">As a result, when the user wishes to remove the filter basket from the swimming pool cleaning apparatus, they do not need to soil their hands through contact with leaves or debris contained in the filter basket.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">The filter basket and the cover are advantageously removed from the apparatus by upward removal out of the body of the cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">In this way, the filter basket is removable through the top of the apparatus.

In the present nonlimiting embodiment the liquid inlet <b>13</b> is situated at the base of the body <b>11</b> (in other words under the latter when the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> is placed in its normal operating position on the bottom of the swimming pool), that is to say immediately facing an immersed surface over which the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> moves in order to be able to aspirate debris accumulated on said immersed surface. The liquid outlet <b>14</b> is situated on top of the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, the liquid outlet <b>14</b> is in a direction approximately perpendicular to the guide plane, i.e. vertical if the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> is resting on the bottom of the swimming pool.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0068">The water filter circuit connects the liquid inlet <b>13</b> to the liquid outlet <b>14</b>. The water filter circuit is adapted to be able to produce a flow of liquid from the liquid inlet <b>13</b> to the liquid outlet <b>14</b>. To this end the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> includes a pump comprising a motor and an axial-flow impeller, said motor driving the axial-flow impeller in rotation, said axial-flow impeller being disposed in the hydraulic circuit.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0069">The swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> is supplied with energy by means of a watertight flexible cable. In the present embodiment, this flexible cable is attached to the top of the body of the swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b>. This flexible cable is connected at its other end to the power supply unit (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) disposed externally of the pool, this power supply unit being itself connected to the electrical mains supply.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0070">In the present embodiment, the cleaning robot <b>10</b> further includes a holding handle <b>15</b> adapted to enable a user to remove the robot from the water, notably when the filter must be cleaned. In the present embodiment, the holding handle <b>15</b> is mobile between a deployed position and a position folded against the body of the cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0071">In a variant of this embodiment, a return spring of the torsion spring type is disposed on the axis of the holding handle <b>15</b> and urges the holding handle towards its folded-away position. In this way, the hydrodynamic resistance of the cleaning unit when moving in water is low and the electrical consumption of the apparatus is therefore low.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0072">In one particular embodiment the cleaning robot includes means enabling rapid emptying of the water contained in its internal filter chamber when it is removed from the water. Such devices are described for example in the Applicant's patent application EP 2 235 291.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0073">The swimming pool cleaning robot <b>10</b> comprises a filter chamber <b>16</b> in the water filter circuit between the liquid inlet <b>13</b> and the liquid outlet <b>14</b>. The filter chamber is in particular fed with liquid via at least one upstream channel connecting the liquid inlet <b>13</b> to the filter chamber <b>8</b>. Each upstream channel opens into the filter chamber <b>16</b> via a feed opening. Here the feed opening is fitted with a check valve.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0074">In the present embodiment, the filter chamber <b>16</b> comprises a filter basket <b>17</b> notably shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> and a cover <b>18</b> notably shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, forming the upper wall of the filter chamber <b>16</b> and forming an integral part of the exterior surface of the body <b>11</b> of the cleaning unit <b>10</b>. This removable cover <b>18</b> enables a user to access the filter basket <b>17</b> in the filter chamber <b>16</b> to clean the filter when this proves necessary.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0075">Here the filter basket <b>17</b> forms the bottom and the inner and outer peripheral walls of the filter chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0076">In one particular embodiment the axial-flow impeller driving the flow of water in the filter circuit is disposed along a vertical axis that is approximately centrally located in the body <b>11</b> of the cleaning unit. In this case the liquid outlet <b>14</b> is situated in the middle of the cover <b>18</b>. In this embodiment the central part of the filter basket <b>17</b> includes a central filter wall <b>19</b> surrounding a cowling of the axial-flow impeller.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0077">In the nonlimiting embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the filter basket <b>17</b> then has a parallelepipedal overall shape with an opening through it formed by the central filter wall, intended to be placed around the cowling of the axial-flow impeller and the electric motor. In addition to the central filter wall <b>19</b>, the filter basket <b>17</b> includes a lower filter wall <b>20</b> and external lateral filter walls <b>21</b>, thus being conformed as a rectangular parallelepiped with no top face, said face normally being formed by the cover <b>18</b>, the central part of said filter basket <b>17</b> including the central filter wall <b>19</b> oriented along an axis perpendicular to its lower face <b>20</b>, this axis coinciding here with the vertical axis Z<sub>r </sub>of the cleaning unit <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment the central filter wall <b>19</b> is of frustoconical shape, wider at the bottom than at the top (near the cover <b>18</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0078">In the present nonlimiting embodiment the filter basket <b>17</b> includes a fine-mesh surface forming the filter as such, welded, glued or attached by other means to a perforated rigid armature <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0079">The filter chamber <b>16</b> is removable, i.e. it can be removed from and inserted in the body <b>11</b> of the apparatus. To this end the body <b>11</b> of the apparatus includes a housing into which the filter basket <b>17</b> can be inserted, the cover <b>18</b> establishing continuity with the exterior surface of the body <b>11</b> of the apparatus. The fact that the filter basket <b>17</b> is removable makes it easy to empty, notably without having to manipulate the entire cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0080">The filter basket <b>17</b> is removably fastened to the cover <b>18</b> in order to facilitate cleaning the filter basket <b>17</b> of debris accumulated therein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0081">The cover <b>18</b> is hermetically sealed to the filter basket <b>17</b> in order to prevent leaking of liquid charged with debris. In one nonlimiting embodiment the cover <b>18</b> includes a peripheral ring adapted to cooperate with an edge of the filter basket. As a result, debris remains inside the filter basket <b>17</b>. In a variant embodiment, the cover <b>18</b> includes a peripheral seal (not shown in the figures) that comes to bear on the edge of the filter basket <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, the cover <b>18</b> forms an upper portion of the outer wall of the body <b>11</b> of the cleaning unit <b>10</b> when the filter basket <b>17</b> is inserted in the housing of said cleaning unit. The cover <b>18</b> has a shape corresponding to the lateral shape of the filter basket <b>17</b>, said shape possibly being pierced at its centre in order to provide a passage for the cowling of the axial-flow impeller whose upper end forms the liquid outlet <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0083">In the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> the cover <b>18</b> includes locking means on the top of the filter basket <b>17</b> in the form of two lugs <b>23</b> that can be actuated manually, disposed under the longitudinal edges of said cover <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) and including return means <b>24</b>. These lugs <b>23</b> close over housings in the top longitudinal edges of the rigid armature <b>22</b> of the filter basket <b>17</b>. By way of nonlimiting example, the return means <b>24</b> are of the torsion spring type.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0084">As a result, by depressing the two lugs <b>23</b> simultaneously, a user separates the filter basket <b>17</b> from the cover <b>18</b>. They can then grasp the rigid armature <b>22</b> of the filter basket <b>17</b> by its longitudinal edges, for example at the location of the housings corresponding to the lugs <b>23</b>, and manipulate said filter basket without having to come into contact with the filtration sludge, localized at the level of the filter surface. The user can therefore turn over the filter basket <b>17</b>, empty it and then wash it in plenty of water, still without coming into contact with the filter sludge.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0085">The cover <b>18</b> also includes means for locking it to the body <b>11</b> in the form of two lateral slides <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) configured in the form of circular arc conduits, these slides <b>25</b> being fastened to the arms <b>26</b> of an extraction handle <b>27</b> mobile between an approximately horizontal position (plane X<sub>r</sub>Y<sub>r</sub>) and an approximately vertical position (plane Y<sub>r</sub>Z<sub>r</sub>). The two lateral slides <b>25</b> are disposed one on each side of the cover <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0086">These two lateral slides <b>25</b> cooperate with two semicircular recesses each including a central stud, said recesses being formed in the lateral edges at the top of the body <b>11</b>. They also correspond to two semi-cylindrical lateral edges <b>28</b> of the filter basket <b>17</b>. As a result, when the cover <b>18</b> is disposed on the filter basket <b>17</b> and on the body <b>11</b>, the lateral slides <b>25</b> of the cover <b>18</b> are positioned on the semi-cylindrical edges <b>28</b> of the filter basket <b>17</b>, coming to bear on the semicircular recesses of the body <b>11</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">Clearly the central stud slides in the circular arc conduit of the corresponding lateral slide <b>25</b> and, depending on whether the extraction handle <b>27</b> is vertical or horizontal, the central stud is released or locked into the circular arc conduit. The filter chamber <b>16</b> comprising the filter basket <b>17</b> and the cover <b>18</b> is therefore fastened to or released from the body <b>11</b> of the cleaning unit <b>10</b>, depending on whether the extraction handle <b>27</b> is horizontal or vertical.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0088">When horizontal, the extraction handle <b>27</b> fits in and is at least partially inserted in a recess <b>29</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>10</b></figref>) provided for this purpose in the upper surface of the cover <b>17</b>. In this position, the extraction handle <b>27</b> is held in place on the cover <b>18</b> by a retaining device <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>10</b></figref>). Here this retaining device <b>30</b> takes the form of a wide button that can be actuated manually, mobile in rotation about a transverse axis (axis Y<sub>r</sub>) between a first position and a second position, urged towards the first position by a torsion spring, and a part of the central lower surface of which is then located above a corresponding part of the surface of the extraction handle <b>27</b>, therefore locking the latter.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">A torsion spring (not visible in the figures) is mounted between the cover <b>18</b> and the extraction handle <b>27</b> at the articulation points of the arms <b>26</b> of the extraction handle <b>27</b>. This torsion spring is configured to urge the extraction handle towards its vertical position, whilst enabling a user of normal strength to push said extraction handle <b>27</b> easily towards its horizontal position.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">As a result, when the mobile handle <b>27</b> is moved to the vertical position, the cover <b>18</b> and the filter basket <b>17</b> can be removed from the body <b>11</b> by the user. The extraction handle <b>27</b> is locked by the retaining device <b>30</b> on the cover <b>18</b> when the filter basket <b>17</b> is inserted in the body <b>11</b> to prevent any risk of the filter basket <b>17</b> moving when the cleaning unit <b>10</b> is in operation.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Variants</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0091">In a variant embodiment the holding handle <b>15</b> is further mobile between a deployed position and a position folded against the body of the cleaning unit.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">A torsion spring type return spring on the axis of the holding handle <b>15</b> urges the holding handle toward its deployed position.
