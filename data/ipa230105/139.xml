The cylindrical filter typically comprises one or more plugs of a fibrous filtration material, such as cellulose acetate tow, circumscribed by a paper plug wrap. Conventionally, the wrapped tobacco rod and the filter are joined by a band of tipping wrapper, normally formed of an opaque paper material that circumscribes the entire length of the filter and an adjacent portion of the wrapped tobacco rod.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosol-generating articles in which an aerosol-generating substrate, such as a tobacco-containing substrate, is heated rather than combusted, are also known in the art. Typically in such articles an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a heat source to a physically separate aerosol-generating substrate or material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By way of example, aerosol-generating articles have been proposed wherein an aerosol is generated by electrical heating of an aerosol-generating substrate. A number of prior art documents disclose aerosol-generating devices for consuming aerosol-generating articles. Such devices include, for example, electrically heated aerosol-generating devices in which an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from one or more electrical heater elements of the aerosol-generating device to the aerosol-generating substrate of a heated aerosol-generating article. As another example, aerosol-generating articles are also known wherein an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a combustible fuel element or heat source to an aerosol-generating substrate. The combustible fuel element or heat source may be located in contact with, within, around, or downstream of the aerosol-generating substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During use of one such aerosol-generating article, volatile compounds are released from the aerosol-generating substrate by heat transfer and are entrained in air drawn through the aerosol-generating article. As the released compounds cool, they condense to form an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, aerosol-generating articles of the types described may include a mouthpiece comprising a porous filtration material, such as cellulose acetate. In some known aerosol-generating articles a hollow tubular segment formed of a filtration material such as cellulose acetate is provided at a location between the aerosol-generating substrate and the mouth end of the article to impart structural strength to the article.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Cellulose acetate and many other commonly used filtration materials are not highly biodegradable. However, alternative dispersible or degradable materials are often not able to provide an acceptable filtration efficiency and smoking experience for the consumer. Furthermore, many known dispersible and degradable materials are unsuitable for use in the existing manufacturing processes, and would require too significant a modification of the existing methods and equipment to make their use commercially feasible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would be desirable to provide a novel and improved aerosol-generating article that has enhanced biodegradation properties compared to known articles including conventional filtration materials such as cellulose acetate. It would be particularly desirable to provide such a novel aerosol-generating article that provides an improved smoking experience to the consumer. It would be further desirable to provide one such aerosol-generating article wherein the resistance to draw (RTD) of a filtration material segment can be adjusted so as to achieve an acceptable RTD of the article as a whole. Further, it would be desirable to provide such an aerosol-generating article that can effectively be produced in an automated, high-speed manufacturing process without requiring major modifications of existing equipment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates to an aerosol-generating article for producing an inhalable aerosol upon heating or combustion. The aerosol-generating article may comprise a rod of aerosol-generating substrate and a filter segment in axial alignment with the rod. The filter segment may comprise a filtration material formed of a plurality of fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) compound. The fibres of the PHA compound may have a denier per filament (dpf) of between 5.0 and 12.0.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the present disclosure relates to a filter for an aerosol-generating article. The filter may comprise at least one filter segment of filtration material. The filter segment may comprise a filtration material formed of a plurality of fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) compound. The fibres comprising the PHA compound may have a denier per filament (dpf) of between 5.0 and 12.0.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention there is provided an aerosol-generating article comprising an aerosol-generating substrate and a filter in axial alignment with the aerosol-generating substrate, the filter comprising at least one filter segment of filtration material comprising a plurality of fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) compound. The denier per filament (dpf) of the fibres is between about 5.0 and about 12.0.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention there is further provided a filter comprising at least one filter segment of filtration material comprising a plurality of fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) compound. The denier per filament (DPF) of the fibres is between about 5.0 and about 12.0.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;aerosol-generating article&#x201d; is used herein with reference to the invention to describe an article wherein an aerosol-generating substrate is heated or combusted to produce and deliver an aerosol to a consumer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol-generating substrate&#x201d; denotes a substrate capable of releasing volatile compounds upon heating or combusting to generate an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A conventional cigarette is lit when a user applies a flame to one end of the cigarette and draws air through the other end. The localised heat provided by the flame and the oxygen in the air drawn through the cigarette causes the end of the cigarette to ignite, and the resulting combustion generates an inhalable smoke. By contrast, in heated aerosol-generating articles, an aerosol is generated by heating a flavour generating substrate, such as, for example, a tobacco-based substrate or a substrate containing an aerosol-former and a flavouring. Known heated aerosol-generating articles include, for example, electrically heated aerosol-generating articles and aerosol-generating articles in which an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a combustible fuel element or heat source to a physically separate aerosol forming material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The filter of the present invention finds particular application as the filter of mouthpiece in a heated aerosol-generating article in which the aerosol-generating substrate is heated to generate an aerosol, without combustion of the substrate. However, the filter of the present invention is also suitable for use as the filter of a combustible smoking article in which the aerosol-generating substrate is combusted during use to generate a smoke.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol-generating substrate&#x201d; describes a substrate capable of releasing, upon heating (including combustion), volatile compounds, which can form an aerosol. The aerosol generated from aerosol-generating substrates may be visible or invisible and may include vapours (for example, fine particles of substances, which are in a gaseous state, that are ordinarily liquid or solid at room temperature) as well as gases and liquid droplets of condensed vapours. As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d; encompasses the aerosol produced upon heating of a substrate in a heated aerosol-generating article and the smoke produced upon combustion of a substrate in a combustible smoking article.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As defined above, the present invention provides a filter for an aerosol-generating article, the filter comprising at least one filter segment comprising a filtration material formed with a plurality of fibres comprising a PHA compound having a value of denier per filament within the range of about 5.0 to 12.0. The PHA containing fibres are referred to below as the &#x201c;PHA fibres&#x201d;. The filter segment comprising the plurality of PHA containing fibres is referred to below as the &#x201c;PHA filter segment&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">PHAs are a family of polyhydroxyesters of 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-hydroxyalkanoic acids, which are produced by a variety of bacterial species under nutrient-limiting conditions with excess carbon and are found as discrete cytoplasmic inclusions in bacterial cells. A PHA molecule is typically made up of 600 to 35,000 (R)-hydroxy fatty acid monomer units. Depending on the total number of carbon atoms within a PHA monomer, PHA can be classified as either short-chain length PHA (scl-PHA; 3 to 5 carbon atoms), medium-chain length PHA (mcl-PHA; 6 to 14 carbon atoms), or long-chain length PHA (lcl-PHA; 15 or more carbon atoms).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As PHA fibres have a much higher level of biodegradability compared with fibres of other filtration materials, such as cellulose acetate, articles in accordance with the present invention are more biodegradable as a whole. At the same time, as PHA fibres are obtained by means of a natural, fermentation process, aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention also provide improved sustainability for the production process.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with the invention, the filter segment is formed with PHA fibres having a relatively high denier per filament (dpf) of between about 5.0 and about 12.0. By providing a relatively high fibre weight, with a dpf within this range, the PHA filter segment has been found to provide an improved level of retention of water from the aerosol passing through the filter. In particular, the PHA filter segment can capture and retain a greater proportion of water from the aerosol than an equivalent filter segment formed of cellulose acetate tow. This property of the PHA filter segment may be especially desirable in aerosol-generating articles in which the aerosol-generating substrate is heated, rather than combusted, to produce an aerosol. The aerosol generated from such heated aerosol-generating articles may have a relatively high water content, for example, due to inclusion of additional humectants such as glycerin or polypropylene glycol which release additional water.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the improved retention of water by the PHA filter segment has been advantageously found to improve the sensorial experience to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The provision of a PHA filter segment having PHA fibres with a relatively high dpf of between 5.0 and 12.0 has additionally been found to provide a relatively low resistance to draw (RTD), which may be desirable for the design of certain filters, for example where a low filtration efficiency is preferred. The PHA filter segment preferably provides a filtration efficiency of less than 50 percent or more preferably less than 30 percent. The provision of a relatively low RTD may be particularly desirable for heated aerosol-generating articles in which the aerosol-generating substrate is heated rather than combusted to produce an aerosol. In such articles, the use of the PHA filter segment as defined above can advantageously optimise the sensorial experience for the consumer, due to the low filtration efficiency.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The provision of a relatively low RTD may additionally be desirable where a relatively long filter segment is required. This may be the case, for example, where the filter is combined with an aerosol-generating substrate that is relatively short, as in certain heated aerosol-generating articles. Due to the low RTD, a relatively long PHA filter segment can be incorporated without increasing the overall RTD of the aerosol-generating article above acceptable levels to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the provision of a relatively low RTD may be beneficial to the consumer in reducing the potential impact on the smoking experience of blocking the ventilation holes provided on the aerosol-generating article. For example, the ventilation holes may be blocked due to incorrect insertion of an aerosol-generating article into an aerosol-generating device during use. Similarly, the provision of a relatively low RTD may be desirable in aerosol-generating article where a non-porous outer wrapper is used. In both cases, the RTD will remain sufficiently low to provide an acceptable smoking experience, even without the provision of ventilation to the aerosol-generating article.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">PHA fibres having a dpf value of between 5.0 and 12.0 may have a significantly larger cross section than conventionally used fibres, such as cellulose acetate fibres. The inclusion of relatively large PHA fibres within the PHA filter segment results in a relatively low exposed surface area within the PHA filter segment since the number of fibres required to form the PHA filter segment will be lower than for fibres having a lower dpf. By minimising the exposed surface area, the degree of exposure of the PHA fibres to potentially undesirable factors such as moisture, gases or bacteria, can also be minimised. This may advantageously improve the stability of the filter under certain storage conditions, thereby providing an improvement in the shelf life of the aerosol-generating article.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Filters formed with PHA fibres have also been found to provide a good filter hardness, which can be further enhanced by circumscribing the filter segment with a stiff plug wrap.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The denier per filament, corresponding to the average denier of an individual PHA fibre within the filter, is between about 5.0 and about 12.0. The term &#x201c;denier per filament&#x201d; (dpf) corresponds to the weight in grams of a single fibre or filament having a length of 9000 metres. In the present invention, the value of dpf therefore gives an indication of the thickness of each of the individual PHA fibres within the filter segment. The denier per filament is expressed in units of denier, where 1 denier corresponds to 1 gram per 9000 metres. The dpf of a filter or filter segment can be readily determined based on the measurement of weight and length of a sample of representative fibres from the filter or filter segment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The denier per filament (dpf) of the PHA fibres is therefore at least about 5.0. Preferably, the dpf is at least about 5.5, more preferably at least about 6.0, more preferably at least about 6.5, more preferably at least about 7.0.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The denier per filament (dpf) of the PHA fibres is additionally no greater than 12.0. Preferably, the dpf is no greater than about 11.0, more preferably no greater than about 10.0, more preferably no greater than about 9.0, more preferably no greater than about 8.0.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain embodiments, the denier per filament (dpf) may be up to about 15.0. For example, the denier per filament (dpf) may be between about 5.0 and about 15.0.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the denier per filament may be between about 5.5 and about 11.0, or between about 6.0 and about 10.0, or between about 6.5 and about 9.0, or between about 7.0 and about 8.0.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other embodiments, the denier per filament may be between about 5.0 and about 7.5, or between about 5.0 and about 7.0, or between about 5.0 and about 6.5, or between about 5.0 and about 6.0, or about 5.5.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other embodiments, the denier per filament may be between about 7.0 and about 10.0, or between about 7.5 and about 10.0, or between about 8.0 and about 9.5, or between about 8.0 and about 9.0, or about 8.0.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the total denier of the filtration material comprising the PHA fibres is between about 10,000 and about 40,000 more preferably between about 15,000 and about 35,000, more preferably between about 15,000 and about 30,000, more preferably between about 20,000 and about 30,000. The &#x201c;total denier&#x201d; of the filtration material defines the total weight in grams of 9000 metres of the combined fibres forming the filtration material. The total denier for the filter segment therefore corresponds to the denier per filament multiplied by the total number of fibres in the filter segment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The transverse cross-sectional shape of the PHA fibres may be varied, for example, in order to control the external surface area of the fibres within the filter. By controlling the external surface area of the PHA fibres, the total surface area of the PHA fibres that is exposed to the aerosol as it passes through the filter segment may also be controlled. This in turn will control to some extent the filtration properties of the PHA fibres, for example, the amount of water that is adsorbed by the fibres.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The total external surface area of the PHA fibres within the filter segment is preferably between about 0.08 square metres per gram and about 0.21 square metres per gram, more preferably between about 0.10 square metres per gram and about 0.18 square metres per gram, more preferably between about 0.12 square metres per gram and about 0.15 square metres per gram.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The PHA fibres may have a substantially round cross-section. In such embodiments, the total external surface area of the PHA fibres within the filter segment is preferably between about 0.08 square metres per gram and about 0.12 square metres per gram.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The PHA fibres may have a Y-shaped cross-section. In such embodiments, the total external surface are of the PHA fibres within the filter segment is preferably between about 0.15 square metres per gram and about 0.21 square metres per gram.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The PHA fibres provided within the filter of the aerosol-generating articles according to the invention may be formed of any suitable PHA compound, including PHA polymers or copolymers. Suitable PHA compounds include but are not limited to: polyhydroxypropionate, polyhydroxyvalerate, polyhydroxybutyrate, polyhydroxyhexanoate and polyhydroxyoctanoate. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the PHA compound is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The PHA filter segment preferably comprises at least about 5 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 10 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 20 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 30 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 40 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 50 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 60 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 70 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 80 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 90 percent by weight of the PHA fibres, more preferably at least about 95 percent by weight of the PHA fibres.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The remainder of the fibres within the PHA filter segment may comprise any suitable material. Suitable fibrous materials would be known to the skilled person and include but are not limited to polylactic acid (PLA) and cellulose acetate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The PHA filter segment is therefore formed with a relatively high level of PHA fibres. This provides an enhanced biodegradability of the filter and of the aerosol-generating article as a whole. As described above, it has previously been found to be technically challenging to form filter segments with a high proportion of degradable polymers, which provide acceptable filtration properties. However, the inventors have surprisingly found that it is possible to produce a filter segment incorporating a relatively high level of PHA fibres that provides desirable levels of filtration properties such as filtration efficiency and resistance to draw.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The PHA fibres of the filter according to the invention may be produced using any suitable method. Suitable techniques for the manufacture of PHA fibres would be known to the skilled person and include but are not limited to melt spinning, gel spinning and electrospinning. Preferably, the PHA fibres are produced by melt spinning. Melt spinning is often regarded as the most economical process of spinning, since no solvent needs to be recovered or evaporated, as is by contrast the case with solution spinning. Further, the spinning rate with melt spinning is generally fairly high, which is advantageous in terms of overall productivity and manufacturing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The PHA fibres may optionally be crimped, in the same way as cellulose acetate fibres in existing filter segments.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The PHA filter segment may be formed of a fibrous filtration material formed with PHA fibres only. However, in certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the PHA fibres may be combined with a plurality of fibres of an additional biodegradable polymer to form the filter segment. For example, the filter segment preferably comprises at least about 5 percent by weight of at least one biodegradable polymer selected from the group consisting of starch, polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutyrate adipate terephthalate (PBAT), thermoplastic starch and thermoplastic starch blends (TPS), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyglycolide (PGA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH/PVA), viscose, regenerated cellulose, polysaccharides, cellulose acetate with a degree of substitution (DS) of less than 2.1, polyamides, protein-based biopolymers, chitosan-chitin based biopolymers, and combinations thereof. The inventors have found that including one or more of these ingredients in the blend from which the fibrous material of the filter segment is formed further contributes to enhancing biodegradability of the filter segment and of the aerosol-generating article as a whole.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In preferred embodiments, the PHA filter segment comprises at least about 10 percent by weight of one such additional biodegradable polymer.

PHA fibres generally provide a good filtration efficiency for undesirable smoke constituents but are less effective at the removal of phenolic compounds. By incorporating a compound that specifically reduces the level of phenolic compounds in the aerosol generated from the aerosol-generating substrate, it is possible to further optimise the filtration capabilities of the filter according to the invention comprising PHA fibres.

In some cases, the filters to be tested may be long enough such that only ten aerosol-generating articles are needed to form twenty contact points, with each smoking article contacting both load applying rods (because they are long enough to extend between the rods). In other cases, if the filters are too short to achieve this, then twenty aerosol-generating articles should be used to form the twenty contact points, with each aerosol-generating article contacting only one of the load applying rods, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">Two further stationary cylindrical rods are located underneath the aerosol-generating articles, to support the aerosol-generating articles and counteract the load applied by each of the load applying cylindrical rods.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">For the standard operating procedure for such an apparatus, an overall load of 2 kg is applied for a duration of 20 seconds.
