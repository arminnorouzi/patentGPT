of priority to European patent application no. 21183811.5, filed Jul. 5, 2021, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure herein generally relates to charged-particle devices, detectors, and methods.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) chips, undesired pattern defects, as a consequence of, for example, optical effects and incidental particles, inevitably occur on a substrate (i.e. wafer) or a mask during the fabrication processes, thereby reducing the yield. Monitoring the extent of the undesired pattern defects is therefore an important process in the manufacture of IC chips. More generally, the inspection and/or measurement of a surface of a substrate, or other object/material, is an important process during and/or after its manufacture.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pattern inspection tools with a charged particle beam have been used to inspect objects, for example to detect pattern defects. These tools typically use electron microscopy techniques, such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In a SEM, a primary electron beam of electrons at a relatively high energy is targeted with a final deceleration step in order to land on a sample at a relatively low landing energy. The beam of electrons is focused as a probing spot on the sample. The interactions between the material structure at the probing spot and the landing electrons from the beam of electrons cause electrons to be emitted from the surface, such as secondary electrons, backscattered electrons or Auger electrons. The generated secondary electrons may be emitted from the material structure of the sample. By scanning the primary electron beam as the probing spot over the sample surface, secondary electrons can be emitted across the surface of the sample. By collecting these emitted secondary electrons from the sample surface, a pattern inspection tool may obtain data representing characteristics of the material structure of the surface of the sample. The data may be referred to as an image and may be rendered into an image.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the data obtained in this way can be useful, there are limitations in the information obtained about the sample from such known electron microscopy techniques.

The following description refers to the accompanying drawings in which the same numbers in different drawings represent the same or similar elements unless otherwise represented. The implementations set forth in the following description of exemplary embodiments do not represent all implementations consistent with the invention. Instead, they are merely examples of apparatuses and methods consistent with aspects related to the invention as recited in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The enhanced computing power of electronic devices, which reduces the physical size of the devices, can be accomplished by significantly increasing the packing density of circuit components such as transistors, capacitors, diodes, etc. on an IC chip. This has been enabled by increased resolution enabling yet smaller structures to be made. For example, an IC chip of a smart phone, which is the size of a thumbnail and available in, or earlier than, 2019, may include over 2 billion transistors, the size of each transistor being less than 1/1000th of a human hair. Thus, it is not surprising that semiconductor IC manufacturing is a complex and time-consuming process, with hundreds of individual steps. Errors in even one step have the potential to dramatically affect the functioning of the final product. Just one &#x201c;killer defect&#x201d; can cause device failure. The goal of the manufacturing process is to improve the overall yield of the process. For example, to obtain a 75% yield for a 50-step process (where a step can indicate the number of layers formed on a wafer), each individual step must have a yield greater than 99.4%. If each individual step had a yield of 95%, the overall process yield would be as low as 7%.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">While high process yield is desirable in an IC chip manufacturing facility, maintaining a high substrate (i.e. wafer) throughput, defined as the number of substrates processed per hour, is also essential. High process yield and high substrate throughput can be impacted by the presence of a defect. This is especially true if operator intervention is required for reviewing the defects. Thus, high throughput detection and identification of micro and nano-scale defects by inspection tools (such as a Scanning Electron Microscope (&#x2032;SEM)) is essential for maintaining high yield and low cost.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A SEM comprises a scanning device and a detector apparatus. The scanning device comprises an illumination apparatus that comprises an electron source, for generating primary electrons, and a projection apparatus for scanning a sample, such as a substrate, with one or more focused beams of primary electrons. Together at least the illumination apparatus, or illumination system, and the projection apparatus, or projection system, may be referred to together as the electron-optical system or apparatus. The primary electrons interact with the sample and generate secondary electrons. The detection apparatus captures the secondary electrons from the sample as the sample is scanned so that the SEM can create an image of the scanned area of the sample. For high throughput inspection, some of the inspection apparatuses use multiple focused primary beams, i.e. a multi-beam, of primary electrons. The component beams of the multi-beam may be referred to as sub-beams or beamlets or an array of primary beams. A multi-beam can scan different parts of a sample simultaneously. A multi-beam inspection apparatus can therefore inspect a sample at a much higher speed than a single-beam inspection apparatus. An implementation of a known multi-beam inspection apparatus is described below.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary charged particle beam inspection apparatus <b>100</b>.

The skilled person would understand that the backscatter signal particles may more generally be described as secondary signal particles.

In other words, the secondary signal particles will be understood to be particles having kinetic energy &#x2264;50 eV when emitted from the sampled and the backscatter signal particles will be understood to be particles having kinetic energy higher than 50 eV when emitted from the sample. In practice, the signal particles may be accelerated before being detected and thus, the energy range associated with the signal particles may be slightly higher. For example, the secondary signal particles will be understood to be particles having kinetic energy 200 eV when detected at a detector and the backscatter signal particles will be understood to be particles having kinetic energy higher than 200 eV when detected at a detector. It is noted that the 200 eV value may vary depending on the extent of acceleration of the particles, and may for example be approximately 100 eV or 300 eV.

Multi-beam systems are known and are beneficial as the throughput can be much higher than when using single-beam systems, e.g. the throughput of a multi-beam inspection system may be 100 times higher than the throughput in a single-beam inspection system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In known multi-beam systems, an array of primary sub-beams of charged particles at a relatively high energy are targeted with a final deceleration step in order to land on a sample at a relatively low landing energy for detection of secondary signal particles as mentioned above. However, in practice, it has not generally been possible to use multi beam inspection in combination with backscatter detection, or at least by direct backscatter detection, i.e. presently known multi-beam systems rely primarily on detection of secondary signal particles. However, there are limitations in the information which can be obtained solely from secondary signal particles. Backscatter signal particles provide information about structures below the surface, such as buried defects. Additionally, backscatter signals can be used to measure overlay targets.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, backscatter signal particles have a large range of energies, typically between 0 eV and the landing energy. The backscatter signal particles have a large range in energy (for example up to the landing energy of the primary beam) and wide angle of emitted backscatter signal particles. Secondary signal particles typically have a more restricted energy range and tend to be distributed around an energy value. The large energy range and wide angle of emitted backscatter signal particles results in crosstalk in a multi-beam system. Crosstalk occurs when backscatter signal particles resulting from one primary sub-beam are detected at a detector assigned to a different sub-beam. Crosstalk generally occurs very close to the sample <b>208</b>, i.e. proximate the sample onto which the primary beam is projected. Due to the crosstalk, previously known multi-beam assessment tools have not been able to effectively image backscatter signals. As a consequence, it has not been possible to increase the throughput for backscattered detection by using multi-beam systems.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Components of an assessment tool <b>40</b> which may be used in an embodiment of the present invention are described below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> which is a schematic diagram of an assessment tool <b>40</b>.

Thus, dispersion only occurs within the Einzel lens itself (between entry and exit electrodes of the lens), thereby limiting off-axis chromatic aberrations. When the thickness of the condenser lenses is low, e.g. a few mm, such aberrations have a small or negligible effect. More generally, the condenser lens array <b>231</b> may have two or more plate electrodes each with an array of apertures that are aligned. Each plate electrode array is mechanically connected to, and electrically isolated from, an adjacent plate electrode array by an isolating element, such as a spacer which may comprise ceramic or glass. The condenser lens array may be connected and/or spaced apart from an adjacent charged particle-optical element, preferably an electrostatic charged particle-optical element, by an isolating element such as a spacer as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The condenser lenses may be separated from a module containing the objective lenses (such as an objective lens array assembly as discussed elsewhere herein). In a case where the potential applied on a bottom surface of the condenser lenses is different than the potential applied on the top surface of the module containing the objective lenses an isolating element (e.g. a spacer) is used to space apart the condenser lenses and the module containing the objective lenses. In a case where the potential is equal then a conductive element can be used to space apart the condenser lenses and the module containing the objective lenses.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each condenser lens <b>231</b> in the array directs a primary beam of charged particles into a respective sub-beam <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> which is focused at a respective intermediate focus down beam of the condenser lens array. The respective sub-beams are projected along respective sub-beam paths <b>220</b>. The sub-beams diverge with respect to each other.

The deflectors <b>235</b> are configured to operate on the respective sub-beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b>. The deflectors <b>235</b> are configured to bend a respective sub-beam <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> by an amount effective to ensure that the principal ray (which may also be referred to as the beam axis) is incident on the sample <b>208</b> substantially normally (i.e. at substantially 90&#xb0; to the nominal surface of the sample). The deflectors <b>235</b> may also be referred to as collimators or collimator deflectors.

Suitable collimators are deflectors disclosed in European patent application publication no.

The sub-beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> having passed through the deflectors <b>235</b> are substantially parallel on entry to the control lens array <b>250</b>. The control lenses pre-focus the sub-beams (e.g. apply a focusing action to the sub-beams prior to the sub-beams reaching the objective lens array <b>241</b>). The pre-focusing may reduce divergence of the sub-beams or increase a rate of convergence of the sub-beams. The control lens array <b>250</b> and the objective lens array <b>241</b> operate together to provide a combined focal length. Combined operation without an intermediate focus may reduce the risk of aberrations.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In further detail, it is desirable to use the control lens array <b>250</b> to determine the landing energy. However, it is possible to use in addition the objective lens array <b>240</b> to control the landing energy. In such a case, a potential difference over the objective lens is changed when a different landing energy is selected. One example of a situation where it is desirable to partly change the landing energy by changing the potential difference over the objective lens is to prevent the focus of the sub-beams getting too close to the objective lenses. In such a situation there is a risk of components of the objective lens array <b>241</b> having to be too thin to be manufacturable. The same may be said about a detector at this location, for example in, on or otherwise associated with the objective lens. This situation can for example occur in case the landing energy is lowered. This is because the focal length of the objective lens roughly scales with the landing energy used. By lowering the potential difference over the objective lens, and thereby lowering the electric field inside the objective lens, the focal length of the objective lens is made larger again, resulting in a focus position further below the objective lens. Note that use of just an objective lens would limit control of magnification. Such an arrangement could not control demagnification and/or opening angle. Further, using the objective lens to control the landing energy could mean that the objective lens would be operating away from its optimal field strength. That is unless mechanical parameters of the objective lens (such as the spacing between its electrodes) could be adjusted, for example by exchanging the objective lens.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The control lens array <b>250</b> comprises a plurality of control lenses. Each control lens comprises at least two electrodes (e.g. two or three electrodes) connected to respective potential sources. The control lens array <b>250</b> may comprise two or more (e.g. three) plate electrode arrays connected to respective potential sources. The control lens array electrodes may be spaced a few millimeters (e.g. 3 mm) apart. The control lens array <b>250</b> is associated with the objective lens array <b>241</b> (e.g. the two arrays are positioned close to each other and/or mechanically connected to each other and/or controlled together as a unit). Each control lens may be associated with a respective objective lens. The control lens array <b>250</b> is positioned up-beam of the objective lens array <b>241</b>. Up-beam may be defined as being closer to the source <b>201</b>. Up-beam may otherwise be defined as further from the sample <b>208</b>. The control lens array <b>250</b> may be in the same module as an objective lens array <b>241</b>, i.e. forming an objective lens array assembly or objective lens arrangement, or it may be in a separate module. In this case, the arrangement may be described as four or more lens electrodes that are plates. In the plates are defined apertures, for example as aperture arrays, which are aligned with a number of sub-beams in a corresponding beam array. The electrodes may be grouped into two or more electrodes, for example to provide a control electrode group, and an objective electrode group. In an arrangement the objective electrode group has at least three electrodes and the control electrode group has at least two electrodes. Alternatively, if the control lens array <b>250</b> and the objective lens array <b>240</b> are separate, the spacing between the control lens array <b>241</b> and the objective lens array <b>250</b> (i.e. the gap between lower electrode of the control lens array <b>250</b> and the upper electrode of the objective lens <b>241</b>) can be selected from a wide range, e.g. from 2 mm to 200 mm or more.

The detector being proximate the sample enables the risk of cross-talk in detection of backscatter signal particles generated by sub-beams which correspond to another detector in the detector array to be reduced if not avoided.

This may be beneficial in positioning the at least one detector in a location in which the at least one detector is more likely to detect backscatter particles than secondary particles. For example, the at least one detector array may be provided on an output side of the objective lens array <b>241</b>.

The detector array <b>240</b> is preferably very close to the sample <b>208</b> such that there is a proximity focus of backscatter signal particles at the detector array. As previously described, the energy and angular spread of the backscatter signal particles is generally so large that it is difficult (or impossible in known prior art systems) to keep the signals from neighboring sub-beams separated. However, the proximity focus means that backscatter signal particles can be detected at a relevant one of the detectors without cross-talk (i.e. interference from neighboring sub-beams) in the first aspect. Of course, there is a minimum distance between the sample <b>208</b> and the detector array <b>240</b>. However, it is preferable to reduce this distance as much as possible. Certain configurations may benefit from reducing the distance even more than others.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, a distance &#x2018;L&#x2019; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, between the detector array <b>240</b> and the sample <b>208</b> is less than or equal to approximately 50 &#x3bc;m, i.e. the detector array <b>240</b> is positioned within approximately 50 &#x3bc;m from the sample <b>208</b>. Although is generally preferably that the distance L is small (e.g. between around 10 to 65 microns), as this can improve detector efficiency and/or reduce crosstalk, the distance may be greater. For example, the distance L may be approximately 100 microns or less, or approximately 200 microns or less. The distance L is determined as the distance from a surface of the sample <b>208</b> facing the detector array <b>240</b> and a surface of the detector array <b>241</b> facing the sample <b>208</b>. Providing a distance of approximately 50 &#x3bc;m or less is beneficial in that cross-talk between backscatter signal particles can be avoided or minimized. Theoretically, there may be a lower limit of how close the sample <b>208</b> and the detector array <b>240</b> can be whilst allowing these components to move relative to each other and this may mean that the distance L might be more than approximately 5 &#x3bc;m or 10 &#x3bc;m. For example, a distance L of approximately 50 &#x3bc;m or less may be used whilst still allowing relatively reliable control of the device as shown as part of the tool in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A distance L of approximately 30 &#x3bc;m or less may be preferable for other configurations, such as those shown and described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> below. A preferred range of the distance L between the detector array <b>240</b> and the sample <b>208</b> may be between approximately 5 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m, or preferably between approximately 5 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, or preferably between approximately 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, or preferably between approximately 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, or preferably between approximately 30 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m. In an arrangement the detector array <b>240</b> may be actuatable relative to the objective lens array <b>241</b>, i.e. to vary the distance L, for example to substantially maintain a distance between the sample and the detector array L. It is noted that the distance L described here is for a multi-beam system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The same distance may be used in a single beam device, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, although the distance L may be larger for the single beam device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The backscatter signal particles are emitted from the sample <b>208</b> with a very large energy spread, and typically with an angular spread following a cosine distribution which may take the appearance in three dimensions of a cone. The further the distance from sample <b>208</b> to the detector array <b>240</b>, the larger the cone of the emitted beam becomes. It will be understood that the backscatter signal particles can have all angles. The cone of the emitted beam is the solid angle assignable to the detector associated with a respective beam, so that this solid angle is larger with greater proximity of the sample and the detector. Because of the very large energy spread it may not be possible to image the backscatter signal particles coming from the different sub-beams onto a detector without introducing significant cross talk. The solution is to place the detector in close proximity to the substrate and choose the pitch of the sub-beams such that the backscatter signal particle signals of the neighbouring sub-beams to not overlay.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, the pitch size, P, as discussed above may be selected depending on the distance between the detector array <b>240</b> and the sample <b>208</b> (or vice versa). For example only, for a distance L between the sample <b>208</b> and the detector array <b>240</b> of approximately 50 microns, the sub-beam pitch p may be equal to or larger than approximately 300 microns. Such a combination may be particularly useful for detecting high energy signal particles, e.g. backscatter signal particles, with an accelerating lens. For example only, for a distance L between the sample <b>208</b> and the detector array <b>240</b> of approximately 10 microns, the sub-beam pitch p may be equal to or larger than approximately 60 microns. Providing a closer detector array allows use of a smaller sub-beam pitch p. This may be beneficial in using certain configurations in which the sub-beam pitch is beneficially smaller, such as the configuration described in relation to, and shown in, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> below. In a different example arrangement the distance between the sample <b>208</b> an the detector array <b>240</b> is approximately 50 microns and the sub-beam pitch p is approximately 60 microns. Such a different set up is intended for different operational settings and to detect a different type of signal particle. For example, such a combination may be particularly useful for detecting low energy signal particles, e.g. secondary signal particles, with a decelerating lens. For simultaneous detection of high energy particles (e.g. backscatter signal particles) and low energy particles (e.g. secondary signal particles), the pitch p and distance L may be selected between the values described above so that the high energy particle and low energy particle signals are sufficiently large. It will be noted that there is no relation or limitation for the distance L and the pitch p for the functioning of the detector. However, due to a risk of crosstalk in neighboring detectors it might be preferable to use a larger pitch p for a larger distance L. Although, there may also be other ways to reduce the risk of crosstalk and any appropriate combination of pitch p and distance L may be used.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The detector array <b>240</b> (and optionally the objective lens array <b>241</b>) may be configured to repel secondary signal particles emitted from the sample <b>208</b>. This is beneficial as it reduces the number of secondary signal particles emitted from the sample <b>208</b> which travel back towards the detector array <b>240</b>. The difference in potential between the detector array <b>240</b> and the sample <b>208</b> can be selected to repel signal particles emitted from the sample <b>208</b> away from the detector array <b>240</b>. Preferably, the detector array potential may be the same as the potential of the downbeam electrode of the objective lens array. The potential difference between the sample potential and the detector array potential is preferably relatively small so that primary sub-beams are projected through or past the detector array <b>240</b> to the sample <b>208</b> without being significantly affected. Additionally, a small potential difference will have a negligible effect on the path of a backscatter signal particle (which generally has a greater energy up to the landing energy), meaning that the backscatter signal particles can still be detected whilst reducing or avoiding detection of secondary signal particles. The potential difference between the sample potential and the detector array potential is preferably greater than a secondary signal particle threshold. The secondary signal particle threshold may determine the minimum initial energy of secondary signal particles that can still reach the detector. Preferably, the secondary signal particle threshold is the potential difference equivalent to the likely energy of a secondary signal particle emanating from the sample <b>208</b>. That is the relatively small potential difference between the sample and detector array potentials is sufficient to repel the secondary signal particles from the detector array. For example, the potential difference between the sample potential and the detector array potential may be approximately 20 V, 50 V, 100 V, 150 V, 200 V, 250 V, or 300V.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The objective lens array <b>241</b> may be configured to accelerate the primary charged particles (i.e. the sub-beams) towards the sample <b>208</b> along the sub-beam paths <b>220</b>. Accelerating the sub-beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> projected onto the sample <b>208</b> is beneficial in that it can be used to generate an array of sub-beams with high landing energy. The potentials of the electrodes of the objective lens array can be selected to provide acceleration through the objective lens array <b>241</b>. It is noted that an accelerating lens in the arrangement may be particularly useful for detecting ranges (e.g. different energy ranges) of backscatter signal particles. Alternatively, the objective lens array may be configured to decelerate the primary charged particles towards the sample <b>208</b> along the sub-beam paths <b>220</b>. It is noted that a decelerating lens in the arrangement may be particularly useful for detecting both secondary and backscatter signal particles. The figures described below, and particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, show the objective lens in the accelerating mode. However, as will be understood from the description above, the objective lens may be used in the decelerating mode instead for any of the embodiments and variations described below. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref> could be adapted to decelerate the sub-beams through the objective lenses.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In an arrangement of accelerating objective lens array <b>241</b>, the low energy particles (e.g. secondary signal particles) generally cannot pass up-beam of the lower part of the accelerating objective lens. It is also increasing difficult for high energy particles (e.g. backscatter signal particles) to pass the accelerating objective lens. This is a key point for both accelerating and decelerating objective lenses. The energy difference between the low energy signal particles (e.g. secondary signal particles) and high energy signal particles (e.g. backscatter signal particles) is proportionately larger down-beam of the objective lens (in both accelerating and decelerating mode) than at any point up-beam of the objective lens. This is beneficial for detection using the detectors described below to distinguish between the different types of signal particles.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The potentials and the values of the potentials defined herein are defined with respect to the source; hence the potential of a charged particle at the surface of the sample may be referred to as a landing energy because the energy of a charged particle correlates to the potential of the charged particle and the potential of the charged particle at the sample is defined with respect to the source. However, as the potentials are relative values, the potentials could be defined relative to other components, such as the sample. In this instance, the difference in potential applied to different components would preferably be as discussed below with respect to the source. The potentials are applied to the relevant components, such as the electrodes and the samples during use, i.e. when the device is being operated.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">For example, the device being configured to accelerate the charged particle sub-beams and repel the secondary signal particles as described above may have potentials as shown in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with the values in Table 1 below.

The middle column may be provided for a smaller resolution than the right hand column. If the resolution is larger (as in the right hand column), the current per sub-beam is larger and therefore, the number of sub-beams may be lower. The advantage of using a larger resolution is that the time needed to scan a &#x201c;continuous area&#x201d; is shorter (which can be a practical constraint). So the overall throughput may be lower, but the time needed to scan the beam area is shorter (because the beam area is smaller).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Landing Energy</entry><entry>&#x3e;10-100 </entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V1 (or omitted)</entry><entry>1-10</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;&#x2002;5 keV</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2009;&#x2002;5 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V2</entry><entry>&#x3e;10-100</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>29.95 keV</entry><entry>29.95 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V3</entry><entry>1-10</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;&#x2002;5 keV</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2009;&#x2002;5 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V4</entry><entry>&#x3e;10-100</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V5</entry><entry>&#x3e;10-100</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;30 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V6</entry><entry>1 -30</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2003;4.4 keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2003;10 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V7</entry><entry>1-10</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2002;&#x2003;5 keV</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2009;&#x2002;5 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>V8</entry><entry>&#x3e;10-100</entry><entry>keV</entry><entry>29.95 keV</entry><entry>29.95 keV</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">For example, the device being configured to decelerate the charged particle sub-beams and repel the secondary signal particles as described above may have potentials as shown in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with the values in Table 2 below.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in an embodiment the charged particle beam tool <b>40</b> comprises a sample holder <b>207</b> supported by a motorized stage <b>209</b> to hold a sample <b>208</b> to be inspected. The charged particle beam tool <b>40</b> comprises an charged particle source <b>201</b>. The charged particle beam tool <b>40</b> further comprises a gun aperture <b>122</b>, a beam limit aperture <b>125</b> (or beam limiter), a condenser lens <b>126</b>, a column aperture <b>135</b>, an objective lens assembly <b>132</b>, and a charged particle detector <b>144</b> (which may otherwise be referred to as an electron detector). The objective lens assembly <b>132</b>, in some embodiments, may be a modified swing objective retarding immersion lens (SORIL), which includes a pole piece <b>132</b><i>a</i>, a control electrode <b>132</b><i>b</i>, a deflector <b>132</b><i>c</i>, and an exciting coil <b>132</b><i>d</i>. The control electrode <b>132</b><i>b </i>has an aperture formed in it for the passage of the charged particle beam. The control electrode <b>132</b><i>b </i>forms the surface facing the sample <b>208</b>. Although the charged particle beam tool <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a single beam system, in an embodiment a multi-beam system is provided. Such a multi-beam system may have the same features as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, such as the objective lens assembly <b>132</b>. Such a multi-beam system may have in addition beam limiter array, for example down-beam of the condenser lens, for generating the sub-beams. Associated with the beam limiter array, such as down beam of the beam limiter array, may be a number of charged particle array elements such a deflector array and a lens array for optimizing and adjusting the sub-beams and reducing aberrations of the sub-beams. Such a multi-beam system may have a secondary column for detecting signal charged particles. A Wien filter may be up-beam of the objective lens assembly to direct the signal particles towards a detector in the secondary column.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">In an imaging process, a charged particle beam emanating from the source <b>201</b> may pass through the gun aperture <b>122</b>, the beam limit aperture <b>125</b>, the condenser lens <b>126</b>, and be focused into a probe spot by the modified SORIL lens and then impinge onto the surface of sample <b>208</b>. The probe spot may be scanned across the surface of the sample <b>208</b> by the deflector <b>132</b><i>c </i>or other deflectors in the SORIL lens. Signal particles emanated from the sample surface may be collected by the charged particle detector <b>144</b> to form an image of an area of interest on the sample <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">The condenser and illumination optics of the charged particle beam tool <b>40</b> may comprise or be supplemented by electromagnetic quadrupole charged particle lenses.

The plurality of detector portions for each detector element (or sensor unit) is provided around an aperture. The plurality of detector portions may, together, have a circular perimeter and/or a diameter. The plurality of detector portions may, together, have an area extending between the aperture and the perimeter of the plurality of detector portions. The pluralities of detector elements may be arranged in rectangular array or a hexagonal array. The signal generated from signal particles captured by detector portions surrounding one aperture may be combined into a single signal or used to generate independent signals. The surfaces of the detector elements, optionally their detector portions, may substantially fill the surface of the substrate supporting the detector elements.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> a surface of a detector array or detector module facing, even proximate in use to, a sample features an array of detector elements (or an array of detectors). Each detector element is associated with an aperture. Each detector element is associated with an assigned surface area of the substrate of the detector module. As the substrate is layered, for example in having a CMOS structure, each layer within the substrate is positioned with respect to the respective detector elements, preferably proximately. Commercially available CMOS structures have a usual range of layers, for example three to ten, usually about five. (For example, two functional layers may be provided for ease of description. These two layers of wiring layer and logic layer may represent as many layers as required and each layer is not restricted to wiring or logic, respectively.) The number of layers is limited by commercial availability and any number of layers is feasible. However, in view of practicality, the substrate has a limited number of layers, in order for an efficient design the available space is limited.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">Ideally a circuit layer of the substrate, which can be the wiring layer and/or logic layer, has a portion assigned for each detector element (or detector). The assigned portions of the different layers may be referred to as a cell <b>550</b>. The arrangement of portions in the substrate for the full multi-beam arrangement may be referred to as a cell array <b>552</b>. The cells <b>550</b> may be same shape as the surface area assigned for each detector element, such as hexagonal, or any reasonable shape that may tesselate and may all be similar in shape and/or area, such as a rectangular shape. Having a rectangular or rectilinear shape can more readily be used by placing and routing design. Such design is commonly implemented by software that is suited to define chips with a rectangular type architecture with orthogonal directions, than architecture requiring acute or obtuse angles such as in a hexagonal architecture. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> the cells <b>550</b> are depicted as being hexagonal and the cell array <b>552</b> is depicted as a hexagon comprising individual cells. However, ideally each similarly located with respect to detector elements. Wiring routes <b>554</b> may connect to each cell <b>550</b>. The wiring routes <b>554</b> may be routed between other cells of the cell array <b>552</b>. Note: reference to wiring routes to be between cells of the array, it is intended that at least the wiring routes avoid the beam apertures of the array of apertures, e.g. defined through the cell array. In an arrangement circuit architecture, the cell size in at least the circuit layer may be reduced to accommodate the wiring routes, so that the wiring routes are routed between cells. Additionally or alternatively the wiring routes pass through the cells of the cell array, preferably towards the perimeter of the cells for example to reduce the interference of the wiring routes with other circuitry in the cells. Therefore reference to a wiring route between the cells encompasses: a wiring route between the circuitry of cells, a wiring route within cells, preferably towards the periphery of the cells and at least around the beam apertures through the cells and any intermediate variation. In all these arrangements, for example in a CMOS architecture, the wiring routes may be in the same die as the other circuitry which may define circuitry in the same cell as a portion of the wiring route, or circuitry in a cell around which the wiring route is routed. Thus, the cells and wiring routes may parts of a monolithic structure. The wiring routes <b>554</b> may signally connect the cells. Thus the wiring routes signally connect the cells <b>550</b> to a controller or data processor external to the cell array or even the substrate or detector module. The circuit layer may comprise a datapath layer for the transmission of sensor signals from a cell outward of the cell array.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">The controller or data processor may before circuitry within the substrate or detector module, preferably external to the cell array for example as control and I/O circuitry (not shown). The control and I/O circuitry may be in the same die as the cell array; the control and I/O circuitry may be monolithically integrated with the cell array, for example in the same CMOS chip. The control and to I/O circuitry enables an efficient connection between the data from all the cells of the cell array <b>552</b>. Consider for example an arrangement of 2791 cells each having an 8 bit digital output. Such an arrangement would have 22328 signals (i.e. 8 bit output*2791 cells) to the electronics located outside the CMOS chip. The standard way of doing this is to use a SERDES circuitry (serializer/de-serializer). Such circuitry would transform a large number of low data rate signals into a few number of high data rate signals by means of time division multiplexing. It is therefore beneficial to have control and I/O circuitry monolithically with the cell array, or at least in the detector module, than external to the detector module.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">In embodiments the control and I/O circuitry may feature general supporting functions, such as circuitry to communicate with the electronics outside the CMOS chip to enable loading certain settings, for example for control of amplification and offset such as subtraction as described herein.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">The circuit layer of a cell <b>550</b> is connected to a detector element of the respective cell. The circuit layer comprises circuitry having amplification and/digitation functions, e.g. it may comprise an amplification circuit. A cell <b>550</b> may comprise a trans impedance amplifier (TIA) <b>556</b> and an analogue to digital converter (ADC) <b>558</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. This figure schematically depicts a cell <b>550</b> with an associated detector element such as capture electrode and a feedback resistor <b>562</b> connected to the transimpedance amplifier <b>556</b> and the analogue to digital converter <b>558</b>. The digital signal lines <b>559</b> from the analogue to digital converter <b>558</b> leave the cell <b>550</b>. Note that the detector element is represented as a detector element <b>560</b> and feedback resistor is shown associated with the detector area as a disc <b>562</b> rather than associated with the transimpedance amplifier <b>556</b>. This schematic representation is to represent each of the detector element and the feedback resistor as an area to indicate their relative size, the reason for which will become apparent when referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">The transimpedance amplifier may comprise a feedback resistor Rf <b>562</b>. The magnitude of the feedback resistor Rf should be optimized. The larger the value of this feedback resistor, the lower the input referred current noise. Thus the better signal-to noise ratio at the output of the transimpedance amplifier. However, the larger the resistance, Rf, the lower the bandwidth. A finite bandwidth results in a finite rise and fall time of the signal, resulting in additional image blur. An optimized Rf results in a good balance between noise level and additional image blur.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">To implement the design the circuitry i.e. the amplification circuitry associated with each detector element should be within the layers of the associated cell <b>550</b> and fit in the limited area available of the portions of each associated layer. In the case of a sub-beam pitch of 70 microns, the available area per layer in the cell is typically only 4000 square microns. Depending on the sensed secondary and/or backscatter signal particles, for example as current to be measured by the detector element, the optimum value for the feedback resistor Rf can be as high as 30 to 300 MOhm. If such a resistor would be implemented as a poly resistor in a standard CMOS process the size of such resistor would be much larger than the area that is available in the CMOS layers of the cell <b>550</b>. For example, a resistor of 300 MOhm would consume around 500000 micron{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2. This is about 130 times larger than the entire available area.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">Typically, for example in CMOS architecture, such a large resistor would be made in a single layer for example of polysilicon. Usually there is a single layer of polysilicon. In some circumstances a layer could be provided having material capable of providing high resistor values, although with such a high aspect ratio (e.g. extreme length relative to width of the resistive structure in the layer) the reliability of the resistor remains. Even if the cell were to have multiple layers used for such a resistor, many more layers would have to be present that is readily available for example using CMOS technology. Additionally or alternatively, the meandering path through different layers would not mitigate the high aspect ratio and risk of variation in the resistance value would only be contributed by the interconnections between different layers. Such interconnects influence the variability of the resistance value of a resistor as a corner, as later described herein.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">Note that such dimensions are calculated assuming a 180 nm node architecture and processing. If alternatively a smaller processing node is used, it is unlikely that a factor of thousand in reducing the dimensions of the resistor structure could be gained. Further, using 180 node architecture is preferred to a smaller node for processing reasons. For instance interconnects in a 180 nm node are simpler to process. Post processing of a detector chip for example in etching the beam apertures <b>504</b> uses aluminum interconnects. Such post processing at a sub-180 nm node typically uses a process with Copper interconnects. Processing at 180 nm is therefore simpler than at sub-180 nm.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">Further if such a resistor were made, in whichever node, the reliability of the resistor specifications as well as the space available for the resistor may be challenging.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">In a layered structure for chip architecture, such as CMOS, the components and features are defined as structures in a layer. The specification of a component is dependent on the material of the layer and the physical properties of the layer, the dimensions of the layer, specifically its thickness and the dimensions of the structure formed in the layer. A resistor may take the form of a long narrow path, route or wire. In view of space constraints, the path may be non-linear, having corners along its path. For such a long component, the width of the path in the layer may vary such as through manufacturing tolerances. A corner may provide greater variance than a linear section of the path, limiting the accuracy with which the resistor can be made in order to have a specified resistance. With many corners and a long length, a resistor having such topology may made with poor reliability so that the resistances for equivalent resistors in different cells of the cell array may have a large range.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">Such a resistive structure has a large surface area. Additionally or alternatively, a resistor with such a large surface area would additionally have a capacitance which is undesirable; such a capacitance is referred to as a parasitic capacitance. Parasitic capacitances may undesirably contribute to noise and blur, influencing the balance between noise, blur and bandwidth optimization which is elsewhere herein described</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">The material properties of the layer can be modified chemically; however such modifications are unlikely to achieve the improvement of several orders of magnitude in size to fit into available space in the cell. Such modifications are unlikely to change the topography of the feedback resistor sufficiently so that it has the required specification and can be made with the desired reliable accuracy.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">Such requirements in reliability and size would enable the resistor to achieve its desired performance in terms of bandwidth, signal to noise ratio, and stability. Unfortunately, these requirements cannot be met.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0141">Alternative amplification circuitry is proposed which does not require such a large feedback resistor. Examples include a trans impedance amplifier with a pseudo resistor as a feedback element and a direct analogue to digital converter, obviating the need for a transimpedance amplifier. Two examples of a direct analogue to digital converter are: using a low duty cycled switched resistor, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, and using a reference capacitor, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. An optional arrangement is to remove the analogue to digital converter <b>558</b> from the cells <b>550</b> so that a circuit wire <b>570</b> connects the trans impedance amplifier <b>556</b> in the cell <b>550</b> with the analogue to digital converter external to the cell array <b>552</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>. The arrangement depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> may be applied to an amplifier circuit, e.g. as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. Each option is now mentioned in turn. The example amplifier circuits described are just some of the suitable types of amplification circuitry that can be used. Other amplifier circuits may exist which achieve similar benefits to those described herein and which use similar circuit architecture for each cell as herein described.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0142">An alternative amplification circuit is a direct analogue to digital converter for example using a switched resistor or capacitor, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> that are connected directly to the output of a detector elements <b>503</b>. A suitable type of direct analogue to digital converter is a charge-balancing direct current-to-digital converter. Using a direct analogue to digital to converter avoids using a trans impedance amplifier and having the feedback resistor Rf or an exotic alternative. Removing the transimpedance amplifier removes the most power consuming component in the amplification circuit and the main source of input noise. Delta/sigma modulators provide the best realization of charge-balancing direct current-to-digital converter. The two possible solutions are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> are: using as a reference a low duty cycle switched resistor; and using as a reference a switched capacitor. These circuits are exemplary and other suitable circuits may exist</p><p id="p-0146" num="0143">A suitable direct current-to-digital converter with low duty cycle switched resistor, is depicted in simplified form <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The circuit has an integrator A to which is input the output from the detector elements <b>503</b> and the reference resistor R<sub>dac</sub>. A capacitor C<sub>int </sub>is in a feedback loop of the integrator A. The signal output from integrator A is processed by a comparator to for the final step of converting the analogue signal to a digital signal. A bit stream bs provides a feedback from the output of the comparator to a control switch for the reference current I<sub>dac </sub>using a charge balance loop. The design of control switch helps to ensure a long-term stable balance between the sensor current I<sub>in </sub>and the reference current I<sub>dac</sub>. This helps ensure that the integrator will not clip its output signal and output bit stream, bs, is a digitised version of the sensor current I<sub>in </sub></p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">In using such direct current-to-digital converter with low duty cycle switched resistor the size of a reference resistor R<sub>dac </sub>is reduced, for example in realizing it a CMOS circuit. This is achieved by connecting the reference resistor R<sub>dac </sub>to the input of the integrator A for a very small portion t of the clock period T<sub>clock</sub>. This results in a small duty cycle: t/T<sub>clock</sub>, e.g. 1:1000. This short connection time is sufficient to deliver the charge in reference current I<sub>dac </sub>to balance the charge delivered in the current I<sub>in </sub>from the detector element, i.e. the sensor current. Providing a reference current in this way to balance the sensor current helps to ensure that the reference noise is small. Yet, using such a low duty cycle enables the same effect that would otherwise be achieved by a large resistor such as the feedback resistor Rf of a standard trans impedance amplifier. So this solution applies a smaller sized resistor than would otherwise be used and using the duty cycle to boost its effective size yet minimizing the actual size of the resistor and the effective area of the circuit layer in a cell for this type of amplification circuit.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">A suitable direct current-to-digital converter with a reference capacitor is depicted in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The circuit has exactly the same features as the current-to-digital converter with low duty cycle switched resistor as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, unless otherwise specified. A capacitive digital-to-analog converter <b>567</b> arranged in a switched configuration supplies the reference current. Such a switched capacitor digital-to-analog converter contains at least one capacitor and may contains a parallel capacitor network. Individual capacitors are connected or disconnected with switches based on the input. As a capacitor based circuit, the capacitive digital-to-analog converter <b>567</b> may be represented as reference capacitor C<sub>dac</sub>. Instead of a reference resistor Raw, a reference capacitor C<sub>dac </sub>is used. Because a capacitor is used, selection of an appropriately sized capacitor will generate a suitable reference current I<sub>dac</sub>, so that a pulse powered by a clock signal fs to the reference circuit is not required. In restricting the use of the clock to the integrator, the effect of clock jitter is minimized. The effect of the reference current I<sub>dac </sub>on the sensor current I<sub>in </sub>is to quantize the signal of the sensor current. This is in effect direct digital conversion.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0146">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, a cell <b>550</b> comprises a transimpedance amplifier <b>556</b> connected to a detector element <b>560</b>.

By removing the analogue to digital converter from the cell <b>550</b>, there is more space available in the circuit layer of the cell <b>550</b> for a feedback resistor element. This relative difference can be noted by the relative size of the feedback resistor areas <b>562</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C</figref>; (but note, the relative dimensions do not necessarily apply to other features of these two figures). There is yet more space in the circuit layer of the cell <b>550</b> if the amplifier circuitry uses an alternative trans impedance amplifier circuit, for example if a trans impedance amplifier with a pseudo resistor is used as a feedback element.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">Although it may be easier to fit the trans impedance amplifier <b>556</b> with a pseudo resistor feedback element and analogue to digital converter in the circuit layers of the cell, in an arrangement it is more practical for space constraints for the analogue to digital converter <b>558</b> to be external to the cell array <b>552</b>. This is despite the use of a pseudo resistor in the feedback element of the trans impedance amplifier providing a gain of one to two orders of magnitude in area. One consideration to decide whether or not the analogue to digital converter <b>558</b> is external to the cell array <b>552</b> is the sub-beam pitch of the multi-beam. For example with a sub-beam pitch of 70 microns, typically only 4000 square microns is available per layer of a cell for the circuitry including the amplification circuitry.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">Under such space constraints, a trans impedance amplifier is located in the cell of each beam. The analogue to digital converter is located outside the array of sub-beams, i.e. outside the cell array. In an embodiment, the analogue to digital converter is present on the same die as the cell array, for example monolithically with the cell array. Such an analogue to digital converter may be located with the control and I/O circuitry which may be on the detector module or even monolithic with the cell array <b>552</b>.

The circuit wire <b>570</b> transmits an analogue signal. Unlike a digital signal, a data path transmitting an analogue signal is susceptible to interference. Signal interference can be from cross-talk with other circuit wires and from external fields such as generated by the sub-beams of the multi-beam and fields from nearby charged particle optical components such as the objective lens array <b>241</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">The circuit wire <b>570</b> is routed through the a wiring route <b>554</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. The wiring route <b>554</b> is routed between cells so that the area of a cell and its layers is used for the amplification circuitry present on a cell. The wiring route <b>554</b> therefore only uses a portion of the circuit layers in which the wiring route is present, namely between adjoining cells <b>550</b> (e.g. at least around the beam apertures <b>504</b>, <b>406</b> of the adjoining cells <b>550</b>; through the adjoining cells <b>550</b> such as towards the periphery of the cells or between the circuitry in a layer assigned to the adjoining cells <b>550</b>, or any arrangement between the stated arrangements). This routing avoids architectural interference of the amplification circuitry and the architecture of the wiring routes <b>554</b>. Circuit wires are routed along the wiring routes in the cell array in an outward direction, for example in a radially outward direction. With greater proximity to a perimeter of the cell array <b>552</b>, there may be more circuit wires <b>570</b> than in a portion of the wiring route <b>554</b> remote from the perimeter. The wiring route may have a plurality of circuit wires <b>570</b>, which as described, is between cells of the array. Therefore a portion of the wiring route <b>554</b> may have more than one circuit wire <b>570</b>. However, having circuit wires located close to each other risks crosstalk between the circuit wires and interference of the analogue signals transmitted by the circuit wires <b>570</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">The risk of crosstalk and signal interference may be at least reduced or even prevented by having the circuit wires <b>570</b> shielded from each other within the wiring route. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts a cross-section of an exemplary arrangement of wiring route <b>554</b>.

The shielding elements may include intermediate shielding elements <b>578</b> that are present in the layer between adjoining circuit wires. The intermediate shielding elements <b>578</b> may therefore at least suppress if not prevent cross-talk between the circuit wires <b>570</b>. In operation, a common potential is applied to the shielding layers <b>572</b>, <b>574</b> and shielding elements <b>576</b>, <b>578</b>.

For example, there may be two layers of circuit wires, requiring three shielding layers which include an upper shielding layer <b>572</b>, a lower shielding layer <b>574</b> and an intermediate shielding layer. The intermediate shielding layer may additionally reduce if not prevent crosstalk between the circuit wires in the different layers of the wiring route <b>570</b>. Thus, there are five layers in total. Every additional layer of circuit wires involves an additional intermediate shielding layer. Whereas increasing the number of layers in the wiring route <b>554</b> reduces the proportion of a layer that wire routing requires, such a variation in design involves additional layers. In view of the limited number of layers, there is an optimum number of layers at which the width of the wiring route is reduced without exceeding the number of layers required elsewhere in the substrate of the detector module, which can be limited to five layers.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154">A further consideration of the design of wiring route is the number of circuit wires that may need to be present in an exemplary design of detector module, for example consider the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> with all circuit wires <b>570</b> in a layer.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0155">For example, an array of sub-beams is arranged a hexagonal array with thirty (30) rings.

This is fifteen 15 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). So that the signals are well shielded, for example to limit crosstalk and the influence of external fields, the wiring route has a shielding arrangement. In a single layer of wire circuits, the layer may have outer elements <b>576</b> at the edges of the wiring route and intermediate shielding elements <b>578</b> between adjacent circuit wires <b>570</b>. With a wiring route of fifteen (15) circuit wires <b>570</b>, there are sixteen shielding elements, including fourteen (14) intermediate shielding elements and two outer shielding elements <b>576</b>. Therefore between adjacent cells <b>550</b> of the outer ring of the example, a wiring route having all circuit wires in the same layer would have thirty-one (31) elements of alternate shielding elements and circuit wires.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0158">For cell array <b>552</b> for a beam array with a pitch of 70 microns, there is enough space, or area, available in the circuit layer, for such a wiring route <b>554</b>. In a structure created using a process at the 180 nm node, the minimum half pitch of a metal layer is typically around 280 nm. In this context a half pitch is a line and a pitch is the line with an associated gap with an adjoining gap. The associated gap is typically the same width the line. The wiring route for thirty-one elements requires thirty-one pitches. However, the associated gap of one of the elements, which corresponds to the outer elements <b>576</b>, is not part of the wiring route <b>554</b>, but would separate the wiring route from adjoining circuitry. Therefore, for thirty one elements, sixty-one (61) half pitches are required, which corresponds to a width of the circuit wiring <b>554</b> of 17.1 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">In a different arrangement, the beam array may be hexagonal having 108 rings and around 35000 cells, and may be considered to be a monolithic beam array. The outermost ring has around 650 cells. Around 34350 signals are required to be routed through the outermost ring. So around 54 signals need to be routed through adjoining cells in the outermost ring. A wiring route <b>554</b> having 54 circuit wires <b>570</b> has 55 shielding elements. Applying a similar calculation as for the previous example in applying this architecture to a half pitch of 280 nm, the width of the circuit wire would be under 61 micrometers. This size would fit between the cells <b>550</b> of the outermost ring. In an alternative arrangement the beam arrangement is apportioned in to two or more strips with one or more intermediate strip for routing a support structure, cooling features such as conduits, data transmission lines and the like. Such a beam array may be referred to as a stripped beam array. The wiring routes may therefore be routed through the one or more intermediate strips. This enables a larger beam array, thus cell array yet maintaining a reasonably sized wiring route. If a stripped beam array were to have the same number of sub-beams as a monolithic beam array, the wiring routes would have fewer circuit wires <b>570</b> than the monolithic cell array i.e. fewer than 54. Indeed a stripped beam array may achieve a larger number of sub-beams than a monolithic beam array because the size of the beam array, as limited by the maximum number of circuit wires that may be in the wiring route, would be larger</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">The optimization of the noise performance for example in terms of bandwidth and noise optimization and balance between the blur and the noise can be enabled by making sure an amplification factor of the trans impedance amplifier is programmable. In a such an arrangement, the amplifier circuit of the cell, at least the trans impedance amplifier, is programmable. Such a programmable amplification circuit may comprise a variable amplifier and/or a variable analogue to digital converter for example. in terms of its sensitivity. The variable amplifier has a variable amplification range dependent on a detected beam current detected by a detector element <b>503</b>. For example, when the detected beam current is low, or for a sample with a lower than typical secondary emission coefficient, the variable amplifier can be adjusted to provide a larger amplification than normally used. When a larger beam current than normal is detected by a detector element <b>503</b>, or for a sample with a larger than typical secondary emission coefficient, the variable amplifier can be tuned to provide a smaller amplification.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">This functionality is beneficial with a trans impedance amplifier with a feedback element having pseudo resistor. A pseudo resistor has different effective resistances on application of different applied voltages; unlike an ideal resistor which has a single resistance at all applied potential differences. In providing different resistance, the trans impedance amplifier associated with the pseudo resistor operates as a variable amplification. In providing an amplifier with variable functionality, an optimized balance between noise levels and image blur (referred to herein above as &#x2018;additional blur&#x2019;) may be achieved. Beneficially, the programmable amplification circuit may match the output of the trans impedance amplifier with the input of the analogue to digital converter. This may be as a programmable offset that is subtracted between the output of the trans impedance amplifier, and the input of the analogue to digital converter. The programmable offset may help reduce the required number of bits that need to be transmitted from the amplification circuit of a cell. The programmable offset may be implemented in the programmable amplifier. These measures help to ensure that the dynamic range of the trans impedance amplifier and the analogue to digital converter, and thus preferably the amplification circuit, are optimally used for different use cases. Such different use cases may include: the material properties of a sample under inspection, different assessment tool configurations for example using different beam currents. The range of applications may be enabled by the provision of a variable amplifier and a variable off set or threshold (e.g. subtraction by a programmable offset) desirable enables tuning of amplification, threshold and bandwidth As mentioned elsewhere herein, the circuitry associated with variable amplification and subtraction may be comprised in the control and I/O circuitry.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">It is beneficial to detect different types of signal particles in order to obtain more varied information relating to the sample.

In order to switch from secondary signal particle detection to backscatter signal particle detection, the electrostatic field between sample and detector is reversed and/or the landing energy is changed. Different sample charging conditions after changing landing energy and/or sample field can cause an overlay measurement error, because these might change the primary beam position. There is a risk the system drifts (sample position and/or beam position) while switching, resulting in an overlay measurement error. Thus, improvements can be made to a system in which detection modes are switched between backscatter detection and secondary detection. European patent application publication no.

Both the secondary signal particles and the backscatter signal particles can be detected at the same time increasing the collection efficiency compared to various known detectors.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0166">In an embodiment, a detector is provided which may be used in a charged particle device for an assessment tool to detect signal particles from a sample.

The detector <b>600</b> comprises a substrate, which may otherwise be referred to as a body.

Resulting signal particles from the sample may comprise signal particles above the first energy threshold and/or signal particles below the second energy threshold. Thus, the detector <b>600</b> comprises two different types of detector element, such a first element and a second element.

The first energy threshold may correspond to a backscatter threshold energy. Thus, the semiconductor element <b>610</b> (e.g. a first element) may be configured to detect primarily backscattered signal particles. The backscatter threshold energy may the selected lowest energy level of backscattered signal particles that the detector is designed to detect.

More specifically, the thickness of the metal layer <b>621</b> may be approximately 100 nm or less, preferably approximately 10 nm to 100 nm. Lower energy signal particles with an energy of less than 50 eV (which may correspond to the secondary signal particles described above) can be &#x2018;captured&#x2019; by charge-based elements with a relatively small thickness. Higher energy signal particles have a higher penetration depth. For example, signal particles having an energy of approximately 350 eV may have a penetration depth which is greater than 10 nm to 100 nm. This means that the lower energy signal particles can be captured by the charge-based element <b>620</b> and the vast majority of higher energy signal particles will pass through the charge-based element <b>620</b>. The higher energy signal particles can be detected by the semiconductor element <b>610</b>.

It is possible to have a p-i-n region without the dead layer, however, the dead layer is beneficial in reducing noise. Although a p-i-n region is described throughout, other semiconductor regions may be used instead of the p-i-n region.

For example, the detector circuitry may comprise a transimpedance amplifier <b>556</b> and/or an analog to digital converter <b>558</b> connected to the charge-based element <b>620</b>. The detector circuitry may comprise a transimpedance amplifier <b>556</b> and/or an analog to digital converter <b>558</b> connected to the semiconductor element <b>620</b>.

It is noted that the size available for the detector elements is relatively small. Thus, it is beneficial to provide an amplifier, such as the transimpedance amplifier. However, some amplifiers such as the transimpedance amplifier generally need a large resistance. Thus, the circuitry may be provided with wiring routed between cells as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>.

Additionally or alternatively, a pseudo resistor may be used with the transimpedance amplifier, and/or an analog to digital converter as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b> or <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0185">Although the above describes and shows an electrically insulating element <b>630</b> between the semiconductor element <b>610</b> and the charge-based element <b>620</b>, this is not a necessity. For example, the semiconductor element <b>610</b> and the charge-based element <b>620</b> may be in direct contact with each other. Furthermore, the semiconductor element <b>610</b> and the charge-based element <b>620</b> may have at least one component in common. For example, the lower metal layer <b>613</b> of the semiconductor element <b>610</b> may be part of the charge-based element <b>620</b>. For example, the metal layer <b>621</b> forming the detection surface of the charge-based element <b>620</b> may also be the lower metal layer <b>613</b> of the semiconductor element <b>610</b>. In such a configuration, good electrical insulation is preferably provided between the circuitry of the detector for the charge-based element and the circuitry of the detector for the semiconductor element. The advantage of the metal layer <b>621</b> forming the detection surface of the charge-based element <b>620</b> and the lower metal layer <b>613</b> of the semiconductor element <b>610</b> is that the layer thickness for penetration is smaller (because the separate metal layer <b>621</b> and electrically insulating element <b>630</b> are not provided), so a greater number of particles reach the p-i-n region. This provides a lower energy threshold for <b>610</b>. However, it is noted that this configuration may make an accurate charge measurement more difficult.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0186">Although it is described above that the first energy threshold and the second energy threshold are substantially the same, they may have an offset. In other words, the first energy threshold may differ from the second energy threshold. For example, it may be noted that detection of signal particles near the threshold might result in detection of various different types of signal particle and it may be preferable to more clearly separate detection of the different signal particles. Having an offset between the first energy threshold and the second energy threshold may reduce the signal particles detected, and may specifically reduce the amount of signal particles with borderline energy levels which may decease noise in the detection. The first energy threshold may be more than the second energy threshold. The first energy threshold may depend on the layer thicknesses before reaching the p-i-n region. However, it can be tuned somewhat with the bias voltage between the sample and the detector (described further below as the potential different between the sample and detector). If the bias voltage is, for example, +200 V instead of +50 V, then effectively lower backscatter signal particles might gain sufficient additional kinetic energy to pass these layers, thereby lowering the effective first energy threshold. Something similar happens with the second energy threshold. Therefore, the values for the threshold can be influenced by the bias voltage, and therefore the difference between the first and second threshold could be between approximately 0 and 200 V.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0187">It will be understood from the description of the secondary and backscatter signal particles above that the threshold value (e.g. of 50 V, or 100 V, or 200 V) between the different types of signal particles is arbitrary. There is not a black and white division around (i.e. distinct separation at) this threshold. The precise selection of the threshold value is unlikely much to improve or contribute to the image contrast or quality. Thus the selection of the threshold value is unlikely to reduce the detection of signal particles with borderline energy levels. In general it is expected that the effective first and second energy thresholds may be different because of the energy loss in the layers between the charge-based detector <b>621</b> and the p-i-n region <b>611</b>. A signal particle that has just enough energy to leave the charge-based detector <b>621</b> (i.e. above the first energy threshold) might lose too much energy in the layers that are in between charge-based detector <b>621</b> and the p-i-n region <b>611</b> to reach the p-i-n region <b>611</b>; thus leading to a second energy threshold having a different value from the first energy threshold.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0188">As described above, an aperture <b>601</b> is defined in the substrate for the passage therethrough of a charged particle beam. This is beneficial in that the signal beam (e.g. primary beam <b>320</b>) may pass through the detector <b>600</b> such that signal particles can be captured by the detector <b>600</b> all the way round the primary beam. However, although this is beneficial, other configurations may also be used. For example, the detector <b>600</b> may be provided to one side of the primary beam path. This would allow the primary beam to reach the sample <b>208</b>, and the detector <b>600</b> can still detect signal particles emitted from the sample <b>208</b>. In this configuration, a Wien filter may be used in combination with the detector. In another arrangement the detector may be provided as at least two portions either side of the path of the primary beam. The two portions may be separated by a gap. The two portions may be spaced apart. The gap may take the form a slit or strip through which the path of the primary beam passes. If multiple primary beams (e.g. sub-beams) are provided, then the detector may still be provided to one or both sides, for example, with slits for paths of the multiple sub-beams of the primary multiple multi-beams. In an arrangement such a detector array may have multiple detectors on one side of the slit. Such an arrangement featuring a slit between detectors or detector portions may be easy to manufacture. However, providing the detector with an aperture formed therein may be beneficial in allowing for a larger detection surface which may thus increase the detection efficiency. Locating the detector on a lens electrode, within an electrostatic lens may be easier to achieve if such a detector has an aperture rather than a slit or the like. It is noted that the aperture of the detector an electrostatic field may cause some disturbance of the field which may affect the primary sub-beam and it is preferable if the disturbance of the sub-beam is symmetric, because it leads to less deformation by aberrations.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0189">The above embodiments and variations may be provided with a slightly different configuration of the charge-based element <b>620</b> and the semiconductor element <b>610</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.

Lower energy signal particles (such as secondary signal particles) will not generally have enough kinetic energy to penetrate the top layer(s) of the detector (consisting of a lower metal layer <b>613</b> and a dead layer of the semiconductor). Thus, the lower energy signal particles will not generally be detected by the semiconductor element <b>620</b>. It is beneficial to remove the lower energy signal particles from the higher energy particle signal. This is because typically more lower energy signal particles are produced at the sample <b>208</b> causing the lower energy particles to dominate the higher energy particles if the different signal particles are not well separated. In this configuration, it is expected that the cross-talk of secondary signal particles on the semiconductor element to be very low or zero.

By applying negative or positive bias on the detector or detector array with respect to the sample, low energy signal particles (e.g. secondary signal particles) can either be repelled (backscatter-only mode) or attracted (combined secondary and backscatter mode). It is noted that higher landing energies are typically used with the accelerating lens.
