following description of certain embodiments presents various descriptions of specific embodiments. However, the innovations described herein can be embodied in a multitude of different ways, for example, as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings where like reference numerals can indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be understood that elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing and/or a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing. Further, some embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) microphones are typically produced using techniques similar to those for fabricating semiconductor devices on semiconductor wafers. The performance of MEMS microphones produced by a particular manufacturer or even within a single batch or from a single semiconductor wafer may vary due to process variations inherent in the manufacturing process for these microphones. One parameter that may differ across batches of MEMS microphones due to variations in the manufacturing process is residual stress within a piezoelectric film used as part of a sound-to-voltage transducer in the microphones. In some examples, the stress variation of a piezoelectric film, for example, a film of AlN, could be higher than 300 MPa across a single wafer due to limitations in uniformity of the AlN deposition process.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One example of a cantilever type piezoelectric microelectromechanical system microphone is shown in a simplified plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and in a simplified cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone <b>100</b> includes several cantilevers <b>105</b> formed from a piezoelectric material, for example, aluminum nitride. The bases <b>105</b>B of the cantilevers are secured to a frame <b>100</b> and the tips <b>105</b>T of the cantilevers are free to move up and down in a direction perpendicular to a plane defined by the frame. Gaps G separate the cantilevers <b>105</b> from one another. Each cantilever <b>105</b> may be about 1 &#x3bc;m thick and the entire microphone may be about <b>1</b> mm across, although these dimensions are not intended to be limiting. Although illustrated as having a square frame and triangular piezoelectric cantilevers, in other embodiments a cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone may have a different shape, for example, a circular shaped frame with pie-piece shaped cantilevers. In accordance with some embodiments a piezoelectric MEMS microphone based on a cantilever structure that may include triangular, rectangular, or polygonal shaped cantilevers is clamped all around the edges of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone. The cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone includes one, two, or multiple piezoelectric layers.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Acoustic pressure from, for example, the voice of a user causes the piezoelectric cantilevers to deflect and generate a voltage that is sensed by electrodes (not shown) disposed on or within the cantilevers to provide a signal indicative of the voice of the user. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the cantilevers <b>105</b> are preferably flat when not acted upon by a source of acoustic pressure and the gap between the cantilevers is small. A small gap between the cantilevers helps prevent sound waves from passing through the piezoelectric MEMS microphone without deflecting the cantilevers, thus providing for a sensitive piezoelectric MEMS microphone, especially at low frequencies.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments residual stresses may remain within the cantilevers of a piezoelectric MEMS microphone due to, for example, process variations in the manufacturing process for the piezoelectric MEMS microphone. In some manufacturing processes for piezoelectric films used for cantilevers in piezoelectric MEMS microphones, variation across a single wafer may cause cantilevers formed from material from the same wafer to have differences in static deflection of, for example, 20 &#x3bc;m or more. A cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone <b>100</b>&#x2032; with residual stresses in the cantilevers may appear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, where the residual stresses cause the cantilevers to exhibit static displacement wherein the cantilevers are bent from a flat orientation even in the absence of applied acoustic pressure. This increases the size of the gap between adjacent cantilevers and reduces the sensitivity of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone, especially at low frequencies. In some embodiments, piezoelectric cantilevers having lengths of about 200 &#x3bc;m that exhibit static deflection of about 16 &#x3bc;m at the tips may reduce the acoustic resistance of a piezoelectric MEMS microphone by about 90% as compared to a piezoelectric MEMS microphone that had flat cantilevers. The static deflection of the cantilevers may cause the 3 db roll-off point of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone, that defines the frequency at which sensitivity of microphone reduces by 3 dB of its sensitivity measured at a frequency of 1 KHz, to change from about 20 Hz to about 200 Hz.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates how the sensitivity of a cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone may change when there is a small gap versus a large gap between the cantilevers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is intended to generally illustrate the effect on change in sensitivity of cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphones with small versus large gaps between cantilevers due to residual stresses in the cantilevers, but is not meant to illustrate numerically accurate sensitivity levels for any particular piezoelectric MEMS microphone disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphones are generally free from sensitivity degradation due to residual stress resulting from manufacturing variation, but they suffer from poor low-frequency roll-off (f<sub>&#x2212;3dB</sub>) control as the gap between ends of opposing cantilevers enlarges when the cantilevers deflect due to the residual stress. A method to reduce the effects of cantilever static deflection is desired.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">One method of reducing static deflection of piezoelectric cantilevers in cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphones is to form the piezoelectric cantilevers from multiple, for example, two different films that have different residual stress levels. The different films are deposited one on another by thin film deposition so that the tendency of one of the films to deflect due to its residual stress is at least partially cancelled out by the tendency of the other film to deflect in the opposite direction due to its residual stress. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate the effect of this method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates results of a simulation of a 300 &#x3bc;m long cantilever formed of a piezoelectric material with an average residual stress of 300 MPa. The cantilever exhibits a static deflection at the tip of about 73 &#x3bc;m. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a simulation of the same cantilever as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, but with a second layer of piezoelectric material having an average residual stress of &#x2212;125 MPa deposited on it. The static deflection is canceled out by the addition of the second layer of piezoelectric material.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">One difficulty with this approach is that it may be difficult to identify or reliably produce different piezoelectric films with different residual stresses that can be deposited on one another for a desired compensation of the residual stress effect and to form piezoelectric cantilevers that exhibit little static deflection. In some manufacturing processes, the difference in residual stress in two piezoelectric films formed on a wafer may vary by, for example, 50 MPa (plus or minus 25 MPa) across a single wafer.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the effect of residual stress and static deformation in piezoelectric cantilevers on sensitivity of a piezoelectric MEMS microphone may be reduced by forming the piezoelectric cantilevers with edge extensions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a simplified cross-sectional diagram of a cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone <b>200</b> including cantilevers <b>205</b> with edge extensions <b>205</b>E. The cantilevers of the cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphone <b>200</b> is otherwise similar to that of the cantilever piezoelectric MEMS microphones <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032; discussed above, for example, having bases of the cantilevers on a frame <b>210</b>. The edge extensions <b>205</b>E extend downward from the tips of the cantilevers <b>205</b>, in some embodiments at a slight angle from normal to the plane of the remainder of the cantilevers <b>205</b>. In some embodiments, the edge extensions <b>205</b>E may extend downward from the tips of the cantilevers <b>205</b> at an angle of from 30&#xb0; to 85&#xb0; or from 60&#xb0; to 70&#xb0; from the plane of the remainder of the cantilevers <b>205</b>. In some embodiments, the edge extensions <b>205</b>E may be from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 10 &#x3bc;m in length or from about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 3 &#x3bc;m in length. The edge extensions <b>205</b>E reduce the size of the gaps G between adjacent cantilevers and increase the sensitivity of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in instances where the cantilevers <b>205</b> exhibit static deflection, the edge extensions reduce the size of the gap that would have been formed between edges of the cantilevers in the absence of the edge extensions and increases the acoustic impedance and sensitivity of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone. A similar improvement may be observed in a piezoelectric MEMS microphone in which the cantilevers exhibit different amounts of static deflection as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, for example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the edge extensions <b>205</b>E are present on portions, but not the entireties, of the edges of the piezoelectric cantilevers <b>205</b>. The edge extensions <b>205</b>E may be absent in sensing regions <b>205</b>S of the edges of the piezoelectric cantilevers <b>205</b>. In the sensing regions <b>205</b>S near the bases of the piezoelectric cantilevers <b>205</b> near the frame <b>210</b>, electrodes (not shown) of the piezoelectric MEMS microphone may be present.

The edge extensions <b>205</b>E are desirably present on the edges of the cantilevers <b>205</b> in the mechanical regions <b>205</b>M where displacement of the cantilevers in response to impinging acoustic energy is the largest. The sensing region <b>205</b>S of the edges of the piezoelectric cantilevers <b>205</b> may extend from the frame <b>210</b> inward along the edges of the cantilevers <b>205</b> to about 20% to 40% of the length of the edges of the cantilevers <b>205</b>.
