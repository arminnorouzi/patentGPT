The implosion of the liquid liner can be driven by a compression driver. In some examples of known compression drivers, an implosion of the liquid liner is driven by a high pressure fluid (e.g. high pressure gas) that pushes on a piston which in turn pushes on a liquid medium fluidly communicative with the liquid liner. In one exemplary application, a plasma compression system comprises a vessel containing a liquid medium that is circulated to form a liquid liner defining a cavity in which plasma is injected. The vessel is connected to multiple compression drivers fluidly communicative with the liquid medium; each compression driver comprises a valve which opens to allow a high pressure gas from an accumulator to move through the valve and act upon a piston that pushes the liquid medium into the vessel to collapse the liquid liner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some applications, the plasma needs to be compressed within a very short time period, in the order of milliseconds. It follows that the compression operation must be performed over a similarly short time period, necessitating the pistons to move very quickly. In order to provide the required energy to collapse the liquid liner and compress the plasma, reducing the compression operation time requires a proportional increase in power. Providing sufficient power to compress plasma within a target time period can be challenging.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, the vessel can be subjected to extremely high outward stresses when the compression drivers push the liquid medium inwardly into the vessel, especially when the compression operation happens quickly, e.g. in the order of milliseconds. The outward stress is caused by two key forces: (1) a recoil force from the compression drivers as the driver piston accelerates, and (2) pressure build up in the liquid medium in front of the pistons. This second cause is particularly prevalent as the pistons pressurize the liquid medium to accelerate inwardly, the pressurized liquid medium pushes outwardly on the vessel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some applications, the vessel wall can experience pressures in the order of 65 MPa. Unless the outward pressure can be reduced, the vessel must be designed to withstand such pressures, which can be expensive and complex.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a compression driver is provided for compressing plasma in a cavity defined by a liquid liner composed of a liquid medium contained in a vessel of a plasma compression system.

The compression driver is connected to a plasma containment vessel containing a liquid medium that forms the liquid liner, and comprises a pair of coaxially aligned pistons that are sequentially driven towards the liquid liner. More particularly, the compression driver comprises a driver piston movable within a driver bore and a pusher piston movable within a pusher bore. The pusher bore has a distal end in fluid communication with the vessel and a proximal end connected to a distal end of the driver bore; a proximal end of the driver bore is coupled to a prime mover for driving the driver piston. The pusher bore is coaxial with and has a smaller diameter than the driver bore such that an interconnecting annular face surface is defined at the junction of the driver and pusher bores. At the start of a compression operation, the pusher piston is located at the driver and pusher bore junction, the driver piston is located at the proximal end of the driver bore, the pusher bore is filled with the liquid medium, and the driver bore between the driver and pusher pistons contains a compressible fluid (&#x201c;compression fluid&#x201d;). During the compression operation, the prime mover accelerates the driver piston towards the pusher piston and compresses the compression fluid. When the compression fluid pressure exceeds the liquid medium pressure acting against the pusher piston, the pusher piston is accelerated towards the distal end of the pusher bore, thereby pushing the liquid medium in the pusher bore into the vessel, causing the liquid liner to collapse, and compressing the plasma. The pusher bore has a shorter length relative to the length of the driver bore and the pusher piston has a lower mass relative to the mass of the driver piston, which effectively amplifies the power delivered by the pusher piston against the liquid medium. The outward forces on the vessel wall caused by compression driver recoil and increased vessel pressure are counteracted by an inward force applied by the compression fluid on the annular face surface during the compression operation. It is expected that this counteracting inward force will reduce the stress on the vessel wall caused by the plasma compression operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>(A)</figref> and (B), multiple plasma compression drivers <b>10</b> can be used in a plasma compression system <b>50</b> such as the system developed by General Fusion Inc. This plasma compression system <b>50</b> comprises a generally spherical plasma containment vessel <b>52</b> that is partially filled with a liquid medium, such as for example a liquid metal. However, the plasma compression drivers can operate with plasma containment vessels having other geometries in other embodiments, such as cylindrical vessels. The liquid medium can be rotated until a liquid liner <b>55</b> is formed defining a cavity. A plasma generator <b>57</b> generates the plasma which is injected into the cavity. The compression drivers <b>10</b> are then operated to push liquid metal into the vessel <b>52</b>, causing the liquid liner <b>55</b> to implode, the cavity to collapse, and the plasma trapped therein to compress.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present description discloses embodiments of a compression driver <b>10</b> that can implode a liquid liner with an ability to tune the implosion trajectory. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a compression driver <b>10</b> that comprises a housing <b>12</b> with an outer wall <b>13</b>, a driver bore <b>14</b>, a driver piston <b>15</b> slidably inserted into the driver bore <b>14</b>, a pusher bore <b>16</b> and a pusher piston <b>17</b> slidably inserted into the pusher bore <b>16</b>. The compression driver <b>10</b> further comprises a prime mover comprising an accumulator <b>18</b> for storing a high pressure fluid (&#x201c;driver fluid&#x201d;) and a valve <b>19</b>. The valve <b>19</b> controls the flow of the driver fluid from the accumulator <b>18</b> to the driver bore <b>14</b> behind the driver piston <b>15</b>. When the valve <b>19</b> opens, the driver fluid expands and flows from the accumulator <b>18</b> through the valve <b>19</b> and to the driver piston <b>15</b>. The driver fluid can be a pressurized gas such as helium. Alternatively, other gases with a comparably low flow resistance can be used as the driver fluid. The accumulator pressure can be about 20 1MPa, in one implementation; however, the accumulator pressure can be different for different implementations, and will depend on factors such as the dimensions and other physical properties of the components of the compression driver <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Instead of an accumulator containing a pressurized driver fluid, other prime movers known in the art can be used; for example, the prime mover can comprise a mechanical spring, or an electromagnetic driver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The driver piston <b>15</b> resides in the driver bore <b>14</b> and has an initial start position that is at the proximal end of the driver bore <b>14</b> adjacent to the valve <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(A)</figref>). A volume in the driver bore <b>14</b> between the driver and the pusher pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> contains a low pressure compressible fluid (&#x201c;compression fluid&#x201d;). For the purpose of this application, a compressible fluid can mean any fluid that can be compressed. For example, in one implementation the compression fluid can be a gas such as helium. In another implementation, the compression fluid can be a mixture of a gas and a liquid, as long as the compression fluid mixture in the bore <b>14</b> between the pistons <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> is compressible. In another embodiment, the compressible fluid is replaced with a compressible magnetic field. In this alternative embodiment, a number of coils (not shown) can be used to generate a magnetic field in the bore <b>14</b> between pistons <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>, and the pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> are composed of a conductive material facing each other, such as copper. As the driver piston <b>15</b> accelerates towards the pusher piston <b>17</b> such magnetic field gets compressed. When the driver piston <b>15</b> is in the initial start position, the initial pressure of the compression fluid or the magnetic field (between the pistons <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>) is significantly less than the fluid pressure of the driver fluid. For example, in one implementation the pressure of the compression fluid is about 0.7 1MPa; however the pressure can be different as long as it is significantly lower that the fluid pressure of the accumulator <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The driver and pusher bores <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> connect at a bore junction <b>31</b>. The pusher bore <b>16</b> has a smaller diameter than the diameter of the driver bore <b>14</b>; an annular face surface <b>41</b> at the proximal end of the pusher bore <b>16</b> faces the distal end of the driver bore <b>14</b> at the junction <b>31</b>. The pusher piston <b>17</b> has an initial start position at the bore junction <b>31</b>, i.e. at the proximal end of the pusher bore <b>16</b>. The pusher bore <b>16</b> has a distal end <b>11</b> open to the vessel <b>52</b>. An outer (distal) face of the pusher piston <b>17</b> is in fluid contact with a liquid medium (not shown) in the pusher bore <b>16</b>; the liquid medium has a higher pressure than the compression fluid when the driver piston <b>15</b> is at the initial start position; this initial pressure differential ensures that the pusher piston <b>17</b> remains in the initial start position. Alternatively, a mechanical, hydraulic or gaseous pressure means (not shown) can be applied to the pusher piston <b>17</b> to keep it in its initial start position.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pusher piston <b>17</b> separates the compression fluid in the driver bore <b>14</b> (between the pistons <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>) from the liquid medium in the pusher bore <b>16</b>. A retaining means, such as for example a ledge <b>33</b>, is located at the open end <b>11</b> of the pusher bore <b>16</b> to prevent the pusher piston <b>17</b> from being dislodged out of the pusher bore <b>16</b>. In addition, an additional retaining means <b>35</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(A)</figref>) can be provided at the proximal end <b>31</b> in order to prevent the pusher piston <b>17</b> from being pushed into the driver bore <b>14</b> due to the pressure applied from the liquid medium in the pusher bore <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The driver and pusher pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> can be composed of a stainless steel or a titanium or another comparable material that does not react with the liquid medium, the driver fluid, and the compression fluid. The valve <b>19</b> in this embodiment is a poppet/slider <b>21</b> and a driver; however, other comparably fast acting valves can be used in other embodiments, such as a gas driven valve or an electromagnetic valve. In one implementation, the compression driver <b>10</b> can further comprise a third piston <b>20</b> (&#x201c;recoil piston&#x201d;) that is configured to reduce the recoil of the driver <b>10</b>. The recoil piston has a mass that significantly higher than the driver piston and can be connected to the driver bore by a damper or spring (not shown). More particularly, the recoil piston <b>20</b> is positioned near the valve <b>19</b> on the opposite side from the driver piston <b>15</b> such that when the valve <b>19</b> opens, the driver piston <b>15</b> is driven down the driver bore <b>14</b> while the recoil piston <b>20</b> is driven in an opposite direction; because the recoil piston is heavier than the driver piston, it will accelerate more slowly than the driver piston and reach a lower peak velocity during the compression operation In other words, the large mass of the third piston serves to slow and lengthen the recoil pulse. The valve <b>19</b> size and driver fluid pressure are selected to allow a sufficient flow rate of the driver fluid through the valve <b>19</b> to accelerate the driver piston <b>15</b> along the driver bore <b>14</b> to the junction <b>31</b> within a target time period. For example, the valve size and driver fluid pressure can be selected to provide enough pressure to accelerate a 60 kg piston along a 2 m long bore in about 15 ms.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a compression operation of the compression driver <b>10</b>, and in particular shows a trajectory and position of the driver and pusher pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> during four stages of the compression operation. Stage <b>1</b> is the initial (start) stage before the compression driver <b>10</b> is triggered. In this stage the accumulator <b>18</b> is fully charged, the valve <b>19</b> is closed and the pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> are in their initial positions. In stage <b>2</b>, the valve <b>19</b> is opened and the driver fluid in the accumulator <b>18</b> passes through the valve <b>19</b> and enters the driver bore <b>14</b> behind the driver piston <b>15</b>, accelerating the driver piston <b>15</b> down the bore <b>14</b> toward the pusher piston <b>17</b> and compressing the compression fluid. During this stage, the pressure of the compression fluid is rising but has not yet exceeded the fluid pressure on the pusher piston <b>17</b> caused by the liquid medium and thus the pusher piston <b>17</b> has not yet moved significantly. At Stage <b>3</b>, the driver piston <b>15</b> has reached the junction <b>31</b> and the compression fluid is at a maximum pressure, which is applied to the pusher piston <b>17</b> and the annular face surface <b>41</b>. At this stage, the compression fluid pressure exceeds the pressure of the liquid medium in the pusher bore <b>16</b> and the pusher piston <b>17</b> is moved. In Stage <b>4</b> the pusher piston <b>17</b> accelerates rapidly, pushing the liquid medium out of the pusher bore <b>16</b> and into the vessel <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Because the driver bore <b>14</b> has a larger diameter than the pusher bore <b>16</b>, it follows that the driver piston <b>15</b> has a larger diameter than the pusher piston <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, the driver piston <b>15</b> is heavier than the pusher piston <b>17</b>, and the length of the driver bore <b>14</b> is longer than a length of the pusher bore <b>16</b> in this embodiment. Assuming substantially all the energy is transferred from the driver piston <b>15</b> to the pusher piston <b>17</b>, it is expected that the power applied by the pusher piston <b>16</b> on the liquid medium to be higher than the power applied by the driver piston <b>14</b> on the compression fluid. In other words, the two-piston design of the compression driver <b>10</b> serves to amplify the power delivered by the pusher piston <b>17</b> against the liquid medium. Such power amplification contributes to reducing the time period for the compression operation for a given amount of energy, e.g. the energy required to compress the plasma within a target time period.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(A)</figref> illustrates the driver piston <b>15</b> in its initial position when the valve <b>19</b> is closed and the poppet <b>21</b> sits on its seat closing the outlet. The valve <b>19</b> can be an electromagnetic valve such that when an electric pulse is provided to a coil (not shown) the poppet <b>21</b> is driven away from its seat (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(B)</figref>). When the valve <b>19</b> opens the driver fluid from the accumulator flows into the driver bore <b>14</b> between the driver piston <b>15</b> and third piston <b>20</b>, and the driver fluid pressure accelerates the driver piston <b>15</b> down the driver bore <b>14</b> and pushes the third piston <b>20</b> (partially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(A) and <b>3</b>(B)</figref>) in an opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">During operation, the acceleration profile of the driver piston <b>15</b> can be controlled by controlling the pressure of the driver fluid in the driver bore <b>14</b> behind the driver piston <b>15</b>. The acceleration profile of the driver piston <b>15</b> can be adjusted by adjusting the driver fluid pressure behind (upstream) the driver piston <b>15</b> (pressure of the accumulator <b>18</b>). For example, the driver fluid pressure on the driver piston can be adjusted by adjusting the valve <b>19</b> opening size or duration to control the driver fluid flow from the accumulator and/or venting driver fluid from the driver bore <b>14</b> via ports <b>22</b> in the driver bore <b>14</b> behind the driver piston <b>15</b>; these ports <b>22</b> can have controllable valves (not shown) similar to driver fluid valve <b>19</b>. The acceleration profile of the driver piston <b>15</b> can also be controlled by controlling the pressure of the compression fluid in front (downstream) of the driver piston <b>15</b>. Ports <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in the wall <b>13</b> of the housing <b>12</b> between the driver and pusher pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> can be controlled to inject or vent the compression fluid. In addition, additional compressible fluid can be injected near the proximal end of the driver bore <b>14</b> to slow down the driver piston <b>15</b> to prevent impact with the pusher piston <b>17</b>. The length of the driver bore <b>14</b> can be designed to be long enough so that the trajectory of the driver piston <b>15</b> can be tuned by changing the pressure of the driver fluid and/or the pressure of the compression fluid. A number of sensors (not shown) can be provided to measure the position of the driver piston <b>15</b> and provide the measured signals to a controller (not shown).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(A)</figref>-(C), the driver and pusher bores <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are connected at the junction <b>31</b> by the annular face surface <b>41</b>. As can be seen particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(B)</figref> and (C), the driver piston <b>15</b> has a distal end designed to cooperate with the annular face surface <b>41</b> to define an annular channel <b>43</b> when the driver piston <b>15</b> is at the junction <b>31</b>, wherein the compression fluid is highly compressed. The high pressure of the compression fluid in the channel <b>43</b> serves to slow down the driver piston <b>15</b> and prevent the impact with the annular face surface <b>41</b> and/or the pusher piston <b>17</b>. Additionally and as previously noted, the compression fluid applies an inward force on the annular face surface <b>41</b>; in other words, the annular face surface <b>41</b> applies an inward force on the vessel and serves as a pressure balancing lip such that the pressure pulse generated by the driver piston <b>15</b> will offset or reduce the pressure pulse generated by the pusher piston <b>17</b> pushing on the fluid in the pusher bore <b>16</b> and thus will reduce (minimize) the stress imparted by the compression driver <b>10</b> on the vessel (or any other structure to which the driver is connected).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of the driver piston <b>15</b>. The driver piston <b>15</b> has a generally frusto-conical shape with a front wall <b>44</b>, a back wall <b>42</b> and a side wall <b>46</b>. The front wall <b>44</b> is the surface of the piston <b>15</b> that faces the pusher piston <b>17</b> while the back wall <b>42</b> is the surface that faces the valve <b>19</b> and upon which the driver fluid from the accumulator <b>18</b> pushes onto. An annular channel <b>48</b> is formed around the periphery of the side wall <b>46</b> to reduce the weight of the piston <b>15</b>. A number of seal seats <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> are formed in the side wall <b>46</b> to house a number of seals (not shown). In some implementations, the seal seats <b>47</b> and the corresponding seals can be omitted. Alternatively, the driver piston <b>15</b> can have a different geometry provided the piston holds pressure in the bores <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and does not impact the pusher piston <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the pusher piston <b>17</b>. The pusher piston <b>17</b> has a frusto-conically shaped inner wall <b>34</b>, an outer wall <b>38</b> and a side wall <b>32</b>. The inner wall <b>34</b> of the pusher piston <b>17</b> faces the front wall <b>44</b> of the driver piston <b>15</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(A)</figref>-(C). The driver and the pusher pistons <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> are shaped so that the front wall <b>44</b> of the driver piston <b>15</b> can approach close to the inner wall <b>34</b> of the pusher piston <b>17</b> and concentrate the compressible fluid between their conical portions. The shape of the pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>, makes the pistons lighter thus reducing the weight of the compression driver <b>10</b>. The pusher piston <b>17</b> can further comprise a plurality of gussets <b>36</b> formed at the outer wall <b>38</b> of the pusher piston <b>17</b>. The gussets <b>36</b> are configured to increase the stiffness of the pusher piston <b>17</b>. In one alternative embodiment (not shown), the outer wall <b>38</b> can be a solid plate that encloses the gussets <b>36</b> such that the gussets are not in contact with the liquid medium contained in the pusher bore <b>16</b>. Persons skilled in the art would understand that the gussets <b>36</b> can be omitted and the stiffness of the pusher piston <b>17</b> can be increased by using a material that can provide the desire stiffness (and lightness) or by adding different features other than the gussets without departing from the scope of the invention. The pusher piston <b>17</b> further comprises a pair of seal seats <b>39</b> for containing seals (not shown). A protruding ledge <b>37</b> extends outwardly from an outer surface of the side wall <b>32</b>. The protruding ledge <b>37</b> cooperates with the ledge <b>33</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) formed at the open end <b>11</b> of the pusher bore <b>16</b> to prevent the pusher piston <b>17</b> from being dislodged out of the bore <b>16</b>. Additionally, liquid medium that gets trapped in a space between the two ledges <b>33</b>, <b>37</b> as the pusher piston <b>17</b> approaches the open end <b>11</b>, creates resistance by the liquid having to divert around the ledges <b>33</b>, <b>37</b> and thus contributes to decelerating the piston <b>17</b> and preventing damage to the piston <b>17</b> and/or the bore <b>16</b>. In addition the pusher piston <b>17</b> can further comprise a ledge <b>37</b><i>a </i>formed near the inner wall <b>34</b> that can interact with the ledge <b>35</b> formed at the proximal end <b>31</b> of the pusher bore <b>16</b> to prevent the pusher piston <b>17</b> from being pushed into the driver bore <b>14</b>. Alternatively, other configuration of retaining means readily apparent to one skilled in the art can be used to prevent the pusher piston <b>17</b> from being dislodged out of the pusher bore <b>16</b> or pushed into the driver bore <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> graphically illustrates a pressure pulse at a driver's bore and a vessel wall during the compression operation as well as a position trajectory over time of the driver piston, the pusher piston and a liner interface, for one exemplary embodiment. The curves illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> are as an example of a compression driver of this exemplary embodiment that has a driver piston with a mass of about 55 kg, a driver bore with a length of about 2 m and a diameter of about 340 mm, a pusher piston with a mass of about 10 kg, a length of about 0.6 m; and a bore diameter of about 290 mm. A 50 L accumulator containing driver fluid at a pressure of 20 MPa is provided to accelerate the driver piston. The initial pressure of the compressible fluid in the driver bore between the two pistons is about 0.7 MPa. The compression driver is used to implode a liquid liner to collapse a spherical cavity with radius of about 1.5 m that is formed within the liquid liner. As can be noticed by the graph, the pusher piston and the liquid liner (see respective curves <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>) accelerate only when the driver piston (curve <b>502</b>) is near the pusher piston (end of 2<sup>nd </sup>stage). Peak inward pressure on an annular face surface at the junction of the driver and pusher bores and a peak outward pressure at the wall of the vessel <b>507</b> occur at the same time (i.e. when the pusher piston is accelerated), thus counteracting each other, and reducing the overall stress on the vessel wall caused by the compression operation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one mode of operation of the compression driver <b>10</b>, a plurality of the compression drivers <b>10</b> can be used in a plasma compression system <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>(A)</figref> and (B). The plasma compression system <b>50</b> comprises the vessel <b>52</b> that can be partially filled with the liquid medium. A liquid rotation/circulating mechanism <b>53</b> is provided to rotate the liquid medium flowing in the vessel <b>52</b> such that the liquid medium is pushed into the pusher bore <b>16</b> of the driver <b>10</b> through the open end <b>11</b>. The rotation of the liquid medium in the vessel <b>52</b> also forms a liquid liner <b>55</b> in the vessel <b>52</b> with a rotating inner interface that defines an evacuated cavity formed within the liner <b>55</b>. The vessel <b>52</b> has a wall with a plurality of openings forming ports <b>54</b> that extend through the wall. A plurality of compression drivers <b>10</b> are mounted to the wall of the vessel <b>52</b> and are arranged at the periphery of the vessel <b>52</b>, such that the pusher bore <b>16</b> of the driver <b>10</b> extends along the port <b>54</b>. For example, the pusher bore <b>16</b> of the driver <b>10</b> can be inserted into the port <b>54</b>, such that the opened end <b>11</b> of the pusher bore <b>16</b> is aligned with the inner surface of the vessel <b>52</b>. A plasma generator <b>57</b> can generate the plasma. The plasma generator <b>57</b> has an outlet (not shown) that is connected to an inlet opening <b>59</b> formed in the wall of the vessel <b>52</b>. The evacuated cavity formed within the liquid liner has an entrance opening <b>59</b> that is aligned with the outlet of the plasma generator <b>57</b> such that the generated plasma is injected into the cavity. The liquid liner <b>55</b> in the vessel <b>52</b> and the liquid medium in the pusher bore <b>16</b> are in fluid communication, such that when the liquid medium in the pusher bore <b>16</b> is displaced out of the pusher bore <b>16</b> due to the acceleration of the pusher piston <b>17</b> (as described herein above) it will implode the liquid liner <b>55</b> inwardly collapsing the cavity and compressing the plasma trapped therein. A controller (not shown) can be provided to receive and process the signals obtained from the sensors of each of the drivers <b>10</b> and provide an output to a number of valves to tune the position of the driver piston <b>15</b> of such drivers <b>10</b> and thus tune the acceleration profile of the pusher pistons <b>17</b> and therefore control the trajectory of liquid liner implosion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tuning of the acceleration profile of the driver piston <b>15</b> can be done by adjusting the pressure behind the driver piston <b>15</b> (pressure of the accumulator) and/or by adjusting the pressure of the compressible fluid between the driver and the pusher pistons <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> during the compression operation. For example, more fluid can be added behind the driver piston <b>15</b> to accelerate it or some fluid can be vented to decelerate the piston <b>15</b>, and thus adjust the acceleration profile of the driver piston <b>15</b> and consequently the acceleration profile of the pusher piston <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">An experimental embodiment of the compression driver <b>10</b> has been tested at General Fusion Inc. and the results from the experiments were compared with the theoretical predictions.
