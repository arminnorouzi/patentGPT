The user enters its debit or credit card or payment card to a specific payment terminal in order to perform the transaction. In some cases a vehicle identification device (typically equipped with an RFID reader) is used for charging or fueling. In other cases a mobile payment method is used. Such a mobile payment typically generates a pin code in response to a request for performing a charging or fueling. In some cases the user has to enter various data such as the pin code and the selected fueling device to the payment terminal or telephone.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The term computing device refers herein to a device that includes a processing unit. Examples for such devices are a personal computer, a laptop, a server, a tablet a cellular device, a mobile device of a driver, a computing device embedded in a vehicle and IOT (internet of things) device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The term site refers herein to a charging station or a refueling station. The refueling may refer, for example, to petrol, gas, hydrogen, biologic refueling etc. The charging operation includes electronic charging which may be implemented, for example, by replacing a battery or by connecting to a charger.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The term property or property of the vehicle refers herein to properties that enable to identify the vehicle by methods such as image processing and deep learning. Such properties may be generic properties or unique properties. Such generic properties may by properties that are generic to the vehicle model and make. Such generic properties include for example color, make, plate number, size of the vehicle, vehicle type and vehicle model. Such generic properties may also include the entities that are authorized to power the vehicle (e.g. the driver, family member an employee in a company that holds a fleet of vehicles etc).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The unique properties may include properties that are specific to a certain vehicle and that may be changed in time. Such unique properties may be explicit (humanly distinguishable) or implicit (embedded in neural networks or detected by neural networks). Examples of explicit properties are specific damages to the vehicle, color of the vehicle, a sticker and the like. The explicit properties may be identified by object detection techniques, for example convolutional or neural network. An example for such a neural network is the YOLO real time object detection tool.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The term signature refers herein to one or more values that are calculated from the generic properties or from the unique properties or a combination thereof, wherein each property may be assigned with a certain weight.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The signature may be used to associate two vehicles in the same time frame, in one example such an association may allow to identify the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A signature from one or more captures of the same vehicle may be used as a reference in the re-identification process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The weight of a property in re-identification and in particular, the unique properties may be affected by the time of the capture; thus a recent event has more influence on the signature value comparing to an old event. Examples of such events are accident or a tire change.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example a weight of a property in a reference signature update process may be increased if it is sufficiently different than the same property in the reference signature. An example of such scenario is an accident considerably changing the appearance of the right side of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to some embodiments a property is also assigned a weight when computing similarity between signatures. In such an embodiment a property that enables to better differ an item from other items may be assigned with a higher weight. For example a property that identifies a unique sticker on a vehicle may be assigned with a high weight and may affect the signature similarity more than other properties.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each object may have a signature and the signature of a vehicle may be comprised from other object signatures. In one example value the signature of a plate number may be derived from the number of digits in the plate number and the position of each digit within the plate number. The signature of the vehicle may be derived from the signature of the plate number and/or other signatures of other properties or any combination thereof. Such other signature may be for example the signature of the headlights of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term confidence level refers herein to a value that represents a level of certainty in identifying a vehicle. Such a value may be derived from comparing the properties of the item or the signature of an item to properties or a signature of another item. If the value is above threshold the confidence level may lead to identifying a vehicle. In one example a confidence level of identifying a vehicle by comparing a signature that is calculated from a capture of a vehicle to an existing signature may be 90%.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The confidence level may also be affected by elimination methods. For example, the confidence level of an identification of a vehicle whose plate number is hidden may increase due to the fact that this vehicle is the only vehicle on site at the time frame of calculating the confidence level.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another example would be reduced (or nullified) confidence of vehicle identification, if the same vehicle was identified a short time ago at a location distant from the current location.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term powering refers herein to fueling or charging. The fueling maybe, for example, by gas or petrol or hydrogen biologic materials or any other materials that could provide power to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term powering device refers herein to a fuel pump or to an EV charging spot.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term transaction or powering transaction refers herein to a transaction of powering a vehicle.

Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood to have the same meaning as &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as defined above.

This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; (or, equivalently, &#x201c;at least one of A or B,&#x201d; or, equivalently &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;carrying,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;holding,&#x201d; &#x201c;composed of,&#x201d; and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to.
