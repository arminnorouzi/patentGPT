One approach is to inscribe the waveguides by index of refraction modification into the optical crystal, as described, for example, in the article &#x201c;High-repetition-rate femtosecond-laser micromachining of low-loss optical-lattice-like-waveguides in lithium niobate&#x201d;, T. Piromjitpong et al., Proc. of SPIE Vol. 10684 (2018). A further approach is to produce the microstructures by laser ablation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Both approaches are described in the article &#x201c;Optical waveguides in crystalline dielectric materials produced by femtosecond-laser micromachining&#x201d;, Feng Chen et. al., Laser Photonics Rev. 8, No. 2, 2014. It is specified there, inter alia, that ridge waveguides can be produced by laser ablation in that channels are introduced into the substrate, between the side walls of which the ridge waveguide is formed. It is also described therein that a disadvantage of the ridge waveguides produced in this way is that rough side walls are formed during the laser ablation using femtosecond laser pulses, which reduce the quality of the ridge waveguide and increase its losses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for producing a substrate is described in EP 0 803 747 A2, which is provided with an optical waveguide in the form of a ridge waveguide. The ridge waveguide is produced by laser ablation, for example, using an excimer laser at wavelengths between 150 nm and 300 nm and pulse durations in the range of nanoseconds. For this purpose, the laser beam can be aligned on a surface of the substrate and moved or scanned over the substrate. The optical axis of the laser beam is aligned vertically in relation to the surface of the substrate for this purpose. The ridge waveguide is to have the most rectangular possible cross-sectional profile to avoid light losses.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The production of microstructures in a diamond crystal is made more difficult in comparison to crystals made of other materials in that the carbon atoms have an extremely high bonding energy and therefore the laser ablation threshold is very high upon the use of pulsed (UV) lasers at 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Etching processes are therefore typically used for the microstructuring of diamond, for example, reactive ion etching, cf. the article &#x201c;Inverse Designed Diamond Photonics&#x201d;, C. Dori et al., nature communications (2019) 10:3309, the article &#x201c;Development of all-diamond scanning probes based on Faraday cage angled etching techniques&#x201d; by C. Giese et al., MRS Advances, Vol. 5, pp. 1899-1907 (2020), in which an RF bias cage is used in the reactive ion etching, or the article &#x201c;Anisotropic diamond etching through thermochemical reaction between Ni and diamond in high-temperature water vapour&#x201d;, M. Nagai et al., Scientific Reports (2018) 8:6687, in which an etching process with the aid of a thermochemical reaction between Ni and diamond in high-temperature water vapour is described.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the limited interaction depths of the fs lasers typically used for laser ablation, previous experiments in microstructuring of diamond crystals by laser ablation have been limited to the production of laser-induced periodic surface structures having structure sizes of typically less than 200 nm, cf., for example, the article &#x201c;Photonic structures in diamond based on femtosecond UV laser induced periodic surface structuring (LIPSS)&#x201d;, E. Granados et al., Optics Express, Vol. 25, No. 13, p. 15330.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the article &#x201c;Nonlinear photooxidation of diamond surface exposed to femtosecond laser pulses&#x201d;, V. V. Kononenko et al., Laser Phys. Lett. 12 (2014) 096101, it is described that upon the irradiation of diamond using fs laser pulses, a photo-induced oxidation of the carbon of the diamond crystal occurs, during which volatile etching products such as CO or CO<sub>2 </sub>are formed. In the article &#x201c;Nonlinear photooxidation of diamond surface exposed to femtosecond laser pulses&#x201d;, V. I. Konov, Laser Physics Letters 12 (2015), 096101, it is described, inter alia, that the desorption rate of carbon species during the photooxidation is proportional to the square root of the induced plasma density.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The optically usable microstructures which are inscribed in a diamond crystal can be, for example, waveguide structures or geometries for collecting light. In particular if the diamond crystal is doped with colour centres, for example, with NV (&#x201c;nitrogen vacancy&#x201d;) centres, it can be used for implementing quantum sensors, for quantum cryptography, up to implementing quantum computers. In all of these applications, the fluorescence of the colour centres is used as an information carrier, which has to be read out efficiently. In diamond-based quantum sensors, light-guiding microstructures in the diamond crystal can contribute to increasing the signal-to-noise ratio upon readout and thus improving the sensitivity of the quantum sensors. For example, the microstructures in diamond crystals which are doped with colour centres can be used, on the one hand, to enable an optimum optical excitation density of excitation light at an excitation wavelength (upon the use of NV centres, for example, between 510 nm-550 nm) and, on the other hand, an optimum collection of the florescent light generated by the excitation light (for example, at fluorescence wavelengths between 620 nm-680 nm), for example, to supply the florescent light to a detector. Further applications of the microstructuring of diamond crystals are precise laser processing and structuring of diamond components such as laser windows, diamond-based tweeters in loudspeakers, or diamond components for heat dissipation in electronic circuits and switchgear.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To form microstructures of these types and others, directly writing laser ablation methods suggest themselves. The precise formation of microstructures, i.e., of structures having structure widths in the micrometre range, by laser ablation in a diamond crystal has not been possible up to this point due to the problems described further above, however. In particular, no method for three-dimensional structuring of a diamond crystal is known, in which freestanding microstructures or waveguide structures are formed in the diamond crystal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for forming at least one freestanding microstructure on a diamond crystal includes the step of removing material from the diamond crystal so as to form a structured surface, wherein the removing of the material includes creating at least two trenches, each trench having a bottom and two side walls and wherein adjacent side walls of the at least two trenches form side walls of the structured surface.

At least one masking layer is subsequently applied in a planar manner to the structured surface. The masking layer is selectively removed in a subsequent step only in the region of the bottom of the trenches in order to be able to deepen the trenches at least along the side walls in a following step.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The at least partial removal of the masking layer from the bottom of the trenches can be carried out by removing material by means of laser ablation. Alternatively to the selective removal of the masking layer in the region of the bottoms of the trenches by laser ablation, a so-called lift-off process can also be used, in which a photoresist is lithographically structured so that it only remains in the region of the bottoms of the trenches. After the masking layer is deposited over the entire surface, the remaining photoresist is removed, for example, by a solvent attack, due to which the masking layer present on the remaining photoresist is also dissolved or removed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Due to the deepening, a section is formed on a respective side wall which is not covered by the masking layer. This section of the side wall of the trench is accessible to an etching attack and enables the microstructure, in particular the waveguide structure, to be undercut. The etching attack therefore takes place underneath the freestanding microstructure or waveguide structure to be produced. The undercutting typically takes place with the aid of an isotropic etching process in the form of a dry etching process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The removal of the material, the at least partial removal of the masking layer, and the additional removal of the material are carried out with the aid of anisotropic methods, typically by laser ablation (see above), in contrast to etching. If the masking layer used should be optically absorbing in the wavelength range used, the masking layer is to be completely removed from the structured surface after the exposure of the microstructures. The removal of the masking layer can also be carried out by laser ablation or possibly with the aid of a wet etching or a dry etching process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inventors have recognized that conventional methods for three-dimensional structuring of crystals, in which freestanding microstructures are formed by undercutting, cannot be applied in the case of a diamond crystal: A three-dimensional structuring of the surface of a diamond crystal by 3D lithography and a subsequent reactive ionic etching method is not possible due to the low selectivity (approximately 30:1) of known hard masks, which are used during the etching of diamond by means of reactive ion etching. Using such a method, only three-dimensional depth structures in the order of magnitude of a few 100 nm can be implemented, which are not suitable as optically usable microstructures or waveguide structures. In contrast thereto, in the method described here, freestanding microstructures can be generated which have a height in the order of magnitude of micrometres.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one variant, the undercutting of the microstructure, in particular the waveguide structure, is carried out by thermal oxidation of the diamond crystal at a temperature between 600&#xb0; C. and 1100&#xb0; C., for example, between 650&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., preferably in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, in particular in an oxygen plasma. The thermal oxidation of the diamond crystal represents an isotropic etching process in which only the regions of the surface of the diamond crystal not covered by the masking layer are attacked. The process duration of the thermal oxidation conforms to the etching speed which prevails in the case of the respectively set process parameters (temperature, pressure, oxygen content in the environment, etc.) and can be from a few seconds to several minutes. The oxygen-containing atmosphere in the environment of the diamond crystal can have molecular oxygen admixed, however, it is also possible that reactive gases which contain oxygen, for example, NO or N<sub>2</sub>O, are admixed to the oxygen-containing atmosphere. It is possible that an oxygen plasma is used for the undercutting, for example, if the step of undercutting is carried out in a conventional CVD reactor. The reactivity of the oxygen is increased by the oxygen plasma and the process temperature required for the thermal oxidation can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further variant, to smooth the structured surface, a thermal oxidation of the structured surface is carried out (before the deposition of the masking layer) at a temperature between 600&#xb0; C. and 1100&#xb0; C., for example, between 650&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C. or between 800&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., preferably in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. In this variant, smoothing of the structured surface and thus also of the microstructures or the waveguide structures is carried out by generally brief thermal oxidation of the structured surface at durations which are typically between a few seconds and one minute. The process parameters, in particular the temperature, the pressure, and the duration of the thermal oxidation, are set deliberately to minimize roughness, without a material removal occurring here, as is the case during the undercutting described further above. The basis of the smoothing is the fact that a rough surface offers more attack possibilities for an oxidative reaction than a smooth surface and therefore a rough surface oxidizes faster than a smooth surface. It is obvious that such a smoothing of microstructures or waveguide structures can also advantageously be applied if no freestanding microstructures or waveguide structures are formed, i.e., if the further above-described steps such as the deposition of the at least one masking layer, etc. are not carried out.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one variant, the deposition of the at least one masking layer is carried out by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The masking layer is used to protect the structured surface before the following isotropic etching attack. The deposition of the masking layer by a CVD or an ALD process enables a conformal deposition in which both the upper side of the microstructures and also their side walls are covered as homogeneously as possible, in order to create isotropic undercutting only at the desired locations. Temperature-stable nitrides or oxides, for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiN, or other amorphous, temperature-stable oxides or nitrides such as TiO or TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO, TiN, AlN, . . . have proven to be advantageous as materials for the masking layer. Typical layer thicknesses of the masking layer are in the order of magnitude between approximately 10 nm and approximately 1000 nm, ideally between 200 nm and 300 nm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further variant, the removal of the material, the at least partial removal of the masking layer, and/or the additional removal of the material are carried out by laser ablation by means of a preferably pulsed laser beam. A pulsed laser beam in the form of an ultrashort pulse laser beam has proven to be advantageous for the laser ablation of diamond material (see below). An ultrashort pulse laser beam can also be used for the at least partial removal of the masking layer, however, it is also possible that the removal of the masking layer is carried out in c/w operation or using a laser beam having significantly longer pulse durations. It is possible that a laser beam is used for the partial removal of the masking layer, the wavelength of which does not correspond to the wavelength of the laser beam used for the removal or the additional removal of the material of the diamond crystal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one refinement of this variant, a temperature of the diamond crystal during the removal of the material and/or during the additional removal of the material is greater than 600&#xb0; C., preferably greater than 700&#xb0; C., in particular greater than 800&#xb0; C., and less than 1000&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inventors have recognized that diamond is very inert up to a specific threshold temperature and does not display any reactive behaviour even in the presence of oxygen. Upon exceeding the threshold temperature, diamond reacts very quickly with oxygen and combusts at the same time (thermal oxidation). The ablation threshold of the diamond material decreases with increasing temperature and accordingly the etching rate of the diamond material increases&#x2014;with otherwise identical process conditions. If the threshold temperature is exceeded, the diamond material generally burns off in an uncontrolled manner, so that the temperature of the diamond material is to be kept below the threshold temperature.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It has been shown that at temperatures of the diamond material of greater than 600&#xb0; C., 700&#xb0; C., or 800&#xb0; C., the ablation threshold can be decreased significantly and the removal rate per laser pulse can thus be significantly increased. It is therefore advantageous to keep the temperature of the diamond material during the formation of the microstructure(s) just below the threshold temperature of the diamond material for thermal oxidation, which is typically in the order of magnitude of approximately 1000&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The material removal during the structuring of the diamond crystal therefore preferably takes place by way of a combination of a laser introduction and a temperature introduction. The pulse energies of the pulsed laser beam which is used for the laser ablation can be reduced by the additional temperature action on the diamond crystal. In this way, the structural integrity and the surface quality during the formation of the microstructures can be improved. The temperature introduction moreover has the advantage that the debris which is created during the laser ablation is reduced, since amorphized carbon components in the debris combust immediately at temperatures of greater than 600&#xb0; C. due to the lower oxidation temperature in comparison to diamond.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A temperature-control unit can be used to heat up the diamond crystal to the temperatures indicated further above. The temperature-control unit is generally a heating unit, but it can possibly be a unit which is designed to both heat and also cool the diamond material. The temperature-control unit can be, for example, a resistance heater or a susceptor heated via IR radiation or in another way, for example, made of silicon. The temperature-control unit is typically used to heat up not only the surface of the diamond crystal, which is irradiated using the pulsed laser beam, but the entire diamond crystal as homogeneously as possible. The temperature-control unit keeps the diamond crystal, during the formation of the microstructure(s), at a temperature which is in the above-specified value range. It is possible, but not absolutely necessary, to set the temperature of the diamond crystal to a specific temperature value with the aid of the temperature-control unit and to keep it at this temperature during the formation of the microstructure(s). It is possible to monitor the temperature at the surface of the diamond crystal with the aid of a temperature sensor or the like and possibly to regulate it to a predefined temperature setpoint value or a predefined setpoint temperature curve.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one refinement, the removal of the material comprises: radiating the pulsed laser beam on the surface of the diamond crystal, moving the pulsed laser beam and the diamond crystal in relation to one another along a feed direction along at least one ablation path, wherein preferably the laser beam and the diamond crystal are moved in relation to one another multiple times along laterally offset ablation paths to form the trenches.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To form the microstructure or a respective trench, in general multiple ablation paths are offset in parallel to one another systematically. The ablation paths either extend linearly or form curved structures in the XY plane on the surface of the crystal. In this way, for example, meandering structures or tapers can be created. Typically, multiple ablation paths are superimposed laterally and possibly vertically, i.e., in the thickness direction of the diamond crystal. In this way, trenches having a predefined width and depth can be created in the diamond crystal. In dependence on the desired geometry, the laser parameters can also be adapted in dependence on the respective ablation path. For details of the formation of microstructures in the form of (ridge) waveguides between two adjacent trenches, reference is made to DE 10 2019 214 684 A1, which is made part of the content of this application in its entirety by reference.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The two trenches, between which the microstructure is formed, have a predefined distance from one another which defines the width of the microstructure. It is not necessary for this distance to be constant, rather it is possible that the distance and thus the width of the microstructure or the (ridge) waveguide varies in the longitudinal direction of the trenches. The same applies to the depth of the trenches, which define the height of the side walls of the microstructure and thus the height of the microstructure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">During the radiation of the laser beam on the surface of the diamond crystal, a beam axis of the laser beam can be aligned perpendicularly to the generally planar surface of the diamond crystal. In this case, a translation movement of a bearing unit typically takes place, for example, in the form of a translation platform, on which the generally plate-shaped crystal is mounted during the formation of the microstructures, in a horizontal plane (parallel to the surface of the diamond crystal). The laser processing head, from which the pulsed laser beam exits and is aligned on the surface of the diamond crystal, can be arranged fixed in place for this purpose, however, it is also possible that the laser processing head is moved over the surface of the diamond crystal. The laser beam exiting from the laser processing head is typically focused in this case on the surface of the diamond crystal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">During the movement of the laser beam and the diamond crystal in relation to one another, alternatively a beam axis of the laser beam can be tilted at an angle in relation to a normal direction of the surface of the diamond crystal, wherein the angle is preferably in a plane perpendicular to the feed direction. In this case, the laser beam is not incident perpendicularly, but rather at an angle not equal to 0&#xb0; on the surface of the diamond crystal. The feed direction of the ablation path along which the material is removed generally extends in parallel to the processing plane or to the surface of the diamond crystal. The angle at which the laser beam is tilted in relation to the normal direction of the surface is typically in a plane which extends perpendicularly to the feed direction (which possibly varies depending on location), but this is not absolutely required.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described in DE 10 2019 214 684 A1, which is made part of the content of this application in its entirety by reference, due to the alignment at the angle, it is possible to achieve that one of the two side walls or side edges of the ablation path extends steeper and the other side wall of the ablation path, which is created in the diamond crystal, extends flatter than would be the case with perpendicular incidence of the laser beam on the surface.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The above-described angle is typically between 2&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;, preferably between 10&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;, in particular between 15&#xb0; and 30&#xb0;. It has proven to be advantageous to select the angle at which the laser beam is aligned in relation to the normal direction in the specified interval in order to achieve that one of the two side walls of the ablation path is aligned as steeply as possible, i.e., as parallel as possible to the normal direction of the surface. For the case in which the side wall of the ablation path or the trench in the diamond crystal forms the side wall of a microstructure, for example, a waveguide, the steepest possible alignment is advantageous, since in this way light losses due to the escape of light guided in the waveguide through the side wall can be kept low. Rotationally symmetrical eigenmodes can be guided in the waveguide by steep side walls and a settable aspect ratio of height to width.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For the case in which linear ablation paths are to be created, the feed direction during the relative movement of the laser beam and the diamond crystal is constant. The feed direction can vary depending on location if curved ablation paths or microstructures are to be created. In both cases, it is to be ensured that the angle at which the laser beam is tilted in relation to the normal direction of the surface of the diamond crystal can be set independently of the selected feed direction&#x2014;which possibly varies depending on location. In a conventional laser scanner, which is fixed in place, for processing a workpiece arranged fixed in place, this is typically not the case, since the laser beam is aligned at a predetermined scanning angle at a respective position on the surface of the workpiece. There are various possibilities for tilting the beam axis of the laser beam at an angle in relation to the normal direction of the surface of the diamond crystal independently of the feed direction. For details, reference is made to DE 10 2019 214 684 A1.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">If a laser beam having a round beam profile is radiated at an angle to the surface of the diamond crystal, it is thus incident with an elliptical, non-rotationally symmetrical beam profile (spot) on the surface. To nonetheless generate a round beam profile on the surface, a laser beam having an elliptical beam profile can be radiated onto the surface. Such an elliptical beam profile can be generated by means of a beamforming optical unit, for example, with the aid of a cylinder lens or a lens telescope or the like. In particular, such a beamforming optical unit can be designed to change the aspect ratio of the elliptical beam profile. For details of the radiation of a laser beam having an elliptical beam profile onto a crystal, reference is also made to DE 10 2019 214 684 A1, cited further above.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It can possibly be advantageous if the beam profile of the laser beam deliberately deviates from a round or rotationally symmetrical geometry, for example, to generate a line focus on the surface of the diamond crystal, as described, for example, in WO 2018/019374 A1, which is made part of the content of this application in its entirety by reference. Such a line focus can be generated, for example, by using asymmetrical modes. The roughness of the produced microstructures can also be improved upon the use of a line focus.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further refinement, the pulsed laser beam is radiated at a wavelength of less than 450 nm onto the surface of the diamond crystal. It has been shown that the use of a wavelength of the pulsed laser beam in the UV wavelength range significantly improves the quality of the (optically usable) microstructures produced during the laser ablation in the diamond material. A laser beam having a greater wavelength can possibly be used for the removal of the marking layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The pulsed laser beam is typically radiated at pulse durations of less than 20 ps, preferably less than 850 fs, particularly preferably less than 500 fs, in particular less than 300 fs onto the surface of the diamond crystal in order to remove the material of the diamond crystal. It has been shown that the use of pulse durations in the fs range significantly improves the quality of the produced microstructures. As was described further above, it is not absolutely necessary for the removal of the masking layer that the laser beam has the pulse durations described further above.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pulsed laser beam can be generated, for example, by a solid-state laser or by an excimer laser. Solid-state lasers enable the generation of laser pulses having low pulse durations in the fs range. Solid-state lasers can generate wavelengths in the UV wavelength range, for example, at 343 nm, by frequency doubling or frequency multiplying. Alternatively, it is possible that the pulsed laser beam is generated by an excimer laser.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Repetition rates between approximately 600 kHz and 1000 kHz are typically used as laser parameters for the ablation described further above. It is possible that the repetition rate varies, i.e., that short, high repetition rates followed by long pulse pauses are used for the ablation (burst operation). Typical feed speeds are between approximately 500 and 1500 mm/s and are therefore higher than in conventional production methods. The average laser power is in the order of magnitude between approximately 1 and 2.5 Watts, the energy introduction per laser pulse is in the order of magnitude between approximately 1.5 and 5 &#x3bc;J. In principle, the removal rate and the structure depth may be set deliberately by a targeted combination of pulse energy, pulse duration, and pulse number as well as feed speed and angle of the laser beam in relation to the surface.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a further variant, the diamond crystal is preferably arranged jointly with the temperature-control unit in a gas-tight process chamber during the undercutting, during the removal of material, during the additional removal of material, and/or during the smoothing of the structured surface. The gas-tight process chamber can be subjected to a defined gas atmosphere, which simplifies the process control. In particular for the case in which the temperature-control unit heats the diamond crystal by the emission of contact heat (conduction), it is advantageous or required for the temperature-control unit to be arranged jointly with the diamond crystal in the process chamber. For the radiation of the pulsed laser beam into the process chamber during the laser ablation, the process chamber typically has a window which is transparent to the wavelength of the pulsed laser beam, for example, a window made of quartz glass. The process chamber can be connected to a pump which suctions gas out of the interior of the process chamber. The pump can in particular be a vacuum pump. Typically, all relevant process parameters such as the temperature of the diamond crystal or the environment of the diamond crystal, the pressure, and the oxygen content can be set with the aid of the process chamber, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an interior of the process chamber, the oxygen-containing atmosphere described further above can be generated, which can be used during the undercutting, during the smoothing of the structured surface, during the removal, and/or during the additional removal of material of the diamond crystal in order to strengthen the thermal oxidation or the action of the pulsed laser beam on the diamond material. The use of oxygen as a reactive gas component in the process chamber has proven to be advantageous for carrying out the method. As was described further above, the use of other reactive gases is also possible, for example, NO or N<sub>2</sub>O. The oxygen content or the partial pressure of the oxygen in the process chamber can preferably be set with the aid of a suitable inlet, for example, with the aid of a controllable valve.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At least one inert gas, preferably nitrogen, can also be contained in the process chamber. The inert gas makes it possible to have the laser ablation process run in a controlled manner, in particular if a reactive gas component is contained in the process chamber. Preferably, the content or the partial pressure of the inert gas in the process chamber can be set, for example, in that the inert gas is supplied to the process chamber with the aid of a controllable inlet, for example, using a switchable or controllable valve. It is advantageous if a practically arbitrary mixing ratio of the reactive gas and the inert gas can be set in the process chamber. To achieve this, the inert gas and the reactive gas can preferably be supplied to the process chamber via two separately settable or controllable valves.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In particular for the step of undercutting and for the step of smoothing, it is advantageous if a gas pressure in the process chamber is set, preferably regulated, to improve the process control. As was described further above, the process chamber is typically connected to a pump, which suctions gas out of the interior of the process chamber. The total pressure or the gas pressure in the process chamber can be measured with the aid of a pressure meter and the pump or a valve can be activated suitably with the aid of a control or regulating device in order to keep the total pressure in the process chamber to a predefined setpoint value. The reduction of the gas pressure in the process chamber is used to reduce the reaction speed during the crystal processing and offers a further degree of freedom in the process control. The gas pressure in the process chamber during pressure-reduced processing is typically in a range between 10 mbar and 100 mbar. For the case in which the pump is connected via a switchable valve to the interior of the process chamber, the pump can be separated from the interior of the process chamber by closing the valve, as soon as the desired total pressure is reached in the process chamber.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a further refinement, the diamond crystal is doped in the region of the freestanding microstructure, in particular the freestanding waveguide structure, with colour centres, preferably with NV centres. In the three-dimensional structuring of the diamond crystal described here, freestanding microstructures can be deliberately generated, in the volume of which the diamond crystal is doped with colour centres. It is possible to limit the doping with the colour centres to the freestanding microstructures, in particular the freestanding waveguide structures, i.e., that the diamond crystal is not doped with colour centres outside the freestanding waveguide structures. Freestanding waveguide structures which are doped with colour centres, in particular with NV centres, can be used, for example, as active sensor or measuring regions to enable a localized measurement, for example, of magnetic fields or of tensions. The freestanding waveguide structure enables the excitation density of excitation light which is supplied to the freestanding waveguide structure to be optimized by a suitable selection of the geometry. The extent of the measuring regions can be limited in the vertical direction by the exposure. Moreover, the geometry of the freestanding waveguide structure can be adapted for the optimization of the excitation density, for example, the cross section of the freestanding waveguide structure can decrease in the propagation direction of the excitation light, which can be achieved by a tapering, truncated-cone-shaped or wedge-shaped geometry.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one refinement, the method comprises: forming at least one further microstructure, preferably at least one further waveguide structure, in the diamond crystal, which is used in particular to supply excitation light to the freestanding waveguide structure and/or to discharge fluorescent light from the freestanding waveguide structure, wherein the diamond crystal is not doped in the region of the at least one further microstructure, preferably the at least one further waveguide structure, with colour centres, preferably is not doped with NV centres. As described further above, the freestanding waveguide structure can be used as an active region, for example, as a measuring region, in which excitation light is converted into fluorescent light. The further waveguide structures can be used as passive regions for improving the light guiding during the supply of excitation light to the freestanding waveguide structure and for discharging fluorescent light from the freestanding waveguide structure or for collecting the light emissions of the colour centres.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To ensure a mechanical stability of the exposed microstructures or waveguide structures or to ensure a mechanically stable connection of the microstructures or the waveguide structure to the remaining diamond substrate and to adapt the freestanding microstructures or waveguide structures to the photonic layout to be implemented, support structures can be used. The support structures are to have as little contact surface as possible with the actual waveguide structures, but are to be structured sufficiently large that they are not completely undercut during the exposure of the microstructures or the waveguides. The further microstructures or the further waveguide structures are typically inscribed in the diamond crystal before the masking layer is deposited on the structured surface.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one refinement, the diamond crystal comprises a first layer, which is doped with the colour centres, preferably with the NV centres, and the diamond crystal comprises a second layer, which adjoins the first layer and which is not doped with the colour centres, preferably not with the NV centres, wherein the freestanding microstructures, preferably the freestanding waveguide structures, are formed in the first layer, and wherein the further microstructures, preferably the further waveguide structures, are formed in the second layer, which preferably adjoins the surface of the diamond crystal. In this refinement, the light, for example, in the form of excitation light, can initially be guided starting from a coupling position with the aid of the further waveguide structures into the second, undoped layer. The light can then be transferred at a transition between the further waveguide structure and the freestanding waveguide structure into the first layer, which is doped using the colour centres and can be used, for example, for sensory measurement. This has the advantage that the light can be guided undisturbed up to a respective measuring region inside the diamond material and only interacts with the colour centres at the location at which a measurement is to take place.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To produce such a structured diamond crystal, typically a diamond crystal is used as the starting material in which the first layer forms a buried layer, which is doped with the colour centres, while the second layer adjoins the surface of the diamond crystal from which the material of the diamond crystal is removed. The doped buried layer can be created in the diamond crystal in a manner known to a person skilled in the art. In the second, surface-proximal layer, the further waveguide structures are formed, while in the first, buried layer, the freestanding microstructures or waveguide structures are formed. The formation of the freestanding waveguide structures and the further waveguide structures can take place in this case in that trenches are formed, the depth of which varies, so that the trenches extend at least along a section, along which the freestanding microstructures are formed, in the first, buried layer to form the side walls of the freestanding microstructures, while the trenches do not extend in the first layer along a section along which the further microstructures or waveguide structures are formed&#x2014;with the exception of a transition region. However, it is also possible in principle that the role of the first layer and the second layer is exchanged, i.e., that the first layer which has the colour centres adjoins the surface of the diamond crystal. The diamond crystal can be produced, for example, via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). To achieve the doping in the first layer, but not in the second layer, for example, doping gas can deliberately be switched on and off during the CVD growth process.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one refinement, the structuring of the surface comprises the removal of the material of the second layer above the microstructure to be formed, in particular the waveguide structure to be formed, to expose the upper side of the microstructure to be formed, in particular the waveguide structure to be formed. For the case that the freestanding microstructure or waveguide structure is formed in the second, buried layer, it is necessary for the material of the first layer to be removed above the microstructure or waveguide structure to be formed in order to create the upper side of the freestanding microstructure or waveguide structure. In a region adjoining the upper side of the microstructure, a material removal in the second layer typically also takes place in order to form a transition region between the freestanding microstructure and those further microstructures which adjoin the freestanding microstructure. The exposure of the microstructure or the waveguide structure takes place as described further above, i.e., by the removal of material to create the trenches, the deposition of a masking layer, the partial removal of the masking layer, and the subsequent (isotropic) undercutting.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A further aspect of the invention relates to a diamond crystal, comprising: at least one freestanding microstructure, in particular at least one freestanding waveguide structure, which is produced according to the method described further above. The diamond crystal can have the further microstructures or waveguide structures described further above in addition to the microstructure or waveguide structure. In particular, the freestanding microstructures or waveguide structures can be doped with colour centres, in particular with NV centres, while this is not the case in the further microstructures or waveguide structures.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further advantages of the invention result from the description and the drawing.
