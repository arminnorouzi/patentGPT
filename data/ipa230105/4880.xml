The same attendant or attendants may be assigned responsibility for a multitude of service areas within the building or site.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the attendant has little to no knowledge of the condition of the facility, especially the fullness state of the various product dispensers, until actually entering the facility. In this regard, the attendant must be prepared for completely empty dispensers in the service areas they are responsible for. The refill supplies are generally not stocked in the service areas, and the attendant must carry sufficient refill supplies for a &#x201c;worst case scenario&#x201d;, which can be an overly burdensome task depending on the number of service areas and types of dispensers. In view of this, it has been found that significant product wastage can be attributed to certain refill practices by the attendants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a towel dispenser may be one-third full when checked by an attendant. It is a common practice, however, to attempt to overstuff the dispenser with a full refill during a scheduled maintenance visit. This overstuffed condition often results in jamming of the dispenser or overuse of towels by the service area patrons, for example when multiple towels are dispensed as a result of the overstuffed condition. If the dispenser has an overstuff-prevention device, it is also a practice to discard the remaining towels in the dispenser to that a new, full, refill can be loaded into the dispenser. Over time, such wastage can be quite expensive for the building proprietor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the attendant has been assigned responsibility for a number of service areas within a facility or site, it is the typical practice for the attendant to establish a route between the service areas for filling the dispensers regardless of the actual depletion state of the consumable product or whether it would be more efficient for a different attendant to replace the product at the same or a different time. This practice can also lead to significant wastage over time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The industry would benefit from a system and method wherein product wastage is reduced by a more efficient use of the dispenser products by patrons prior to refill by the service area attendant.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method and associated service area system are presented incorporating aspects of the invention. The term &#x201c;service area&#x201d; is used generically herein to encompass any manner of public, semi-public, or private facility visited by patrons or employees to use sink or toilet facilities, bathing facilities, changing facilities, sanitation facilities, and so forth. The term &#x201c;service area&#x201d; includes any location or type of facility where product dispensers are installed, such as break rooms, food processing sanitization stations, industrial manufacturing floors, and so forth. Particular non-limiting examples of such service areas referred to in this description for explanation purposes are washroom facilities (also known as restrooms), toilet closets, public bathrooms, men's room, ladies' room, and the like. A typical public or semi-private service area has a number of toilet facilities or urinals and sinks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although the present method and service area system are particularly useful in an &#x201c;away-from-home&#x201d; public or semi-private environment, the system is not limited by scope of use. As used herein, the term &#x201c;away-from-home&#x201d; means a place or location where people congregate for various reasons or purposes that are outside the typical home. Examples of away-from-home locations include places of business, such as office buildings, office suites, retail stores, and warehouses, manufacturing facilities; schools; hospitals and other types of medical facilities; places of worship; hotels and motels; conference centers; and the like. The method and system are particularly well-suited for structures or facilities wherein multiple service areas are provided for use of the building tenants, or an industrial or manufacturing site wherein multiple site facilities are provided for a controlled populace. All such locations, structures, and sites are referred to generically herein as a &#x201c;facility.&#x201d; It should be appreciated though that the present service area system and method may prove useful in a residential or private environment, and such uses are within the scope and spirit of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with aspects of the invention, a system and related method are provided for managing dispenser operation to cause one product dispenser to be used over another in order to optimize product usage prior to refilling the dispensers. Each of the service areas has one or more consumable product dispensers that require periodic refill, such as towel dispensers, soap dispensers, toilet tissue dispensers, and so forth. Within each service area, the product dispensers are configured with a sensor that detects a level or amount state of the product remaining in the dispenser. The sensors are in communication with a control station assigned to the service area, wherein the control station determines usage data related to the various dispensers (among other tasks). The control station may include any manner of computer hardware/software system configuration for this purpose, and may be in communication with the sensors via a wired or wireless communication network.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A plurality of the service areas may be assigned to a common control station. For example, all of the service areas within a building or site location may communicate with the same control station via a suitable wired or wireless communication network. The control station may include or be interfaced with any manner of server system for carrying out the functions described herein. The server system may be a remote system that functions with a plurality of the control stations, or may be a dedicated system for each service area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with aspects of the present method, via a sensor configured with each of the product dispensers and the control system in communication with the sensors, the level or amount condition of product in each of the dispensers is determined. Based on this information, the method includes generating and transmitting a visual or audio message to the patron that encourages the patron to use a product dispenser that has a greater fill amount as compared to another product dispenser in the service area that dispenses the same product. In this manner, the patrons are influenced to use the dispensers having the most product at the particular time they are in the service area, with the intent being to deplete the dispensers as much as possible with the method before the attendant refills the dispensers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The product dispensers may be any one or combination of towel dispenser, soap dispenser, or toilet tissue dispenser. For example, the service area may be a washroom that includes multiple stalls with a respective toilet tissue dispenser. The method can use any manner of audio or visual message to cause use of the stall having the fullest toilet tissue dispenser. Similarly, the method can cause use of a particular sink having the fuller soap dispenser as compared to another sink, or to use a towel dispenser having more towel material as compared to another towel dispenser in the service area.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the first and second product dispensers are in the same service area within the facility and are of the same type (e.g., both may be hand towel dispensers), and the message is transmitted to the patron via a device inside of the service area, for example via one or more audio/video (A/V) device in the service area, such as video boards or displays, speakers, and so forth. The service area may be equipped with a sensor to detect the presence of the patron within the service area prior to transmitting the message. For example, in one embodiment, sensors may be located within the service area to detect the presence of the patron adjacent to the first and second product dispensers (e.g., adjacent to the sinks where the soap dispensers and towel dispensers are located), wherein the message encourages the patron to use one of the product dispensers over the other.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other embodiments, the message is transmitted to the patron via an audio/video devise located outside of the service area, for example via a video screen or display adjacent the door of the service area. The message may encourage the patron to use certain facilities within the service area prior to the patron entering the service area. In an alternative embodiment, the message may encourage the patron to visit a different service area, for example when the towel dispensers in one service area are nearly depleted, but the towel dispensers in a different service area are nearly full. Thus, in this embodiment, the first and second product dispensers are actually in different service areas.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a particularly unique embodiment, the message intended to influence the patron's selection of dispenser is a visual configuration of the dispenser that can be altered or modified based on a fullness state of the dispenser. For example, in a certain embodiment, the first and second product dispensers are electronic towel dispensers within the same service area, wherein the dispensers are configured to switch operation between (1) a hanging-towel mode wherein a portion of a towel (a &#x201c;tail&#x201d;) hangs from the towel dispenser and is visible to the patron, and a subsequent towel portion is automatically dispensed and hangs from the towel dispenser upon removal of the hanging towel by the patron, and (2) a hidden towel mode wherein a towel to be dispensed is contained completely within the towel dispenser and is not dispensed until the patron is detected adjacent to the dispenser. Both of these modes of operation are well-known in the industry. The method includes monitoring the fill level of towel material in both of the first and second towel dispensers while operating both dispensers in the hidden towel mode. Upon one of the first or second towel dispensers reaching a setpoint low fill level, the other respective towel dispenser is remotely switched to operate in the hanging towel mode. Thus, the patron is presented with one towel dispenser having a visible towel tail, and another dispenser with no visible towel material. The visual tail of the towel dispenser operating in the hanging towel mode is intended to influence the patron to retrieve a towel from that particular dispenser, as compared to the other towel dispenser operating in hidden towel mode.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method may further include switching the towel dispenser operating in hanging towel mode back to hidden towel mode upon reaching the setpoint low fill level in the towel dispenser operating in hanging towel mode. Alternatively, the method may include switching the towel dispenser operating in hidden towel mode to hanging towel mode upon reaching the setpoint low fill level in the towel dispenser operating in hanging towel mode.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram view of a service area facility incorporating a system and method in accordance with aspects of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a component diagram view of certain control features of a system and method in accordance with the invention; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side diagram view of an embodiment of a towel dispenser operable in a hanging towel mode and a hidden towel mode that may be used to practice aspects of the present method.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference will now be made in detail to one or more embodiments of the invention, examples of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the drawings.

Various types of product dispensers configured with sensors are well known in to those skilled in the art and a detailed explanation thereof is not necessary for purposes of the present disclosure. Examples of such dispensers include mechanical arm sensors (e.g., a mechanical arm/potentiometer that rests on a product roll and detects a change in roll diameter as the product is depleted), non-contact electrical sensors (e.g., IR sensors, capacitive sensors), optical sensors (camera-based sensor), weight sensors, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sensors <b>25</b> associated with the various product dispensers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are in communication with a control station <b>45</b> via any manner of suitable wireless communication system (as indicated by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or wired network. The information signal from the sensors includes an identification tag (or other identification means) that identifies the particular dispenser <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to the control station.

The left hand soap dispenser <b>24</b> has been determined by the control station <b>45</b> to have more soap than the right hand soap dispenser. A message <b>32</b> is generated by the control station <b>45</b> (which includes retrieval of a stored message <b>32</b>) and sent to the speaker <b>60</b> located between the soap dispensers <b>24</b>. The message is broadcast in the service area <b>12</b> and the requests the patron <b>30</b> to use the sink on the left, and thereby the left hand soap dispenser <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, the message <b>32</b> is not generated or transmitted until one of the soap dispensers is depleted to a predefined low level setpoint, for example 10% remaining soap.

For example, detectors <b>38</b> are located near the sinks <b>20</b> to detect when the patron <b>30</b> approaches the sinks. Once the patron is detected at the sinks <b>20</b>, a message <b>32</b> can be generated that encourages the patron <b>30</b> to use a particular one of the sinks. Likewise, a detector <b>38</b> is located near the stalls <b>18</b>. Once the patron <b>30</b> is detected approaching the stalls, a message <b>32</b> may be transmitted urging the patron <b>30</b> to use the stall having the fuller toilet tissue dispenser <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present system and method include embodiments wherein the message <b>32</b> encourages the patron <b>30</b> to visit a different service area <b>12</b>, for example when the towel dispensers <b>26</b> in one service area are nearly depleted, but the towel dispensers <b>26</b> in a different service area <b>12</b> within the facility are nearly full. Thus, in this embodiment, the first and second product dispensers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are actually in different service areas <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an A/V device <b>58</b> located outside of the service area <b>12</b> for this purpose.

For example, the first and second product dispensers may be electronic towel dispensers <b>26</b> within the same service area <b>12</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each of the towel dispensers <b>26</b> are configured to switch operation between (1) a hanging-towel (&#x201c;tail&#x201d;) mode wherein a portion of a towel hangs from the towel dispenser <b>26</b> and is visible to the patron <b>30</b>, and a subsequent tail is automatically dispensed and hangs from the towel dispenser <b>26</b> upon removal of the hanging towel by the patron, and (2) a hidden towel mode wherein a towel to be dispensed is contained completely within the towel dispenser <b>26</b> and is not dispensed until the patron <b>30</b> is detected adjacent to the dispenser. Both of these modes of operation are well-known in the industry. The method includes monitoring the fill level of towel material in both of the first and second towel dispensers <b>26</b> while operating both dispensers <b>26</b> in the same mode. Upon one of the towel dispensers <b>26</b> reaching a setpoint low fill level (e.g., 15% percent towel material remaining), operation of the dispensers is changed as necessary so that the dispenser <b>26</b> at the low level setpoint operates in the hidden-towel mode and the dispenser <b>26</b> with more towel material is operated in the hanging towel mode. Thus, the patron is presented with one towel dispenser <b>26</b> having a visible towel tail, and another dispenser <b>26</b> with no visible towel material.

The dispenser <b>126</b> includes a housing <b>118</b> of any general shape and configuration having a bottom portion <b>120</b>, a front portion <b>124</b>, and a back portion <b>122</b>. The dispenser <b>126</b> may be mounted to a vertical supporting wall structure by any conventional means. A dispensing slot <b>123</b> is defined at an appropriate location in the housing <b>118</b>, for example in the middle of the bottom portion <b>120</b>. It should be understood that the dispensing slot <b>123</b> may be disposed at various locations in the housing depending on the conveying path of the towel material <b>116</b> and configuration of the internal components of the dispenser <b>126</b>. The dispensing slot <b>123</b> is disposed so that a patron can see a tail <b>114</b> of the towel material extending therefrom and has easy access to grasp and pull the tail <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The roll <b>112</b> is rotatably disposed in the housing <b>118</b> by any manner of suitable carrier, such as the side arms <b>128</b> disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Various configurations of carrier mechanisms are known in the art for rotatably supporting a roll <b>112</b> of material in a dispenser.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The dispenser <b>126</b> incorporates an electromechanical feed mechanism, generally <b>130</b>. The towel material <b>116</b> passes through the feed mechanism <b>130</b> in its running path through the dispenser housing <b>118</b>. The feed mechanism <b>130</b> operates in the first mechanical mode of operation wherein measured sheets of the towel material <b>116</b> are dispensed by the patron simply grasping and pulling on the tail <b>114</b> extending from the dispensing slot <b>123</b>. After the hanging sheet of material <b>116</b> has been severed, the feed mechanism <b>30</b> is triggered to automatically drive the feed mechanism <b>130</b> with an electrically powered motor <b>32</b> to dispense a subsequent measured length of the towel material tail <b>114</b> out of the dispensing slot <b>123</b>. A control circuit <b>134</b> is configured with the motor <b>132</b> and feed mechanism <b>130</b> to automatically trigger the feed mechanism <b>130</b> at the correct time in the dispensing sequence described above. The controller <b>134</b> is in wired or wireless communication with the control system <b>45</b>, as discussed above and depicted by the dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Various sensors are known in the art for detecting the usage of the towel material <b>116</b>, for example by monitoring the size of the roll <b>112</b> as the roll <b>112</b> is depleted. U.S. Pat.

The feed roller <b>136</b> is drivingly engaged by the motor <b>132</b> via a friction roller <b>146</b> that engages the surface of the feed roller <b>136</b> such that rotation of the friction roll <b>46</b> causes corresponding rotation of the feed roller <b>136</b>. It should be appreciated that any mechanical coupling between the drive motor <b>132</b> and the feed roller <b>136</b> may be used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A pressure roller <b>144</b> is disposed in opposition to the feed roller <b>136</b> and defines a nip with the feed roller <b>36</b> through which the towel material <b>16</b> passes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The feed roller <b>136</b> is &#x201c;freely&#x201d; rotatable to the extent that it does not impede a user from manually pulling a measured sheet of the towel material <b>116</b> from the dispenser. For example, the feed roller <b>36</b> remains in contact with the friction roll <b>146</b> while a user pulls the towel material <b>116</b> between the feed roller <b>136</b> and pressure roller <b>144</b>. The friction roll <b>146</b> and the shaft of the motor <b>132</b> will thus also rotate but do not exert enough resistance to prevent the feed roller <b>136</b> from freely rotating as the user pulls the tail <b>114</b>. In an embodiment wherein a clutch is disposed between the motor <b>132</b> and feed roller <b>136</b>, the clutch would be disengaged after the tail <b>114</b> has been feed out of the slot <b>123</b> and, thus, the feed roller <b>136</b> would actually free-wheel when the user pulls on the tail <b>114</b>. In an embodiment wherein the motor <b>132</b> is directly geared to the feed roller <b>136</b>, the gearing and motor <b>132</b> would offer some resistance, but would not impede the ability of the user to pull the tail <b>114</b> of material in order to dispense a measured sheet of the material <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the user has pulled a measured length of the towel material <b>116</b> from the dispenser <b>126</b>, the material <b>116</b> is clamped by the feed mechanism <b>130</b> in order to allow the user to subsequently tear or sever the material <b>116</b> by pulling the material against a tear blade or bar <b>158</b> mounted proximate to the dispensing slot <b>123</b>. The clamping feature may be carried out by various devices. In the illustrated embodiment wherein the feed mechanism <b>130</b> includes a feed roller <b>136</b> and pressure roller <b>144</b>, the feed roller <b>136</b> is stopped by a brake mechanism once the correct measured amount of towel material <b>116</b> has passed between the rollers. Various mechanical, electrical, or electromechanical brake devices can be utilized in this regard. A relatively simple brake is illustrated as a solenoid <b>150</b> that actuates a plunger, wherein the plunger then extends into one of a series of holes or recesses <b>140</b> defined in an end face <b>138</b> of the feed roller <b>136</b>. The trigger signal is sent to the solenoid <b>50</b> upon the correct measured length of towel material <b>116</b> passing between the feed roller <b>136</b> and pressure roller <b>144</b>. To release the brake, a release signal is sent to the solenoid <b>150</b> causing the plunger to retract and thus release the feed roller <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A brake trigger device <b>154</b> may be provided to trigger and engage the brake once the correct length of towel material <b>116</b> has passed between the rollers. In the illustrated embodiment, the trigger device <b>154</b> includes a revolution counter, such as a typical tacho-generator, that is configured with the feed roller <b>136</b> to measure the length of towel material <b>16</b> passing between the feed roller <b>136</b> and pressure roller <b>144</b> by counting the revolutions of the feed roller <b>136</b> or pressure roller <b>144</b>. For example, the feed roller <b>136</b> includes a vane <b>142</b> configured at the end face <b>138</b> thereof. Revolutions of the vane <b>142</b> are detected and counted by the device <b>154</b>, and a corresponding signal is forwarded to the control circuit <b>34</b>. It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;control circuit&#x201d; is used herein to broadly define any combination of relays, switches, power sources, counters, sensors, and the like that route the various signals and actuate the various components of the dispenser <b>126</b> as described herein. Once the revolution counter indicates that the required measured length of towel material <b>116</b> has passed the feed roller <b>136</b>, the control circuit <b>134</b> triggers the brake to stop rotation of the feed roller <b>136</b>. As explained, the signal is simply sent to the solenoid <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an alternative embodiment, a mechanical braking and measuring system may be utilized. One such system widely known and used in the art is a gear system wherein the length of the sheet is determined by the arc of a curved rack that is geared to a metering roll. Such a system is used, for example in the LEV-R-MATIC&#xae; roll towel dispenser from Kimberly-Clark Corporation. This system utilizes a metering roll with a fixed ring gear on an end thereof that is geared to a curved rack gear by way of a floating pinion gear. The ring gear could be provided on the feed roll or pressure roll in the present dispenser. As the towel material is dispensed, the metering roll rotates and drives the curved rack gear by way of the pinion gear. The length of the sheet is determined by the degree of travel of the curved rack gear. At the stop position of the curved rack gear, the feed roll would be locked and the sheet material clamped thereby. The pinion gear is housed in an angled track and moves within the track to disengage from the ring gear and curved rack gear at the stop position of the rack gear, at which point the rack gear falls back to its start position. This type of system is well known by those skilled in the art and need not be described in great detail herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the tear blade or bar <b>158</b> is disposed within the housing <b>118</b> proximate to the dispensing slot <b>123</b> so that, once the towel material <b>116</b> is clamped, the user can sever the measured length of towel material into a sheet by pulling the towel forward against the tear bar <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the sheet has been severed by the user (as sensed by the tear bar <b>158</b>), the feed mechanism <b>130</b> automatically electrically dispense a measured length of the towel material <b>116</b> out of the dispensing slot <b>123</b> to define the tail <b>114</b> for the next subsequent user. To accomplish this, a motor trigger device is used to activate the motor once the sheet has been severed. Various devices may be used to sense that the sheet has been torn by the user. In the illustrated embodiment, the tear blade <b>158</b> &#x201c;floats&#x201d; on a carrier <b>160</b> to a certain degree so that the blade <b>158</b> is caused to move or deflect upon the user pulling the towel material <b>116</b> against the blade <b>158</b>. A sensor <b>168</b> detects motion or deflection of the tear bar <b>158</b> and sends a corresponding signal to the control circuit <b>134</b>. The sensor <b>168</b> may be a relatively simple contact arrangement between a stationary contact and the end of the tear blade <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment not illustrated in the figures, the tear bar or blade <b>158</b> may be a cam actuated device that is recessed with in a slot defined in the feed roller <b>136</b>. As the feed roller <b>136</b> rotates, cam followers move along cam surfaces and cause the blade <b>158</b> to pivot out of the slot in the feed roller to at least partially sever the towel material <b>116</b>. For example, the towel material <b>116</b> may be severed up to about 95%. The user then simply gently pulls on the end of the sheet dispensed out of the slot <b>123</b> to completely separate the sheet. A mechanical or proximity sensor may be disposed to detect the pivoting action of the blade <b>158</b> and send a corresponding signal to the control circuit <b>134</b>. This type of cam actuated cutter blade configuration is also known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A power supply <b>172</b> is contained within the housing <b>118</b> to power the various electronic components and control circuit <b>134</b>. The power source <b>172</b> may include a battery compartment for disposable DC batteries. Alternately, the dispenser <b>126</b> may be supplied with AC power and include and internal AC to DC adapter. This embodiment may be useful when the dispenser <b>126</b> can be mounted in close proximity to an AC outlet.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Switching of the operation mode of the dispenser <b>126</b> from the hanging tail mode described above to the hidden towel mode is controlled by the controller <b>134</b> in response to a signal transmitted to the controller <b>134</b> from the control system <b>45</b>, as described above. In hidden towel mode, a forward-facing proximity detector <b>125</b>, such as an infra-red (IR) detector, mounted on the dispenser <b>118</b> is powered on. The use of such sensors <b>125</b> to detect the presence of a user in close proximity to the dispenser and to initiate an automatic dispense cycle where a measured length of the towel material <b>116</b> is dispensed from the slot <b>123</b> is well-known in the art. In this mode, upon detection of, for example, the users hands, by the proximity detector <b>125</b>, the control circuit <b>134</b> energizes the feed mechanism <b>130</b> to dispense a measured sheet of the material. In one embodiment, this sheet may be the same length as the tail <b>114</b> discussed above, wherein the user grasps and pulls the tail as discussed above. In an alternate embodiment, a longer, complete sheet of the material <b>116</b> is feed out of the slot <b>123</b>, wherein the user simply pulls the sheet against the tear bar <b>158</b>, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">An additional proximity detector <b>127</b> is located adjacent and rearward of the dispensing slot <b>123</b> and is also powered on in the hidden sheet mode. This detector <b>127</b>, which is also in communication with the control circuit <b>134</b>, serves to detect whether the dispensed sheet has been removed. If the detector <b>127</b> detects that the sheet has not been removed by the user, the control circuit prevents a subsequent dispense cycle until the sheet has been removed. This feature prevents multiple dispense cycles by, for example, a user repeatedly waving their hands in front of the detector <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the hidden towel mode, once the detector <b>127</b> detects that the sheet has been removed, the control circuit <b>134</b> resets for a subsequent dispense cycle.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should also be appreciated that a dispenser <b>126</b> for use in the present method and system according to the invention may incorporate any combination of additional features found in conventional &#x201c;hands-free&#x201d; dispensers. For example, the dispenser may include an emergency manual feed device such as a manual hand wheel or knob. The dispenser may be configured to dispense a stub roll in addition to a primary roll. Any combination of such additional features is within the scope and spirit of the invention.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments it is to be understood that the subject matter encompassed by way of the present invention is not to be limited to those specific embodiments.
