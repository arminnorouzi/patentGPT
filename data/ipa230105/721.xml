Essentially, an aseptic process typically renders such item sterile, and fills and seals the same into a sterile container.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the past, bags formed of polymeric material have been aseptically filled using the combination of a gland welded to the face of the bag and a pair of membranes. Such a bag creation requires special equipment that is not compatible with current fill equipment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, a sealed tube has been used attached to a bag followed by the manual cutting of the tube and attaching the same to the supply of sterile solution. A heated cutter blade is employed in this technique. Essentially, this latter method is labor intensive, as bags are individually filled by hand. Also, the aseptic liquid contained in the bag is not accurately ascertained since measurement of the same is derived on a weigh scale. Needless to say, the fill rates using this method are extremely slow.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 3,101,752 in which an aseptic filling machine is revealed. Current filling machines are similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,101,752, but have not been adequately been adapted to filling sterilized bags containing aseptic liquids.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other prior sterilization and sampling apparatuses have been devised. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,411 discloses a catheter assembly where one end of a sheath is secured to a hub as a sealed fit to allow a hollow needle to gain access to liquid flow.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,188 utilizes an injection needle to provide fluid communication through a close injection site to transport fluid into a tube.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 4,386,933 shows a sterile entry system for use in transferring blood that includes a sleeve which jackets the exterior of a transfer tube. The tube has seals which are adapted to be pierced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 8,777,921 describes a sterile sampling apparatus and method where a closed sterile sight chamber is connected to a pouch to allow fluid to flow into such chamber and, at the same time, permits air to enter the chamber. The pouch is severed after sampling takes place.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. RE317696 shows a multiple access fluid connector in which a plurality of access ports are provided to transport fluid through a multipart manifold element. The manifold is formed by mating of elements having matchable ports. Selected ports are severable, as desired.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need for simplifying the aseptic filling of bags with liquids utilizing precision filling devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with the present application, a novel and useful aseptic filling apparatus and method of carrying out such filling is herein provided.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The filling apparatus involves the transporting of an aseptic liquid from a source such as an aseptic filling machine to a container such as a polymeric bag. The filling apparatus includes as one of its elements and adaptor that is formed with a first end portion, a second end portion, and an intermediate portion. The adaptor includes a passageway with an exit at the first end portion and an entrance at the second end portion. The adaptor intermediate portion is constructed of severable and sealable material. The adaptor is further configured to receive an aseptic liquid from a source through the entrance to the passageway. A membrane is fixed to the second end portion of the adaptor and is capable of being unsealed to accept aseptic liquid from the source.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, a tube is employed with the adaptor and includes an opening or aperture that communicates with the passageway of the adaptor at the entrance to the same. The tube is attached using a connector, which may take the form of a cinching band or tie wrap. A container, such as a bag formed of a polymeric material, includes a chamber that is attached to the tube such that the tube opening communicates with the chamber of the container. The tube is connected to the container in a permanent manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first end portion of the adaptor may include at least one flange and is employed to connect the adaptor to the source of aseptic liquid. Likewise, the severable and sealable intermediate portion of the adaptor includes material that is sealable under the influence of heat. Moreover, the first end portion of the adaptor possesses a barbed end compatible with the tube connection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, a method of transporting an aseptic liquid from a source is herein provided. The method includes the step of using an adaptor having a first end portion, a second end portion, and an intermediate portion with a passageway through the same. Again, the passageway incudes an exit at the first end portion and an entrance at the second end portion of the adaptor. Further, the adaptor intermediate portion is constructed of severable and sealable material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method includes a further step of removably fixing a membrane to the second end portion of the adaptor and providing and connecting or attaching the tube to a container to permit communication of an opening through the tube to a container having a chamber.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the first end portion of the adaptor is connected to the tube, while the second end portion of the adaptor is attached to the source of the aseptic liquid.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, a further step is employed in which the membrane attached to the second end portion of the adaptor is unsealed and may be cut or pierced in such a step. Once the membrane is sealed, aseptic liquid is passed from the source to the adaptor passageway, to the tube opening, and to the container. Finally, the intermediate portion of the adaptor is severed and heat sealed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additional steps may take place in the sterilization of the adaptor, tube, and container by the use of irradiation and the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It may be apparent that a novel and useful apparatus and method of providing a filling apparatus for the transporting of aseptic liquid from a source and a method to carry out the same has been hereinabove described.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is therefore an object of the present apparatus to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source which utilizes a novel adaptor which may be employed with precision automatic filling machines.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source and a method for carrying out the same which provides aseptically filled containers at a very high rate of speed and accurately measures the quantity of aseptic liquid within the container.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source and method to carry out the same in which a single pierceable membrane is used, thus simplifying aseptic filling technology.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source and a method for carrying out the same which eliminates hand filling of aseptic containers in a slow and tedious manner.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source and a method for carrying out the same which employs known automatic filling machines as a source of the aseptic liquid and known cutting apparatuses for severing and sealing components of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source and a method for carrying out the same which is relatively simple and economical in comparison to the prior art devices and methods.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Yet another object of the present application is to provide a filling apparatus for transporting an aseptic liquid from a source that is economical and does not require the investment in expensive manufacturing equipment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The application possesses other objects and advantages especially as concerns particular characteristics and features thereof, which will become apparent as the specification continues.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Various aspects of the application will evolve from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof which should be taken in conjunction with the prior described drawings.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The apparatus as a whole is depicted in the drawings by reference character <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it may be observed that an adaptor <b>12</b> is employed. Adaptor <b>12</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and is formed of severable and heat sealable material such as polyethylene. Adaptor <b>12</b> is constructed with a first end portion <b>14</b>, a second end portion <b>16</b>, and an intermediate portion <b>18</b>. Further, adaptor <b>12</b> includes a passageway <b>20</b> through the same. Passageway <b>20</b> includes an entrance <b>22</b> and an exit <b>24</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In essence, aseptic liquid is intended to flow through passageway <b>20</b> through entrance <b>22</b> and out through exit <b>24</b>, which will be discussed in further detail as the specification continues.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Again, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it may be observed that a tube <b>26</b> is employed in the present apparatus <b>10</b>. Tube <b>26</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, includes an opening or aperture <b>28</b>. A connector <b>30</b>, such as a tie wrap, attaches tube <b>26</b> to first end portion <b>14</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> such that opening <b>28</b> of tube <b>26</b> communicates with passageway <b>20</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>. Such communication takes place at exit <b>24</b> therefrom. Tube <b>26</b> leads to a container <b>32</b> depicted as a polymeric bag. It also should be noted that container <b>32</b> is presented in miniature fashion for the sake of clarity in the drawings. However, bag <b>32</b> may be notably larger than that depicted in the drawings. Container <b>32</b> includes a chamber <b>34</b>. Tube <b>26</b> is permanently attached to container <b>32</b> at attachment place <b>36</b>, allowing aperture <b>28</b> to communicate with chamber <b>34</b>. A membrane <b>36</b> is attached to adaptor <b>12</b> at second end portion <b>16</b> by any suitable means such as gluing, welding, and the like. Membrane <b>36</b> may be cut or pierced at a later time, as will be described hereinafter. It should also be noted that adaptor <b>12</b> includes flanges <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> at second end portion <b>16</b> to permit attachment of the same to a known filling apparatus which serves as the source of aseptic liquid. In addition, first end portion <b>14</b> is manufactured with a barbed end configuration <b>42</b> which is compatible with tube <b>26</b> and connector <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the adaptor <b>12</b>, tube <b>26</b>, and container <b>32</b> are initially formed into a unit <b>44</b> that is sterilized by any suitable means. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> indicates an irradiation method of sterilization shown by plurality of jagged-lined arrows <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once sterilized, unit <b>44</b> may be employed to carry aseptic liquid from a source <b>46</b>, dashed lines on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, of conventional configuration. For example, source <b>46</b> may take the form of a modified filling machine known as the ENGI-O A3.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the employment of unit <b>44</b> and the method of aseptic filling of the present application is shown. Directional arrow <b>48</b> represents the piercing or unsealing of membrane <b>38</b> by filling machine <b>46</b>, a known process associated with filling machine <b>46</b>. Directional arrow <b>50</b> shows the passage of aseptic liquid from automatic filling machine <b>46</b> into entrance <b>16</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>. Directional arrow <b>52</b> traces the passage of aseptic liquid through tube <b>26</b> via aperture <b>28</b> and into container <b>34</b> (not shown).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once container <b>32</b> is filled with aseptic liquid <b>54</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, adaptor <b>12</b> is severed and sealed at intermediate portion <b>18</b>, directional arrows <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Such process is achieved by the use of an impulse sealer, known in the art. It also should be noted that bag <b>32</b> filled with aseptic liquid <b>54</b> is measured using an accurate flow meter in conjunction with filling machine <b>46</b>. The severing and sealing of intermediate portion <b>18</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> leaves a narrowed terminus <b>60</b> of the now shortened adaptor <b>12</b>. The severed part <b>62</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is the discarded as indicated by arrow <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Viewing now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it may be apparent that an aseptically filled and sealed unit <b>66</b> has been created utilizing the severed and sealed portion <b>68</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>, tube <b>26</b>, and connected container <b>32</b> filled with aseptic liquid <b>54</b>. Unit <b>66</b> is then passed to a user. A user would then cut or open tube <b>26</b> indicated by directional arrows <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> and discard portion <b>74</b> which includes part <b>68</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> and a portion <b>76</b> of tube <b>26</b>. Aseptic liquid <b>54</b> within chamber <b>43</b> of container <b>34</b> may then be employed by the user.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In operation, the apparatus <b>10</b> of the present application is assembled utilizing adaptor <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is attached to a tube <b>26</b> via a connector <b>30</b>. Tube <b>26</b> is, in turn, fixed permanently to a polymeric bag <b>32</b> to form a unit <b>44</b>. Unit <b>44</b> is then sterilized using known methods such as irradiation. Following sterilization of unit <b>44</b>, membrane <b>38</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> is unsealed or pierced, allowing aseptic liquid to flow from a prior art conventional filling machine <b>46</b>, through passageway <b>30</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>, passageway <b>28</b> of tube <b>26</b>, and into chamber <b>34</b> of container <b>32</b>. It should be noted that filling machine <b>46</b> is also capable of such piercing or unsealing membrane <b>38</b> at second end portion <b>16</b> of adaptor <b>12</b>, in this regard. Once aseptic liquid <b>54</b> flows to container <b>32</b>, adaptor <b>12</b> is severed and sealed at intermediate portion <b>18</b>, according to directional indicator arrows <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>. A narrow terminus <b>60</b> is formed on remaining part <b>68</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> and serves as part of a unit <b>66</b> which is then transported to a user. The severed part <b>62</b> of adaptor <b>12</b> is discarded. Once the user receives unit <b>66</b>, tube <b>26</b> is cut allowing aseptic liquid <b>54</b> to flow from chamber <b>34</b> of container <b>32</b> for use.
