In this case, on the basis of the interaction between the two types of light, it is possible to obtain various types of optical information on positions of photons and how the reflection is performed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To obtain cardiovascular OCT images, a catheter is positioned in a cardiac blood vessel (with a diameter of 3 to 5 mm) to be evaluated through a femoral artery and an aorta and then captures images of the cardiac blood vessel while being rotated at 100 revolutions per second and pulled back at a speed of 20 mm/s (i.e., 100 frames of the cross-sectional images of the blood vessel are played at an interval of 0.2 mm/s).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this case, a rotary junction needs to be implemented to rotate and pull the catheter, and an optical rotational device needs to be implemented to connect the catheter and an OCT system and rotate the catheter. It is necessary to minimize an optical coupling loss during a process of aligning a rotating optical system and an adjusted optical system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the rotary junction in the related art is configured by a rotary joint, a shaft coupler, a hollow motor, a shaft coupler, and an adapter component and implemented by being inserted into a module mount with longitudinal axis tolerance minimized by lathe machining.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is a problem in that noise occurs during a high-speed rotation when a coupler, which is a connection part between a fiber optic rotary joint and a shaft, is coupled. Further, there is also a problem in that a commercially available joint is not suitable for a high-speed rotation because of limited performance of the joint, and a corresponding part of the joint is broken down because of abrasion or the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the above-mentioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an optical rotary junction module for an OCT system, in which a coupler for inhibiting tolerance between inner components of a rotary junction module between an OCT system and an imaging catheter is removed, and a joint end capable of performing optical coupling in a free space is implemented, such that tolerance caused by the assembling of the respective components of the rotary junction module may be reduced, and torque of a hollow motor may be transmitted to the imaging catheter without a loss.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the above-mentioned object, an optical rotary junction module for an OCT system according to the present invention includes: an OCT connection part having a screw thread formed on an outer peripheral surface thereof, the OCT connection part being connected to an OCT system configured to produce light;
