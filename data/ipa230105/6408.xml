A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). A lithographic apparatus may, for example, project a pattern of a patterning device (e.g., a mask, a reticle) onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (photoresist or, simply, &#x201c;resist&#x201d;) provided on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To project a pattern on a substrate a lithographic apparatus may use electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of this radiation determines the minimum size of features which can be formed on the substrate. A lithographic apparatus, which uses deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation, having a wavelength within the range 20-400 nm, for example 193 nm or 248 nm, may be used to form features on a substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) or a master oscillator power ring amplifier (MOPRA) is a two-stage optical resonator arrangement that produces a highly coherent amplified light beam. The performance of the MOPA or the MOPRA can depend critically on the master oscillator (MO), the power amplifier (PA), and/or the power ring amplifier (PRA). Electrodes of the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA surrounding a gas discharge medium can degrade over time and produce metal fluoride dust. The metal fluoride dust can settle on optical windows of the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA and can lead to optical damage. Light beam fluences are higher in the PA or the PRA rather than the MO and, thus, metal fluoride dust can lead to earlier optical damage to the PA or the PRA over time. Further, circulation of metal fluoride dust in the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA can also lead to reduced discharge voltage from the electrodes and poor laser performance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need to reduce metal fluoride dusting on optical windows, improve control of flow distribution through a window housing apparatus, provide an efficient purge without increasing clean gas backflow rates from a metal fluoride trap, and increase the service lifetimes of both the metal fluoride trap and the master oscillator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a light source apparatus includes a chamber, a metal fluoride trap, and a set of window housing apparatuses. The chamber is configured to hold a gas discharge medium, the gas discharge medium outputting a light beam. The metal fluoride trap is coupled to the chamber and is configured to trap metal fluoride dust generated from the chamber and provide clean gas, i.e. gas largely free of fluoride dust, along an output port. The set of window housing apparatuses is coupled to the chamber and is configured to reduce metal fluoride dusting on optical windows. Each window housing apparatus includes a window housing, an aperture apparatus, and an insert. The window housing supports an optical window. The aperture apparatus is coupled to the window housing and includes a plurality of cells configured to trap metal fluoride dust flowing upstream from the chamber through the aperture apparatus toward the optical window. The insert is disposed between the aperture apparatus and the optical window. The insert is configured to control a first flow rate of the clean gas along the optical window and a second flow rate of the clean gas through the aperture apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the insert is configured such that the first flow rate along the optical window is greater than or equal to the second flow rate through the aperture apparatus. In some embodiments, the insert includes a channel configured to decrease the first flow rate along the optical window and increase the second flow rate through the aperture apparatus. In some embodiments, a cross-sectional area of the channel is proportional to the first flow rate decrease and the second flow rate increase.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the window housing apparatus further includes a plug with a bore disposed between an input port of the window housing and the output port of the metal fluoride trap. In some embodiments, the plug and output port are disposed in a frame of the chamber. In some embodiments, the bore includes a diameter configured to control a flow rate of the clean gas into the window housing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, a plurality of tangs are disposed on an exterior surface of the aperture apparatus and are configured to direct the clean gas to flow around the aperture apparatus toward the insert. In some embodiments, the plurality of tangs have an outer diameter greater than the exterior surface of the aperture apparatus to provide a gap for the clean gas to flow through.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the window housing includes a channel configured to flush the clean gas along the optical window. In some embodiments, the window housing includes a Fresnel beam capture pocket configured to capture and absorb Fresnel reflections from the optical window to achieve a desired reflection-transmission ratio for the optical window.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the gas discharge medium includes an excimer and/or an exciplex. In some embodiments, the gas discharge medium includes F2, ArF, KrF, and/or XeF.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the light source apparatus further includes a set of optical elements configured to form an optical resonator around the chamber.

The insert is disposed between the aperture apparatus and the optical window. The insert is configured to control a first flow rate of clean gas along the optical window and a second flow rate of the clean gas through the aperture apparatus.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the window housing includes a bore therein configured to receive the aperture apparatus and the insert. In some embodiments, the bore includes an undercut and/or a recess configured to increase a volume of the clean gas in the window housing apparatus. In some embodiments, the window housing includes a channel configured to direct the clean gas to flow along the optical window prior to flowing through aperture apparatus.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, a plurality of tangs are disposed along an exterior surface of the aperture apparatus and are configured to direct the clean gas to flow around the aperture apparatus toward the insert. In some embodiments, the plurality of tangs are symmetrically arranged. In some embodiments, the plurality of tangs of the aperture apparatus mechanically mate with a plurality of recesses in the insert.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the aperture apparatus includes a plurality of cells each configured to trap metal fluoride dust flowing upstream from the chamber through the aperture apparatus toward the optical window. In some embodiments, the aperture apparatus includes at least five cells having a decreasing diameter from a front end to a back end toward the chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the window housing apparatus is configured such that the first flow rate along the optical window is greater than or equal to the second flow rate through the aperture apparatus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the insert includes a channel configured to decrease the first flow rate along the optical window and increase the second flow rate through the aperture apparatus. In some embodiments, a cross-sectional area of the channel is proportional to the first flow rate decrease and the second flow rate increase.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, a method of reducing metal fluoride dusting on an optical window in a window housing apparatus includes directing clean gas to flow from a metal fluoride trap through an input port of the window housing apparatus. In some embodiments, the method further includes directing the clean gas to flow around an aperture apparatus disposed in a window housing of the window housing apparatus and toward an insert disposed between the aperture apparatus and the optical window. In some embodiments, the method further includes directing the clean gas to flow through a channel in the window housing and along an interior surface of the optical window.

Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; each include the following: an illumination system (illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (for example, deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation); a support structure (for example, a mask table) MT configured to support a patterning device (for example, a mask, a reticle, or a dynamic patterning device) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device MA; and, a substrate table (for example, a wafer table) WT configured to hold a substrate (for example, a photoresist coated wafer) W and connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate W. Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; also have a projection system PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion (for example, comprising one or more dies) C of the substrate W. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are reflective. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032;, the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are transmissive.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The illumination system IL may include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic, or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling the radiation beam B.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The support structure MT holds the patterning device MA in a manner that depends on the orientation of the patterning device MA with respect to a reference frame, the design of at least one of the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and other conditions, such as whether or not the patterning device MA is held in a vacuum environment. The support structure MT may use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic, or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device MA. The support structure MT can be a frame or a table, for example, which can be fixed or movable, as required. By using sensors, the support structure MT can ensure that the patterning device MA is at a desired position, for example, with respect to the projection system PS.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; MA should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that can be used to impart a radiation beam B with a pattern in its cross-section, such as to create a pattern in the target portion C of the substrate W. The pattern imparted to the radiation beam B can correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion C to form an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The patterning device MA may be transmissive (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) or reflective (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Examples of patterning devices MA include reticles, masks, programmable mirror arrays, or programmable LCD panels. Masks are well known in lithography, and include mask types such as binary, alternating phase shift, or attenuated phase shift, as well as various hybrid mask types. An example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of small mirrors, each of which can be individually tilted so as to reflect an incoming radiation beam in different directions. The tilted mirrors impart a pattern in the radiation beam B which is reflected by a matrix of small mirrors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; PS can encompass any type of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, or for other factors, such as the use of an immersion liquid on the substrate W or the use of a vacuum. A vacuum environment can be used for DUV or electron beam radiation since other gases can absorb too much radiation or electrons. A vacuum environment can therefore be provided to the whole beam path with the aid of a vacuum wall and vacuum pumps.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and/or lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be of a type having two (dual stage) or more substrate tables WT (and/or two or more mask tables). In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machines, the additional substrate tables WT can be used in parallel, or preparatory steps can be carried out on one or more tables while one or more other substrate tables WT are being used for exposure. In some situations, the additional table may not be a substrate table WT.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The lithographic apparatus may also be of a type wherein at least a portion of the substrate may be covered by a liquid having a relatively high refractive index, e.g., water, so as to fill a space between the projection system and the substrate. An immersion liquid may also be applied to other spaces in the lithographic apparatus, for example, between the mask and the projection system Immersion techniques are well known in the art for increasing the numerical aperture of projection systems. The term &#x201c;immersion&#x201d; as used herein does not mean that a structure, such as a substrate, must be submerged in liquid, but rather only means that liquid is located between the projection system and the substrate during exposure.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the illuminator IL receives a radiation beam from a radiation source SO. The source SO and the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be separate physical entities, for example, when the source SO is an excimer laser (e.g., master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) or master oscillator power ring amplifier (MOPRA)). In such cases, the source SO is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and the radiation beam B passes from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) including, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases, the source SO can be an integral part of the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;, for example, when the source SO is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD, if required, can be referred to as a radiation system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The illuminator IL can include an adjuster AD (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) for adjusting the angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam. Generally, at least the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as &#x201c;&#x3c3;-outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x3c3;-inner,&#x201d; respectively) of the intensity distribution in a pupil plane of the illuminator can be adjusted. In addition, the illuminator IL can comprise various other components (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator IL can be used to condition the radiation beam B to have a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross section.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (for example, mask) MA, which is held on the support structure (for example, mask table) MT, and is patterned by the patterning device MA. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, the radiation beam B is reflected from the patterning device (for example, mask) MA. After being reflected from the patterning device (for example, mask) MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the radiation beam B onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF<b>2</b> (for example, an interferometric device, linear encoder, or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately (for example, so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B). Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor IF<b>1</b> can be used to accurately position the patterning device (for example, mask) MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B. Patterning device (for example, mask) MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (for example, mask MA), which is held on the support structure (for example, mask table MT), and is patterned by the patterning device. Having traversed the mask MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. The projection system has a pupil conjugate PPU to an illumination system pupil IPU. Portions of radiation emanate from the intensity distribution at the illumination system pupil IPU and traverse a mask pattern without being affected by diffraction at the mask pattern and create an image of the intensity distribution at the illumination system pupil IPU.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The projection system PS projects an image MV of the mask pattern MP, where image MV is formed by diffracted beams produced from the mark pattern MP by radiation from the intensity distribution, onto a photoresist layer coated on the substrate W. For example, the mask pattern MP may include an array of lines and spaces. A diffraction of radiation at the array and different from zeroth order diffraction generates diverted diffracted beams with a change of direction in a direction perpendicular to the lines. Undiffracted beams (i.e., so-called zeroth order diffracted beams) traverse the pattern without any change in propagation direction. The zeroth order diffracted beams traverse an upper lens or upper lens group of the projection system PS, upstream of the pupil conjugate PPU of the projection system PS, to reach the pupil conjugate PPU. The portion of the intensity distribution in the plane of the pupil conjugate PPU and associated with the zeroth order diffracted beams is an image of the intensity distribution in the illumination system pupil IPU of the illumination system IL. The aperture device PD, for example, is disposed at or substantially at a plane that includes the pupil conjugate PPU of the projection system PS.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The projection system PS is arranged to capture, by means of an upper lens or upper lens group L<b>1</b> and a lower lens or lower lens group L<b>2</b>, not only the zeroth order diffracted beams, but also first-order or first- and higher-order diffracted beams (not shown). In some embodiments, dipole illumination for imaging line patterns extending in a direction perpendicular to a line may be used to utilize the resolution enhancement effect of dipole illumination. For example, first-order diffracted beams interfere with corresponding zeroth-order diffracted beams at the level of the wafer W to create an image MV of the line pattern MP at highest possible resolution and process window (i.e., usable depth of focus in combination with tolerable exposure dose deviations). In some embodiments, astigmatism aberration may be reduced by providing radiation poles (not shown) in opposite quadrants of the illumination system pupil IPU. For example, the illumination at the illumination system pupil IPU may use only two opposite illumination quadrants, sometimes referred to as BMW illumination, such that the remaining two quadrants are not used in the illumination but are configured to capture first-order diffracted beams. Further, in some embodiments, astigmatism aberration may be reduced by blocking the zeroth order beams in the pupil conjugate PPU of the projection system associated with radiation poles in opposite quadrants.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF (for example, an interferometric device, linear encoder, or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately (for example, so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B). Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) can be used to accurately position the mask MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B (for example, after mechanical retrieval from a mask library or during a scan).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In general, movement of the mask table MT can be realized with the aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which form part of the first positioner PM. Similarly, movement of the substrate table WT can be realized using a long-stroke module and a short-stroke module, which form part of the second positioner PW. In the case of a stepper (as opposed to a scanner), the mask table MT can be connected to a short-stroke actuator only or can be fixed. Mask MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks (as illustrated) occupy dedicated target portions, they can be located in spaces between target portions (known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the mask MA, the mask alignment marks can be located between the dies.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Mask table MT and patterning device MA can be in a vacuum chamber V, where an in-vacuum robot IVR can be used to move patterning devices such as a mask in and out of vacuum chamber. Alternatively, when mask table MT and patterning device MA are outside of the vacuum chamber, an out-of-vacuum robot can be used for various transportation operations, similar to the in-vacuum robot IVR. Both the in-vacuum and out-of-vacuum robots need to be calibrated for a smooth transfer of any payload (e.g., mask) to a fixed kinematic mount of a transfer station.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be used in at least one of the following modes:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">1. In step mode, the support structure (for example, mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are kept essentially stationary, while an entire pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C at one time (i.e., a single static exposure). The substrate table WT is then shifted in the X and/or Y direction so that a different target portion C can be exposed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">2. In scan mode, the support structure (for example, mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C (i.e., a single dynamic exposure). The velocity and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the support structure (for example, mask table) MT can be determined by the (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PS.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">3. In another mode, the support structure (for example, mask table) MT is kept substantially stationary holding a programmable patterning device, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C. A pulsed radiation source SO can be employed and the programmable patterning device is updated as required after each movement of the substrate table WT or in between successive radiation pulses during a scan. This mode of operation can be readily applied to maskless lithography that utilizes a programmable patterning device, such as a programmable mirror array.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Combinations and/or variations on the described modes of use or entirely different modes of use can also be employed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a further embodiment, lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> includes an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source, which is configured to generate a beam of EUV radiation for EUV lithography.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A relative vacuum, i.e. a small amount of gas (e.g. hydrogen) at a pressure well below atmospheric pressure, may be provided in the radiation source SO, in the illumination system IL, and/or in the projection system PS. The radiation source SO may be a laser produced plasma (LPP) source, a discharge produced plasma (DPP) source, a free electron laser (FEL), an excimer laser, a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA), a master oscillator power ring amplifier (MOPRA), or any other radiation source that is capable of generating DUV radiation.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Exemplary Light Source Apparatus</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As discussed above, a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) or a master oscillator power ring amplifier (MOPRA) is a two-stage optical resonator arrangement. The master oscillator (MO) (e.g., first optical resonator stage) produces a highly coherent light beam. The power amplifier (PA) or the power ring amplifier (PRA) (e.g., second optical resonator stage) increases the optical power of the light beam while preserving the beam properties. The MO can include a gas discharge chamber, an optical coupler (OC), and a linewidth narrowing module (LNM). The OC and the LNM can surround the gas discharge chamber to form an optical resonator. The PA or the PRA can include a second gas discharge chamber, a wavefront engineering box (WEB), and a beam reverser (BR). The WEB and the BR can surround the second gas discharge chamber to form a second optical resonator. For example, certain MOPAs and MOPRAs have been previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,643,528, issued Jan. 5, 2010, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,822,092, issued Oct. 26, 2010, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Performance of the MOPA or the MOPRA can depend critically on the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA, for example, the optical windows of the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA that output the light beam. An excimer laser utilizes an excimer (e.g., excited dimer) or an exciplex (e.g., excited complex) to output deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation. An excimer is a short-lived homodimeric molecule formed from two species (e.g., Ar<sub>2</sub>, Kr<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Xe<sub>2</sub>). An exciplex is a heterodimeric molecule formed from more than two species (e.g., ArF, KrCl, KrF, XeBr, XeCl, XeF). Electrodes of the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA surrounding the gas discharge medium (e.g., F<sub>2</sub>, ArF, KrF, and/or XeF) can degrade over time and produce metal fluoride dust (e.g., average diameter of about 2.0 &#x3bc;m). Metal fluoride dust can settle on the optical windows of the MO, the PA, and/or the PRA and can lead to optical damage (e.g., local thermal adsorption and/or heating). Further, circulation of metal fluoride dust in the MO can also lead to reduced discharge voltage from the electrodes and poor laser performance</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, a metal fluoride trap (MFT) can be coupled to the chamber of the MO and to the chamber of the PA and/or the PRA to reduce contamination in the gas discharge medium. For example, certain MFTs have been previously described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,240,117, issued May 29, 2001, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,819,945, issued Oct. 26, 2010, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. As a portion of the gas discharge medium passes through the MFT, metal fluoride dust in the contaminated gas discharge medium is adsorbed in the trap filter and any remaining particles are collected by an electrostatic precipitator. The electrostatic precipitator induces an electrostatic charge in the dust particles flowing through the metal fluoride trap (MFT) via a strong electric field (e.g., applied potential of several kV). For example, a voltage can be applied to a center wire passing axially through a precipitation tube (e.g., cylindrical) that creates an electrostatic charge on the inner surface of the precipitation tube. Any remaining metal fluoride dust adheres to the inner surface of the precipitation tube. The resulting clean gas can be circulated back into the MO chamber, the PA chamber, and/or the PRA chamber through the disclosed optical window housings to keep the windows free from dust.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, however, MFT setups can still be unsuccessful in eliminating metal fluoride dust and providing clean gas (e.g., dust free) backflow to the optical window housings. For example, thermal overloading due to metal fluoride dust accumulation on an optical window may lead to catastrophic slip planes (e.g., CaF<sub>2 </sub>crystal dislocation and/or plastic deformation), and may result in MO chamber, PA chamber, and/or PRA chamber replacement. Thus, reducing metal fluoride dusting on optical windows is critical since even a small amount of dusting may lead to irreparable changes in MO chamber, PA chamber, and/or PRA chamber performance and lifetime. Further, clean gas (e.g., dust free) backflow rates from the MFT may not be simply increased to remedy the dusting problem. By increasing a backflow rate of clean gas from the MFT (e.g., opening an input port), the MFT may accumulate metal fluoride dust at a much faster rate than MO chamber, PA chamber, and/or PRA chamber lifetime and, thus, may limit MFT functionality and overall light source lifetimes. In particular, light beam fluences are higher in the PA or the PRA rather than the MO and, thus, metal fluoride dust can lead to earlier optical damage to the PA or the PRA over time. Hence, an appropriate balance may be achieved between clean gas backflow rates (e.g., affects MFT lifetime) and efficiently purging an interior surface of optical windows (e.g., exposed to chamber) with clean gas backflow to reduce metal fluoride dusting on the optical windows (e.g., affects MO chamber, PA chamber, and/or PRA chamber lifetime).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Embodiments of light source apparatuses and systems as discussed below may reduce metal fluoride dusting on optical windows, improve control of flow distribution through a window housing apparatus, provide an efficient purge without increasing clean gas backflow rates from a metal fluoride trap, and increase the service lifetimes of both the metal fluoride trap and the master oscillator, the power amplifier, and/or the power ring amplifier to provide an excimer laser beam (e.g., DUV radiation), for example, to a DUV lithographic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates light source apparatus <b>200</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments.
