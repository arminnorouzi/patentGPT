To save weight and costs, the line portions are frequently made of plastic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular when used in charge-air lines, the line portions are exposed to significant pressure fluctuations, vibrations and heat emissions from engine components.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 10 2012 007 670 A1 discloses a generic plug-in coupling in which the lock has a locking device, an actuating device and a preloading device. The locking device engages with blocking elements through openings in the female line portion, with the result that a male line portion is able to be locked in the female line portion by means of a corresponding groove. Via the actuation device, this lock can be undone again.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Apart from the fact that, on account of the large number of components, that solution is very complicated, it also has, like similar, known solutions, the drawback that the openings in which the blocking elements engage can be deflected, in plastics parts, by the outlined dynamic loads on the plug-in coupling. As a result, the openings can also separate and this can result in the plug-in couplings being destroyed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention was based on the object of improving a plug-in coupling of the outlined type such that it withstands dynamic loads with a high degree of reliability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is achieved in that the female line portion has, in the region of the blocking openings, at least one reinforcement made of a metal material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A metal reinforcement can take a high contact pressure and so, even under dynamic loads, retaining forces of the spring blocking element engaging in the blocking openings are able to be readily taken up.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one development of the invention, the at least one metal reinforcement is in the form of a ring which is arranged around the female line portion in the region of the blocking openings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this way, even under high loads, the spring blocking element butts substantially against the metal ring such that the plastics material of the female line portion is subject to less severe stresses.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one development of the invention, the metal ring has apertures which correspond to the blocking openings such that the spring blocking element, with the coupling fully assembled, can engage both through the apertures in the metal ring and through the blocking openings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This results in particularly good distribution of the forces of the spring blocking element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one development of the invention, the metal ring is in the form of a split spring ring and the female line portion has axially spaced-apart ring webs between which the split spring ring is able to be positioned such that the spring ring is fixed axially to the female line portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The ring webs additionally take up the forces that are transferred from the spring blocking element to the spring ring, with the result that an even better force distribution is possible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one development of the invention, the metal ring is in the form of a closed ring with a predetermined diameter, wherein the closed ring is able to be embedded in the plastic of the female line portion during the production of the female line portion.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The embedding of the closed ring results in optimal transfer of the forces from the spring blocking element to the female line portion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The outlined solutions ensure more reliable force transfer from the spring blocking element to the female line portion. As a result, it is possible to ensure that, even in the event of high contact pressures between the spring blocking element and the female line portion, separation of the blocking openings can be ruled out.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be explained in more detail in the following text on the basis of the drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded illustration of the female line portion of a plug-in coupling according to the invention with a split spring ring,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective illustration of the female line portion with a split spring ring in an assembly state, and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a longitudinal section through a female line portion with a closed, embedded metal ring.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded illustration of a female part <b>1</b> of a plug-in coupling according to the invention.

The blocking clip <b>5</b> is supported on the ring webs <b>2</b>A of the coupling sleeve <b>1</b> such that the forces are not absorbed between the pawls <b>7</b> of the blocking clip <b>5</b> and the blocking slots <b>3</b> in the coupling sleeve <b>1</b> but between the reinforcement ring <b>9</b> and the ring webs <b>2</b>A. Therefore, on account of the much larger contact surfaces, the surface pressure is much lower and so separation of the blocking slots <b>3</b> is avoidable.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a longitudinal section through a further embodiment of the coupling sleeve <b>1</b> according to the invention.
