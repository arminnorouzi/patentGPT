Moreover, the tire comprising the tire internal member formed of the rubber composition has improved ride comfort and steering stability with a good balance.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Since the rubber composition of the present disclosure comprises a rubber component, an inorganic fiber material, and a coupling agent, it exhibits excellent breaking strength and anisotropy.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although it is not intended to be bound by theory, the following can be considered as a mechanism by which the rubber composition of the present disclosure can exhibit excellent breaking strength and anisotropy.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By compounding an inorganic fiber material into the rubber composition, a modulus of the rubber can be given with anisotropy, but it is considered that the inorganic fiber material is less likely to be dispersed in the rubber component compared with a filler such as carbon black. Therefore, the entire rubber matrix cannot be reinforced, and it is considered that it is difficult to obtain sufficient breaking strength and anisotropy. Here, by compounding a coupling agent together with the inorganic fiber material, dispersibility of the inorganic fiber material in the rubber matrix is improved to reinforce the entire matrix, and it becomes possible to orient the inorganic fiber material in a uniform state, and therefore it is considered that anisotropy also becomes improved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the rubber composition (vulcanized rubber) of the present disclosure, the value of the ratio of 100% modulus in the grain direction M100a to 100% modulus in the cross-grain direction M100b as the index of anisotropy (M100a/M100b, may be herein referred to as the &#x201c;modulus ratio&#x201d;) is 1.10 or more, more preferably 1.15 or more, further preferably 1.20 or more, from the viewpoint of an excellent anisotropy. On the other hand, an upper limit value of the ratio of the modulus is not particularly limited, but is usually 2.00 or less, and may be 1.80 or less, 1.60 or less, or 1.50 or less. By setting the ratio of the modulus to 1.10 or more, a supple response to the cross-grain direction of the inorganic fiber material oriented in a highly dispersed state with the coupling agent is realized, and rigidity in the grain direction is increased, allowing for improvement in responsiveness. Besides, in the present disclosure, the &#x201c;grain direction&#x201d; means a rolling direction when a sheet is formed by extrusion or shearing, while the &#x201c;cross-grain direction&#x201d; means a direction perpendicular to the grain direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, when the rubber composition is used as a tire, the grain direction of the inorganic fibers may be any of a circumferential direction, a radial direction, and a width direction of the tire, but it is preferably arranged along the tire circumferential direction from the viewpoint of improving ride comfort and steering stability with a good balance. By orienting the inorganic fibers in the tire circumferential direction, a supple response to an input (vibration) from a tire vertical direction during rolling is realized, and by increasing rigidity in the orientation direction (tire circumferential direction), responsiveness to the input during steering is improved. Therefore, it is considered that ride comfort and the steering stability are improved with a good balance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A procedure for producing a tire including a production of the rubber composition that is one embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail below.

Moreover, the content of the vulcanization accelerator based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber component is preferably 8 parts by mass or less, more preferably 7 parts by mass or less, further preferably 6 parts by mass or less.

For example, in the kneading step, kneading is performed at 80&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C. for 1 to 30 minutes, and in the vulcanization step, vulcanization is performed at 130&#xb0; C. to 190&#xb0; C. for 3 to 20 minutes.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0109">It is considered that the rubber composition of the present disclosure realizes a supple response to an input (vibration) from a tire vertical direction during rolling by orienting the inorganic fibers in the tire circumferential direction and improves in responsiveness to the input during steering by increasing rigidity in the orientation direction (tire circumferential direction). Therefore, it can be appropriately used for continuous members in the tire circumferential direction such as a cap tread, a base tread, a sidewall, a sidewall inner layer, an inner liner, a strip apex, a bead apex, a clinch apex, a bead reinforcement layer, an insulation, and an insert, and it is considered that the similar effect can be obtained in either case. Among them, it is appropriately used as a rubber composition for tire internal member such as a base tread, a sidewall inner layer, an inner liner, a strip apex, a bead apex, a bead reinforcing layer, an insulation, and an insert. When the rubber composition of the present disclosure is used as such a tire internal member, elasticity (responsiveness) of the tire in the rolling direction can be improved while maintaining cushioning property, so that it is considered that steering stability and ride comfort are improved.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0110">Besides, in the present specification, the &#x201c;internal member&#x201d; is not limited to the above-described members, but shall refer to tire members other than members that form an outer surface when the tires are mounted on a rim and filled with air.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0111">The tire of the present disclosure can be produced by a usual method using the above-described rubber composition. That is, an unvulcanized rubber composition, in which each of the above-described components is compounded as necessary with the rubber component, is extruded into a shape of a corresponding tire member to obtain a rubber composition in which inorganic fiber materials are oriented in a grain direction. Then, the above-described rubber composition is attached together with other tire members on a tire molding machine so that the inorganic fiber materials are oriented in a tire circumferential direction, and the mixture is molded by a usual method to form an unvulcanized tire, and this unvulcanized tire is heated and pressurized in a vulcanizing machine, thereby producing a tire. The tire of the present disclosure may be a pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic tire. Moreover, it is appropriate for a racing tire, a tire for a passenger car, a tire for a large passenger car, a tire for a large SUV, or a tire for a motorcycle, and can be used as a summer tire, a winter tire, or a studless tire thereof.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0023" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0112">Although the present disclosure will be described based on Examples, it is not limited to Examples.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0113">Various chemicals used in Examples and Comparative examples are collectively shown below.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0114">NR: TSR20</p><p id="p-0111" num="0115">BR: Ubepol BR150B manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.
