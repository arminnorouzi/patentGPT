Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A semiconductor package device may include a substrate and multiple devices attached thereto. The substrate may have a through hole facilitating external signal receiving of one of the devices. The through hole, however, limits the selection of subsequent manufacturing operations since the through hole itself may become a channel for device contamination. In some techniques, a plastic member may be attached to the substrate, having a through hole aligning with the through hole of the substrate so as to facilitate external signal receiving. However, it is difficult to identify a suitable adhesive to properly attach the plastic member to the substrate, and it is technically difficult to align the through hole of the substrate with the through hole of the plastic member within a tolerable range.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, a semiconductor package device includes a substrate, a first electronic component, a first dielectric layer, and a first hole.

the same or similar components. Embodiments of the present disclosure will be readily understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to explain certain aspects of the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed or disposed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed or disposed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present disclosure provides a semiconductor package device including a substrate, a first electronic component disposed on a surface of the substrate, and a dielectric layer disposed on another surface of the substrate. A first hole extends through the substrate and the dielectric layer and substantially aligns with the first electronic component, allowing the first electronic component to efficiently receive at least one signal therethrough. A reflection layer may be disposed along a sidewall of the first hole to reduce reflection loss during transmission of the physical signal. Furthermore, to reinforce the robustness of the semiconductor package device, the dielectric layer can firmly hold one or more relatively small devices disposed on the substrate. Consequently, a relatively small package size can be achieved. Furthermore, the first hole may be formed via a relatively inexpensive process, for example, mechanical drilling or laser ablation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, the semiconductor package device may include a second electronic component disposed on the same side of the substrate as the dielectric layer. A second hole extends through the substrate and substantially aligns with the second electronic component. The second electronic component can efficiently receive at least one physical signal through the second hole. With such an arrangement, the first and second electronic components may individually receive at least one physical signal different from each other.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor package device <b>1</b>A according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

The connection element <b>51</b> is disposed between the first electronic component <b>2</b> and the first surface <b>101</b> of the substrate <b>1</b>.

The connection element <b>51</b> may include, for example but is not limited to, solder, adhesive (which may include a conductive adhesive (e.g. resin mixed with conductive particles)), or other suitable bonding material(s).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first electronic component <b>2</b> includes a housing <b>21</b>, a base <b>22</b>, and an active side <b>23</b>. The housing <b>21</b> is in contact with the base <b>22</b>. The active side <b>23</b> is in contact with the base and surrounded by the housing <b>21</b>. The active side <b>23</b> is configured to receive or detect at least one physical signal. In some embodiments, the active side <b>23</b> may include a membrane. The housing <b>21</b>, the base <b>22</b>, and the active side <b>23</b> may define a cavity to detect the variation of at least one physical signal. The first electronic component <b>2</b> is configured to receive or detect at least one physical signal from environment (e.g., sound, pressure, light, temperature, humidity, gas, and the like) and to convert the received physical signal to an electrical signal (e.g., for subsequent processing). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first hole <b>4</b> is aligned with the first electronic component <b>2</b> so as to facilitate the receiving of the aforesaid physical signal by the first electronic component <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the first electronic component <b>2</b> may be a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device which includes, e.g., a pressure sensor, a microphone, a barometer, a thermometer, a hygrometer, a gas detector, or the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first dielectric layer <b>3</b> is disposed on the second surface <b>102</b> of the substrate. The first dielectric layer <b>3</b> has a third surface <b>301</b> away from the substrate <b>1</b> and a fourth surface <b>302</b> toward the substrate <b>1</b>. In some embodiments, the fourth surface <b>302</b> may be in contact with the second surface <b>102</b>. The first dielectric layer <b>3</b> may include epoxy resin or other suitable mold material.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first hole <b>4</b> extends through the substrate <b>1</b> and/or the first dielectric layer <b>3</b>. The first hole <b>4</b> includes a first section <b>41</b> extending through the substrate <b>1</b> and a second section <b>42</b> extending through the first dielectric layer <b>3</b>. The first hole <b>4</b> extends from the third surface <b>301</b> to the first surface <b>101</b>. For example, the first hole <b>4</b> has a first end <b>401</b> adjacent to the first surface <b>101</b> and a second end <b>402</b> adjacent to the third surface <b>301</b>. In some embodiments, the first end <b>401</b> is proximal to the active side <b>23</b> of the first electronic component <b>2</b>. The second end <b>402</b> is distal from the active side <b>23</b> of the first electronic component <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the second end <b>402</b> may be exposed or covered by a protection layer with microporous material. The second end <b>402</b> of the first hole <b>4</b> is substantially aligned with the first electronic component <b>2</b>, allowing the first electronic component <b>2</b> to efficiently receive or detect the physical signal through the first hole <b>4</b>. Alternatively, the second end <b>402</b> may be positioned facing the at least one external signal source in order to facilitate transmission of the physical signal. The external signal source can be located over the third surface <b>301</b> or at the side surface of the dielectric layer <b>3</b>. The external signal source can be located under the first surface <b>101</b> of the substrate <b>1</b>. Multiple external signal sources may be simultaneously presented at the aforesaid locations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In comparative embodiments, a semiconductor package device includes a substrate with a first hole, an electronic component disposed on a first side of a substrate, and a plastic member disposed on a second side opposite to the first side of the substrate. The plastic member includes a second hole aligned with the first, so the electronic component can receive external signals through the first and second holes. However, it is technically difficult to align the first hole and the second hole in the attachment process. Misalignment of the first and second holes can degrade transmission efficiency of the external signals. In the present disclosure, the first hole <b>4</b>, which substantially aligns with the first electronic component <b>2</b> and extends through the substrate <b>1</b> and the first dielectric layer <b>3</b>, provides an unimpeded transmission path for the physical signal and therefore improves transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, the first hole <b>4</b> may be formed by, for example, mechanical drilling or laser ablation, so the process cost is relatively less than forming a plastic member having a hole.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the reflection layer <b>18</b> is disposed on the first dielectric layer <b>3</b> and within the first hole <b>4</b>.
