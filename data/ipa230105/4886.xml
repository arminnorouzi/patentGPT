In consequence, for example, measures to reduce a risk of occurrence of said incidents or measures to reduce an impact of an occurrence of said incidents can be taken. Very common methods to manage such risks is the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as well as the Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)&#x2014;both are often referred to as FMEA.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The same applies for the operation of technical systems, for example chemical processing plants or manufacturing plants. For example for the determining a need of preventive maintenance, effects resulting from failure (or a detectable state of degradation) are assessed. These effects can be harm for operators and/or an environment, for example if an air filtering system or a safety device fail. But they can also be related to effects on a productivity of a part of the system or depending systems. For example, a stoppage of a machine can lead to a production stop for subsequent and/or preceding line parts, in particular in the context of LEAN production.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Risk assessment and risk management can be required by law or regulation. Depending on outcomes of risk assessments and/or implemented counter measures, requirements can be made. This even applies to financial service providers such as banks or insurances, which may be obligated to have a certain financial backup depending on risks that result from their operation. This backup can further depend on which measures they take in order to mitigate risks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Risk management also plays an important role in the operation of water craft. Apart from interests of shipowners and the crew to keep a vessel in safe operation, international contracts and guidelines such as the contracts negotiated under the aegis of IMO require several safety measures to limit risks result from operating vessels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, often, said risk management is still performed manually. Software solutions often only transpose a process from paper to software&#x2014;however, the assessment of risks, their agglomeration and the management of dependencies often stays a human task. In consequence, problems such as a low reproducibility of results of such analyses as well as false estimations because of human perception of risks are still a common problem. Furthermore, many risk management systems lack flexibility, especially when they are implemented in spreadsheets that are relatively rigid in terms of structure of dependencies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, understanding complex interactions between risks is cognitively cumbersome for humans. Thus, finding synergies or common origins of risks with a multitude of dependencies can be non-obvious.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the invention to overcome or at east alleviate the shortcomings and disadvantages of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for supporting risk management.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This objective is met by a system comprising a first data-processing system and at least one second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first data-processing system can comprise a server.

That is, the second data-processing system can comprise at least a portion of at least one end-user computer device or portions of each of a plurality of end-user computer devices. That can for example be the case when the second data-processing system comprises end user computer system with profiles for a plurality of users, and at least one profile belongs to a second data-processing system &#x201c;A&#x201d; and at least another profile belongs to a second data-process system &#x201c;B&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second data-processing system can also be the plurality of end-user computer devices.

This can obviously also be advantageous in cases where the first data-processing system transmits data that facilitate solving said tasks to the second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first data-processing system can be configured for transmitting data to a third data-processing system.

The condition-node modifier can be a data element representative for an impact of all condition-states that impact a specific condition-node.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The data-storage component can further be configured for storing a plurality of condition-node values and wherein each condition-node comprises a condition-node value. A condition-node value can be representative of an estimate of a probability of occurrence of the certain event or incident. A condition-node can be representative of a measure of a risk that the incident occurs or the certain state is reached.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The data-storage component can be configured for storing at least one or a plurality of condition-states.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The data-storage component can further be configured for storing a plurality of assignments, wherein each assignment assigns a condition-state to at least one of the condition-nodes.

A node-link can link two condition-nodes. A node-link can be representative of a connection between conditions modelled by the condition-nodes. In a case where two condition-nodes each model a risk, a node-link can model the relation of the two risks, for example one risk increasing the other.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The node-links can further be directed. That is, in a case where node-link C links condition-nodes A and B in the direction from A to B, then B is reachable from A, but A is not reachable from B via the node-link C. The terms &#x201c;directed&#x201d; and &#x201c;reachable&#x201d; are intended to be understood in the way of terms of graph theory, interpreting the condition-nodes and node-links as a directed graph.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The resulting graph can furthermore be acyclic. The condition-nodes and the node-links can be connected so that such a resulting directed graph is acyclic.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The node-links can further satisfy a supplementary condition. The supplementary condition may be that the links do not form circles if they are directed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The data-storage component can further be configured for storing a node-link value for each node-link. Each node-link can further comprise a node-link value. A node-link value can be a value representative of a weighting of a node-link or a data-element representative thereof.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The data-storage component can be configured for storing at least one or a plurality of subset(s) of the condition-nodes.

The data-storage component can be configured for storing at least one or a plurality of subset(s) of the condition-states. The subset(s) of the condition-states can each comprise at least one or at least some of the condition-states. They can each comprise at most all of the condition-states.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The at least one or the plurality of node-links can be a plurality of node-links. The data-storage component can be configured for storing at least one or a plurality of subset(s) of the node-links. The subset(s) of the node-links can each comprise at least one or at least some of the node-links. They can each comprise at most all of the node-links.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The system and/or the condition-state determining component can be configured to perform for each condition-state of at least a subset of the condition-states the following operations:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The system and/or the condition-state determining component can be configured for comparing each condition-state value and the respective condition-state threshold in at least a subset of the condition-states. The system and/or the condition-state determining component can be configured for thus generating a comparison result for each of these condition-states. Furthermore, the system and/or the condition-state determining component can be configured for assigning the comparison result to the respective condition-state.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In other words, the system and/or the condition-state determining component can be configured for performing these steps for at least some of the condition-states, for example for a subset of the condition-states. The system and/or the condition-state determining component can also be configured for performing these steps for a plurality of subsets of the condition-states or for each of the condition-states.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The condition-state processing component and/or the system can be configured for generating a condition-node modifier for each condition-node of at least a subset of condition-nodes by aggregating the comparison results of the condition-states of at least a subset of condition-nodes which condition-states are assigned to the respective condition-node.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">That is, the condition-state processing component and/or the system can be configured to combine the comparison results of all condition-states assigned to a condition-node and thus generate a condition-node modifier for said condition-node. The condition-state processing component and/or the system can furthermore be configured for performing this for some or all condition-nodes and the assigned condition-states or subsets of the assigned condition-states. The latter can be advantageous when only a subset of the condition-states is applicable.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The condition-state determining component and/or the system can be configured to compare the condition-state values and the condition-state thresholds of at least the subset of the condition-states by calculating a distance of each condition-state value and the respective condition-state threshold and to generate the respective comparison result based on this distance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">That is, the condition-state determining component and/or the system can be configured to generate comparison results by calculating a distance or a measure for a distance of condition-state values and respective condition-state thresholds.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Such a distance or measure thereof can for example be the difference of two scalar values.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The condition-state determining component and/or the system can further comprise a limiting element.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The limiting element can be configured to limit the comparison results to a certain range of values. For example, the limiting element can be configured to only keep negative or positive distances and to set the comparison result to 0 otherwise.

The input data can differ at least regarding the linking criterion. They can also differ regarding a specified element, that is the specified condition-state and/or the specified condition-node. The person skilled in the art will easily understand that thus, also combinations of linking criteria and specified condition-state/specified condition-node can differ.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0304">The outputting step can comprise outputting at least one or a plurality of condition-node values of the condition-nodes to be outputted.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0305">The outputting step can also comprise outputting at least one or a plurality of condition-state values of the condition-states to be outputted.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0306">The outputting step can comprise outputting only condition-states that belong to one subset of condition-states. The outputting step can also comprise for each combination of a linking criterion and a specified condition-state and/or a specified condition-node outputting only condition-states that belong to one subset of condition-states. However, the subsets can be different between the combinations or some of the combinations.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0307">The outputting step can comprise outputting only condition-nodes that belong to one subset of condition-nodes. The outputting step can also comprise for each combination of a linking criterion and a specified condition-state and/or a specified condition-node outputting only condition-nodes that belong to one subset of condition-nodes. However, the subsets can be different between the combinations or some of the combinations.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0308">The method can further comprise a pre-calculating step (PCS). The pre-calculating step can comprise determining at least one of the condition-nodes and the condition-states to be outputted for at least one or a plurality of linking-criteria and a plurality of the at least one of the specified condition-node and the specified condition-state and to thus generate pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0309">That is, the pre-calculating step can comprise pre-calculating the condition-nodes and/or the condition-states to be outputted for different input data, wherein the input data comprise at least one or multiple linking criteria and a plurality of specified condition-nodes and/or condition-states.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0310">An advantage of this method step can be that the method provides data to the user or the third data-processing system with a lower response time. This can be due to the fact that determining the condition-nodes and/or condition-states to be outputted based on a linking criterion and a specified condition-node or specified condition-state respectively can be an NP-hard problem. Thus, determining these condition-nodes and/or condition-states to be outputted only upon request may lead to a considerable response time. However, pre-calculating these condition-nodes and/or condition-states to be outputted may shorten the response time since looking up a result can be performed with a significantly lower (computational) time complexity. Hence, the pre-calculating step may be still more advantageous when the number of condition-nodes and the number of condition-links are high, as in such a case, a lookup of a pre-calculated result or at least a pre-calculated part of the result can be significantly faster or significantly less demanding in computing power than calculating the result.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0311">The pre-calculating step (PCS) can further comprise storing said pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0312">The pre-calculating step (PCS) can be performed by the first data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0313">This can be advantageous in particular in cases where the first data-processing system is a server, cloud-computer system or the like as discussed above. In such cases, the first-data processing system may comprise a higher computing power then the second data-processing system. Also, in case where the second data-processing system comprises mobile devices, an advantage of using the first data-processing system for the pre-calculating can be a simpler access to power, in particular when the first data-processing system is stationary.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0314">The pre-calculated data can be stored at least at the second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0315">The outputting data can be based on the pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0316">The outputting step can be performed based on the pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0317">The method can comprise determining the at least one of the plurality of the condition-node values and the condition-state values based at least on the pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0318">In other words, the method can comprise determining the at least one of the condition-nodes to be outputted and the condition-states to be outputted based at least on the pre-calculated data.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0319">However, the determining can still comprise further steps, input data or parameters. That is, the data to be outputted do not need to be exclusively determined based on the pre-determined data.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0320">The method can comprise determining the at least one of the plurality of the condition-node values and the condition-state values by the second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0321">Storing the at least one node-link(s) and storing the plurality of the condition-nodes can comprise storing the at least one node-link(s) and storing the plurality of the condition-nodes in a graph database.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0322">Storing the at least one condition state can comprises storing the at least one condition-state in a document-oriented database.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0323">The method can comprise storing the pre-calculated data in a graph database. An example for a graph database can be the Neo4j graph database.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0324">The method can comprises storing the pre-calculated data in a document-oriented database.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0325">The method can further comprise storing the pre-calculated data in source code of an application for carrying out the method and furthermore compiling said source code.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0326">In other words, the method can comprise pre-calculating all possible permutations of the node-links and storing them in the source code of the application. Hence, at runtime, a pre-calculated result can be selected from the pre-calculated data and be used for further calculation.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0327">This can be particularly advantageous as retrieving information that is stored in data of the application can be significantly faster than retrieving data from a database. Hence, this embodiment may further reduce the response time to requests. In experiments, the lookup time was reduced by around a factor <b>1000</b> compared to data-base calls.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0328">The method can further comprise the first data-processing system and a plurality of second data-processing systems. The plurality of the second data-processing systems can be according to the remarks above.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0329">The method can further comprise performing the condition-state determining step for each second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0330">Each subset of the condition-states can correspond to at least one or exactly one second data-processing system. The subsets can for example be the same in a case where identical systems or organisations are modelled. The subsets can for example be different in a case where systems with different risks or applicable measures are modelled.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0331">The method can also comprise performing the condition-state processing step (CSP) for each second data-processing system, wherein each subset of the condition-nodes corresponds to at least one second data-processing system.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0332">The method can further comprise storing separate sets of values for the condition-node values, the condition-node modifiers, the condition-state values and the comparison results for each second data-processing system. That is, the system process input data separately for different second data-processing systems. This can be advantageous for example in a case where a ship owner owns a fleet of 20 ships for which one central server keeps the data. In such a case, even if all 20 ships are from a same type and age, values representing their conditions and/or measures taken by the crew can be different for each ship. In such a case, the method allows using only one first data-processing system for modelling states of all 20 ships.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0333">The method may further comprise storing separate sets of values for the condition-node thresholds for each of the second data-processing systems. This can be advantageous when the modelled systems operate under different circumstances or when they are different.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0334">The method can comprise performing the condition-node processing step (CNP) for each set of the sets of values.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0335">Each set of values can comprise set of values relating to at least one second data-processing system, comprising at least the condition-node values generated in the condition-node processing step.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0336">The method can comprise performing the condition-state selecting step for each set of the sets of values.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0337">Each set of values can comprise a subset of condition-states selected in the respective condition-state selecting step.

A method comprises using a plurality of condition-nodes <b>20</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> indicated by capital letters A to I, wherein the number of condition-nodes <b>20</b> is merely exemplary. The condition-nodes (<b>20</b>) are connected by node-links <b>40</b>. The node-links <b>40</b> can optionally each be associated with a node-link value <b>42</b>. The node-links <b>40</b> are directed and each node-link <b>40</b> links one condition-node <b>20</b> to another condition-node <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0659">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows furthermore a plurality of condition-states <b>30</b> that are assigned to one of the condition-nodes <b>20</b>. Each of the condition-states <b>30</b> can also be assigned to at least one or a plurality of other condition-nodes <b>20</b>, and each or at least some of the condition-states <b>30</b> can be assigned to different condition-nodes <b>20</b>. For the sake of clarity and readability, such further relations of shown condition-nodes <b>20</b> as well as further condition-states <b>30</b> are not shown. However, the method may comprise using such further relations of condition-states <b>30</b> to condition-nodes <b>20</b> as well as further condition-states <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0660">Each condition-state can comprise a condition-state threshold <b>34</b> and a condition-state value <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0661">In one example, the method can be used to monitor and manage a condition or a plurality of conditions or reliabilities of a ship, or risks relating to the ship. In such this example, a condition-node relates to at least an aspect of a technical system and/or a corresponding risk. For example, a propulsion-system of the ship may comprise at least one internal combustion engine, a transmission system, and a power-output, such as at least one propeller. The transmission system can for example be a combination of at least one electrical generator and at least one electrical motor, typically completed by corresponding power electronics. The transmission system can for example also be a mechanical transmission system as known to the person ordinarily skilled in the art. In this example, condition-node A represents the internal combustion engine of the ship. The shown condition-states <b>30</b> relate all at least to said internal combustion engine. A first condition-state <b>30</b> can relate to a quantity of fuel that is stored in the fuel tank. This condition-state's <b>30</b> condition-state threshold <b>34</b> can for example indicate a minimum quantity of fuel, and this condition-state's condition-state value can refer to the carried quantity of fuel. As this example illustrates, the ship (or the overall system, respectively) may be operational, even though condition-state value <b>36</b> is below the condition-state threshold <b>34</b>. Nevertheless, a risk of fuel-shortage on the high seas may be increased. Analogously, a second condition-state <b>30</b> can relate to a lubrification system of the ship. The second condition-state <b>30</b> can also relate to another condition-node <b>20</b>, such as the transmission system of the ship, which may also require the lubrification system to be in an operative state. A third condition-state <b>30</b> may relate to a controller, such as an ECU of the combustion engine, or to its software. Also one or more condition-nodes <b>20</b> may refer to software components, such as a software component operating a RADAR-system of the ship. That is, more generally speaking, condition-states <b>30</b> can relate to one or more condition-nodes <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0662">The method comprises comparing the condition-state value <b>36</b> and the condition-state threshold <b>34</b> of condition-states <b>30</b>. A result of this comparison is a comparison result <b>38</b> (not shown). The comparison result can be obtained by different measures. The comparison results <b>38</b> can for example be obtained by calculating a difference of each condition-state value <b>36</b> and the respective condition-state threshold <b>34</b> if the respective condition-state value <b>36</b> is lower than the respective condition-state threshold <b>34</b> and assigning said result to the respective comparison result <b>38</b>, and assigning 0 to the respective comparison result <b>38</b> otherwise.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0663">The method can furthermore comprise aggregating the comparison results <b>38</b> of each condition-state <b>30</b> which condition-state is assigned to a condition-node <b>20</b> and thus generating a condition-node modifier <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the condition-states <b>30</b> assigned to condition-node <b>20</b> A are shown, that is, a condition-node modifier <b>22</b> of condition-node <b>20</b> A can be obtained from aggregating the shown condition-states' <b>30</b> comparison results <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0664">Returning to the example of using the method for monitoring a ship's condition or risks relating to a ship, the abovementioned exemplary condition-node modifier <b>22</b> relates to the ship's internal combustion engine. If said condition-node modifier <b>22</b> and the corresponding comparison results <b>38</b> are calculated as discussed above, then they can for example be a measure for a risk of a failure or a stoppage of the internal combustion engine. If their calculation is adapted, such as by subtracting the condition-node modifier <b>22</b> from another value, such as 1, then the condition-node modifier <b>22</b> can represent a reliability of the internal combustion engine. Analogous considerations apply to other condition-nodes, condition-states <b>30</b> and related elements. Condition-node <b>20</b> D can in this example relate to a generation of electrical power on board, for example in case of a diesel-electric ship. Condition-nodes <b>20</b> A and D are linked by a node-link <b>40</b>, as the generation of electrical power on board depends on the internal combustion engine. Condition-node <b>20</b> F and G are then aspects of the ship that depend on the generation of electrical power on board, such as an operation of the propulsion system (in the case of a diesel-electric ship, where the propulsion system comprises electric motors that power propellers or the like), and an availability of electrical systems on board. In general, the node-links <b>40</b> do not need to express absolute dependencies, but they can also only indicate a propagation of conditions or risks, such as in case of the exemplary availability of electrical systems on board. Even in case of an interruption of generation of electrical power on board by generators on board, at least a part of the electrical systems on board will still remain operational at least for some time, as they will most probably be linked to batteries, too.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0665">The detailed example illustrates a use of the method as modern tool of engineering, namely for maintenance and naval operation. However, the method is not limited to this application, but can also be used to monitor other systems, for example a ship as discussed above, a cyber-physical system such as an IT-system, or even conditions and risks in an operation of another system, such as a bank or an insurance.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0666">For example in case of a bank or an insurance, the condition-nodes could for example correspond to risks that contribute to an operations risk, and the condition-states could correspond to measures that are implemented or required in order to limit or control these risks. The method can hence be a computer-implemented method for risk-assessment of a bank, an insurance and/or any company of corporate finance.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0667">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, some condition-nodes <b>30</b> F, G, H and I only have node-links <b>40</b> incoming from other condition-nodes <b>30</b>, but no &#x201c;outgoing&#x201d; node-links <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0668">Thus, the invention allows to efficiently manage, forecast and simulate impacts of adjustments or measures on conditions or states of a system. As the method uses a graph-representation, applicable states, conditions, measures and (inter-)dependencies can be flexibly changed.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0669"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the method with a set of method steps, of which some are optional, and used data-processing systems, comprising a first data-processing system <b>10</b> and a second data-processing system <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0670">The first data-processing system <b>10</b> can for example be a server, a server system, a cloud system, or a hybrid system, wherein calculation operations can be distributed to several devices that may even be end-user computer devices, or a system emulating a server, such as a server system with an appropriate software for running a virtual machine.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0671">The second data-processing system <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> is a data-processing system that comprises at least one user interface.
