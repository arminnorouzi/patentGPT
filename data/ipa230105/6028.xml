In comparison to the conventional IPD structure, the three-dimensional inductor structure of the present disclosure occupies less circuit area while achieving the same inductance. In addition, since the three-dimensional inductor structure may include the plurality of front side metal layers of the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b>, the plurality of backside metal layers of the backside patterns <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, and the plurality of backside metal layers on the wall surfaces of the through-wafer via structures <b>161</b> to <b>164</b>, the eddy current may be effectively reduced and the quality factor of the inductor is increased considerably.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>300</b> of forming the semiconductor device <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method <b>300</b> includes Steps S<b>302</b> to S<b>314</b>. Steps S<b>302</b> and S<b>304</b> are used to form the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> and the front side protection layers <b>241</b> to <b>243</b>. Steps S<b>306</b> to S<b>310</b> are used to form through-wafer vias. Steps S<b>312</b> and S<b>314</b> are used to form the backside patterns <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. Any reasonable step change or adjustment is within the scope of the present disclosure. Steps S<b>302</b> to S<b>314</b> are detailed as follows:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Step S<b>302</b>: Form the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> on the front side surface <b>101</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Step S<b>304</b>: Form the front side protection layers <b>241</b> to <b>243</b> on the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Step S<b>306</b>: Thin the compound substrate <b>10</b> from the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Step S<b>308</b>: The infrared camera identifies one end of the front side pattern <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> from the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b> to align the head ends <b>1411</b>, <b>1421</b> and the tail ends <b>1412</b>, <b>1422</b> on the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Step S<b>310</b>: Drill the compound substrate <b>10</b> from the head ends <b>1411</b>, <b>1421</b> and the tail ends <b>1412</b>, <b>1422</b> on the backside surface <b>102</b> to form through-wafer vias;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Step S<b>312</b>: Electroplate the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b> and the through-wafer vias to form the backside metal layer <b>260</b>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step S<b>314</b>: Etch the backside metal layer <b>260</b> to form backside patterns <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In Steps S<b>302</b> and S<b>304</b>, if the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> are made of N front side metal layers, N being a positive integer, a corresponding number of front side protection layers will be formed on each front side metal layer. For example, the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> are made of the front side metal layers <b>221</b> to <b>223</b>, and the corresponding front side protection layers <b>241</b> to <b>243</b> are formed on the front side metal layers <b>221</b> to <b>223</b>, respectively. In Step S<b>306</b>, the compound substrate <b>10</b> is thinned to a predetermined thickness, so that the compound substrate <b>10</b> can carry the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> properly without being affected by the stress, while light being able to pass through the compound substrate <b>10</b> for aligning with the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b> from the backside surface <b>102</b>. The predetermined thickness may be between 100 micrometers and 75 micrometers. In Step S<b>308</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tail end of the front pattern <b>121</b> corresponds to a position of the head end <b>1411</b>, the head end of the front pattern <b>122</b> corresponds to a position of the tail end <b>1412</b>, the tail end of the front pattern <b>122</b> corresponds to a position of the head end <b>1421</b>, and the head end of the front pattern <b>123</b> corresponds to a position of the tail end <b>1422</b>. In Step S<b>310</b>, since a through-wafer via is drilled from the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b>, the second diameter d<b>2</b> of the through-wafer via would exceed the first diameter d<b>1</b> of the through-wafer. In Step S<b>312</b>, the backside surface <b>102</b> of the compound substrate <b>10</b> and the through-wafer vias are simultaneously electroplated to form the backside metal layer (electroplated layer) <b>260</b> on the backside surface <b>102</b> and the wall surfaces of the through-wafer vias. In Step S<b>314</b>, after the backside metal layer <b>260</b> is formed, a photoresist is coated, dried, and then the infrared camera is used to align a photomask with the front side patterns <b>121</b> to <b>123</b>, followed by exposure and development, etching, and then removing the photoresist to form the desired backside patterns <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. The etching technique may be dry etching of removing unwanted portions of the backside metal layers <b>261</b> to <b>263</b> to form the backside patterns <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The method <b>300</b> may form the three-dimensional inductor structure of the semiconductor device <b>1</b> on a gallium arsenide substrate, reducing the circuit area of the inductor and enhancing the quality factor of the inductor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.
