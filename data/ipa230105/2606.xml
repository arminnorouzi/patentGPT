A heterophasic copolymer of propylene with a comonomer selected from ethylene, alpha-olefins having 4 to 10 carbon atoms and their mixtures is produced in the process. Further on, said heterophasic copolymer may be processed into a pipe having good low-temperature toughness.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0010">A heterophasic copolymer comprises at least two phases, a matrix, and an elastomeric phase.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0011">The matrix, which is the continuous phase, substantially comprises and preferably consists of a semicrystalline homopolymer of propylene or a random copolymer of propylene with a comonomer selected from ethylene, alpha-olefins having 4 to 10 carbon atoms and their mixtures. By &#x201c;semicrystalline&#x201d; is meant that the homopolymer or the random copolymer has a substantial crystallinity. This is indicated, for instance, by the fact that matrix is mostly insoluble in cold xylene determined according to ISO 16152. By &#x201c;mostly insoluble&#x201d; is meant that at most 30%, preferably at most 15% and more preferably at most 10% by weight of the matrix is soluble in xylene at 25&#xb0; C. according to ISO 16152.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0012">By &#x201c;substantially comprises&#x201d; is here meant that substantially all, that is, at least 90% by weight, preferably at least 95% by weight and more preferably at least 98% and especially preferably at least 99% by weight of the matrix is formed of the homopolymer of propylene or the random copolymer of propylene with a comonomer selected from ethylene, alpha-olefins having 4 to 10 carbon atoms and their mixtures. It is, however, within the scope of the invention that the matrix consists of two or more homopolymers of propylene and/or random copolymers of propylene as defined above, provided that the overall matrix is semicrystalline and forms a single, continuous phase.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0013">The matrix comprises a higher molecular weight component produced in one polymerisation reactor and a lower molecular weight component produced in another polymerisation reactor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0014">The elastomeric phase is dispersed into the matrix. The elastomeric phase substantially comprises, preferably consists of, copolymers of propylene with a comonomer selected from ethylene, alpha-olefins having 4 to 10 carbon atoms and their mixtures. The elastomeric phase is substantially amorphous with no crystalline fraction. This is indicated, for instance, by the fact that elastomeric phase is mostly soluble in cold xylene as measured according to ISO 16152. Thus, at least about 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% and especially preferably at least 95% of the elastomeric phase is soluble in cold xylene as measured according to ISO 16152.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0015">It is within the scope of the invention that the elastomeric phase consists of two or more copolymers of propylene as defined above, provided that the overall elastomeric phase is non-crystalline and is dispersed within the matrix as separate domains.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0016">Further the heterophasic polypropylene may contain to some extent a crystalline polyethylene, which is a by-reaction product obtained by the preparation of the heterophasic propylene copolymer. Such crystalline polyethylene is present as inclusion of the amorphous phase due to thermodynamic reasons.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0017">Especially, according to the present invention the matrix is produced in at least two distinct polymerisation steps in at least two polymerisation reactors and the elastomeric phase is produced in at least one polymerisation step in at least one polymerisation reactor. To avoid unnecessary complexity of the process it is preferred that the matrix is produced in two polymerisation reactors and the elastomeric phase in one or two polymerisation reactors.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Catalyst</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0018">Solid Catalyst Component</p><p id="p-0024" num="0019">The solid catalyst component used in the present invention is preferably a solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst component, which comprises compounds of a transition metal of Group 4 to 6 of IUPAC, like titanium, a Group 2 metal compound, like a magnesium and an internal electron donor (ID) being a compound according to formula (I).

However, preferably comonomer is not introduced into the first polymerisation reactor.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">According to the present invention the slurry is passed directly from the first polymerisation reactor into the second polymerisation reactor. By &#x201c;directly&#x201d; it is meant that the slurry is introduced from the first reactor into the second reactor without a flash step between the reactors for removing at least a part of the reaction mixture from the polymer. Thereby, substantially the entire slurry stream withdrawn from the first polymerisation reactor is passed to the second polymerisation reactor. This kind of direct feed is described in EP-A-887379, EP-A-887380, EP-A-887381 and EP-A-991684. However, it is within the scope of the present invention to take small samples or sample streams from the polymer or from the fluid phase or from both for analysing the polymer and/or the composition of the reaction mixture. As understood by the person skilled in the art, the volume of such sample streams is small compared to the total slurry stream withdrawn from the loop reactor and typically much less than 1% by weight of the total stream, such as at most 0.1% or 0.01% or even 0.001% by weight.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">Second Polymerisation Reactor</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">In the second polymerisation reactor a first polymer mixture comprising the first polymer of propylene and a second polymer of propylene is formed.

However, this is generally not sufficient to maintain desired propylene concentration in the second polymerisation reactor. Therefore, additional propylene is typically introduced into the second polymerisation reactor. It is introduced to maintain a desired propylene concentration in the fluidisation gas.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0090">It is also often necessary to introduce additional hydrogen into the second polymerisation reactor to control the melt index of the first polymer mixture. Suitably, the hydrogen feed is controlled to maintain constant hydrogen to propylene ratio in the fluidisation gas. The actual ratio depends on the catalyst. Good results have been obtained by maintaining the ratio within the range of from 0.1 to 3 mol/kmol, preferably from 0.15 to 2 mol/kmol.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0091">In a fluidised bed gas phase reactor olefins are polymerised in the presence of a polymerisation catalyst in an upwards moving gas stream. The reactor typically contains a fluidised bed comprising the growing polymer particles containing the active catalyst, said fluidised bed having its base above a fluidisation grid.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0092">The polymer bed is fluidized with the help of the fluidisation gas comprising the olefin monomer, eventual comonomer(s), eventual chain growth controllers or chain transfer agents, such as hydrogen, and eventual inert gas. The fluidisation gas is introduced into an inlet chamber at the bottom of the reactor. To make sure that the gas flow is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional surface area of the inlet chamber the inlet pipe may be equipped with a flow dividing element as known in the art, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,149 and EP-A-684871. One or more of the above-mentioned components may be continuously added into the fluidisation gas for compensating losses caused, among other, by reaction or product withdrawal.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0093">From the inlet chamber the gas flow is passed upwards through a fluidisation grid into the fluidised bed. The purpose of the fluidisation grid is to divide the gas flow evenly through the cross-sectional area of the bed. Sometimes the fluidisation grid may be arranged to establish a gas stream to sweep along the reactor walls, as disclosed in WO-A-2005/087361. Other types of fluidisation grids are disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,879, EP-A600414 and EP-A-721798. An overview is given in Geldart and Bayens: The Design of Distributors for Gas-fluidized Beds, Powder Technology, Vol. 42, 1985.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0094">The fluidisation gas passes through the fluidised bed. The superficial velocity of the fluidisation gas must be greater than minimum fluidisation velocity of the particles contained in the fluidised bed, as otherwise no fluidisation would occur. On the other hand, the velocity of the gas should be less than the transport velocity, as otherwise the whole bed would be entrained with the fluidisation gas. The bed voidage then is then typically less than 0.8, preferably less than 0.75 and more preferably less than 0.7. Generally, the bed voidage is at least 0.6. An overview is given, among others in Geldart: Gas Fluidization Technology, J. Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1986 in chapters 2.4 and 2.5 (pages 17-18) as well as in chapters 7.3 to 7.5 (pages 169-186, especially FIG. 7.21 on page 183).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0095">When the fluidisation gas is contacted with the bed containing the active catalyst the reactive components of the gas, such as monomers and chain transfer agents, react in the presence of the catalyst to produce the polymer product. At the same time the gas is heated by the reaction heat.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0096">The unreacted fluidisation gas is removed from the top of the reactor and cooled in a heat exchanger to remove the heat of reaction. The gas is cooled to a temperature which is less than that of the bed to prevent the bed from heating because of the reaction. It is possible to cool the gas to a temperature where a part of it condenses. When the liquid droplets re-enter the fluidised bed, they are vaporised. The vaporisation heat then contributes to the removal of the reaction heat. This kind of operation is called condensed mode and variations of it are disclosed, among others, in WO-A-2007/025640, U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,399, EP-A-699213 and WO-A-94/25495. It is also possible to add condensing agents into the recycle gas stream, as disclosed in EP-A-696293. The condensing agents are non-polymerisable components, such as n-pentane, isopentane, n-butane or isobutane, which are at least partially condensed in the cooler.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0097">The gas is then compressed and recycled into the inlet chamber of the reactor. Prior to the entry into the reactor fresh reactants are introduced into the fluidisation gas stream for compensating losses caused by the reaction and product withdrawal. It is generally known to analyse the composition of the fluidisation gas and introduce the gas components to keep the composition constant. The actual gas composition is determined by the desired properties of the product and the catalyst used in the polymerisation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0098">The top part of the gas phase reactor may include a so-called disengagement zone. In such a zone the diameter of the reactor is increased to reduce the gas velocity and allow the particles that are carried from the bed with the fluidisation gas to settle back to the bed.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0099">The bed level may be observed by different techniques known in the art. For instance, the pressure difference between the bottom of the reactor and a specific height of the bed may be recorded over the whole length of the reactor and the bed level may be calculated based on the pressure difference values. Such a calculation yields a time-averaged level. It is also possible to use ultrasonic sensors or radioactive sensors. With these methods instantaneous levels may be obtained, which of course may then be averaged overtime to obtain a time-averaged bed level.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0100">Also, antistatic agent(s) may be introduced into the gas phase reactor if needed. Suitable antistatic agents and methods to use them are disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,026,795, 4,803,251, 4,532,311, 4,855,370 and EP-A-560035. They are usually polar compounds and include, among others, water, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0101">The reactor may also include a mechanical agitator to further facilitate mixing within the fluidised bed. An example of suitable agitator design is given in EP-A-707513.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0102">The polymeric product may be withdrawn from the gas phase reactor either continuously or intermittently. Continuous withdrawal is preferred. Combinations of these methods may also be used. Continuous withdrawal is disclosed, among others, in WO-A-00/29452. Intermittent withdrawal is disclosed, among others, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,952, EP-A-188125, EP-A-250169 and EP-A-579426.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0103">Third Polymerisation Reactor</p><p id="p-0115" num="0104">In the third polymerisation reactor a heterophasic copolymer comprising the first polymer mixture and a third copolymer of propylene is formed. This is done by introducing the particles of the first polymer mixture, containing active catalyst dispersed therein, together with additional propylene and comonomer into the third polymerisation reactor. Hydrogen may be introduced for controlling the molecular weight. This causes the third copolymer to form on the particles containing the first polymer mixture.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0105">The melt index MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the heterophasic copolymer is from 0.05 to 2.0 g/10 min, preferably from 0.1 to 1.0 g/10 min and more preferably from 0.15 to 0.5 g/10 min.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0106">As explained above for the first polymer mixture, the MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the third copolymer of propylene cannot be measured because the third copolymer cannot be isolated from the heterophasic copolymer. However, the MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the third copolymer of propylene can be calculated by using equation 1 above. In that case the component 1 is the first polymer mixture, component 2 is the third copolymer and the final blend is the heterophasic copolymer. It can then be found that the MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the third copolymer is about the same as the MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the first polymer mixture. It is also possible to estimate the MFR<sub>2 </sub>of the third copolymer of propylene by analysing the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer fraction which remains soluble in xylene at 25&#xb0; C., measured according to ISO 16152.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0107">Hydrogen feed is adjusted to achieve a desired melt flow rate (or molecular weight) of the polymer. Suitably, the hydrogen feed is controlled to maintain constant hydrogen to propylene ratio in the reaction mixture. The actual ratio depends on the catalyst as well as the type of the polymerisation. Good results have been obtained in gas phase polymerisation by maintaining the ratio within the range of from 1 to 100 mol/kmol, preferably from 2 to 80 mol/kmol.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0108">The third copolymer is elastomeric.

Preferably the third copolymer of propylene comprises from 35 to 70% by mole of comonomer units and from 30 to 65% by mole of propylene units.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0113">According to another method, the comonomer content of the third copolymer is determined from the polymer fraction which remains soluble in xylene at 25&#xb0; C.

Into the reactor were fed additional propylene, ethylene, and hydrogen, as well as nitrogen as inert gas, so that the content of propylene was 63% by mole, the ratio of ethylene to propylene was 310 mol/kmol, the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene was 22 mol/kmol and the ratio of hydrogen to propylene was 7 mol/kmol. The production rate in the reactor was 11 kg/h. The polymer was withdrawn from the reactor and the hydrocarbons were removed by purging with nitrogen. The resulting polymer had a melt flow rate MFR<sub>2 </sub>of 0.25 g/10 min and an ethylene content of 7.3% by weight. The split of the polymer produced in the loop and the first gas phase reactors to the polymer produced in the second gas phase reactor was 86:14.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0192">The polymer powder withdrawn from the reactor was mixed with a combination of 0.1 wt % of Pentaerythrityl-tetrakis(3-(3&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-di-tert. butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate (CAS No. 6683-19-8, commercially available as Irganox 1010 from BASF AG, Germany) and 0.1 wt % of Tris (2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) phosphite (CAS No. 31570-04-4, commercially available as Irgafos 168 from BASF AG, Germany) as antioxidants, and 0.05 wt % of calcium stearate (CAS No. 1592-23, commercially available as Calcium stearate SP from Faci SpA, Italy) as acid scavenger. The mixture of polymer and additives was then extruded to pellets by using a ZSK70 extruder (product of Coperion, Germany) under nitrogen atmosphere at a barrel temperature of 200-240&#xb0; C., followed by strand pelletisation after cooling in a water bath. The resulting polymer pellets were subsequently used for characterization.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0193">The procedure of Example 1 was followed except that the operation conditions in the loop reactor and the gas phase reactors were modified as shown in Table 1.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Examples 3 and 4</heading><p id="p-0202" num="0194">The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the TEA/Ti ratio was about 68 mol/mol, the TEA/DCPDMS ratio was 8 mol/mol and the catalyst feed rate was 6.1 g/h.

The very high toughness of these heterophasic copolymers both at ambient and sub-zero temperatures result from combination of high amount of xylene soluble fraction with a limited intrinsic viscosity of the amorphous copolymer.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="315pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Polymerisation conditions and some properties measured from the polymer</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Example</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>CE1</entry><entry>CE2</entry><entry>CE3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Prepol Temperature, &#xb0;
