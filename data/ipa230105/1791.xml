Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to inventive and unconventional apparatus and methods for providing vehicle information on an automatically rotatable display with haptic feedback.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A display device capable of providing various information may be installed around the driver's seat of a vehicle. The display device can provide various information about a route from a departure to a destination location current location of the vehicle, and other location-related information. In addition, the display device can display a wide variety of other information including, playing music or movies, display received terrestrial or satellite broadcasts, and provide information on the status of the vehicle or other information for user convenience or interest, such as weather and news.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Driving information is optimally displayed in a vertical orientation, so that a driver may quickly view information on the screen without turning his or her head, while entertainment media is often displayed in a horizontal orientation. A stationary display device may not be capable of providing the same ease and safety that a driver may desire while operating and controlling a vehicle, while aiso optimizing the display device for entertainment use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional vehicles, having a stationary display device, are unable to change the orientation of the display device to provide the driver or user maximum utility while driving and optimized entertainment experience while parked. For example, conventional stationary vehicle displays may play widescreen movies across the narrow dimension of a vertical screen in portrait format, leaving much of the screen unused. While conventional vehicles may provide one or more additional displays behind the driver for enjoyment of passengers in back seats, passengers in the front seats are unable to view media in its original, widescreen format, or may be unable to view the displayed media at all.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for improved methods and apparatus for rotatable vehicle information displays optimizing the display for use by the driver during vehicle operation while also optimizing the display for entertainment use by the driver and/or passengers when the vehide is stopped or parked.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to an apparatus for rotating a console display device of a vehicle.

Forces may be caused via a motor connected to touch bar <b>208</b>, or via a motor or other device connected to other components of the vehicle, such as a motor attached to a seat.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Processor <b>102</b> may optimize information displayed via a GUI by managing the use of visible areas display device <b>208</b> and touch bar <b>208</b>. In one embodiment, processor <b>102</b> may utilize a portion of display device <b>206</b> during drive mode that is not obstructed by touch bar <b>208</b> to display vehicle information, and/or may replicate an obstructed portion on a display of touch bar <b>208</b>. For example, processor <b>102</b> may optimize display device <b>208</b> to not display information in a portion of display device <b>208</b> obstructed by touch bar <b>208</b>. Additionally or alternatively, processor <b>102</b> may provide a first GUI on the display device; and provide a second GUI on a touchscreen disposed on the touch bar.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary illustration of a rotating a console display of a vehicle in a landscape orientation, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Entertainment mode, as disclosed herein, may refer to an operating mode available when the vehicle is stopped or parked. In entertainment mode, user such as a passenger or driver, may view movies, mustc videos, news, television, native and cloud based gaming, vehicle information, or other features. When the vehicle is in entertainment mode, display device <b>206</b> may have a landscape orientation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, that differs from the portrait orientation in drive mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Processor <b>102</b> may rotate information displayed on display device <b>206</b> by 90 degrees in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Further, processor <b>102</b> may reshape the information to accommodate the landscape orientation. Touch bar <b>206</b> may remain unmoved between the drive mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and the entertainment mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, touch bar <b>206</b> may move to avoid obscuring display device <b>206</b>, such as by folding underneath display device <b>206</b> or moving vertically.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Users may activate a change in orientation of display device <b>206</b> when a vehicle is stopped or parked. For example, user may send a request to processor <b>102</b> via button of touch bar <b>208</b> or GUI presented on touchscreen of touch bar <b>208</b> initiating rotation of display device <b>206</b> from portrait orientation to landscape orientation, or to return display device <b>208</b> from landscape to portrait orientation. The user request may be triggered by a long press of a button, such as a home button, for instance, or by touching a dedicated button for rotating the screen that may be disposed above a home button. In some embodiments, GUI displayed on display device <b>206</b> may provide user with the option to rotate display device <b>206</b>, such as in embodiments providing a display device without touch bar. The screen may also be rotated automatically when the vehicle is placed into park, and the vehicle may provide a user with a cancel rotation option, such as via a touch screen. Further, touch bar may include a reverse rotation button, and processor <b>102</b> may execute a rotation of the display device from the landscape orientation to the portrait orientation. Processor <b>102</b> may re-enable vehicle movement once display device <b>206</b> returns to the portrait orientation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, vehicle may engage entertainment mode when user selects entertainment mode using an option on GUI or touch bar, and the vehicle is stopped or parked. Alternatively, entertainment mode may automatically engage when the vehicle is stopped or parked and then moved or turned on, respectively. In some embodiments, processor <b>102</b> may allow user to set default orientation of display device <b>206</b> when vehicle is parked.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, processor <b>102</b> may provide message on display device <b>206</b> confirming an impending rotation movement and providing lime for user to cancel the request if desired. If user provides no request to processor <b>102</b> to cancel rotation, processor <b>102</b> may execute rotation using rotation mechanism <b>104</b>. In this manner, processor <b>102</b> may allow drivers to prevent errant inputs, such as by an animal or child, or the driver him or herself, accidentally pressing button on touch bar <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, processor <b>102</b> may prevent the vehicle from being driven while in landscape orientation by sending signal to disable vehicle movement, for instance, to vehicle control processor. Alternatively or additionally, processor <b>102</b> may receive signal that vehicle has transitioned into drive mode, and automatically return display device <b>206</b> to portrait mode. For example, a driver may enter entertainment mode while stopped in heavy traffic during construction. When traffic begins moving, driver may suddenly shift into drive and begin moving. However, doing so while display device <b>206</b> is in landscape mode may be dangerous. Therefore, processor <b>102</b> may receive signal, such as from vehicle control module or processor, indicating that gear selector of vehicle has been moved to drive mode. In response to this indication, processor <b>102</b> may automatically execute reverse rotation of display device from landscape orientation to portrait orientation. In some embodiments, processor <b>102</b> may provide delay before returning screen to portrait orientation, or may return to portrait orientation after the vehicle exceeds a certain speed. This may be beneficial in heavy stop-and-go traffic, wherein driver drives a short distance before shifting to park again, so that driver need not repeatedly enter and exit entertainment mode.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Processor <b>102</b> may utilize the entire area of display device <b>206</b> to provide entertainment to user. Processor <b>102</b> may also coordinate the interaction of first GUI on display device <b>206</b> and second GUI on screen of touch bar <b>208</b>. For instance, processor <b>102</b> may utilize first GUI to receive request from user regarding selection (e.g., movie, channel, song, music video, slide show, album, photo, video, or any other content or combination thereof), turning vehicle s engine on or off, or any other combination thereof. Processor <b>102</b> may also use second GUI to receive user input to fast-forward streaming video content or music, pause streaming video content or music, reverse streaming video content or music, or switch to drive mode. Components of first and second GUIs may be replicated, or reversed from that described herein. For example, first GUI rather than second GUI may enable switching to drive mode.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Processor <b>102</b> may also allow user to select content or take pictures based on the entertainment shown on display device <b>206</b>. The user may use one or more fingers to zoom in, zoom out, or capture a certain frame. Processor <b>102</b> may also receive inputs according to touch sequences, such as user touching once, double touching, or any other combination of touches thereof to pause, fast-forward, reverse, or slow-down the entertainment content shown Processor <b>102</b> provide haptic feedback responses via display device <b>206</b> and/or touch bar <b>208</b>, as described above, to user in vehicle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary illustration of display and touch bar in drive mode, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates front view <b>302</b> and side view <b>304</b> of display device <b>308</b> and touch bar <b>308</b>.
