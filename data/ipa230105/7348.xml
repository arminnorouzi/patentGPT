In some examples, an apparatus for subjective evaluation includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry receives scores graded by a subject to a media presentation (e.g., an immersive audio or video media presentation). The scores by the subject includes a plurality of self comparison scores that are graded to self comparison tests in the media presentation. The processing circuitry applies a first rule and a second rule to the plurality of self comparison scores. The first rule requires a first subset of the plurality of self comparison scores in a first range. The second rule requires a second subset of the plurality of self comparison scores in a second range to limit at least an outlier score in the plurality of self comparison scores to the first rule according to the second range. The processing circuitry determines that the scores of the subject are qualified for the subjective evaluation when the first rule and the second rule are satisfied.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the first rule includes a requirement that at least N1 self comparison scores are within the first range of [&#x2212;M1, M1], N1 is a first positive integer less than or equal to N-1, and N is a total number of the self comparison tests. The second rule includes a requirement that at least N2 self comparison scores are within the second range of [&#x2212;M2, M2], N2 is a second positive integer less than or equal to N, M1 and M2 each is a positive number.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the first rule includes a requirement that at least N-1 self comparison scores are within the first range of [&#x2212;M1, M1]; and the second rule includes a requirement that all N self comparison scores are within the second range of [&#x2212;M2, M2].</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the processing circuitry excludes the scores of the subject for the subjective evaluation when the plurality of self comparison scores fails at least one of the first rule and the second rule.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some examples, the scores comprises 4 self comparison scores, the first rule requires 3 out of the 4 self comparison scores in the first range, and the second rule requires the 4 self comparison scores in the second range. In an example, the first range is [&#x2212;0.5, 0.5], and the second range is [&#x2212;1.5, 1.5].</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, the first rule requires a majority (e.g., &#x3e;=50%) of the plurality of self comparison scores in the first range.

Immersive media processing can be implemented according an immersive media standard, such as Moving Picture Expert Group Immersive (MPEG-I) suite of standards, including &#x201c;immersive audio&#x201d;, &#x201c;immersive video&#x201d;, and &#x201c;systems support.&#x201d; The immersive media standard can support a VR or an AR presentation in which the user can navigate and interact with the environment using 6 degrees of freedom (6 DoF), that include spatial navigation (x, y, z) and user head orientation (yaw, pitch, roll).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a diagram illustrating an environment using 6 degrees of freedom (6 DoF) in some examples. The 6 degrees of freedom (6 DoF) can be represented by a spatial navigation (x, y, z) and a user head orientation (yaw, pitch, roll).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an aspect of the disclosure, immersive media can be used to impart the feeling that a user is actually present in the virtual world. In some examples, audio of a scene is perceived as in the real world, with sounds coming from associated visual figures. For example, sounds are perceived with the correct location and distance in the scene. Physical movement of the user in the real world is perceived as having matching movement in the scene of the virtual world. Further, the user can interact with the scene and cause sounds that are perceived as realistic and matching the user's experience in the real world.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, subjective evaluation can be used to evaluate media quality as experience by humans. In some examples, objective evaluation, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), may not correlate well with what a human perceives. The subjective evaluation emphasizes how media is perceived by humans (also referred to as subjects) and evaluates media quality based on subjects' opinions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is noted that while subjective evaluation of audio quality is used as examples in the following description of techniques for subjective evaluation, the techniques for subjective evaluation can be used in subjective evaluation of media quality of other media type, such as image, video, and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to some aspects of the disclosure, to perform subjective evaluation, subjects are selected to form a subject panel. Then, a media presentation can be performed to the subjects, the media presentation includes tests, and the subjects can grade the tests in the media presentation by scores. The scores are collected, and data processing is performed on the scores and other suitable information related to the subjective evaluations. Statistical methods can be used to analyze the scores, and media quality can be interpretated based on the statistical analysis.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the data processing, to have a reliable and consistent subjective evaluation, a qualification test, also referred to as post-screening, is conducted on subject scoring. For subjects whose scores that are not reliable, or not consistent, their scores will be excluded from subjective evaluation in some examples.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The qualification test, also referred to as a post-screening, is based on self-comparison tests in the media presentation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally, comparison tests are used compare a first media with a second media. In an example, the first media can be processed, for example, coded, rendered by a technique under evaluation, and the second media can be a reference media. During a comparison test, the first media and the second media are presented to a subject, and the subject can give a score to indicate an assessment of the quality difference.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of grade scale for comparison test. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> example, scores are ranged from &#x2212;3 to 3. Score 0 indicates that the first media and the second media are about the same quality; score &#x2212;1 indicates that the first media is slightly worse than the second media; score 1 indicates the first media is slightly better than the second media; score &#x2212;2 indicates that the first media is worse than the second media; score 2 indicates the first media is better than the second media; score &#x2212;3 indicates that the first media is much worse than the second media; score 3 indicates the first media is much better than the second media.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is noted that while the scores in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> example are integers, non integer numbers can be used as scores. In some examples, a minimum change unit in scores is 0.5. For example, following scores can be used to grade the comparison tests: 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0, &#x2212;0.5, &#x2212;1, &#x2212;1.5, &#x2212;2, &#x2212;2.5, &#x2212;3. The score of a comparison test is also referred to as score difference in some examples.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to an aspect of the disclosure, during presentation of comparison tests to a subject, self comparison tests (also referred to as self comparison trials) can be mixed with regular comparison tests without informing the subject, and scores collected from the self comparison tests can be used for post screening. When presenting a self comparison test, the first media and the second media are of the same media, such as processed by same codec, same render and the like. Thus, large values (e.g., large absolute values) in the scores graded by a subject to the self comparison tests may indicate scores of the subject are not reliable, or not consistent for subjective evaluation. A score for a self comparison test is referred to as a self comparison score in some examples.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, a listener (subject for audio quality evaluation)'s file for audio playback (audio presentation) includes 4 self comparison tests in addition to other tests. During the audio playback according to the listener's file, the listener grades all the tests by scores. After the audio playback, the scores by the subject to all the tests are collected, and scores of the 4 self comparison tests are used in post screening to determine whether the scores by the listener can be used for further data analysis and media evaluation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a related example, a rule is applied in the post screening based on scores of self comparison tests of a subject. The rule specifies qualification of subjects whose scores can be used for further data analysis and media evaluation. Specifically, when at least 3 out of 4 self comparison scores are within the score difference range from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5 ([&#x2212;0.5,0.5]), the scores by the subject are retained and used in further media evaluation. If two or more scores are out of the score difference range from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5 ([&#x2212;0.5,0.5]), the scores by the subject are excluded from further data analysis and media evaluation, in some examples.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the related example, the post-screening is capable of excluding a subject who has 2 (out of 4) or more self-comparison scores that are outside the score difference range from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5 ([&#x2212;0.5,0.5]). However, some subjects that would pass the post-screening with 3 self comparison scores within the score different range from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5 ([&#x2212;0.5,0.5]), but one self comparison score as high as 3.0 or as low as &#x2212;3.0. Due to the high variation, scores by such subjects cannot be considered as reliable in some examples, and may need to excluded from the subjective evaluation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Aspects of the disclosure provide multi-rule techniques for post-screening, and enhance score reliability for subjective evaluation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some aspects of the disclosure, two rules can be applied in the post screening based on scores of self comparison tests by a subject. The first rule specifies qualification of subjects based on a majority of the self comparison scores (e.g., over 50% of the self comparison scores), and the second rule specifies qualification of subjects based on outliers (self comparison scores outside of the first range) in the self comparison scores. When self comparison scores of a subject satisfy both rules, then the scores by the subject can be used in further data analysis and media evaluation. When self comparison scores by a subject fails at least one of the two rules, then the scores by the subject are excluded from further data analysis and media evaluation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an aspect of the disclosure, the first rule limits the majority of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject (subject whose scores are qualified for further data analysis and media evaluation after post screening) in a narrow range, and the second rule limits outliers of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject not having too much variation from the majority of the self comparison scores.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the first rule can be expressed as: at least 3 (out of 4) self comparison scores are within a score difference range, e.g., from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5 ([&#x2212;0.5,0.5]); and the second rule can be expressed as all 4 self comparison scores are within another score difference range, e.g., from &#x2212;1.5 to 1.5 ([&#x2212;1.5,1.5]). In this example, the majority of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject (subject whose scores are qualified for further data analysis and media evaluation after post screening) is limited in a narrow range (e.g., from &#x2212;0.5 to 0.5), denoted by [&#x2212;Vmajority, Vmajority], (Vmajority is a positive number, such as 0.5). The outliers of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject are limited not having too much variation from the majority of the self comparison scores, such as limited in a range of [&#x2212;3&#xd7;Vmajority, 3&#xd7;Vmajority]).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the above example, when a self comparison score by a subject is out of the first range (e.g., [&#x2212;0.5,0.5]), the self comparison score is referred to as an outlier self comparison score. When the outlier self comparison score has too much variation (e.g., outside [&#x2212;1.5, 1.5])), scores by the subject is excluded from further data analysis and media evaluation. With the above two rules in post-screening, all 4 self comparison are constrained in a given score range, such that there will be no high self comparison difference score, such as 3.0 or low self comparison score such as &#x2212;3.0. Thus, those subjects with high self comparison score or low self comparison score, (even though may have only one high self comparison score or low self comparison score), will be excluded from subjective evaluation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, a post screening is based on N self comparison scores, and N is a positive number. The post screening uses two rules based on the N self comparison scores. The first rule can be expressed as: at least N-1 self comparison scores are within a score difference range, such as [&#x2212;M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>]; and the second rule can be expressed as all N self comparison scores are within another score difference range, such as [&#x2212;M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>], where M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2 </sub>are positive numbers, and M<sub>2 </sub>can be greater than or equal to M<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In above examples, the majority of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject (subject whose scores are qualified for further data analysis and media evaluation after post screening) is limited in a narrow range (e.g., from [&#x2212;M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>]), and outliers (e.g., self comparison scores outside of [&#x2212;M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>]) of the self comparison scores of a qualified subject are limited not having too much variation from the majority of the self comparison scores, such as limited in the range [&#x2212;M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>].</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, a post screening is based on N self comparison scores, and N is a positive number. The post screening uses two rules based on the N self comparison scores.

The second rule can be expressed as at least N<sub>2 </sub>self-comparison scores are within another score difference range, such as [&#x2212;M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>], where N<sub>2 </sub>is a positive integer that is less than or equal to N, M<sub>2 </sub>is a positive number, and M<sub>2 </sub>can be greater than or equal to M<sub>1</sub>.

The process (<b>300</b>) can be used in a subjective evaluation.
