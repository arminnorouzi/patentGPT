For example, torques in a bottom bracket (crank bearing) of an e-bike can be determined based on a magnetized shaft of the bottom bracket as the primary sensor and one or more associated magnetic field sensors near the surface of the shaft as the secondary sensor, as described, for example, in EP 3 050 790 B1. Both the primary as well as the secondary sensor are provided within the bottom bracket. The measurement is effected in a contactless manner. Due to the (inverse) magnetostrictive effect, a magnetic field is generated outside the magnetized shaft when a torque is applied and is dependent on the torque currently applied, because the shear and torsional forces acting in the shaft depend thereupon. A measuring circuit comprising the secondary sensor determines the effective torque based on the size of the magnetic field generated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in view of the typically small space available in such bottom brackets, in particular in the context of and electric motor driving in assisted operation and its coupling to the bottom bracket, this solution is structurally very complex or not implemented in a satisfactory manner with regard to the accuracy of the torque measurement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another field in which torque is measured with limited space is the field of robotics, as described, for example, in EP 3 232 172 B1. Here as well, the measurement of the torque with magnetized shafts and associated magnetic field sensors in part requires a great structural effort.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object underlying the invention is to overcome the drawbacks mentioned at least in part.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is satisfied by a torque sensor according to claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The torque sensor according to the present invention comprises a disk comprising a magnetostrictive, magnetically biased, or magnetizable material; and a magnetic field sensor assembly; where a torque acting about an axis of rotation of the disk can be applied to the disk and the magnetostrictive material is configured to generate a magnetic field outside the disk that changes depending on the acting torque; where the magnetic field sensor assembly is configured to output a signal based on the magnetic field generated by the magnetostrictive material; and where the torque sensor is configured to determine a value of the acting torque based on the signal that is output.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention, a disk, which acts as an element transmitting forces, is used to measure the torque applied in that the disk is magnetically biased (i.e., in particular before it is installed in a drive). In this way, the disk and not a shaft on which the disk can be arranged is used as the primary sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This has the structural advantage that the magnetic field sensor assembly (and any associated electronics that may be necessary) does not have to be arranged on the shaft but can be provided outside of the drive (for example, bottom bracket). Due to the reason that the surface of the magnetized component can then be effectively rotated by 90&#xb0;, other spatial options for providing the magnetic field sensor assembly arise.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the alternative in which the disk comprises a magnetically biased material, permanent magnetization of magnetostrictive material of the disk is given.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the alternative, in which the disk comprises a magnetizable material, a magnetization assembly can furthermore be provided for magnetizing the magnetostrictive magnetizable material over a limited period of time so that the magnetic field, which changes depending on the acting torque, can be generated outside of the disk with the magnetostrictive and thus magnetized material. This therefore provides active magnetization when torque sensing, the material need not be magnetically biased.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The disk is rotatable about an axis of rotation. The magnetic field sensor assembly can be arranged to be co-rotatable synchronously with the disk, in particular can be connected thereto in a rotationally fixedly manner. This further development has the advantage that the magnetic field sensors co-rotate with the magnetization and can directly detect changes due to a change in torque. This is particularly advantageous in the case of radially magnetized connection regions between an inner and an outer region of the disk, because the shearing forces and the resulting magnetic fields arise in the connection region(s). Alternatively or additionally, the magnetization assembly can be arranged to be co-rotatable synchronously with the disk, in particular can be connected thereto in a rotationally fixed manner.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As an alternative thereto, the magnetic field sensor assembly can be arranged to be independent of a rotation of the rotatable disk. This is particularly suitable for solid disks whose shearing forces (and therefore also the magnetic fields generated) do depend on the radial distance from the axis of rotation, but are substantially constant with a constant radius in the direction of rotation. Alternatively or additionally, the magnetization assembly can be arranged to be independent of a rotation of the rotatable disk.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another further development, the magnetic field sensor assembly can comprise at least one electric coil and/or at least one AMR sensor. In particular, one or more electrical (measuring) coils or one or more AMR sensors in electronic measuring equipment are suitable for detecting the magnetic field or its change, respectively. AMR sensors are based on the anisotropic magnetoresistive effect.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inner region, the outer region, and the at least one connection region can be formed integrally. The disk can therefore be produced as a blank, for example, from a solid disk made of metal. This blank can be given its final shape by machining steps such as drilling.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The at least one connection region can comprise connection elements and/or spokes and/or struts. In the event that the inner region, the outer region, and the at least one connection region are formed integrally, free spaces (recesses in the solid disk) are provided between the connection elements and/or the spokes and/or the struts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A driving force can be applied at the inner region, whereby the inner region acts as a driving region and the outer region acts as a driven region. Alternatively, a driving force can be applied at the outer region, whereby the outer region acts as the driving region and the inner region to act as the driven region.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this case, the inner region can comprise a first coupling device for coupling to a drive element and the outer region can comprise a second coupling device for coupling to a driven element; or the inner region can comprise first a coupling device for coupling to a driven element and the outer region can comprise a second coupling device for coupling to a drive element.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A drive bearing, in particular a bottom bracket, according to the present invention comprises a torque sensor according to the invention, where a chainring carrier or crank star of the drive bearing is formed as the disk of the torque sensor. The magnetic field sensor assembly can be provided in relation to a bottom bracket casing on an inner side or an outer side of the disk.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A device with such a drive bearing can be an ergometer, an e-bike, a bicycle or a motorcycle</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A robotic device according to the present invention comprises a torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention further provides a method with which a disk for use in a torque sensor according to the invention can be magnetized. In particular, the disk can be a part of a drive device that is needed anyhow. Magnetization can give the disk an additional function in a torque sensor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method for magnetizing a disk comprising a magnetostrictive material comprises at least the following steps: conducting an electrical current from a connection region, provided between an inner region which with respect to an axis of rotation is in proximity to the axis and an outer region of the disk which is remote from the axis, to the inner region and/or the outer region; and/or conducting an electrical current from a first side of the disk to an axially opposite second side of the disk. However, the current can also be conducted from the inner region via the connection region to the outer region, or alternatively in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this case, the current can be introduced at one or more points of the disk, and the current can exit at one or more points of the disk.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A further development is that contact points of a power generating device contact the disk from one of the two sides of the disk or where contact points of the power generating device contact the disk in pairs on oppositely disposed sides.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention further provides a method for measuring torque. The method comprises the steps of: providing a disk which is rotatable about an axis of rotation and comprises a magnetized magnetostrictive material; applying a torque that acts about the axis of rotation to the disk; generating a magnetic field outside the disk with the magnetostrictive material, where the magnetic field generated varies in dependence of the acting torque; outputting a signal with a magnetic field sensor assembly based on the magnetic field generated; and determining a value of the acting torque based on the signal that is output. In the case of a magnetizable magnetostrictive material, the following further step is performed prior to applying the torque that acts about the axis of rotation to the disk: magnetizing the magnetizable magnetostrictive material for a limited period of time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The advantages of the method according to the invention correspond to those that were mentioned in relation to the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further features and exemplary embodiments as well as advantages of the present invention shall be illustrated below using the figures. It is understood that the embodiments do not exhaust the scope of the present invention. It is further understood that some or all features described hereafter can also be combined with each other in different ways.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b></figref> B show a first embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a second embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> show a third embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> show a fourth embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate contacting the disk for magnetization.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show a first embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a first variant of the first embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a second variant of the first embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Torque sensor <b>100</b> according to the invention comprises a disk <b>110</b> comprising a magnetostrictive material <b>120</b> and a magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b>. A torque acting about an axis of rotation A of disk <b>110</b> can be applied to disk <b>110</b> and magnetostrictive material <b>120</b> is configured to generate a magnetic field B outside disk <b>110</b> that can be changed in dependence of the acting torque; where magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> is configured to output a signal S based on the magnetic field B generated. Torque sensor <b>100</b> uses output signal S to determine a value of the acting torque, for example, by way of a control or evaluation unit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the variant according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, magnetostrictive material <b>120</b> is magnetically biased. An example of magnetostrictive material is iron or iron alloys, steel, etc.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> can comprise one or more measuring coils or one or more AMR sensors for detecting magnetic field B. Magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> is shown there to be stationary, i.e. it is not intended to be rotatable about axis A together with disk <b>110</b>. This makes sense if, for a given torque, magnetic field B at the location of magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> changes within a rotation about axis A at most in such a way that this is not essential when determining the torque. In certain applications, it can also be possible to average the magnetic field over an entire revolution of the disk.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">AMR sensors are advantageous in that magnetic fields can be measured in at least one or more directions; measurements can also be taken, in particular, in the three spatial axes and the magnetic field can be recorded in <b>3</b>D. One, two, or three components of the magnetic field can be used to determine the torque.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Compared to the variant according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a magnetization assembly <b>160</b> can additionally be provided in the variant according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> for magnetizing the magnetostrictive magnetizable material over a limited period of time so that magnetic field B, which can be changed as a function of the effective torque, can be generated outside of disk <b>110</b> with magnetostrictive and thereby with magnetization assembly <b>160</b>. A control or evaluation unit can send a respective signal M to magnetization assembly <b>160</b> in order to activate magnetization assembly <b>160</b> and thereby generate a magnetic field that in turn magnetizes the disk or the magnetostrictive material, respectively. In this case, this is active generation of a magnetic field in the disk during the detection/measurement of the torque. In this case, the magnetization is not permanent, but is only generated for a certain period of time by way of magnetization assembly <b>160</b> during a respective measurement of the torque. Such active measurement is also described, for example, in EP 1 920 221 A1/B1.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a second embodiment of the torque sensor according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The only difference from the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> is that magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> co-rotates synchronously with disk <b>110</b>. For this purpose, magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> can be arranged, for example, on a carrier element <b>151</b> which in turn is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to disk <b>110</b> and therefore co-rotates together with disk <b>110</b>. As a result, the magnetic field is always detected by magnetic field sensor assembly <b>150</b> at the same point on disk <b>110</b>.
