In a video recording or photographing process, because the user's hand shakes or another external factor causes an electronic device to shake in the photographing process, a photographed image is unclear, and image quality is affected. To resolve this technical problem, an electronic device with an image stabilization function emerges.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the conventional technology, the electronic device includes a camera module. The camera module includes an image stabilization motor and a lens. The lens is mounted on the image stabilization motor by using a spring plate. In the conventional technology, a value of an image stabilization angle of the lens depends on rigidity of the spring plate. When the rigidity of the spring plate is small, large-angle image stabilization may be performed, but a posture difference of the image stabilization motor is large. When the rigidity of the spring plate is large, the posture difference of the image stabilization motor is small. However, when large-angle image stabilization is performed in this case, large motor thrust force is required. The posture difference of the image stabilization motor refers to differences in a movement track and a direction of the image stabilization motor obtained when a center of gravity location of the image stabilization motor changes in different photographing postures of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the camera module in the conventional technology cannot meet shake suppression in many scenarios.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides an image stabilization motor, a camera module, and an electronic device, to implement rotation of a lens in a large angle range, so that the camera module is applicable to more application scenarios.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of this application provides an image stabilization motor, including:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a lens carrier, configured to mount a lens;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a sensing component, where the sensing component is fastened on the lens carrier;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a base;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a bearing assembly mounted on the base; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a driving component, where the driving component is fastened on the base, where</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the driving component cooperates with the sensing component, so that the lens carrier can rotate around the bearing assembly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the image stabilization motor provided in this application, the bearing assembly is disposed, so that the lens carrier needs to overcome only friction force between the lens carrier and the bearing assembly in an entire rotation process.
