id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Closed disposable seeding systems with improved seeding chambers permitting uniform seeding of a scaffold or graft with patient's cells are provided. The seeding chambers with a variable width along the length of the chamber, or a minimal gap between the scaffold and chamber wall, provide an improvement of the prior seeding chambers of closed disposable seeding systems by providing faster and more efficient and uniform seeding of the grafts and scaffolds. Also described are scaffolds with biomechanical and structural properties permitting spontaneous reversal of stenosis and neotissue formation as the graft degrades yielding a scaffold-free neovessel.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="74.08mm" wi="34.88mm" file="US20230002709A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

A common example of such an application is the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) for single ventricle anomalies. In some instances, the use of these synthetic grafts as scaffolds is complicated by progressive obstruction, susceptibility to infection, and risk of thromboembolic complications. In all instances, a significant limitation to cardiovascular reconstruction is lack of growth potential of synthetic implants. For TCPC, this may lead to sub-optimal management strategies including either postponement of completion of the Fontan circulation because of patient size, or over-sizing of scaffolds, which results in sub-optimal flow characteristics such as expiratory phase back-flow and regions of flow stagnation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) offer the potential to overcome these problems by providing a biodegradable scaffold in which autologous cells proliferate and mature into a physiologically functional blood vessel as scaffold polymers degrade (Shin'oka, et al. <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>344(7), 532-533 (2001); Hibino, et al. <i>J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. </i>139(2), 431-436.e432 (2010 Roh J D, et al. <i>Biomaterials. </i>29(10), 1454-1463 (2008); Hibino, et al. <i>FASEB J. </i>25(8), 2731-2739 (2011); Hibino, et al. <i>FASEB J. </i>25(12), 4253-4263 (2011); Kurobe, et al. <i>Tissue Eng Part C Methods </i>21(1), 88-93 (2015)).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Clinical trials in humans confirmed the growth capacity of the TEVG and demonstrated no graft related deaths or graft failures (Shin&#x2032;oka, et al. <i>J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. </i>129(6), 1330-1338 (2005)). However, the results of this study also demonstrated that stenosis was the primary graft-related complication, effecting nearly 25% of graft recipients, with 16% of recipients developing critical stenosis (&#x3e;75% decrease in luminal diameter) (Hibino, et al. <i>J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. </i>139(2), 431-436.e432 (2010)). Despite promising results using TEVGs for the treatment of patients with congenital heart diseases, the high incidence of graft stenosis in clinical applications hinders wide spread use of this technology (Fernandez, et al. <i>Current opinion in chemical engineering </i>3, 83-90 (2014); Mcallister, et al. <i>Lancet </i>373(9673), 1440-1446 (2009); Wystrychowski, et al. <i>J Vasc Surg </i>60(5), 1353-1357 (2014)).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, before routine clinical use of the TEVGs can be recommended, the assembly of the TEVG must be optimized to personalize the grafts and minimize the time required to make the graft and improve its overall utility (Patterson, et al. <i>Regenerative Medicine </i>7(3), 409-419 (2012)).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat.

The CDSS includes seeding chambers for housing and seeding the scaffolds and grafts with cells. The seeding of scaffolds and grafts using the CDSS of U.S. Pat.

Improved seeding chambers for use in a closed disposable seeding system have been developed which provide a uniform density of cells seeded along the length of the scaffold or graft. The cell seeding chambers, termed &#x201c;flip&#x201d; chamber and &#x201c;capacitor&#x201d; chamber, have a cap with lateral ports. The flip chamber typically has a variable width along its length. The flip chamber may be operated by flipping the seeding chamber about half-way (180&#xb0;) during the seeding. The capacitor chamber typically has a uniform width along its length and a narrow gap between the scaffold and the chamber wall.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cell seeding chambers generally include a housing, a cap with one or more lateral ports, and a base. The cap typically has an opening for a suction rod insertable into the housing, and a mandrel positioned over the suction rod.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The cap may include one or more lateral tubes, each connecting to a lateral port. The lateral tubes typically include a lateral inlet tube connecting to a lateral inlet port, a lateral outlet tube connecting to a lateral outlet port, and a lateral went tube connected to a lateral vent port. The cap typically has a superior smooth surface and an inferior threaded surface. The threaded surface secures the cap onto the housing. The top portion of the cap is generally flat, and the cap may serve as a base if the chamber is inverted.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mandrel is typically a perforated, porous mandrel. Alternatively or additionally, the mandrel may have protrusions of any suitable arrangements, such as axially arranged protrusions running in parallel to one another, spiraling down, arranged in a diamond pattern, in circles, in zig-zags, and/or waves.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The housing of the cell seeding chamber may have a uniform or a variable width, along its length. The cell seeding chamber may have a gap between about 1 mm and about 30 mm, more preferably between about 3 mm and 20 mm, between the suction rod or the mandrel and the housing for the flip chamber. The cell seeding chamber may have a gap between about 1 mm and about 10 mm, more preferably between about 1 mm and 5 mm between the suction rod or the mandrel and the housing for the capacitor. The housing may have a region with the greatest width positioned between about 30% and 60% of the length of the housing. For example, the region with the greatest width may be positioned at about 50% (half way) along the length of the housing. The housing typically has a threaded portion for receiving the threaded surface of the cap. The &#x2018;Flip&#x2019; seeding chamber eliminates the variability of the distribution of MNCs on the scaffold. The central premise behind the device is to vary the cross section of the seeding chamber along its length. The shape of the chamber resembles that of the inverse of an hour glass, with a bulge (greatest cross section) approximately 40% of the way down the height of the device. Both the top and the bottom of the device narrow to accommodate the mandrel with the scaffold mounted to it, along with a very minimal volume for part clearance and excess liquid. The effect of the change in cross section is that it effectively slows the speed at which the MNCs are drawn through the least seeded portions of the scaffold.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also provided are methods for uniformly seeding a graft or scaffold with cells. In some aspects, the method includes the steps of a) connecting a seeding chamber to a closed disposable seeding system containing a vessel with fluid having blood or enriched cells, b) inserting a graft or scaffold over the mandrel of the seeding chamber, c) filling the seeding chamber with the fluid to about half way of graft or scaffold by gravity flow and bleeding air, d) filing the seeding chamber with the fluid to cover the graft or scaffold, and e) introducing negative pressure to draw all the fluid through the graft or scaffold.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other aspects, the method includes the steps of: a) connecting a seeding chamber to a closed disposable seeding system containing a vessel with fluid having blood or enriched cells, b) inserting a graft or scaffold over the mandrel of the seeding chamber, c) filling the seeding chamber with the fluid, d) applying negative pressure to lower mandrel outlet and emptying the chamber to about half way, e) inverting the chamber, and f) applying negative pressure and emptying the chamber through an upper outlet port.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, the seeding chamber is connected to the closed disposable seeding system via the lateral inlet port and the lateral outlet port. The negative pressure may be provided by a syringe, a pump, or a vacuum source. Typically, the graft or the scaffold is uniformly seeded using a minimal volume of a cell-containing fluid, such as a volume between about 10 ml and 200 ml, preferably between 10 ml and 150 ml, of blood, bone marrow aspirate, or mononuclear cell (MNC)-enriched fluid.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary closed system (<b>1000</b>) for seeding and/or testing cells and/or grafts, e.g., tissue grafts as described in U.S. Pat.

Organic polymers may be natural (e.g., polysaccharides, such as starch, cellulose, pectin, seaweed gums, vegetable gums; polypeptides, such as casein, albumin, globulin, keratin, collagen, nucleic acid, and hydrocarbons), synthetic (such as thermoplastics, unvulcanized elastomers, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, linear polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyurethane, acrylate resins); thermosetting (e.g., vulcanized elastomers, crosslinked polyethylene, phenolics, alkyds, polyesters), and semisynthetic (e.g., cellulosics, such as rayon, methylcellulose, cellulose acetate; and modified starches)). In addition, useful scaffolds may include hydrogels formed from water soluble or water insoluble cellulose compounds. As would be readily understood by the skilled artisan, the particular type and composition of scaffold will vary depending upon the desired application. However, it is generally preferred that the polymeric material in the scaffold be biocompatible (i.e., will not elicit an unwanted immune reaction). In certain embodiments, the scaffold is biodegradable. Exemplary degradable polymers include poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid), poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(orthoesters), poly(phosphazenes), polycaprolactones, or polyamides. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer is poly(lactic acid-glycolic acid).

Additional Active Agents</p><p id="p-0123" num="0147">It has been established that TEVG seeded with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells reduce and prevent the incidence of post-operative stenosis via a paracrine effect. Advantages of cell seeding include the release signals in response to the body's feedback mechanism, unlike the drug-eluting scaffolds which release the drug regardless of feedback.

The chamber is filled, a negative pressure is applied, the chamber has 50% of the volume drained (at which point the bottom &#x2dc;50% of the scaffold is saturated with mononuclear cells (MNCs)), the negative pressure is interrupted, the device is inverted, and the negative pressure is re-introduced, allowing the remaining 50% of the volume to be drawn through the &#x201c;upper&#x201d; half of the scaffold, which then also becomes saturated with MNCs. Therefore, the bottom and top halves of the scaffold saturate sequentially, resulting in a completely saturated scaffold with minimal MNC loss (high seeding efficiency).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0170">The negative pressure may be provided by a syringe, pump, or vacuum source.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0171">2. Capacitor Seeding Chamber</p><p id="p-0148" num="0172">Methods of using the capacitor seeding chamber include the following steps. The mandrel and scaffold assembly are carefully placed into the seeding chamber. The seeding chamber is very narrow as compared to the assembled mandrel/scaffold assembly. It is designed to hold a minimum volume of MNC solution. The cell seeding chamber may have a gap between about 1 mm and about 10 mm, more preferably between about 1 mm and 5 mm between the between the suction rod or the mandrel and the housing.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0173">After the mandrel and chamber are secured together, the MNCs are introduced into the device. The fluid quickly fills the chamber and &#x201c;overflows&#x201d; into an IV bag located above the chamber. After the entire volume of MNCs have been introduced into both the seeding chamber and overflow (capacitor) IV bag, a negative pressure is applied. The MNC fluid begins to pass through the scaffold, and the entire scaffold remains submerged in MNCs as the fluid level is lowered in the IV bag. It is not until the very end of the seeding process that the fluid is completely drained from the IV bag and the fluid level eventually falls below the top of the seeding device. There is only a very small amount of time in which the fluid is drained from the top of the scaffold exposing the scaffold to filtered air while the bottom of the scaffold remains submerged. Thus, the top and bottom of the scaffold remained submerged throughout the majority of the seeding process. Only for a small fraction of the MNC solution is the top exposed while the bottom is submerged. Therefore, the seeding gradient is minimized along the length of the scaffold.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0174">The negative pressure may be provided by a syringe, pump, or vacuum source.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0175">B. Methods of Using Grafts or Scaffolds</p><p id="p-0152" num="0176">It has been established that the cell-seeding dose on tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) is an effect-dependent variable for improving the performance and utility of the graft, regardless of cell incubation time. Typically, TEVGs are seeded with cells prior to implanting into a subject. Typically, the cells are autologous cells from the intended recipient, and the methods of seeding can include the step of harvesting the cells from the recipient. One or more cell types can be isolated from a mixture of cells using any techniques known in the art. Therefore, the methods can also include the step of isolating or purifying the cells prior to application (i.e., seeding).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0177">Seeding of TEVG with cells is carried out using a kit or device, such as the closed disposable seeding system. The closed disposable seeding system may include any one of flip seeding chamber or capacitor seeding chamber for seeding the cells onto the graft or scaffold. Preferably, the kit or device enables sterile and efficient seeding of TEVG with a controllable amount of cells.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0178">1. Methods of Use of TEVGs Seeded with Cells</p><p id="p-0155" num="0179">TEVGs seeded with cells can reduce or prevent the rate of post-operative stenosis of the TEVG, relative to the rate of stenosis in the equivalent TEVG in the absence of cells. Therefore, TEVGs can be seeded with an effective amount of cells to reduce or prevent one or more of the immune processes associated with development of post-operative stenosis, including inflammation.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0180">Tissue repair has four distinct stages, including: a) clotting/coagulation; b) inflammation; c) fibroblast migration/proliferation; and d) a final remodeling phase where normal tissue architecture is restored. In the earliest stages after tissue damage, epithelial cells and/or endothelial cells release inflammatory mediators that initiate an antifibrinolytic-coagulation cascade that triggers clotting and development of a provisional extracellular matrix (ECM). Aggregation and subsequent degranulation of platelets promotes blood vessel dilation and increased permeability, allowing efficient recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils to the damaged tissue. Neutrophils are the most abundant inflammatory cell at the earliest stages of wound healing, but are quickly replaced by macrophages after neutrophil degranulation. Activated macrophages and neutrophils debride the wound, eliminate any invading organisms and produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines that amplify the inflammatory response as well as trigger fibroblast proliferation and recruitment. Upon activation, fibroblasts transform into myofibroblasts that secrete &#x3b1;-smooth muscle actin and ECM components. Finally, in the remodeling phase epithelial/endothelial cells divide and migrate over the temporary matrix to regenerate the damaged tissue. Thus, healing and neotissue generation is a finely regulated process that balances the need to regenerate tissue and thicken blood vessel walls, without excessive thickening and stenosis or fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0181">a. Macrophages</p><p id="p-0158" num="0182">It has been shown that the presence of circulating monocytes and infiltrating macrophages is critical for wound healing and neotissue development (Arras, et al., <i>J Clin Invest, </i>101(1): 40-50 (1998)). However, the extent of macrophage infiltration at a site of tissue damage has also been correlated with proliferative dysregulation and neointima formation (Hibino, et al., <i>FASEB J. </i>25(12):4253-63 (2011)). Further, numerous studies have indicated that macrophages and fibroblasts are the main effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (reviewed in Wynn, <i>Nat Rev Immunol. </i>4(8):583-94 (2004)).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0183">Following vascular damage, inflammatory monocyte cells (CD16-hi, CD64-hi and CD14-hi in humans; CD115+, CD11b+ and Ly6c-hi in mice) are recruited to the damaged tissue and differentiate into activated macrophages (Emr1-hi in humans; F4/80-hi in mice) upon exposure to local growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbial compounds (Geissmann et al., <i>Science </i>327: 656-661 (2010)). Excessive macrophage infiltration results in stenosis, whilst complete inhibition of macrophage infiltration prevents neotissue formation (Hibino, et al., <i>FASEB J. </i>25(12):4253-63 (2011).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0184">Two distinct states of polarized activation for macrophages have been defined: the classically activated (M1) macrophage phenotype and the alternatively activated (M2) macrophage phenotype (Gordon and Taylor, <i>Nat. Rev. Immunol. </i>5: 953-964 (2005); Mantovani et al., <i>Trends Immunol. </i>23: 549-555 (2002)). The role of the classically activated (M1) macrophage is an effector cell in TH1 cellular immune responses, whereas the alternatively activated (M2) macrophage appears to be involved in immunosuppression and wound healing/tissue repair. M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct chemokine and chemokine receptor profiles, with M1 secreting the TH1 cell-attracting chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and with M2 macrophages expressing chemokines CCL17, CCL22 and CCL24.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0185">The presence of M2 macrophages has been associated with neo-intima development and stenosis (Hibino, et al., <i>FASEB J. </i>25(12):4253-63 (2011)). The correlation between the extent of macrophage infiltration, neotissue formation and stenosis at certain time points following tissue graft implantation provides means to prevent stenosis through modulation of macrophage activity.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0186">Further, macrophages are typically located close to collagen-producing myofibroblast cells, and it has been shown that monocyte-derived macrophages critically perpetuate inflammatory responses after injury as a prerequisite for fibrosis (Wynn and Barron, <i>Semin Liver Dis., </i>30(3):245-257 (2010)). Macrophages produce pro-fibrotic mediators that activate fibroblasts, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B). Specifically, a marked increase of the non-classical M2 (CD14+, CD16+) subset of macrophages has been correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and clinical progression in patients suffering from chronic liver disease. During fibrosis progression, monocyte-derived macrophages release cytokines perpetuating chronic inflammation as well as directly activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), resulting in their proliferation and trans-differentiation into collagen-producing myofibroblasts (Zimmermann, et al., <i>PLOS One, </i>5(6):e11049 (2010)).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0187">b. Platelets</p><p id="p-0164" num="0188">Aggregated platelets assist the repair of blood vessels by secreting chemicals that attract fibroblasts from surrounding connective tissue into the wounded area to heal the wound or, in the case of dysregulated inflammatory responses, form scar tissue. In response to tissue injury, platelets become activated and release a multitude of growth factors which stimulate the deposition of extracellular matrix, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, as well as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x3b2;). Both of these growth factors have been shown to play a significant role in the repair and regeneration of connective tissues. PDGF functions as a primary mitogen and chemo-attractant which significantly augments the influx of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, as well as stimulating cell proliferation and gene expression. PDGF enables leukocytes to firmly attach to the vessel wall and finally to transmigrate into the subendothelial tissue. However, the platelet-derived chemokines are also known to induce smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and play a role in neointimal proliferation and organ fibrosis (Chandrasekar, et al., <i>J Am College Cardiology, Vol </i>35, No. 3, pp. 555-562 (2000)). Increased expression of PDGF and its receptors is associated with scleroderma lung and skin tissue. Specifically, there is evidence for an autocrine PDGF-receptor mediated signaling loop in scleroderma lung and skin fibroblasts, implicating both TGF-&#x3b2; and PDGF pathways in chronic fibrosis in scleroderma (Trojanowska, <i>Rheumatology; </i>47:v2-v4 (2008)). In addition, deregulation of PDGF signaling is associated with cardiovascular indications such as pulmonary hypertension, and atherosclerosis.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0189">Media layer smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration in response to injury-induced PDGF are essential events contributing to neointimal thickening (Fingerle, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci., 86:8412 (1989); Clowes, et al., Circ. Res., 56:139-145 (1985)) which eventually leads to blood vessel narrowing and stenosis.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0190">Other healing-associated growth factors released by platelets include basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor <b>1</b>, platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0191">The TEVGs can be seeded with an effective amount of cells to create a pro-regenerative immune environment that enhances wound healing and prevents stenosis. The TEVG can also be seeded with an effective amount of cells to modulate platelet activity and function. Thus, the TEVG can also be seeded with an effective amount of cells to reduce or prevent the biological functions of platelets, such as platelet aggregation and the production/expression of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0192">Methods of using the tissue engineering vascular grafts seeded with cells to reduce post-operative stenosis of the graft include surgically implanting, or otherwise administering, the cell-seeded grafts to within a patient. Typically, the method of implanting includes attaching the graft to a section of an artery that is to be replaced or augmented. Methods of attaching vascular grafts are known in the art. The methods typically reduce or inhibit the infiltration of macrophage cells, or the conversion of macrophage cells from M1 to M2 phenotype, or both, compared to a control, such as an equivalent graft that is not seeded with cells, or seeded with fewer cells. In some embodiments, the methods reduce or inhibit proliferation of macrophage cells without reducing or inhibiting vascular neotissue development. A subject can have stenosis, restenosis or other vascular proliferation disorders, or be identified as being at risk for restenosis or other vascular proliferation disorders, for example subjects who have undergone, are undergoing, or will undergo a vascular trauma, angioplasty, surgery, or transplantation arteriopathy, etc. Any of the methods described can include the step of identifying a subject in need of treatment.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0193">The present invention will be further understood by reference to the following non-limiting examples.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 1.

Diameter and thickness were normalized by the original values for the implanted TEVG scaffold; normalized diameter compliance was calculated as the change in diameter for a 50% increase in pressure from the homeostatic pressure normalized by the original graft diameter. The depicted parameters (see Table 1) were chosen to capture a broad range of potential physiologic outcomes based on pilot simulations.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Inflammatory parameters tested.</entry></row><row><entry><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.46mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230002709A1-20230105-P00899.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> .

this study was to test a computationally generated output, that is, to quantify the natural history of neotissue formation and thus neovessel development over 1 year in an established IVC interposition TEVG model. Seeded TEVGs were implanted in 24 lambs, and in vivo data were collected via serial angiography and intravascular ultrasound at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. The 1-week time point was used for baseline anatomic information; it provided comparable data to the immediate post-operative period, but allowed the animal to recover from the initial surgical insult and decreased the risk associated with the prolonged anesthesia needed to perform the implantation surgery and an initial catheterization during the same period. Pilot data demonstrated significant stenosis at 6 weeks, consistent with computational predictions, and the later times were chosen to monitor graft performance over the long term. The primary endpoint was the narrowest cross-sectional area of the graft on intravascular ultrasound imaging at each time. No data were excluded from the study.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0259">Large Animal Scaffold</p><p id="p-0235" num="0260">TEVG scaffolds were provided by Gunze Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and were identical to those used in clinical trial: knitted PGA core with a 50:50 co-polymer sealant of PCLA.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0261">Bone Marrow Aspiration, Assembly, and Implantation of the TEVG</p><p id="p-0237" num="0262">Twenty-four juvenile lambs underwent bone marrow aspiration (5 mL/kg body weight) and implantation of an autologous cell-seeded TEVG as intrathoracic IVC interposition grafts. Animals were anesthetized using propofol (5 mg/kg) for induction and isoflurane (1-4%) or propofol (20-40 mg/kg/hr) for maintenance. Lambs were placed in the lateral recumbent position, and the area overlying the iliac crest was shaved and prepped in standard sterile fashion. A 2-mm incision was made and an aspiration needle was inserted into the bone. Heparinized syringes (100 U/mL) were used to aspirate 5 mL/kg of bone marrow.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0263">Following aspiration, the bone marrow was processed using Ficoll density gradient separation to isolate the bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells as previously described. Briefly, bone marrow was filtered through 100-&#x3bc;m cell strainers to remove bone spicules and clots. A 1:1 dilution was achieved with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the bone marrow was layered onto Ficoll 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). The plasma and mononuclear cell layers were isolated after centrifugation. The mononuclear cell layer underwent two washes with PBS to yield a cell pellet that was diluted in 20 mL of PBS to seed the scaffold. The mononuclear cells were vacuum-seeded onto the scaffold, which was incubated in plasma until the time of implantation.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0264">The scaffolds were implanted in the intrathoracic IVC as previously described. Lambs were placed in a left lateral recumbent position. Depending on each animal's anatomy, a right thoracotomy was made in the fifth or sixth intercostal space, and the thoracic IVC was dissected between the diaphragm and right atrium. A cavoatrial shunt was placed to maintain perfusion during cross-clamping of the IVC. The vessel was clamped and a 2-cm segment of a diameter-matched seeded scaffold was implanted, with end-to-end anastomoses performed using a running nonabsorbable monofilament suture. No native vessel was removed. Titanium vascular clips were applied to the suture tails to mark the anastomoses for postoperative imaging. The chest wall, overlying muscle, and skin layers were reapproximated with absorbable sutures.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0265">Interventional Imaging</p><p id="p-0241" num="0266">Postoperative catheterizations were performed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Additional imaging was performed as needed based on the animals' clinical conditions. After sedation and intubation, lambs were placed in a left lateral recumbent position. The right internal jugular vein was cannulated and a 9-French sheath (Terumo, Somerset, N.J.) was inserted followed by an intravenous bolus of heparin (150 U/kg). A 5-French JR 2.5 catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind.) was passed into the right internal jugular vein through the SVC and into the right atrium. Using an angled Glidewire (Terumo), the JR catheter was then passed through the TEVG into the intraabdominal IVC where a Rosen exchange guidewire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind.) was placed. The JR catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French multi-track angiographic catheter (NuMed, Hopkinton, N.Y.) which was used to measure hemodynamic pressures in the intraabdominal IVC, intrathoracic IVC below and above the TEVG, and within the TEVG. A mean pressure gradient was calculated by subtracting the mean pressure above the TEVG from the mean pressure below the TEVG. A digital angiogram was then obtained by injecting ioversol 68% (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, N.C.) through the multi-track angiographic catheter positioned in the intraabdominal IVC. Diameters were measured at seven points: the intraabdominal IVC, low intrathoracic IVC (on the diaphragmatic side of the TEVG), proximal anastomosis (defined with respect to blood flow), midgraft, distal anastomosis, high intrathoracic IVC (on the atrial side of the TEVG), and the area of most severe narrowing. The proximal and distal anastomoses were identified by the aforementioned surgically-placed radiopaque clips. A 0.035-inch digital intravascular ultrasound catheter (Volcano, San Diego, Calif.) was advanced through the graft over the Rosen guidewire.

The PGA fibers were knitted into a tube and coated on the inner and outer surface with the PCLA solution and then freeze dried under a vacuum, creating a matrix of knitted PGA fibers embedded within a porous sponge of PCLA. The scaffold was designed to degrade by hydrolysis over approximately 6 months. Scaffold dimensions measured either 16&#xb1;0.5 mm or 18&#xb1;0.5 mm on the inner diameter, 13&#xb1;0.5 cm in length, and 0.7&#xb1;0.1 mm in wall thickness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Quantitative scanning electron microscopy of the inner surface revealed an average pore size of 41.9&#xb1;2.7 &#x3bc;m and porosity of 0.87&#xb1;0.01. On the outer surface, average pore size was 36.4&#xb1;6.6 &#x3bc;m and porosity was 0.86&#xb1;0.02. The PGA fiber bundles were knit in a weft pattern, with a 1 mm separation between layers axially and 1 mm between peaks running circumferentially. The average PGA fiber diameter measured 15.8&#xb1;1.0 &#x3bc;m. TEVGs were assembled in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. Bone marrow (5 ml/kg body weight) was harvested on the day of surgery and the mononuclear cell fraction separated using density centrifugation in Ficoll. In the United States clinical trial, this procedure yielded an average of 20.6&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>(range 19.0-22.2&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) mononuclear cells with an average cell viability of 92.6% (range 86.5-96.8%).

The four TEVGs increased 2.5 mm (range 1.1 to 4.2 mm) in length between 6 months and 3 years after implantation whereas the Glenn shunt increased 1.5 mm (range 0.9-2.4 mm) in length during the same period.

The study objectives were as follows. The primary objective of this pilot study was to determine the safety of using tissue engineered vascular grafts as large diameter, high-flow, low-pressure conduits in pediatric patients requiring extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (EC TCPC) for palliative treatment of single ventricle cardiac anomalies. The secondary objective was to determine the growth potential of the tissue engineered vascular grafts using serial magnetic resonance angiography. The Trial Design was as follows. This investigation was a prospective, nonrandomized Phase <b>1</b> clinical trial determining the safety of the use of tissue engineered vascular grafts as conduits for EC TCPC. Eligibility Criteria: All patients who were considered candidates to undergo EC TCPC for completion of a modified Fontan for palliation of their congenital cardiac anomaly during the course of the investigation at the institution were considered for enrollment in the trial. No patient was excluded based on age, gender, or ethnicity. Inclusion criteria included patients with single ventricle anomalies who were candidates for EC TCPC, who volunteered, and provided informed consent. Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria included urgent/emergent operative status, major chromosomal anomalies, the need for a pacemaker, pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, (u=Wood's units), abnormal venous drainage (interrupted IVC), presence of moderate to severe atrio-venticular valve regurgitation, or other significant medical problems. History of any other condition or other significant medical problems that, in the opinion of the investigator, precluded compliance with protocol-specified procedures. Study Sites: This single institutional study was initiated at Yale-New Haven Hospital but then transferred to Nationwide Children's Hospital. The data housing facility is on site (Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio). Outcome Measures: Primary end points of the study included determination of graft failure rates and graft related morbidity and mortality. Graft failure was defined as any graft narrowing/occlusion or dilation/rupture requiring surgical or endovascular intervention. Graft related morbidity and mortality included any post-operative complication such as any thromboembolic or infectious event that required treatment and was thought likely to be caused by the tissue engineered vascular graft as determined by the investigators and confirmed by the data safety monitoring board. Sample Size: an initial plan was for enrolling a total of 6 patients. Since a higher incidence of stenosis was experienced than expected, the study was concluded at 4 patients total. Since this was a pilot study to look at rates of adverse events among patients who receive these vascular grafts, the study was not powered for testing. Study Dates: FDA approval received in December 2009 while at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital associated with Yale University, implanted the first patient in August 2011. The study was relocated to Nationwide Children's Hospital associated with The Ohio State University in September 2012. After completion of required inspection of the institutional facility, the enrollment was resumed in March 2014 with a completion of all clinical follow-ups in August 2017. Study Termination: A higher incidence of TEVG stenosis was experienced in the clinical trial than predicted based on the original pilot study in Japan. Based on these findings the study was voluntarily placed on hold and requested a closed DSMB meeting. The DSMB has subsequently met and recommended temporarily putting the study on hold and re-evaluating the data.

The computational model to simulate the evolving geometry, composition, and mechanical properties of TEVGs implanted in mice over time was previously developed.

Specifically, datadriven constitutive relationships define the intrinsic material properties for each of the &#x3b1;=1, 2, . . . n constituents as well as their individual rates of production and removal: a neoHookean relation describes the mechanical behavior of the polymer, a Fung-exponential relation describes that of the neotissue, the rate of mass density production m) &#x3c4;&#x3e;0 depends on mechanobiological stimuli, such as intramural wall stress, and immunobiological stimuli, proportional to macrophage invasion, and removal is defined via a survival function q) s, &#x3c4;&#x3f5;[0,1] that tracks the percentage of the material produced at time &#x3c4;&#x3f5;[0, s] that remains at time s. For example, deviations in intramural stress from homeostatic conditions regulate mechano-mediated kinetics, as vascular cells typically promote mechanobiological homeostasis, while scaffold microstructure, as quantified from scanning electron microscopy, modulates inflammation-driven kinetics since a pore size sufficient for cellular infiltration is a critical regulator of macrophage activity and phenotype.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0296">Previous studies of immuno-competent and immuno-compromised mice identified four key model parameters that control the deposition and degradation of inflammation-driven extracellular matrix (Table 1): &#x3b4; modulates the onset and duration of the inflammatory response, &#x3b2; controls the skewness of the production function, K<sup>i</sup><sub>h </sub>controls rates of inflammatory extracellular matrix production and degradation, and K<sup>i</sup><sub>max </sub>scales the inflammatory effects of extracellular matrix degradation, with production given by</p><p id="p-0276" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>m</i><sub>infl</sub><sup>&#x3b1;</sup>(&#x3c4;)=<i>m</i><sub>h</sub><sup>&#x3b1;,infl</sup>(1&#x2212;exp)(&#x2212;&#x3c4;))<i>K</i><sup>i</sup>(&#x3c4;)&#x3b4;<sup>&#x3b2;</sup>&#x3c4;<sup>&#x3b2;-1</sup>exp(&#x2212;&#x3b4;<sub>&#x3c4;</sub>),),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0277" num="0000">Where m<sub>h</sub><sup>&#x3b1;,infl </sup>is the basal rate of production of matrix constituent &#x3b1; driven by inflammation and K<sup>i</sup>(&#x3c4;)=K<sub>h</sub><sup>i</sup>(r<sub>p</sub>(&#x3c4;)/r<sub>n</sub>)+K<sub>w</sub><sup>i</sup>, is the gain on a gamma distribution function that describes the onset and resolution of the foreign body response to the degrading polymer, with r<sub>p</sub>(&#x3c4;)/r<sub>n </sub>the pore size of the scaffold normalized by a critical pore size for cellular infiltration, and K<sup>i</sup><sub>w </sub>a basal gain on inflammation-driven extracellular matrix production.

Overall, the simulations predicted findings similar to those suggested by the clinical trial, namely an early narrowing of the TEVG due to increased inflammation-driven neotissue thickening of the wall and narrowing of the lumen. Interestingly, however, the model also predicted that such narrowing would reverse spontaneously for a broad range of cases as the immune response waned with polymer degradation and subsequent mechanomediated neotissue degradation outpaced deposition as wall stress dropped well below normal homeostatic values due to both the narrowing and thickening (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>H</figref>).

TEVG morphology was monitored serially over a 12- to 18-month period in all surviving lambs using angiography and intravascular ultrasound to measure luminal diameter and cross-sectional area. Angiography revealed significant TEVG stenosis at 6 weeks (&#x2212;0.48&#xb1;0.16-fold diameter change from 1 week, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test: a=0.05, p&#x3c;0.0001). As predicted, the stenosis improved spontaneously by 6 months without endovascular intervention and all TEVGs remained patent at 1 year and beyond.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0302">Intravascular ultrasound suggested that early TEVG narrowing resulted from appositional growth of neotissue on the luminal surface of the scaffold, thus thickening the wall and narrowing the lumen. At 6 weeks, the TEVG stenosis was localized to the mid-distal segment of the graft (i.e., region closer to the heart) while no changes were appreciated at the proximal anastomosis. Quantitative intravascular ultrasound assessment confirmed that the luminal area decreased significantly from 1 to 6 weeks (&#x2212;0.67&#xb1;0.17-fold area change from 1 week midgraft area, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test: a=0.05, p&#x3c;0.0001), the narrowing reversed by 6 months, and grafts remained patent at 1 year (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). During the same period, the wall reached its maximum thickness at 6 weeks (range 1.5 to 4.6 mm, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison's test: a=0.05, p&#x3c;0.0001) and then progressively thinned over the 1 year time course (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0286" num="0303">Hemodynamic data during each angiography was also collected. The mean pressure gradient across the graft followed the aforementioned morphometric changes. The gradient increased significantly from 1 to 6 weeks (0.5&#xb1;0.5 vs. 11.8&#xb1;5.5 mmHg, p&#x3c;0.001), then decreased to near baseline by 6 months (1.3+2 8 mmHg, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test: a=0.05, p&#x3c;0.001 vs. 6 weeks, p=0.8883 vs. 1 week) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D</figref>: Angiography, IVUS, and Hemodynamic Data Analysis). The largest pressure gradients tended to correspond to the most narrowed grafts. Two of 22 animals (9.1%) that developed stenosis also developed symptoms including ascites, lethargy, and weight loss. Both of these lambs had mean pressure gradients &#x3e;19 mmHg at 6 weeks, and their grafts were two of the three most narrowed on angiography, both measuring less than 4 mm luminal diameter at the narrowest point. These two symptomatic animals were euthanized Despite the formation of significant TEVG stenosis in all animals, the stenosis resolved in the remaining lambs, which remained asymptomatic. None of the grafts acutely occluded and no animals died as a result of stenosis.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0304">Computational Model Validation</p><p id="p-0288" num="0305">Whereas the parametric studies were parameterized based on studies of a murine IVC-interposition TEVG that consisted of a similar scaffold design as used in the ovine and clinical grafts, it was tested whether the model could also describe the in vivo ovine data. These data fit well for all times (R2=0.83) using many model parameters from the murine experiments (e.g., mechanical properties of collagen and basal rates of collagen turnover), but generated ovine-specific values for the four key parameters that control the temporal inflammatory response: &#x3b4;=0.32 days-1, &#x3b2;=3.96, K<sup>i</sup><sub>h</sub>=5.13, and K<sup>i</sup><sub>max</sub>=72. These best-fit values of the parameters were identified using a Surrogate Management Framework optimization method, as in prior growth and remodeling studies of native blood vessels. Among the different computed metrics, note in particular the evolution of luminal diameter and wall thickness which dictate the presence or absence of stenosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0289" num="0306">Evolving Cellular Composition of Neovessel is Consistent with Computational Model Predictions</p><p id="p-0290" num="0307">The changes in the ovine neotissue over time were characterized using histology and immunohistochemistry. Histological sections confirmed changes in the lumen and wall of the TEVG that were observed with in vivo imaging, and verified that the transient luminal narrowing was primarily due to scaffold thickening and partly due to neotissue formation on the luminal surface of the scaffold that appeared to resolve by 6 months after implantation. Quantitative histomorphometry demonstrated that wall thickening peaked 6 weeks after implantation, consistent with the computational predictions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>) Immunohistochemical staining for a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) identified some positive cells along the luminal surface of the scaffold as well as within the scaffold; their number were greatest at 6 weeks. The aSMA+ cells that form along the luminal surface were presumed to be smooth muscle cells that proliferated and contributed to the neotissue that caused TEVG stenosis. The overall number of aSMA+ cells peaked early, which fit well with the predicted early exuberant production of matrix by the computational model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C and <b>9</b>D</figref>). The degree of macrophage infiltration was assessed using immunohistochemical staining against CD68. Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed the greatest macrophage density at 6 weeks. Beyond 6 months, the number of macrophages diminished consistent with scaffold degradation, which also fit well with the computational predictions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>E and <b>9</b>F</figref>). Taken together, these findings show that the formation of TEVG stenosis is largely inflammation driven.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0308">Computational Model Accurately Predicts Neovessel Biomechanics</p><p id="p-0292" num="0309">The sum of the mechanical contributions of the polymeric scaffold and neotissue (which is primarily determined by the extracellular matrix component of the neotissue) determine the biomechanical properties of the TEVG. The scaffold degradation and neotissue formation was characterized using polarized light images of Picro-Sirius Red (PSR) stained sections from ovine TEVGs obtained 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after implantation, which revealed both the degradation of PGA fibers and the deposition and maturation of collagen fibers. The PGA fibers remained highly organized within the scaffold 1 week after implantation, but had thinned and begun to show evidence of early fragmentation at 6 weeks. Only rare thin individual fragments of the PGA fibers were visible by 6 months after implantation and beyond. In contrast, minimal staining was detected for fibrillar collagen at 1 week. The total amount of collagen in the neotissue peaked 6 weeks after implantation, with significant amounts of thin (green) fibers within the scaffold and along its luminal surface. Collagen density increased steadily over the first year as it compacted and matured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>). This collagen appeared to be the primary extracellular matrix component of the neotissue that was associated with TEVG stenosis. The collagen also appeared to remodel between 6 weeks and 6 months, as the scaffold degraded and the wall thinned; at 6 months, collagen fibers appeared orange, signifying they were of medium thickness. By one year after implantation, the wall became even thinner and the collagen fibers appeared thicker (red) and denser, suggestive of normal, mature vascular collagen.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0310">In vitro biaxial mechanical testing of TEVGs excised 1.5 years post-implantation revealed a structural response (pressure-diameter) of the TEVG that was similar to model predictions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>). The final compliance of the TEVG, which was predicted by the computational model as a validation step rather than based on a fit to data, also matched well with values found from the in vitro mechanical characterizations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>). Importantly, the associated values of the material parameters in the computational model suggested that this bulk behavior resulted from a higher inflammation-driven matrix turnover than mechano-mediated matrix turnover throughout much of neovessel development, as the mechanical stimuli for neotissue production were attenuated by the high wall thickness and low diameter.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0311">Discussion</p><p id="p-0295" num="0312">The first FDA-approved clinical trial evaluating the use of TEVGs in the repair of complex congenital cardiac anomalies confirmed that stenosis is the most prevalent graft-related complication, but formation of early TEVG stenosis occurred at a much higher incidence than previously observed.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0313">To gain mechanistic insight into the complex immunological and mechanical processes underlying the formation of early TEVG stenosis, a computational model of neovessel development was used to study parametrically the relative contributions of multiple critical factors that control neotissue formation. This model predicted spontaneous resolution of stenosis, a finding that was reproducibly confirmed in an ovine IVC interposition graft model. Asymptomatic TEVG stenosis in the lambs could be monitored safely without acute graft failures or thrombosis over the entire 1 to 1.5-year study period. Based on the available data, symptoms and the mean pressure gradient across the graft could be primary criteria in assessing the clinical significance of TEVG stenosis rather than morphometric changes alone. Because most stenoses resolved naturally, appropriate monitoring rather than overly aggressive intervention may be the way forward.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0314">Collectively, the results from the previous studies coupled with the human clinical trials, computational simulations, and ovine studies suggest that implantation of a cell-seeded PGA/PCLA scaffold as a TEVG within the vasculature sets into motion an inflammation-driven, mechanomediated evolution of a neovessel over time. The polymer initially incites a strong foreign body response and host inflammatory cells infiltrate the scaffold. At the same time, the scaffold partially shields infiltrating vascular cells and the neotissue they deposit from the hemodynamically imposed mechanical forces until the structural integrity of the polymer is lost. Mechanobiological processes thus appear to increase as scaffold integrity diminishes, and the low wall stresses due to overthickening of the graft cause degradation to outpace subsequent deposition, resulting in a progressive resolution of the initial inflammation-driven stenosis. The consequences of inflammation are not completely negative, however; indeed, some inflammation is fundamental to early host cell recruitment and neotissue formation. Infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in particular orchestrate early neotissue formation by inducing ingrowth of host endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells from the neighboring vessel wall. Overall TEVG functionality thus requires a balanced degradation of the polymeric scaffold (primarily by hydrolysis) and appropriate deposition of neotissue. It appears that it is critical to promote, but limit, inflammation while simultaneously optimizing the timing of load transferal from the initially stiff polymeric scaffold to the cell-matrix composite that constitutes the neotissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0298" num="0315"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> are diagrams showing implantation of the scaffold induces a foreign body reaction and mechano-mediated neotissue remodeling. Macrophages infiltrate the scaffold. Macrophages are essential for neotissue formation, but excessive macrophage infiltration leads to stenosis. The immunobiological contribution continues to build while the polymer fragments and degrades, but begins to subside as the polymer disappears; concurrently, the smooth muscle cells respond to the mechanical stimuli of the hemodynamic environment by remodeling the extracellular matrix to alter the amount of stress shielding so as to establish mechanical homeostasis. In situations where the cells in the vascular neotissue sense low mechanical stimulation, they break down and remodel extracellular matrix to reduce stress shielding until mechanical homeostasis is reestablished.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0316">Similarly, in situations of high mechanical stimulus, these cells produce and remodel the extracellular matrix to increase stress shielding until mechanical homeostasis is attained. The mechanobiological contribution continues to build as the stress-shielding capability of the degrading polymeric scaffold diminishes. During the first 6 months after implantation, the orchestration of neotissue formation by macrophages occurs through paracrine signaling that drives cellular migration and extracellular matrix production, while after the scaffold degrades and loses its biomechanical integrity, kinetics are mediated by the ability of vascular cells to sense and respond to their local mechanical environment via the deposition and degradation of neotissue. Note that the loss of scaffold mechanical integrity precedes its disappearance, hence an overlap in inflammatory and mechanical contributions to neotissue turnover. Importantly, the exuberant production of neotissue during the inflammation-driven period results in neotissue wall stresses well below the normal homeostatic target, thus promoting a mechano-mediated degradation of neotissue that outpaces deposition, contributing to the natural resolution of the stenosis.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0317">In conclusion, this study highlighted the utility of combining advanced computational modeling and model-driven pre-clinical experiments in translational research. A framework for creating robust computational models that can accurately predict changes in the geometry, composition, and biomechanics of the neotissue that ultimately determine graft performance was developed. Results suggested that the early stenosis observed in the clinical trial, which resulted in the study ending prematurely, would have resolved spontaneously without angioplasty. The computational simulations predicted that the scaffold could be modified to reduce the degree and duration of narrowing by altering the scaffold design (including fiber diameter, fiber alignment, porosity and pore size) to reduce the associated inflammation and stress shielding.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001 MATH-US-00001-2 MATH-US-00001-3 MATH-US-00001-4 MATH-US-00001-5" nb-file="US20230002709A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="39.12mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002709A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230002709A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002709A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
