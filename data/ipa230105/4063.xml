However, when framing is frequently repeated, such as in the case of aiming at an object, the operability of the camera <b>11</b> cannot be made higher because the shake detection signal is not stable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the second signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>b</i>, the low-frequency component of the shake detection signal from the shake detecting unit <b>15</b> is attenuated by a high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>b </i>having a small time constant. The shake detection signal from the shake detecting unit <b>15</b> that has passed through the high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>b </i>is integrated by an integrator <b>22</b><i>b </i>and converted into an angular signal of the camera shake.

Hence, there is no problem in aiming at the object, but the high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>b </i>is not suitable for seeking high image quality such as still image exposure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a description will be given of signal processing waveforms of the first and second signal processing units <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>described above while low-frequency noise is superimposed on the shake detecting unit <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a horizontal axis of each graph illustrates elapsed time.

The second graph illustrates an angular signal from the second signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>b </i>(second image stabilization target value) and an angular signal from the first signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>a </i>(first image stabilization target value). The third graph illustrates an angular signal that is switched from the second image stabilization target value to the first image stabilization target in the case where still image exposure (shooting hereinafter) is performed during aiming at the object (aiming hereinafter) in preparation for the still image exposure is an angle signal that switches to a value. The fourth graph is an angular signal obtained by the conventional signal processing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A waveform <b>31</b> is a camera-shake angular velocity signal output from the shake detecting unit <b>15</b>, and illustrates a simple vibration for explanation convenience. A low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>is superimposed on the waveform <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A waveform <b>32</b> is a waveform obtained by converting the waveform <b>31</b> into an angular signal by the second signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>superimposed on the waveform <b>31</b> is removed during a section <b>32</b><i>a </i>by the high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and becomes a stable second image stabilization target value. Thus, the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>can be quickly removed because the high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>b </i>in the second signal processing unit has a small time constant. However, as described above, the waveform <b>32</b>, which is the second image stabilization target value, has high stability and is suitable for aiming, but is not suitable for shooting.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A waveform <b>33</b> is a waveform obtained by converting the waveform <b>31</b> into an angular signal by the first signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>a</i>. It takes a long time to remove the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>superimposed on the waveform <b>31</b> by the high-pass filter <b>21</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Thus, it takes a long time to remove the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>because the first signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>a </i>has a large time constant. Hence, as described above, the waveform <b>33</b>, which is the first image stabilization target value, has low stability and is unsuitable for aiming.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The waveform <b>33</b> has discontinuity points <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b</i>. As understood from the waveform <b>31</b>, the signal of the first image stabilization target value, which is the waveform <b>33</b>, fluctuates due to the influence of the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a</i>. This fluctuation becomes large and the calculation overflow may occur. Accordingly, when the first image stabilization target value of the waveform <b>33</b> exceeds an overflow threshold value <b>33</b><i>d </i>(predetermined value), the overflow preventing unit <b>18</b> subtracts or adds a constant bias signal and generates anew image stabilization target value. More specifically, when the output of the integrator <b>22</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> becomes a predetermined value or higher, a value made by subtracting or adding the certain value from or to the output value is newly used as the output of the integrator <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A waveform <b>34</b> illustrates an image stabilization target value according to the imaging sequence of the camera <b>11</b>. The second image stabilization target value of the waveform <b>32</b> is incorporated in sections <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>c </i>as aiming sections, and the first image stabilization target value of the same timing in the waveform <b>33</b> is incorporated in the section <b>34</b><i>b </i>as a shooting section. The image stabilizing unit is driven by these image stabilization target values.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Here, the first and second signal processing units <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>simultaneously start calculations, and the waveform <b>33</b> which is the signal from the first signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>a </i>in the section <b>34</b><i>b </i>where the shooting is performed is stable because the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently removed. Therefore, highly accurate image stabilization is performed. Thus, the output of the first image stabilization target value by the first signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the output of the second image stabilization target value by the second signal processing unit <b>16</b><i>b </i>are performed in parallel. Here, if shooting is started earlier, the image stabilization becomes unstable even in the above processing. However, since the aiming time is often set long in actual imaging, the influence of the low-frequency noise component <b>31</b><i>a </i>on the first image stabilization target value is small during that period, and the image stabilization is less likely unstable.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A waveform <b>35</b> is the conventional image stabilization target value, and sections <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>c </i>as aiming periods are the same as those of this embodiment.
