For example, attempting to lift and install a barcode reader assembly into a piece of furniture, such as a countertop at a retail location can be difficult because of the minimal clearances between the barcode reader/assembly and the opening in which is it being installed. This is further complicated by the variety of barcode reader assemblies that can be available. For example, barcode reader assemblies can have different size frames (short, medium, long, etc.) and can come with or without a scale assemblies. All of these different versions change the weight and center of gravity of the assembly and can make lifting and balancing the assembly difficult.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are some barcode readers and barcode reader assemblies that have attempted to address this issue by providing a lift mechanism that includes a small hook that can rotate between a retracted and extended position and be used to assist in lifting and moving the barcode reader/assembly. However, these lift mechanisms are only large enough to fit a single finger, which does not provide much assistance when lifting a heavier assembly with a metal frame and/or a scale assembly. In addition, since these lift mechanisms are narrow, the area covered by the hook is small and will not be located over the center of gravity of the barcode reader and the barcode reader assembly with a variety of options, which does not help in keeping the barcode reader/assembly balanced when lifted or moved or during installation.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an embodiment, the present invention is a barcode reader assembly comprising a barcode reader and a metal frame.

As shown, first pair of channels <b>140</b> and second pair of channels <b>145</b> extend into upper housing portion <b>150</b> and into lower housing portion <b>125</b>. However, first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> could extend only into lower housing portion <b>125</b> or only into upper housing portion <b>150</b>, depending on the particular design of housing used. In addition, in the example shown, first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> extend all the way through the bottom of lower housing portion <b>125</b>, which provides an opening at the bottom of first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to allow fluid or debris that may enter first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to move through and fall out of first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>, rather than getting stuck in first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>.

Similarly, second lift handle <b>400</b> has tabs <b>415</b> that extend from main body <b>405</b> and extend into and are received in second pair of channels <b>145</b> in lower housing portion <b>125</b> so that second lift handle <b>400</b> is movable in a liner motion relative to housing <b>105</b> between the retracted and extended positions. As first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are moved from the retracted to the extended position, tabs <b>315</b>, <b>415</b> will ride within first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> and will stop when tabs <b>315</b>, <b>415</b> engage the end of first and second pairs of channels <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>.

In the example shown, first and second retention features include identical flexible tabs <b>440</b> formed on first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> (flexible tab on first lift handle <b>300</b> not shown) and first and second protrusions <b>345</b>, <b>445</b> on lower housing portion <b>125</b> of housing <b>105</b>. When moved from the retracted to the extended position, first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are lifted vertically in a linear motion until tabs <b>440</b> flex and snap past protrusions <b>345</b>, <b>445</b>, which then engage the respective flexible tabs <b>440</b> with first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> in the extended position to retain first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> in the extended position. Conversely, to move first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> from the extended to the retracted positions, first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are pushed downward in a linear motion until tabs <b>440</b> flex and snap past protrusions <b>345</b>, <b>445</b>. Alternatively, flexible tabs <b>440</b> could also be formed on housing <b>105</b> (rather than on first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>) and first and second protrusions <b>345</b>, <b>445</b> could be formed on first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> (rather than on housing <b>105</b>) and still operate in the same manner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">First and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> make it easier to lift and move barcode assembly <b>10</b>, or even barcode reader <b>100</b> by itself, whether it be to remove barcode reader assembly <b>10</b> from a packing box, removing it from or placing it into a cavity in a counter, moving it from one location to another, or any other movement of barcode reader assembly <b>10</b>. To move barcode reader assembly <b>10</b>, or barcode reader <b>100</b>, first and second lift handles <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are moved in a linear motion relative to housing <b>105</b> from the retracted to the extended position.
