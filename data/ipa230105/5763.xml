manufacturing, and in particular, to a device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers and method for processing silicon wafers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Photovoltaic silicon wafers or semiconductor silicon wafers are cut from a silicon bar glued to a support by a wire cut electrical discharge machine. In a process of a related art, the silicon wafers are still glued to the support after wire cutting process, and transported by hand or multi-function transport vehicle (such as AGV, Automated Guided Vehicle) to a separate degumming machine for degumming After degumming, the silicon wafers are taken out from acid-containing water and put into an elastic clip, and the elastic clip is put into a water tank. Then the water tank is transported to a device for inserting a silicon wafer by hand or the AGV, and the elastic clip is taken out and put into the device for inserting the silicon wafers manually. However, manual transportation of the silicon wafers has the following problems. Firstly, it is necessary to manually transport the silicon wafers from the acid-containing water, and the acid-containing water contains a large amount of silicon powder and a small amount of acid, which is harmful to human body. Secondly, because the silicon wafers are very thin and brittle, a slight collision during the manual transportation of the silicon wafers can cause defective products such as chipping and fragments of silicon wafers. Thirdly, it is necessary to transport the silicon wafers to the elastic clip, since the manual transportation of the silicon wafers takes a long time for transportation, gaps between the silicon wafers will be reduced, and a great force is required in a stage of inserting the silicon wafer to separate the silicon wafers. The great force may easily cause the silicon wafers to crack or even produce fragments.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers and method for processing silicon wafers are provided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers.

However, after the cutting processing, the silicon wafers <b>100</b> are still bonded on the support <b>200</b>. The device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers provided by this application can realize separation of the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b> without a need to manually move the silicon wafers <b>100</b>, and make the bonded silicon wafers <b>100</b> split into single silicon wafer <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers provided by the present embodiment can include a material frame <b>1</b>, a grabbing mechanism <b>2</b>, a degumming mechanism <b>3</b>, an unlocking mechanism <b>8</b>, an inserting mechanism <b>4</b>, a separation conveying mechanism (not shown), a single piece cleaning mechanism <b>5</b> and a drying mechanism (not shown). The material frame <b>1</b> provided by the present embodiment is different from a conventional material frame in a related art. The conventional material frame can only clamp the support <b>200</b>, while the material frame <b>1</b> provided by the present embodiment can not only clamp the support <b>200</b>, but also clamp the silicon wafer <b>100</b>. In this way, after the separation of the support <b>200</b> and the silicon wafer <b>100</b>, the silicon wafer <b>100</b> does not need to be taken out from the material frame <b>1</b>, but can be directly transferred to the inserting mechanism <b>4</b> by the material frame <b>1</b>. Moreover, the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b> provided by the present embodiment can grab the material frame <b>1</b> and the support <b>200</b> respectively, and transport the material frame <b>1</b> and the support <b>200</b> separately or together. Specifically, when the support <b>200</b> and the silicon wafers <b>100</b> are not separated, the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b> can grab and transfer the material frame <b>1</b> and the support <b>200</b> and the silicon wafers <b>100</b> placed in the material frame <b>1</b> simultaneously. And when the silicon wafers <b>100</b> is separated from the support <b>200</b>, the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b> can transport the support <b>200</b> away separately, and then transfer the material frame <b>1</b> together with the silicon wafers <b>100</b>. The degumming mechanism <b>3</b> is configured for degumming the silicon wafers <b>100</b> from the support <b>200</b>, and the silicon wafers <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b> can be separated by the degumming mechanism <b>3</b>. Usually, the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> can be provided with a degumming agent such as lactic acid. According to similarity-intermiscibility theory, adhesives between the silicon wafers <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b> can be dissolved in the degumming agent, thereby realizing degumming and separation of the silicon wafers <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b>. During a transfer process of the silicon wafer <b>100</b>, the material frame <b>1</b> can clamp the silicon wafer <b>100</b>. Therefore, before the silicon wafers <b>100</b> are split, the unlocking mechanism <b>8</b> can be configured for releasing a clamping and fixing of the material frame <b>1</b> to the silicon wafers <b>100</b>, thus facilitating the separation of the adjacent silicon wafers <b>100</b>. The inserting mechanism can be configured for splitting the degummed plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b>, so that the bonded silicon wafers <b>100</b> can be separated into single piece of silicon wafer. The thickness of the single piece of silicon wafer <b>100</b> can be extremely thin. Generally, the thickness of a photovoltaic silicon wafer can be in a range between 0.13 mm and 0.18 mm, and the thickness of the semiconductor silicon wafer can be about 0.7 mm. Therefore, the single piece of silicon wafer <b>100</b> needs to be transported separately by the separation conveying mechanism. Moreover, there is a certain amount of impurities in a single piece of silicon wafer <b>100</b>, therefore, the silicon wafer <b>100</b> can be transferred to the single piece cleaning mechanism <b>5</b> to clean. After cleaning, the single piece of silicon wafer <b>100</b> can be transferred to the drying mechanism for drying. In order to improve operation efficiency of the device <b>300</b> for degumming and inserting silicon wafers. In the present embodiment, the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> can be located on a side of the inserting mechanism <b>4</b>, the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> and the inserting mechanism <b>4</b> can be arranged on the same horizontal plane, and the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b> can be arranged above the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> and the inserting mechanism <b>4</b>. In this way, a structure of the device <b>300</b> for degumming and inserting silicon wafers can be more compact, and operation efficiency thereof can be improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Specifically, the method for processing a silicon wafer using the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers mentioned above includes the following steps: firstly, placing the material frame <b>1</b> with the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> at a feeding region <b>6</b>; secondly, grabbing and moving the material frame <b>1</b> with the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> to the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> via the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b>, to perform a degumming treatment so as to separate the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> from the support <b>200</b>; thirdly, grabbing and removing the support <b>200</b> separated from the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> via the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b>, and then grabbing and moving the material frame <b>1</b> with the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> to the inserting mechanism <b>4</b>; fourthly, releasing the clamping and fixing of the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> from the material frame <b>1</b> via the unlocking mechanism <b>8</b>, and then splitting the degummed plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> via the inserting mechanism <b>4</b>; and finally, cleaning and drying one of the plurality of silicon wafers. It can be seen from the above that the device <b>300</b> for degumming and inserting silicon wafers provided by the present disclosure does not require manual transportation of the silicon wafer <b>100</b> during an entire processing, thereby avoiding a serious damage to the silicon wafer <b>100</b> and preventing a human body from being corroded by wastewater.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, since an inserting process of inserting the silicon wafer <b>100</b> is after a degumming process of degumming the silicon wafer <b>100</b>, and time required for the inserting process of the inserting mechanism <b>4</b> is longer than time required for the degumming process of the degumming mechanism <b>3</b>. Therefore, after the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> are degummed, an inserting treatment cannot be performed immediately, that is, after the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> are degummed, it needs to wait for a period of time before performing the degumming treatment. In this way, smoothness of the overall operation of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers can be affected. In order to improve the smoothness of the overall operation of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers, in the present disclosure, a buffering region <b>7</b> can be provided between the degumming mechanism and the inserting mechanism. The buffering region <b>7</b> can be configured for accommodating the material frame <b>1</b> clamped with the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> or the empty material frame <b>1</b>. In this way, the material frame <b>1</b> clamped with the degummed silicon wafer <b>100</b> can be placed on the buffering region <b>7</b> to wait for the subsequent inserting process, so as to prevent the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers from operating unsmoothly due to nowhere to place the material frame <b>1</b>. Furthermore, in order to improve operation efficiency of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers, and reduce waiting time of the material frame <b>1</b> before the inserting process, in the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers provided by the present disclosure, the number of the inserting mechanisms <b>4</b> can also be twice greater than or equal to that of the degumming mechanism <b>3</b>. That is, one degumming mechanism <b>3</b> can correspond to at least two inserting mechanisms <b>4</b>, thus greatly improving smoothness of the overall operation and operation efficiency of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A specific structure of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers can be further analyzed below.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the material frame <b>1</b> can include a main frame body <b>11</b>, the main frame body <b>11</b> can be provided with a material tank <b>111</b>, and the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b> can be provided in the material tank <b>111</b>. The material tank <b>111</b> can be provided with a wafer outlet <b>112</b>, and the wafer outlet <b>112</b> can be configured for allowing one of the plurality of silicon wafers to pass through. In this way, the single silicon wafer <b>100</b> split by the inserting mechanism <b>4</b> can be transferred from the material tank <b>111</b> directly through the wafer outlet <b>112</b>. Two first clamping members <b>12</b> opposite to each other can be provided on two side walls of the material tank <b>111</b>, and the two first clamping members <b>12</b> can be configured for clamping the support <b>200</b>. The first clamping member <b>12</b> can be rotatably connected to the main frame <b>11</b> via a first rotating shaft <b>13</b>, respectively. The two first clamping members <b>12</b> can be driven to move close to each other by rotating the first rotating shaft <b>13</b> provided on the two sides of the material tank <b>111</b>, so as to clamp the support <b>200</b>, and the two first clamping members <b>12</b> can be driven to move far away from each other by rotating the first rotating shaft <b>13</b> provided on the two sides of the material tank <b>111</b>, so as to release a clamping of the support <b>200</b>. Two second clamping members <b>14</b> opposite to each other can be further provided on the two side walls of the material tank <b>111</b>, and the two second clamping members <b>14</b> can be rotatably connected to the main frame body <b>11</b> via second rotating shafts <b>15</b>, respectively. The two second clamping members <b>14</b> can be driven to move close to each other by rotating the second rotating shafts <b>15</b> provided on the two sides of the material tank <b>111</b>, so as to clamp the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b>, and the two second clamping members <b>14</b> can be driven to move far away from each other by rotating the second rotating shafts <b>15</b> provided on the two sides of the material tank <b>111</b>, so as to release a clamping of the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b>. Since the silicon wafer <b>100</b> is disposed below the support <b>200</b> during the transfer process of the silicon wafer <b>100</b> and the support <b>200</b>, in the present embodiment, the second clamping member <b>14</b> can be disposed below the first clamping member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in order to drive the second rotating shaft <b>15</b> to rotate more smoothly, a crank-connecting rod structure can be also arranged between the two second clamping members <b>14</b> opposite to each other. The crank-connecting rod structure can include a sliding block <b>16</b> and a sliding groove <b>17</b> slidably fitting with each other, and the crank-connecting rod structure can also include at least one set of a first connecting rod <b>18</b> and a second connecting rod <b>19</b>. The first connecting rod <b>18</b>, as a component with a highest degree of freedom in the crank-connecting rod structure, can play a key role in converting a linear motion into a circular motion. Specifically, both ends of the first connecting rod <b>18</b> can be pivotally connected to the sliding block <b>16</b> and the second connecting rod <b>19</b>, respectively, and the second connecting rod <b>19</b> can be fixedly connected to the second rotating shaft <b>15</b>. When the sliding block <b>16</b> moves relative to the sliding groove <b>17</b>, the sliding block <b>16</b> can drive an end of the first connecting rod <b>18</b> connected to the sliding block <b>16</b> to perform the linear motion. Then the first connecting rod <b>18</b> can apply a driving force from the sliding block <b>16</b> to the second connecting rod <b>19</b>, so that the second connecting rod <b>19</b> can drive the second rotating shaft <b>15</b> to perform the circular motion. In order to ensure that the structure of the device for degumming and inserting silicon wafers can be more compact, in the present embodiment, only one set of sliding block <b>16</b> and sliding groove <b>17</b> can be provided, and two sets of the first connecting rod <b>18</b> and the second connecting rod <b>19</b> can be connected on both sides of the sliding block <b>16</b> respectively. In this way, the sliding block <b>16</b> can drive the two sets of the first connecting rod <b>18</b> and the second connecting rod <b>19</b> to move simultaneously when the sliding block <b>16</b> moves, and then the second rotating shafts <b>15</b> opposite to each other can be driven by the second connecting rod <b>19</b> simultaneously, and drive the second clamping member <b>14</b> to rotate, so as to clamp the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> or release a clamping of the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b>. According to the structure of the above material frame <b>1</b>, the unlocking mechanism <b>8</b> can realize a rotation of the second rotating shaft <b>15</b> by driving the sliding block <b>16</b> to slidably fit with the sliding groove <b>17</b>, thereby releasing clamping and fixing of the material frame <b>1</b> on the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, a crank-connecting rod structure can be also arranged between the two first clamping members <b>12</b> opposite to each other, and the crank-connecting rod structure arranged between the two first clamping members <b>12</b> can work in the same principle as the crank-connecting rod structure arranged between the second clamping members <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the grabbing mechanism <b>2</b> can include a frame manipulator <b>21</b>, a lifting assembly <b>22</b>, a longitudinal guide rail <b>23</b>, and a transversal guide rail <b>24</b>. The frame manipulator <b>21</b> can be installed on the lifting assembly <b>22</b>, the lifting assembly <b>22</b> can be slidably installed on the longitudinal guide rail <b>23</b>, and the longitudinal guide rail <b>23</b> can be slidably installed on the transverse guide rail <b>24</b>. The lifting assembly <b>22</b> and the longitudinal guide rail <b>23</b> can be both provided with a motor, so as to realize an automatic sliding.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The degumming mechanism <b>3</b> provided by the present embodiment can be configured for degumming the plurality of silicon wafers <b>100</b> from the support <b>200</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the degumming mechanism <b>3</b> can include a degumming tank <b>31</b>, an acid storage tank <b>32</b>, and a water storage tank <b>33</b>. Both the acid storage tank <b>32</b> and the water storage tank <b>33</b> can be communicated with the degumming tank <b>31</b> through pipes <b>37</b>, respectively.
