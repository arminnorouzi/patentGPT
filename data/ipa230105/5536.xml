present application claims, under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119(a), the benefit of Korean application No. 10-2021-0087022, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an electronic device, an apparatus, and an operating method thereof, and more particularly, to a method of operating a selector device, a method of operating a nonvolatile memory apparatus to which the same is applied, an electronic circuit device including the selector device, and a nonvolatile memory apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the next-generation memories based on resistance changes, such as ReRAM (resistive random-access memory), PCRAM (phase-change RAM), and MRAM (magnetic RAM) have non-volatile characteristics, they have the advantages that power consumption may be greatly reduced, and high speed and high reliability may be obtained. In addition, due to its simple structure, higher integration is possible as compared to the existing NAND flash memory, and when it is manufactured as a crossbar array structure, a large-capacity memory device may be implemented according to the design rule of 4F2.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a memory having a crossbar array structure, memory cells are positioned at intersections (cross-points) of word lines and bit lines. In this case, information read errors may occur due to leakage current generated in unselected cells during the read/write process of a memory having a parallel structure, or a sensing margin may be reduced, or the maximum size (capacity) of integrated memory may be limited. In order to suppress such a leakage current component, a selector device suitable for a memory may be used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a selector device connected in series with a memory element is inserted in the integrated memory structure, a memory operation error generated due to a leak current generated in a cell unselected may be suppressed by the selector device. At this time, the operating voltage is different depending on, for example, the material of the variable resistor in which the resistance change occurs within the same type of memory, that is, the material of the resistive memory layer as well as the type of memory used in connection with the selector device. Thus, the required operating characteristics of the selector device also change. Therefore, the operating voltage of the selector device may be determined in consideration of the operating voltage of the memory element connected thereto. To this end, it may be desirable to precisely control the driving characteristics of the selector device. In developing the next-generation memory, it may be desirable to develop a selector device having a structure/material and characteristics suitable for the type of memory and the material of the memory layer even in the same type of memory.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of embodiments of the present disclosure is to provide a method of operating a selector device capable of easily adjusting the threshold voltage of the selector device without changing the material or configuration of the selector device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, another object of embodiments of the present disclosure is to provide a method of operating nonvolatile memory apparatus to which the above-described method of operating the selector device is applied.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of embodiments of the present disclosure is to provide an electronic circuit device including the above-described selector device and a driving circuit unit for operating the same.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, another object of embodiments of the present disclosure is to provide a nonvolatile memory apparatus to which the above-described selector device and a driving circuit unit are applied.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The objects to be accomplished by embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the objects mentioned above, and other objects not mentioned may be understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of operating a selector device for controlling access of a signal to a memory element, and the method comprises providing a selector device including a switching layer including an insulator and a separate metal element, and first and second electrodes disposed on both surfaces of the switching layer;

The selector device SD<b>10</b> may include a switching layer S<b>1</b>, and the first and the second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> disposed on both surfaces of the switching layer S<b>1</b>. A switching layer S<b>1</b> may be disposed between the first and second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>. The first electrode E<b>1</b> may be disposed on a lower surface of the switching layer S<b>1</b>, and the second electrode E<b>2</b> may be disposed on an upper surface of the switching layer S<b>1</b>. The first electrode E<b>1</b> and the second electrode E<b>2</b> may be provided or shared by the wires of an electronic circuit device or the electrodes of other memory devices. This will be separately described later.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The switching layer S<b>1</b> may include an insulator N and a metal element M dispersed in the insulator N. The insulator N of the switching layer S<b>1</b> may contain defects therein, and the selector device SD<b>10</b> may be a two-terminal device operating based on charge charging into the defects of the insulator N and forming of a conduction path between the insulator N and the metal element M. The insulator N may include one or more of silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, tungsten oxide, titanium oxide, nickel oxide, copper oxide, manganese oxide, tantalum oxide, niobium oxide, iron oxide, antimony oxide, silicon nitride, and aluminum nitride. A metal element may include one or more of arsenic (As), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al), lanthanum (La), niobium (Nb), vanadium (V), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), zirconium (Zr), and hafnium (Hf).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The metal element M may be doped and present in the insulator N. As a result, the switching layer S<b>1</b> may include the insulator N doped with the metal element M. In an embodiment, the doping may be a doping process realized by performing an ion implantation process. In a process in which the metal element M is doped into the insulator N by the ion implantation, defects in the insulator N may be induced. For example, the doping concentration (e.g., an ion implantation concentration) of the metal element M may be approximately 2&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>&#x2dc;2&#xd7;10<sup>23 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment, the switching layer S<b>1</b> may include silicon oxide SiO<sub>x </sub>doped with arsenic (As), where As may correspond to a metal element M, and SiO<sub>x </sub>may correspond to an insulator N, and may be expressed as As:SiO<sub>2</sub>. In this case, the doping concentration of As may be about 2&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>&#x2dc;2&#xd7;10<sup>23 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. The metal elements M may be distributed substantially uniformly in the insulator N. The distribution of the metal element M may be layered so that the metal element layer and the insulator N layer may be alternated at least twice or more, for providing the switching layer S<b>1</b>. Such a layer of the metal element M (or a metal element layer) may be a layer in which atoms or clusters of atoms are dispersed at a predetermined density in the same layer, rather than a continuous metal layer. Alternatively, for example, the metal element layer may include one large cluster composed of a metal element M. In some cases, the atoms and the clusters may be mixed. The distribution of the metal element M shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is illustrated as only an example, and may be variously changed. Silicon oxide SiO<sub>x </sub>may be stoichiometric SiO<sub>2 </sub>or oxygen deficiency, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the case of an As:SiO<sub>2 </sub>based-device according to an embodiment, in particular, oxygen vacancy defects inside SiO<sub>2 </sub>may have a stable energy level as a neutral defect having a dimer structure in the vicinity of the valence band depending on the state of charge of electrons, and as a form of a bipolar charging defect having an energy level similar to the work function of As in the neutral section of the band gap. The two types of defects may act as oxygen vacancy defects having variable energy levels due to the charging and discharging of holes by an electric field. In this case, a formation of a tunneling path composed of charging defects in SiO<sub>2 </sub>which are generated due to a hole charging may lead to the resistance change.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first and second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> may include a metal or a conductive metal compound. Here, the metal compound may be a metal nitride, a metal oxide, a metal carbide, or a mixture or compound thereof. One or both of the first and second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> may include one or more of titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride, tungsten, aluminum, copper, tantalum, titanium, gold, platinum, silver, ruthenium, iridium and molybdenum. In an embodiment, the first and second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> may include TiN (titanium nitride) or may be formed of TiN.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The driving circuit unit D<b>10</b> may be configured to apply a multi-step voltage pulse including a threshold voltage control pulse and a subsequent operating voltage pulse to the switching layer S<b>1</b> through the first and second electrodes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>. A memory cell including a selector device may be formed by connecting a memory element in series to the switching layer S<b>1</b>. Each of the memory cells may be connected through the driving circuit unit D<b>10</b> and a wiring for a cell access such as a bit line and/or a word line. Thus, it may store information or perform a logical operation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in another embodiment of the present disclosure, the metal elements M form a single cluster in the switching layer S<b>1</b> is illustrated. In this case, the reference character M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may refer to a large cluster. Other matters may be the same as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, a plurality of the large clusters may be inserted into the insulator N. In an embodiment, the average size, or diameter of the large clusters may be in the range of 30% to 90% of the thickness of the insulator N.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph schematically showing a multi-step voltage pulse that may be applied to an operating method of a selector device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the driving circuit unit D<b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may apply a multi-step voltage pulse to a selector device (e.g., the selector device SD<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). The multi-step voltage pulse may be a two-step voltage pulse including a threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> and a subsequent operating voltage pulse VP<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the multi-step voltage pulse may have a single aggregate waveform including the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> and the operating voltage pulse VP<b>2</b> that immediately follows the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b>. The operating voltage pulse VP<b>2</b> may have an intensity (or a magnitude) for turning on the selector device, and the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> may have a intensity (or a magnitude) lower than that of the operating voltage pulse VP<b>2</b>. The threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> activates the energy band structure of the switching layer S<b>1</b> to a given level (e.g., a predetermined level) without turning on the selector device SD<b>10</b>. Therefore, it serves to make the switching layer S<b>1</b> have a set threshold value. The step for applying the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> may be a step for forming a tunneling path composed of charged oxygen bonds having an elevated energy level through hole charging into the neutral oxygen defects in the insulating layer (e.g., see N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), for example, SiO<sub>2 </sub>by applying a voltage of a relatively low magnitude. As a result, the driving circuit unit D<b>10</b> may adjust the threshold voltage Vth of the selector device SD<b>10</b> by the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b>. Here, the threshold voltage Vth may indicate a critical voltage for turning on the selector device SD<b>10</b>. For example, the threshold voltage Vth may be decreased by application of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b>. Here, the decrease width of the threshold voltage Vth may be less than about 1.5 V. For example, when the threshold voltage Vth is decreased from a first threshold voltage to a second threshold voltage, the decrease width of the threshold voltage Vth may correspond to a difference between the first threshold voltage to the second threshold voltage.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A duration of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> may be about 0.1 &#x3bc;s to 500 &#x3bc;s, or about 0.1 &#x3bc;s to 5 &#x3bc;s, or about 0.2 &#x3bc;s to 5 &#x3bc;s. An intensity (or a magnitude) of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> may be, for example, about 0.3 V to 2.0 V. When the above-described duration and the intensity conditions are satisfied, activation of the energy band structure for adjusting the threshold voltage Vth may be efficiently achieved by using the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b>. If the duration of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> is less than about 0.1 &#x3bc;s or less than about 0.2 &#x3bc;s, the effect of adjusting the threshold voltage Vth may be relatively insignificant. Meanwhile, when the duration of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> exceeds about 500 &#x3bc;s or about 5 &#x3bc;s, power consumption may be excessively large and an operation speed may be relatively slow. In an embodiment, the magnitude of the threshold voltage control pulse VP<b>1</b> may be in a range from about 6% to about 60% of that of the operating voltage pulse VP<b>2</b>.
