Each storage unit typically includes a transistor and a capacitor. The transistor has a gate electrically connected to a word line, a source electrically connected to a bit line, and a drain electrically connected to the capacitor. A word line voltage on the word line can control the turn-on and turn-off of the transistor, so that data information stored in the capacitor can be read or written into the capacitor through the bit line.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in a semiconductor structure such as a DRAM, all word lines are located at a same level, and the coupling effect between adjacent word lines is strong because the spacing between adjacent word lines is narrow. When one word line is selected to be turned on, the adjacent word lines will be turned on instantaneously due to the strong coupling effect, which may eventually cause capacitance leakage or even read and write failure, thereby seriously affecting the performance of the memory.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, how to reduce the coupling effect between adjacent word lines so as to improve the performance of the memory is currently an urgent technical problem to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure relates to the technical field of semiconductor manufacturing, and more particularly, to a semiconductor structure and a method for forming a semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of disclosure, there is provided a semiconductor structure, including: a substrate, multiple active pillars located in the substrate, and multiple word lines.

The semiconductor structure in this specific implementation may be, but is not limited to, a memory such as a DRAM. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the semiconductor structure includes: a substrate <b>20</b>, multiple active pillars <b>12</b> and multiple word lines. The multiple active pillars <b>12</b> are located in the substrate <b>20</b>. The multiple active pillars <b>12</b> are arranged in an array in a first direction and a second direction. The first direction a-a&#x2032; and the second direction c-c&#x2032; are both directions parallel to a top surface <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, and the first direction a-a&#x2032; and the second direction c-c&#x2032; intersect. The multiple word lines are spaced apart in the first direction a-a&#x2032;. Each of the word lines extends in the second direction c-c&#x2032; and continuously surrounds and covers a portion of a side wall of each of the multiple active pillars <b>12</b> arranged in the second direction c-c&#x2032;. Any two adjacent word lines are at least partially staggered in a direction perpendicular to the top surface <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the substrate <b>20</b> may be, but is not limited to, a silicon substrate. This specific implementation will be described by taking the substrate being a silicon substrate as an example. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>20</b> may also be a semiconductor substrate such as gallium nitride substrate, gallium arsenide substrate, gallium carbide substrate, silicon carbide substrate, or SOI substrate. The substrate <b>20</b> includes the top surface <b>201</b>, and a bottom surface <b>202</b> opposite to the top surface. The multiple active pillars <b>12</b> are arranged in an array in the substrate <b>20</b> in the first direction a-a&#x2032; and the second direction c-c&#x2032;. Each of the active pillars <b>12</b> extends in the direction perpendicular to the top surface <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The multiple word lines are all located inside the substrate <b>20</b>. Each of the word lines extends in the second direction c-c&#x2032; and continuously surrounds and covers a portion of a side wall of each of the multiple active pillars <b>12</b> arranged in the second direction c-c&#x2032;. The multiple word lines are spaced apart in the first direction a-a&#x2032;. The intersection may be a vertical intersection or an inclined intersection. This specific implementation will be described with reference to the intersection being a vertical intersection.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to this specific implementation, any two adjacent word lines are at least partially staggered in the direction perpendicular to the top surface <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> such that any two adjacent word lines are at different levels, thereby reducing the facing area between any two adjacent word lines, so as to reduce the effect of capacitive coupling between any two adjacent word lines. Therefore, when one of the two adjacent word lines is selected to be turned on, the other word line is not turned on due to the effect of capacitive coupling, so as to reduce or even avoid electric leakage problems between adjacent storage units, thereby improving the electrical performance of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, some of the multiple word lines are first word lines <b>111</b> and some of the multiple word lines are second word lines <b>112</b>. As for the multiple active pillars <b>12</b> arranged in the first direction a-a&#x2032;, the first word line <b>111</b> surrounds and covers a portion of the side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> in a first parity sequence and the second word line <b>112</b> surrounds and covers a portion of side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> in a second parity sequence.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, the first parity sequence may be an odd sequence and the second parity sequence may be an even sequence. Accordingly, the operation that the first word line <b>111</b> surrounds and covers a portion of the side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> in the first parity sequence and the second word line <b>112</b> surrounds and covers a portion of the side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> in the second parity sequence means that, after sequentially ordering the multiple active pillars <b>12</b> arranged in the first direction a-a&#x2032;, a portion of the side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> located at an odd position is surrounded and covered by the first word line <b>111</b>, and a portion of the side wall of the active pillar <b>12</b> located at an even position is surrounded and covered by the second word line <b>112</b>. The first word line <b>111</b> and the second word line <b>112</b> are at least partially staggered in the direction perpendicular to the top surface <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. Of course, the first parity sequence may also be an even sequence and the second parity sequence may also be an odd sequence.
