More particularly, the present embodiments relate to biometric pre-identification.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Biometric identification systems may identify people using biometrics. Biometrics may include fingerprints, irises, retinas, eyes, faces, voices, gaits, pictures, or other identifying characteristics about a person. A biometric identification system may capture a biometric using a biometric reader and identify a person by comparing the captured information against stored information. For example, a camera may capture an image of a fingerprint and compare the image of the fingerprint against stored fingerprint images.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to biometric pre-identification. A station device may use identity to perform one or more actions. Identities may be determined (such as via a backend) using biometric information. A biometric pre-identification device may obtain biometric information and/or a digital representation thereof from a person approaching the station device. The biometric pre-identification device may transmit such to the station device, facilitating the station device to begin and/or perform various actions. The station device may begin or perform the actions using the identity determined based on the biometric information before the person arrives at the station device. In this way, the station device may be able to function faster and/or more efficiently as time for the actions after the person arrives at the station device may be decreased and/or eliminated. This technological solution may increase station device responsiveness, allow the station device to spread action performance across a wider time span without requiring the person to wait for action completion, and so on. This may also allow the station device to perform the function of having various actions completed upon the person's arrival as the station device was able to work on such actions prior to the person's arrival.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various implementations, a system for biometric pre-identification includes a biometric pre-identification device that obtains a biometric for a person and a station device. The station device receives an identity of the person determined using the biometric and begins an action using the identity prior to arrival of the person at the station device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, the system tracks the person between obtaining of the biometric and arrival of the person at the station device. In various examples, the biometric pre-identification device may be a biometric reader that is incorporated into or connected to the station device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In numerous examples, the action involves determining permissions for the person. In some such examples, the action further includes preparing credentials to provide using the permissions. In various such examples, the action further includes preparing access for the person using the permissions. In various examples, the action involves determining a device configuration for the person and configuring a device using the device configuration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, a station device that uses identification in a biometric pre-identification system includes at least one non-transitory storage medium that stores instructions, a communication unit, and at least one processor. The at least one processor executes the instructions to receive an identity of a person via the communication unit, the identity determined using a biometric obtained by a biometric pre-identification device, and perform an action using the identity prior to arrival of the person at the station device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various examples, the action includes determining a reservation for the person and performing a task in fulfillment of the reservation. In some examples, the action includes operating an entry mechanism using the identity. In numerous examples, the action includes summoning an elevator and programming a floor for the elevator. In various examples, the action includes adjusting a light or a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, the action includes determining a task previously requested by the person and arranging for the task to be performed. In numerous examples, the action includes determining an entitlement for the person and arranging for the entitlement to be provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In numerous implementations, a biometric pre-identification device includes a biometric reader, at least one non-transitory storage medium that stores instructions, a communication unit, and at least one processor.

In various examples, the digital representation of the biometric is at least one of a gait of the person, a retina of the person, an iris of the person, or at least a portion of a face of the person. In numerous examples, the digital representation of the biometric includes an override action that signals to override performance of a particular action</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In various examples, the biometric pre-identification device tracks the person to the station device after the digital representation of the biometric is obtained. In some examples, the biometric reader is a camera.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a first example of a system for biometric pre-identification.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a second example of a system for biometric pre-identification.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example system for biometric processing that may be used in a system for biometric pre-identification, such as the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and/or <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an example application programming interface client interaction for the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example application programming interface server interaction for the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an example data structure that may be used for the abstracted biometric identifier in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an example process flow of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an example of matching engine abstraction that may be used in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a first example method of biometric pre-identification.

It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The description that follows includes sample systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products that embody various elements of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that the described disclosure may be practiced in a variety of forms in addition to those described herein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The following disclosure relates to biometric pre-identification. A station device may use identity to perform one or more actions. Identities may be determined (such as via a backend) using biometric information. A biometric pre-identification device may obtain biometric information and/or a digital representation thereof from a person approaching the station device. The biometric pre-identification device may transmit such to the station device, facilitating the station to begin and/or perform various actions. The station device may begin or perform the actions using the identity determined based on the biometric information before the person arrives at the station device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this way, the station device may be able to function faster and/or more efficiently as time for the actions after the person arrives at the station device may be decreased and/or eliminated. This technological solution may increase station device responsiveness, allow the station device to spread action performance across a wider time span without requiring the person to wait for action completion, and so on. This may also allow the station device to perform the function of having various actions completed upon the person's arrival as the station device was able to work on such actions prior to the person's arrival.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, a security station may identify a person in order to issue the person a badge or other credentials for entering a secured area. A biometric reader or other device may obtain a biometric or digital representation thereof for the person as they approach the station. The person may be identified based on the obtained biometric and that determined identity may be provided to the station prior to the person's arrival at the station. The action or actions performed at the station using identity may thus be begun and/or completed prior to the person's arrival at the station. This may save time, simplify operations, and/or allow various other benefits over systems that do not biometrically pre-identify people.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>14</b></figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these Figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a first example of a system <b>100</b> for biometric pre-identification. The system <b>100</b> may include a biometric pre-identification device <b>102</b>, a station device <b>101</b> that uses identification, and a backend <b>103</b> or other device. As a person <b>190</b> approaches the station device <b>101</b>, the biometric pre-identification device <b>102</b> may obtain one or more biometrics and/or digital representations thereof for the person. The biometric and/or various digital representations thereof (such as one or more hashes, encrypted data structures, abstract biometric identifiers, and so on) may be transmitted to the backend <b>103</b>. The backend <b>103</b> may identify the person <b>190</b> based on the transmitted information. The backend <b>103</b> may transmit the determined identity and/or other information to the station device <b>101</b> (and/or to the biometric pre-identification device <b>102</b> or other device that then transmits the determined identity to the station device <b>101</b>. Based on the received identity, the station device <b>101</b> (and/or various devices and/or entities associated with the station device <b>101</b>) may begin and/or complete various actions for which the station device <b>101</b> uses identification. The actions may be begun and/or completed before the person <b>190</b> arrives at the station device <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, a person may enter a hotel. A camera may take a picture of the person's face. The person may be identified based on the picture. Based upon the identification, a hotel check in desk may begin preparing check in for the person before the person arrives at the check in desk.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By way of another example, a person may approach an airport security screening checkpoint. A camera may take a picture of the person's iris. The person may be identified based on the picture. Based upon the identification, various security screening procedures may be set in motion prior to the person arriving at the security screening checkpoint. For example, the person may be directed to a reduced or increased security screening line. By way of another example, a boarding pass may be printed and waiting for the person. In still another example, security officials may have been called to intercept, detain, and/or arrest the person due to outstanding warrants and/or other statuses.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">By way of yet another example, a person may provide a fingerprint on the way to a car rental kiosk. The person may be identified based on the fingerprint. Based upon the identification, a car meeting the person's stored preferences may be prepared and waiting for the person when the person reaches the car rental kiosk. In some cases, payment information may have been obtained and processed as well.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In yet another example, a person may enter the lobby of an office building the person works in. A camera may monitor the person's gait. The person may be identified based upon the gait. In response to the identification, an elevator may be summoned and programmed to the floor that the person works on prior to the person arriving at a bank of elevators.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some cases of such examples, the person may be entering the lobby to go to a floor that the person does not normally work on. In such an example, the system may be configured to recognize an override action, such as the person waving the person's hand above the person's head. When the system recognizes that the person who has entered has performed such an override action, the system may not program the person's usual floor, though the system may still summon an elevator for the person prior to the person's arrival at the elevator bank. The person may then manually indicate the non-normal floor to which the person wishes to go.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, the biometric may be actively and/or passively obtained using various biometric readers. For example, one or more cameras may take one or more pictures of a person's iris, retina, face, gait, and so on. By way of another example, one or more microphones may record the person's voice. In still other examples, the person may intentionally provide one or more fingerprints, facial images, palm prints, and so on. In various cases, various combinations of active and passive biometric gathering may be performed using one or more different biometric readers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In various cases, the person <b>190</b> for whom the biometric is obtained may be tracked between the obtaining of the biometric and arrival at the station device <b>101</b>. For example, the person <b>190</b> may be tracked on camera between when the biometric is obtained (which may or may not also involve the camera) and arrival at the station device <b>101</b>. This may ensure that the same person <b>190</b> identified is the person <b>190</b> for whom the actions at the station device <b>101</b> are performed. In this way, a person <b>190</b> may not be identified and actions performed at the station device <b>101</b> for them only to have another person slip in and take advantage of the actions performed for the original person <b>190</b>. Various configurations are possible and contemplated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a second example of a system <b>200</b> for biometric pre-identification. The system <b>200</b> may include a biometric pre-identifier <b>202</b> (such as a camera, fingerprint reader, iris reader, retina reader, voice recording device, gait detection device, and so on); one or more credentialing systems <b>203</b><i>b</i>; biometric identity storage <b>203</b><i>a</i>; and a check in desk, ticketing booth, elevator, badge station, or other station device <b>201</b>. The biometric pre-identifier may obtain a biometric for a person <b>290</b>. The person <b>290</b> may be identified using the credentialing system <b>203</b><i>b </i>and/or the biometric identity storage <b>203</b><i>a</i>. Based on the identification, the check in desk, ticketing booth, elevator, badge station, or other station device <b>201</b> may prepare and/or provide credentials, badges, tickets, pre-authorizations, and so on in a manner that is pre-printed and/or otherwise begun and/or waiting prior to the person's arrival at the check in desk, ticketing booth, elevator, badge station, or other station device <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various implementations, the identification technology discussed herein may enable visitors to residences, office buildings, theme parks, or any other place that uses badging, ticketing, or identification for entry, to be pre-identified using biometrics or other identity technologies and have their credentials, ticket, or general entry mechanism waiting for them at an entry point. The credentials, ticket, or entry mechanism may be physical, electronic, and may contain any information. For example, in the case of a building's badging station, a camera might identify a visitor while walking into the building and the visitor's badge is waiting and the visitor's escort has been automatically called.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Persons to be identified may be pre-registered or somehow known to the system <b>200</b>. Registration or pre-knowledge may be in any number of formats including, but not limited to, internet searches, social media identification, or inclusion in any number of approved identity lists, e.g. department of motor vehicle lists, passport lists, or any approved list that contains a photo or any other biometric or digital identity information.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Persons to be identified may have the opportunity to passively or actively provide their biometric or identification on their way to a checkpoint or other station device <b>201</b>. An example of an active method may include placing their fingerprints on a biometric reader. Passive methods may include long range iris scanning or facial recognition.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Upon identification of an individual, a lookup may be done in a credential, ticketing, or permissions system to determine whether the person has access or permissions. Once identification is complete prior to a checkpoint, the individual may need not stop or wait for entry or printed credentials.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Identity integration into ticketing, badging or building entry systems may enable permissioned individuals to have their credentials automatically and immediately pre-identified. For example, for companies that use visitor badges, the badge may be pre-printed for the individual ready for pick-up. In order to determine whether a visitor has credentials, the systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> discussed herein may integrate into local permission systems including, but not limited to, calendaring systems, access control lists, guest registers, and so on. Simultaneously, an employee who is being visited, or an appropriate escort, may be notified. Similarly, a ticket to an event may be printed and waiting, an elevator may be preselected to the correct floor, or subsequent biometric identifiers may allow access to permissioned areas.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example system <b>300</b> for biometric processing that may be used in a system for biometric pre-identification, such as the systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and/or <b>2</b></figref>. The system <b>300</b> may abstract a biometric ID (identifier) using one or more biometric readers <b>302</b> and/or one or more devices <b>301</b>, creating an abstract biometric ID that may be an image, a data structure, a hash, or any mathematical or computer based construct. The abstract biometric ID may represent any biometric type or modality. For example, abstract biometric ID may represent a finger, face, voice, iris, retina, or gait, and so on. This may give the abstract biometric ID the ability to work with any hardware, any modality, or multiple modalities at a single time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The abstract biometric ID, which may be secure in itself (for example, the abstract biometric ID may be a hash which may include data to uniquely compare with stored information related to the obtained biometric but may not include the biometric or a digital representation thereof in a way that allows for the biometric itself to be derived or determined), may be further secured through a multiple of protocols including dual certification https, in-flight encryption, and non-redundant encryption. This may mean that the abstract biometric ID may be encrypted in-flight using different protocols each time.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The abstraction technology of the present disclosure may allow the abstract biometric ID to be integrated with any matching engine <b>304</b> or matcher. A backend <b>303</b>, gateway, or other device that receives the abstract biometric ID may detect the biometric type of the abstract biometric ID and format the abstract biometric ID according to a proper template (e.g., a format specified for and/or appropriate to the particular matching engine <b>304</b> that matches that biometric type, the formatting putting the abstract biometric ID into a form that the matching engine <b>304</b> can compare against a corresponding biometric database) of one or many templates for singular or parallel processing (abstract data structure and so on).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case of multi-modal abstract biometric IDs (such as combination of a facial image, an iris, a retina, and a gait and/or any other such combination of different biometric types), the backend <b>103</b> may detect each of the modalities, run each of the modalities through an appropriate matching engine <b>304</b> or matcher. Through the prioritization of modalities, scores, and statistical combinatorics, the backend <b>303</b> may determine a most accurate and/or likely match (e.g., identify the person associated with the biometric).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An associated payment account such as a credit or debit card or pre-existing payment instrument may or may not be associated with biometric payment as part of actions associated with stations that use identification as disclosed herein. Options for payment may include, but are not limited to, a credit card on file, a pre-existing credit balance, ACH, through credit based offline payments, the creation of a line of credit, and so on.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Upon pre-identification, the system <b>300</b> discussed herein may simultaneously perform pre-identification, process payments, perform actions involving identification, communicate with various servers <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>f</i>, and validate any number of additional factors. These additional factors may include, but are not limited to, validating age data, financial risk, criminality, terrorism, credit risk, opening a line of credit, and so on. In some implementations, the system discussed herein may be operable to open a line of credit to process a payment that has been otherwise declined.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Multiple biometric types may be accepted at a single point of contact. The backend may determine, using the same or a different API call, which biometric type was used. The biometric API may use the abstract identifier by itself. In such cases, no additional information or hints may be required.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The biometric pre-identification system <b>300</b> discussed herein may or may not use a point of sale (POS) device <b>301</b> or system. In some implementations, the system <b>300</b> may integrate into commercial POS systems.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The biometric pre-identification system <b>300</b> may include libraries that enable the rapid reading and transmission of biometrics. Such libraries may be included for Android&#x2122;, iOS&#x2122; Windows&#x2122;, and/or other operating systems.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>300</b> may perform credit risk checks. This may allow for offline payments.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">By using a &#x201c;centralized&#x201d; backend <b>103</b> (e.g., a single system that various POS or other devices may connect to for biometric pre-identification, not necessarily a single device as the backend <b>303</b> may be one or more computing devices that may interact to perform the functions discussed herein such as one or more cloud computing configurations, cooperative processing configurations, and so on) for pre-identification and/or other identity verification, biometrics may be registered once, in any location, and reused across different ecosystems. In other words, any number of different devices using the API or software may transmit abstract biometric IDs to the backend <b>303</b> without people needing to separately register the associated biometric at each device <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The backend <b>303</b> technology may retrieve biometric data from any repository of biometric information. In some cases, the backend <b>303</b> may store such a repository. In other cases, the repository may be stored remotely.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The backend <b>303</b> technology may distribute and/or limit credit or debit card access to improve security and maintain payment card industry (PCI) compliance. The backend <b>303</b> technology may also distribute and/or limit access to other payment options, other private information for identified people, and so on.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Users may enter one or more biometrics into any biometric reader <b>302</b> of a device <b>301</b>. The device <b>301</b> may stand alone, be integrated into an on-premises POS, or be on a mobile device. There may be multiple devices present.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">An API may reside in an application that is integrated into the device <b>301</b> or connected devices. Examples of such devices <b>301</b> may include, but are not limited to, a point of sale device, a mobile device, tablet, or any other computer device. The API may receive the data from the device <b>301</b> and may generate and send an abstracted, encoded biometric identifier to the backend <b>303</b>. This abstract biometric ID may be of any form or structure (e.g., a hash and so on), may involve serialization or packetizing of a digital representation of the biometric, and/or various other processing. The abstract biometric ID may be unreadable on its own (for example, the abstract biometric ID may be structured in a way that can be coherently interpreted by a program that understands the format of digital data contained therein but otherwise appears to be a random string of zeroes and ones), may be of any modality (type of biometric), from any hardware. It may be sent via dual certificate HTTPS and on-the-fly unique encryption to the backend.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The backend <b>303</b> may decrypt the transmission, interpret the modality or modalities of the data structure of the abstract biometric ID, and dynamically create templates or formats associated with any number of matching engines <b>304</b> or matchers that are compliant with the sent modality or modalities. The matching engine <b>304</b> may execute on the backend <b>303</b> and/or on another device with which the backend <b>303</b> is operable to communicate.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The matching engine <b>304</b> may retrieve biometric information from any biometric repository, including the backend's own repository. In the case of multi-modal abstract biometric IDs, the backend <b>303</b> may detect each of the modalities, run each of them through the proper matching engine(s) <b>304</b> and through the prioritization of modalities, scores, statistical combinatorics, and so on, and determine a most accurate and/or likely match (e.g., identify a person associated with the biometric).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the abstract biometric ID is identified, the abstract biometric ID may be simultaneously and/or otherwise sent to a number of pre-identification, information, validation, and/or other services or servers <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>f</i>. Such services or servers <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>f </i>may include, but are not limited to, an age validation service, a terrorist risk service, a criminality service, a wanted list, a credit check service, a payment engine, a line of credit account validation service, and so on.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The API may return data (which may be received from the backend <b>303</b> and/or may be transmitted by a backend <b>303</b> to a station device associated with the device <b>301</b> running the API) that indicates one or all of the requested information. For example, requested information may include, but is not limited to, whether the individual is pre-identified, the identity of the individual, information about the individual to be used with actions performed by a station device using identification, whether the individual has an approved purchase, if they're of a specific age (such as twenty-one for purchase of alcohol or gambling services), if they have a risk score that indicates either a criminal or terrorist risk factor (e.g., money laundering), if they have an approved line of credit, and so on. This return may be formatted in a variety of ways. For example, the return may be itemized, with or without explanation, be a single decline with or without an explanation, be a risk score that can be assessed per merchant either through human intervention or through code written in a POS, and so on. The API may also return results, explanations, or codes based upon predefined rules, logic, algorithms, and so on. The API may transmit the results to an associated station.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In various implementations, upon the return of a positive identity match from an identification system, the API may return an identity object or token and, potentially, biometric information that may be integrated into any permissions, access, credentialing or ticketing system that stores the identity of the person. In the case of tickets or access that uses age verification or financial eligibility, this may be done simultaneously prior to the issuing of credentials.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the case of ticketing, payment may occur simultaneously. An associated credit card or pre-existing payment instrument may not be required to be associated with the biometric payment service. Options for payment include, but are not limited to, a credit card on file, a pre-existing credit balance, ACH, through credit based offline payments, or the creation of a line of credit.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various implementations, prior to an entry checkpoint (e.g., ticketing booth, ticket taker, building security desk, elevator bank), a person may actively or passively present a biometric or digital identity. Examples may include a face passing a camera, iris, retina, finger, voice, gait, and so on.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The API may reside in an application that is integrated into the device <b>301</b>, or a connected device, such as a mobile device, tablet, or any other computer device.

This identifier may be of any form or structure (e.g., a hash), may be unreadable on its own, and may of any modality, from any hardware. It may be sent via dual certificate HTTPS and on-the-fly unique encryption to the back-end.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The backend <b>303</b> may decrypt the transmission, interpret the modality or modalities and the data structure, and dynamically create templates or formats associated with any number of matchers compliant with the sent modality or modalities.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The matching engine <b>304</b> may retrieve biometric information from any biometric repository, including a repository of its own. In the case of multi-modal identifiers (e.g., different types of biometrics), the backend <b>303</b> may detect each of the modalities, run each of the modalities through the proper matching engine(s) and through the prioritization of modalities, scores, and statistical combinatorics, determine a most accurate and/or likely match (e.g., identify an associated person).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the image (abstract biometric identifier) is identified, the identity may be simultaneously sent to a number of information and validation services.

A station device may use identity to perform one or more actions. Identities may be determined (such as via a backend) using biometric information. A biometric pre-identification device may obtain biometric information and/or a digital representation thereof from a person approaching the station device. The biometric pre-identification device may transmit such to the station device, facilitating the station to begin and/or perform various actions. The station device may begin or perform the actions using the identity determined based on the biometric information before the person arrives at the station device. In this way, the station device may be able to function faster and/or more efficiently as time for the actions after the person arrives at the station device may be decreased and/or eliminated. This technological solution may increase station device responsiveness, allow the station device to spread action performance across a wider time span without requiring the person to wait for action completion, and so on. This may also allow the station device to perform the function of having various actions completed upon the person's arrival as the station device was able to work on such actions prior to the person's arrival.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the present disclosure, the methods disclosed may be implemented as sets of instructions or software readable by a device. Further, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the methods disclosed are examples of sample approaches. In other embodiments, the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the method can be rearranged while remaining within the disclosed subject matter. The accompanying method claims present elements of the various steps in a sample order, and are not necessarily meant to be limited to the specific order or hierarchy presented.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The described disclosure may be provided as a computer program product, or software, that may include a non-transitory machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which may be used to program a computer system (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present disclosure. A non-transitory machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing information in a form (e.g., software, processing application) readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). The non-transitory machine-readable medium may take the form of, but is not limited to, a magnetic storage medium (e.g., floppy diskette, video cassette, and so on); optical storage medium (e.g., CD-ROM); magneto-optical storage medium; read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); erasable programmable memory (e.g., EPROM and EEPROM); flash memory; and so on.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments.
