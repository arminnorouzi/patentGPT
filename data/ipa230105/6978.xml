id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of providing blind vertical learning includes creating, based on assembled data, a neural network having n bottom portions and a top portion and transmitting each bottom portion of then bottom portions to a client device. The training of the neural network includes accepting a, output from each bottom portion of the neural network, joining the plurality of outputs at a fusion layer, passing the fused outputs to the top portion of the neural network, carrying out a forward propagation step at the top portion of neural network, calculating a loss value after the forward propagation step, calculating a set of gradients of the loss value with respect to server-side model parameters and passing subsets of the set of gradients to a client device. After training, the method includes combining the trained bottom portion from each client device into a combined model.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

Decentralized learning paradigms, such as federated learning (FL) and Blind Learning (BL) provide means to train on datasets located at different data sources (clients) without transferring them to a centralized location. However, these paradigms learn from decentralized data that must consist of the same features across all data providers. For example, if learning from an Electronic Health Record (EHR) using patient features X, Y, and Z, then all data sources must provide EHRs with the same features (X, Y, Z). This type of data distribution is referred to as horizontal data partitioning. In contrast, vertical data partitioning refers to decentralized data consisting of distributed features of the same entity (e.g., patient). For example, the same patient can have some EHRs at one hospital with features (e.g., prognosis) for X and Y diseases and at the same time prognosis for Z disease at another hospital.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to describe the manner in which the above-recited and other advantages and features of the disclosure can be obtained, a more particular description of the principles briefly described above will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

Some of these aspects and embodiments may be applied independently and some of them may be applied in combination as would be apparent to those of skill in the art. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the application. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ensuing description provides example embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the following description of the exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an exemplary embodiment. It should be understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the application as set forth in the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As suggested above, it is extremely challenging for current FL and BL techniques to train using such vertically partitioned datasets. What is needed in the art is a method and system to enable neural networks to be trained on data sets that are partitioned vertically, meaning that decentralized data consisted of distributed features associated with a same entity such as a person or other entity. This disclosure also addresses an issue where the data types across different clients is different. For example, some data may be text, other data may be images or tabular data, and so forth. The neural network structure for processing different types of data will need to be different. Thus, this disclosure also provides for an approach to dealing with different data modalities.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This disclosure will first discuss some background approaches and then introduce the new approaches. In one aspect, a particular platform is used to enable a federated development or training of neural network models. The use of the disclosed platform for training models in this manner is disclosed as another embodiment herein. In yet another embodiment, data is encrypted as it is passed between a server and one or more client devices. Various types of federated learning (Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), split learning (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and split-learning peer-to-peer (Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) are disclosed herein. This disclosure describes as background two primary improvements over federated learning and split learning. The first is a blind learning approach (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) in which client side processing occurs in parallel and independent of other clients. The second disclosed approach (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b></figref>) relates to a multi-modal artificial intelligence (MMAI) training approach to handle different types of data from different clients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>13</b></figref> show background data such as concepts related to blind correlation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, related methods and information regarding how to perform processes in a &#x201c;shared space&#x201d; in which parties generate &#x201c;shares&#x201d; of their data and rather than sharing data with another party, they provide just a &#x201c;share&#x201d; of their data that does not reveal anything regarding their data.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typical federated learning involves passing a whole model from a server to a client device for training using the client data. The process can include using a number of different clients, each with their respective data, for training purposes. The approach typically is performed in a linear and iterative fashion in which the whole model is sent to the first client with data, then after training at the first client, the whole model is received back to the server for &#x201c;averaging&#x201d;. Then whole updated model is sent to second client with data for additional processing. Then that updated model is sent back to the server for additional &#x201c;averaging&#x201d;, and so on. In a split learning approach, the model is split and part is sent to each client but there still is a linear and interactive training process that is inefficient. The split-learning peer-to-peer approach also is performed linearly as peer clients share data in the linear process. Improvements in maintaining the privacy of data and efficiency in the training process are needed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As noted above, a blind learning approach is disclosed as a variation on the typical federated learning approach. A method in this regard includes splitting up, at a server, a neural network into a first portion and a second portion, and sending the second portion separately to a first client and a second client. The clients can have the data (MRIs, patient data, banking data for customers, etc.) and each receive a portion of the neutral network (a certain number of layers of the network up to a cut layer). The method includes performing the following operations until a threshold is met: (1) performing, at the first client and the second client, a forward step on the second portion simultaneously to generate data SA<b>1</b> and SA<b>2</b> (See FIGS. I-4); (2) transmitting, from the first client and the second client, SA<b>1</b> and SA<b>2</b> to the server; (3) calculating, at the server, a loss value for the first client and the second client; (4) calculating, at the server, an average loss across the first client and the second client; (5) performing, at the server, backpropagation using the average loss and calculating gradients; and (6) sending, from the server, the gradients to the first client and the second client. This approach provides an improvement over the federated learning approach and the split learning approach by causing the processing on the client side (or the &#x201c;data server&#x201d; side) to operate in parallel and independent of each other. This approach also differs from the split learning peer-to-peer approach as well. The independent data servers send their activations up to the server side which aggregates, averages or otherwise processes the data depending on the network requirement to obtain the final trained model.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another aspect of this disclosure relates to an improvement in developing an artificial intelligence model in which multiple different modes of data or types of data are available to be used for training. For example, different clients might have different types of data. One client might have images of X-rays or MRIs and another client may have text describing a patient's health condition. In this regard, a method can include splitting a neural network into a first client-side network, a second client-side network and a server-side network, sending the first client-side network to a first client. The first client-side network is configured to process first data from the first client, the first data having a first type. The first client-side network can include at least one first client-side layer. The method includes sending the second client-side network to a second client. The second client-side network is configured to process second data from the second client, the second data having a second type. The second client-side network can include at least one second client-side layer, wherein the first type and the second type have a common association.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method can further include receiving, at the server-side network, first activations from a training of the first client-side network on first data from the first client, receiving, at the server-side network, second activations from a training of the second client-side network on second data from the second client, training at least one server-side layer of the server-side network based on the first activations and the second activations to generate gradients and transmitting the gradients from the server-side network to the first client-side network and the second client-side network. In this manner, multiple different types of data, having a common relationship such as being related to single patient or a single type or category of patient, are used to train the model.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Blind Vertical and Multimodal Learning</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to this present disclosure, the concept of providing an approach to training a deep learning model from decentralized data sources in which the respective data from a respective client device differs from another type of respective data. The innovations in this approach include training a multimodal deep learning model from decentralized data using one global model. The approach is to split the global model into two parts with one at a server and one at each client device. The models at the client side are different from one another based on the corresponding data at each client. A fusion layer at the server combines the outputs from each client device. The method securely finds the common data records between the client devices and sorts them so that they belong to the same object during the training process so that different modalities of medical records, for example, from different hospitals are processed for the same patient as an example. A software tool and method can securely run different types of data transformations such as a resizing and normalization in preprocessing on each client.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One example method of blind vertical learning includes creating, at a server device and based on assembled data from n client devices, a neural network having n bottom portions and a top portion and transmitting, from the server device, each respective bottom portion of the n bottom portions to a respective client device of n client devices. During a training iteration for training the neural network, the following steps occur: accepting, at the server device, a respective output from each respective bottom portion of the neural network to yield a plurality of respective outputs, joining the plurality of respective outputs at a fusion layer on the server device to generate fused respective outputs, passing the fused respective outputs to the top portion of the neural network, carrying out a forward propagation step at the top portion of neural network, calculating a loss value after the forward propagation step, calculating a set of gradients of the loss value with respect to server-side model parameters and passing, from the server device, respective subsets of set of gradients of the fusion layer from the server device to a respective client device of the n client devices. Each of the n client devices calculates a local set of gradients corresponding to their local models, which is used to update local parameters associated with respective local models on the respective client device to yield a respective trained bottom portion of the neural network. The method also includes, after training, receiving and combining the respective trained bottom portion of the neural network from each respective client device into a combined model.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With respect to blind multimodal learning, an example method includes creating, at a server device and based on assembled data from n client devices, a neural network having n bottom portions and a top portion and transmitting, from the server device, each respective bottom portion of the n bottom portions to a respective client device of n client devices. The assembled data includes different types of data such as text data, image data, tabular data, streaming data, and so forth. During a training iteration for training the neural network, the following steps occur: accepting, at the server device, a respective output from each respective bottom portion of the neural network to yield a plurality of respective outputs, joining the plurality of respective outputs at a fusion layer on the server device to generate fused respective outputs, passing the fused respective outputs to the top portion of the neural network, carrying out a forward propagation step at the top portion of neural network, calculating a loss value after the forward propagation step, calculating a set of gradients of the loss value with respect to server-side model parameters and passing, from the server device, respective subsets of set of gradients of the fusion layer from the server device to a respective client device of the n client devices.

The subject matter should be understood by reference to appropriate portions of the entire specification of this patent, any or all drawings, and each claim.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The foregoing, together with other features and embodiments, will become more apparent upon referring to the following specification, claims, and accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Disclosed herein is a new system, a platform, compute environment, cloud environment, marketplace, or any other characterization of the system that will enable an improved approach averaging of models such that an individual client can obtain an average of a group of client models without getting access to data of the other models. In one aspect, the approach is called a blind learning approach that combines features from known approaches but that provides a training process that maintains privacy for data used to train the model from various client devices. This disclosure first discusses in more detail the federated learning approach, follow by the split learning approach and a split learning peer-to-peer approach and then introduces the novel federated split-learning approach. Additionally, the multi-modal artificial intelligent (MMAI) learning approach for different types of data is introduced as well. The novel federated split-learning approach and the MMAI approach build on several models including those mentioned above. The application will review these first approaches in more detail and then introduce the two novel learning techniques.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Federated Learning</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the federated learning approach <b>100</b>. This is an approach used by major companies now. A downside of this approach is that it proceeds &#x201c;linearly&#x201d; to one data provider at a time&#x2014;rather than in parallel. The example neural network shown is a fully connected feed forward neural network that is being trained using a federated learning approach. The training process in this case includes a server <b>102</b> creating a model <b>104</b> and sharing the model <b>106</b>A, <b>108</b>A and <b>110</b>A with respective clients <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> in a linear fashion. The clients train the respective model <b>106</b>A, <b>108</b>A, <b>110</b>A separately when they receive the model on their turn and respectively send their trained model data back to the server <b>102</b> as shown. The server <b>102</b> averages the models and produces a new model <b>104</b> with updated weights (a.k.a a trained model). The server <b>102</b> sends the new model or weights to the respective clients <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> in a linear fashion. The process is repeated a number of iterations or until a specific accuracy is achieved.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In each iteration, the server <b>102</b> averages all participating models to create a trained model B. Thus, the server has a fully-trained model <b>104</b> at any point of time. The term &#x201c;global model&#x201d; refers to the model that results from the training process. The global model is a trained object that will be used for an inference task. An inference task might be to evaluate a medical image to classify whether the patient has cancer or a broken bone or some other medical condition.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">An example of this approach being used, devices such as an electronic watch, or a mobile device, a device charging at night for example, and connected to a Wi-Fi network, could have its processor used to train neural network models. Thus, client 1 (<b>106</b>) could be an Apple watch, client 2 (<b>108</b>) could be another person's iPhone, and so forth. An example of a model is the Sin speech processing service offered by Apple. Every device is training the same model and the only difference is that the respective client is training on the data local to them. The model or data is transmitted back to the server <b>102</b> and the server averages the model together. The downside is that respective clients, such as client 1 (<b>106</b>), could be tricked into sharing something about the data being used to train the model. This would be a leakage of privacy data and raise the issued outlined above. The challenge of the federated learning approach is that there is no model privacy as the entire model is passed from client to client. There are high computational costs as each client processes the entire model, and a heavy communication overhead as the entire model is transmitted numerous times. A reconstruction attack can make training data venerable as well.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Split Learning</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a split learning centralized approach. A model (neural network) <b>204</b> is split into two parts: one part (<b>206</b>A, <b>208</b>A, <b>210</b>A) resides on the respective client side <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> and includes the input layer to the model and optionally other layers up to a cut layer, and the other part (B) resides on the server side <b>202</b> and often includes the output layer. Split layer (S) refers to the layer (the cut layer) where A and B are split. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, SA represents a split layer or data sent from A to B and SB represents a split layer sent from B to A.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, the neural network between B <b>204</b> and client 1 (<b>206</b>) is the B portion <b>204</b> plus the A1 portion (<b>206</b>A) with the communication of data SB<b>1</b> (<b>206</b>C) and SA<b>1</b> (<b>206</b>B) to complete the entire neural network. The training process is as follows in this model. The server <b>202</b> creates A and B and sends a respective model A (<b>206</b>A, <b>208</b>A, <b>210</b>A) to the respective client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. For every client, the operations include repeating the following in a linear or iterative fashion across the group of clients until some conditions occurs. The respective client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> on their turn downloads the most recent model A from the server <b>202</b> (Note that this step is different between the approach shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.). The clients <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> in their respective turn do a forward step on the model A and sends the output of A (i.e., activations at S only or SA<b>1</b> (<b>206</b>B), SA<b>2</b>(<b>208</b>B), SAN <b>210</b>B)) to the server <b>202</b> in addition to the required labels. The server <b>202</b> does a forward step on B using the SAs received from the respective client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. The server <b>202</b> calculates the loss function and the server <b>202</b> does backpropagation and calculates gradients at the S layer. The server <b>202</b> sends the gradients of S only (i.e., SB<b>1</b> (<b>206</b>C), SB<b>2</b> (<b>208</b>C), SBN (<b>210</b>C)) to the respective client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. This is process is performed linearly across the different clients such that the operations occur first for client <b>206</b>, followed by client <b>208</b>, and then client <b>210</b>. The client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> does backpropagation using the SB gradients received from the server <b>202</b> and the client <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> shares their updated A (SA<b>1</b> (<b>206</b>B), SA<b>2</b> (<b>208</b>B), SAN (<b>210</b>B)) with the server <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The horizontal axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is time such that the processing occurs in like a round-robin fashion from client to client.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, network A1 <b>206</b>A on client 1 can include a convolution layer and an activation layer.

The B network repeatedly (in round robin fashion) processes the different data from the different clients <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. It will ultimately arrive at an averaged reflection of the network. It never trains the network on all the data from all the clients <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> at the same time.

The model B cannot be tricked into revealing its data as it has never been trained on all of the data.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Split Learning in a Peer-to-Peer Environment</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a split learning peer-to-peer approach. A model (neural network) is split into two parts: one part (A) resides on the client side and includes the input layer, and the other part (B) resides on the server side and often includes the output layer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the client side part (A) is shown respectively as A1 (<b>306</b>A) at client <b>306</b>, A2 (<b>308</b>A) at client <b>308</b>, AN (<b>310</b>A) at client <b>310</b>. A split layer (S) refers to the layer where A and B are split. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, SA represents a split layer sent from A to B and SB represents a split layer sent from B to A.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example, the neural network between B and client 1 <b>306</b> is the B portion plus the A1 portion <b>306</b>A with the communication of data SB<b>1</b> <b>306</b>C and SA<b>1</b> <b>306</b>B to complete the entire neural network. The training process is as follows in this model. The server <b>302</b> creates A and B and sends A to the clients <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. For every client, the process includes repeating the following until some conditions occurs. First, the process includes downloading the most recent A from a previous client.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Note that this step is different between the approach shown in other figures. The process then includes performing a forward step on A and sending the output of A (i.e., activations at S only) to the server <b>302</b> in addition to the required labels. The server <b>302</b> performs a forward step on B using the SA received from the respective client <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. The server <b>302</b> calculates a loss function and performs a backpropagation and calculates gradients at S. The server <b>302</b> sends the gradients of S only (i.e., SB) to the respective clients <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. The client does backpropagation using the SB gradients received from the server <b>302</b>. The client shares their updated A with the server <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The peer-to-peer approach generally involves the respective client updating its A model by directly downloading it from a last trained client, or more broadly, by a previously trained client. In this regard, the process of training clients can occur in a round-robin fashion where the clients are trained sequentially. For example, if client 1 <b>306</b> gets trained first, then in a peer-to-peer model, rather than client 2 <b>308</b> updating its client-side model A2 from the server <b>302</b> or another trusted server, client 2 <b>308</b> updates its client model A2 by downloaded the client side model A1 from client 1 <b>306</b>. The previously trained model can be the last trained client model or it could be a model from some other previously trained client based on some criteria. For example, client 1 <b>306</b> and client 2 <b>308</b> may have their respective models trained. Client 3 <b>310</b> needs a client-side model update and might implement an algorithm or process to determine which client-side model to download between client 1 <b>306</b> and client 2 <b>308</b>. Note that the disclosure below implements a multi-model artificial intelligence training process that could apply here. If client 1 <b>306</b> processes images and its model A1 focuses on image processing, and client 2 <b>308</b> processes text and its model A2 focuses on text processing, and client 3 <b>310</b> processes images, then the algorithm or process could cause, in a peer-to-peer environment, the downloading of the client side model A1 to the client 3 <b>310</b> as its update.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one scenario, there is not enough information from split learning to achieve proper training of the neural network. It is assumed in this model that a good training approach could be that A and B are aggregated at the server <b>302</b> in plain text by simply stacking them (A and B).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Blind Learning</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the improvement to training neural networks disclosed herein. This improvement can be characterized as a blind learning approach and addresses some of the deficiencies of the approaches disclosed above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> introduces a parallel processing approach. The parallel and independent processing causes the model training to occur at a faster pace than the other models described above.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The blind learning approach does not perform the round robin processing described above. The server <b>402</b> splits the network at the &#x201c;split layer&#x201d; which is a user parameter inserted into the network definition codes. The &#x201c;top portion&#x201d; of the network is kept at the server <b>402</b> the &#x201c;bottom portion&#x201d; is sent to the respective data providers or clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> (the terms clients and data providers are used interchangeably here). The training starts at the very lowest network layer which is the layer closest to the data. Each layer reads either the data (from the first layer) or the output of the previous layer (all other layers).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The layers can calculate their output (these are termed &#x201c;activations&#x201d; because they come from an activation function) based on any valid network architecture command (convolutions, dropouts, batch normalization, flatten layers, etc.) and activation function (relu, tanh, etc.). When the last layer on the data side <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> has calculated its appropriate activations (i.e., output) those outputs are sent to the first layer on &#x201c;the other side of the split&#x201d;&#x2014;the first layer on the server side <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The following approach involves splitting the model up as before. A model is split into two parts: (A) on the client side and includes the input layer, and (B) on the server side and often includes the output layer. (S) is the split layer. The clients or data providers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> run independently and send back the answer if they have it. The code on the server <b>402</b> processes the data and sends back its output equally to all the clients as SB (<b>406</b>C, <b>408</b>C, <b>410</b>C).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An example training process is as follows. The server <b>402</b> creates A and B and sends the portion A (<b>406</b>A, <b>408</b>A, <b>410</b>A) to the clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>. The following steps are repeated until a condition is met (e.g., accuracy). All the clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> do the forward step on A simultaneously. Up to this point, all the calculations on the clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, are being done on independent servers and there is no dependency from one data server to the other. This approach highlights a one of the innovations disclosed herein. All these calculations by the clients/data providers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> can all operate in parallel, at the same time. This is in contrast to the linear or &#x201c;round robin&#x201d; fashion discussed above.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> each run their portion A (<b>406</b>A, <b>408</b>A, <b>410</b>A) of the neural network and generate a respective output of A (i.e., SA (<b>406</b>B, <b>408</b>B, <b>410</b>B) and send the output to the server <b>402</b>. The server <b>402</b> receives <b>3</b> different &#x2018;versions&#x2019; of the activations (one from each of SA<b>1</b>, SA<b>2</b>, SA<b>3</b>). At this point, the server <b>402</b> processes those activations &#x201c;appropriately&#x201d;, which can mean that the server <b>402</b> does different operations depending on the case. For example, the server <b>402</b> calculates the loss value for each client <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> and the server <b>402</b> calculates the average loss across all clients. The server <b>402</b> performs backpropagation using the average loss and calculates gradients at S. The server <b>402</b> sends gradients at S (i.e., SB (<b>406</b>C, <b>408</b>C, <b>410</b>C)) to all the clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other words, training on the server side <b>402</b> proceeds much like is described above. Once the first layer on the server side <b>402</b> is &#x201c;complete&#x201d; (either through averaging or aggregating what is received from the data providers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>) forward propagation occurs until the &#x201c;top&#x201d; of the network is reached. An additional innovation described in this disclosure is in the management of the activations coming from the data providers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> and how they get averaged, aggregated or some other treatment. Once the system arrives at the top of the model, the server <b>402</b> calculates the gradients necessary for back propagation, and sends them back down and across the split networks as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As noted above, the processing and the management of the activations by the server <b>402</b> can vary depending on different factors. For example, assume a case where all three data providers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> are supplying the same data (X-rays). In that case, the data will be combined horizontally which can conceptually mean that the data is &#x201c;stacked&#x201d; one file on top of the other. In this case, the activations that come up will most likely be averaged. The &#x201c;average of each activation&#x201d; will then be sent forward into the &#x201c;top half&#x201d; of the network.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a different case, the data can be &#x201c;vertically&#x201d; stacked, so Client 1 <b>406</b> has the first 40 columns of data (say a blood test), Client 2 <b>408</b> has the next 60 columns of data (say an Electronic Health record that includes data such as age, weight, etc.) and Client 3 <b>410</b> has the last 100 columns of data (say insurance information&#x2014;previous claims, etc.). In this instance, the three clients can be considered as establishing a combined &#x201c;record&#x201d; of 200 columns (aggregated vertically across the page). In this case, the activations will be &#x201c;combined vertically&#x201d; and sent forward into the server network. This and other approaches to combining data can be implemented. Note that the multi-model artificial intelligence model described more fully below builds upon the concept just described with respect to combining vertically the activations. More details will be provided below on this concept.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As noted above, the clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> run in parallel in this embodiment. This reduces the time it takes to train the model&#x2014;as all the processing is done in parallel. Further, this data is delivered over a particular platform. The applications incorporated above provide examples of the particular platform that can be used to deliver the data as disclosed herein. This will be discussed more below.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A global model in blind learning can be aggregated as follows. After the training is done, the system uses on the following approach to aggregate a global model, which will be used for the inference task. In a first approach, the server selects one of the models, Ai, to be aggregated with its model, B, to form the global model. The selection of Ai could be achieved using one of the following ways. For example, random selection could be used where the server selects a model (Ai) of any client <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> randomly. This random selection might be influenced by other factors, such as the currently available clients online, the types of data each client processes (text data, image data, temporal data) or based on the transmission speed or network delay between the two entities. The server then stacks both parts Ai and B to generate the global model.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another example, a weighted client selection could be used. For this selection criteria, the server <b>402</b> assigns each client a weight (i.e., a numerical value) that reflects their importance based on their data, computational powers, and other valuable assets they possess and contribute during the training process. For example, a particular model set (say data for a certain language, data associated with a type of image, data associated with a patient set, or data from a particular country or region) could get weighted heavily in the model development. Thus, if a country is selected, then the client devices from that country can be weighted more heavily than clients from other countries. Japanese-based client devices can be used for 80% of the model data, for example. Australia could be 10% and Canada could be the other 10%. In another example, data from a certain clinic associated with an outbreak of the flu or COVID could be weighted more heavily. In yet another example, the type of data might be weighted more heavily as well. Image data may be used for 70% of a model, while textual data for 20% and temporal data for 10%.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Yet another model could be an accuracy-based selection. In this case, the server <b>402</b> can test the accuracy generated from each client model Ai and then select the model that generates the &#x201c;best&#x201d; accuracy. The &#x201c;best&#x201d; can be identified by stakeholders, through a machine learning approach, or otherwise. These are all models of the first approach.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second approach can be where the global model is aggregated by averaging all clients' models Ai {1, N}. Each client first encrypts their model using homomorphic encryption and then sends the encrypted Ai&#x2032; data to the server <b>402</b>. The server <b>402</b> adds all the encrypted models, decrypts the addition results, and then calculates their average. The averaged A is then stacked with B to generate a global model. One approach could be a default approach, and optional approaches could be provided as well. The decryption processes and averaging process could also be spread between different servers, for example, with one process occurring on the client side and another process being performed by the server <b>402</b> to achieve the global model.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The approaches may vary through the development of the model. For example, the model may begin to be trained using a default approach and then the training could be adjusted such that a weighted approach is used to complete the model training.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A method example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and can include splitting up, at a server, a neural network into a first portion and a second portion (<b>502</b>), sending the second portion separately to a first client and a second client (<b>504</b>) and performing the following operations until a threshold is met:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0000">(1) performing, at the first client and the second client, a forward step on the second portion simultaneously to generate data SA<b>1</b> and SA<b>2</b>;<br/>(2) transmitting, from the first client and the second client, SA<b>1</b> and SA<b>2</b> to the server;<br/>(3) calculating, at the server, a loss value for the first client and the second client;<br/>(4) calculating, at the server, an average loss across the first client and the second client;<br/>(5) performing, at the server, backpropagation using the average loss and calculating gradients; and<br/>(6) sending, from the server, the gradients to the first client and the second client (<b>506</b>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">A computing device or devices performing the above operations can also be covered as well as a computer-readable storage device storing instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to perform these operations. The operations can be performed in any order and the method can include one or more of the operations.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">In another aspect of this disclosure, the platforms described in the patent applications incorporated above can provide the basis for communicating data back and forth in any of the federated models. For example, each of the clients and/or the server as well may be required to be logged onto a platform or one of the versions of the platform referenced in the applications incorporated herein. Therefore, delivering this functionality over a platform or an exchange configured as disclosed in these applications is also covered as an aspect of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In another aspect, a customer could chose SA, SB lines (vectors and numbers) which represent weights that need to be propagated. If a client wanted their data to be locked down without the server knowing anything about the data, that data can be homomorphically encrypted. The encryption process (which can include any encryption process) could be used in any approach disclosed above.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The incorporated patent applications above provide example platforms that client devices and/or servers can log into or may be required to be logged into in order to perform the blind learning approach disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">It is noted that in one aspect, the steps disclosed herein can be practiced by a &#x201c;system.&#x201d; The system can include the server and one or more clients together, or might just be functionality performed by the server. The system could also be a client or a group of clients, such as clients in a particular geographic area or clients groups in some manner that are performing the client-based functions disclosed herein. In one aspect, the &#x201c;server&#x201d; can also be a computing device (physical or virtual) on the server side as well as a computing device (physical or virtual) on the client side. In one example, a server can be on the client side and can receive back-propagation output of the respective client side models Ai and can synchronize a client-side global model in a round of training.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Thus, each of the server side system and the client side system can perform any one or more of the operations disclosed herein. Claims can be included which outline the steps that occur from the standpoint of any device disclosed herein. For example, the steps of transmission, calculation, and receiving of data can be claimed from the standpoint of a server device, a client device, or group of client devices depending on which embodiment is being covered. All such communication from the standpoint of an individual component or device can be included as within the scope of a particular embodiment focusing on that device.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In another aspect, the system can include a platform as disclosed in the patent applications incorporated by reference also performing steps in coordination with the concept disclosed above. Therefore, the platform as used to provide the blind learning process described herein is also an embodiment of this disclosure and steps can be recited in connection with the use of that platform for training models in a manner that maintains privacy of the data as described herein.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Typically the training of a neural network is performed on similar data types. For example, a neural network trained to identify cancer by receiving a patient image or a kidney is trained on images of kidneys that are and are not cancerous. Next is discussed a new approach to training which uses different types of training data together to train a neural network, using the blind learning approaches disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Multi-Model Artificial Intelligence Approach</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">As mentioned above, the MMAI innovation builds on the &#x201c;vertical aggregation&#x201d; idea described in an example of blind learning. The example related to all three clients <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> providing the same type of data&#x2014;either images (for stacking) or tabular data to be combined vertically. When the inventors were considering the vertical aggregation concept, they realized that this could be done with different types of data. For example, Client 1 could provide images, Client 2 could provide a blood test, and Client 3 could provide doctors textual notes. The significant difference is all of those data types require different network architectures. In this case, the developers of the system can't define one network and then let the server &#x201c;split&#x201d; it. Thus, part of the solution is to let the users define the network &#x201c;before the split&#x201d; for each data provider, and then define the network and aggregation technique on the server. This approach is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the multi-modal artificial intelligence (MMAI) platform or a machine learning (ML) platform <b>600</b>. The MMAI approach reduces the computational requirements and communication overhead of other approaches. Additionally, the training speed is much faster and the process maintains a much higher privacy in the data, including the fact that the model stays private as well.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">The MMAI platform <b>600</b> applies AI/ML techniques to multiple data types in one large AI model. Typically, different data types require different AI network architectures to yield accurate results. Images, for example, typically require special filters (convolutions), whereas text or speech require different &#x201c;time series-like&#x201d; treatment, and tabular data frequently works best with ML or feed forward architectures. The issue is that images are best understood by looking at all of the pixels together and &#x201c;convoluting&#x201d; them in various ways, whereas speech is best understood in the context of what came before and/or after a certain sound (i.e. in a manner similar to time-series data), etc. Because of these differences in processing, &#x201c;state of the art&#x201d; systems today typically process one data type (i.e. images, text, speech, tabular, etc.).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Most AI researchers recognize that breakthroughs in &#x201c;next generation&#x201d; accuracy can be achieved by adding more unique data to their models. This is essentially the equivalent to providing more data to the model to give it more context with which to discover interesting differences in cases. An example of this concept is a model that diagnoses Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib) by examining ECG (electro-cardiogram) data. The model can reach a certain level of accuracy based on the ECG data alone, but when the researchers add age, sex, height and weight to the ECG data, the model becomes far more accurate. The increase in accuracy is due to the four additional data types being able to help the model better understand what would otherwise look to the model like &#x201c;equivalent&#x201d; ECGs. Adding the four items or characterizations of the data can make the data more granular.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The MMAI platform <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> introduces a new generation crypography toolset to improve the training and protection of private data. The MMAI platform <b>600</b> provides the model with more data than is typically used to train AI/ML models and expands on the data. The approach adds a significant amount of data by combining different data types &#x2014;i.e. images and tabular data, for instance.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a first outside source of data <b>602</b>, which is shown as Wells Fargo bank.

Unfortunately, the typical processing of the X-ray image is not consistent with the typical processing of the tabular ECG data. With a few minor engineering additions, the above-disclosed split-federated learning tool can be used to address this incompatibility problem. Namely, new instructions can be provided to the tool to allow different data types to process in the existing pipeline.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In this case rather than an &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; split of the network architecture this variation on the idea allows the network architect (i.e. the data scientist developing the algorithm) to specify the specific network components desired for each data type. Each data type will need network architecture layers relevant to its data type (i.e. convolutional layers for images, Recurrent layers/Long Short Term Memory layers for speech, feed forward layers for tabular data, etc.). These disparate layers, each specific to the data type in question, will be specified such that they run on the &#x201c;data server&#x201d; side (almost like independent networks in and of themselves). The last layer of each &#x201c;independent network&#x201d; (per data type) will send it's activations &#x201c;across the split&#x201d; to the &#x201c;server side&#x201d;. The algorithm server side will have one consistent &#x201c;network&#x201d; that processes the incoming activations (from the data server side) appropriately. In some respects this approach is similar to an &#x201c;ensemble of networks&#x201d; (on the data server side) being aggregated into one final network on the algorithm server side (which ultimately produces the final &#x201c;answer&#x201d; from the &#x201c;ensemble&#x201d; of networks).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Split learning is a collaborative deep learning technique, where a deep learning network or neural network (NN) can be split into two portions, a client-side network A and a server-side network B, as discussed above. The NN includes weights, bias, and hyperparameters. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, where the data reside, commit only to the client-side portion of the network, and the server <b>710</b> commits only to the server-side portion of the network. The client-side and server-side portions collectively form the full network NN.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The training of the network is done by a sequence of distributed training processes. The forward propagation and the back-propagation can take place as follows. With the raw data, a client (say client <b>702</b>) trains the client-side network <b>702</b>A up to a certain layer of the network, which can be called the cut layer or the split layer, and sends the activations of the cut layer to the server <b>710</b>. The server <b>710</b> trains the remaining layers of the NN with the activations that it received from the client <b>702</b>. This completes a single forward propagation step. A similar process occurs in parallel for the second client <b>704</b> and its client side network <b>704</b>A and its data and generated activations which are transmitted to the server <b>710</b>. A further similar process occurs in parallel for the third client <b>706</b> and its client side network <b>706</b>A and its data and generated activations which are transmitted to the server <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Next, the server <b>710</b> carries out the back-propagation up to the cut layer and sends the gradients of the activations to the respective clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>. With the gradients, each respective client <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> performs back-propagation on the remaining network <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A. This completes a single pass of the back-propagation between a client <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and the server <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">This process of forward propagation and back-propagation continues until the network gets trained with all the available clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and reaches its convergence. In split learning, the architectural configurations are assumed to be conducted by a trusted party that has direct access to the main server <b>710</b>. This authorized party selects the ML model (based on the application) and network splitting (finding the cut layer) at the beginning of the learning.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">As noted above, a concept introduced in this disclosure relates to the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> each providing a different type of data but also where the different types of data have a common association. Thus, the selection of the machine learning model can be based on the types of data that are being processed on the client side, and the process of finding the cut layer can also depend on what types of data or the disparity in the different types of data. For example, for widely disparate data types across the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, the cut layer may be chosen to have more or less layers on the client-side networks <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A. In another aspect, the number of layers before the cut layer or split layer may vary across clients. Client <b>702</b> may be processing images and require 8 layers before the cut layer, while client <b>704</b> may process text and only need 4 layers before the cut layer. In this regard, as long as the vectors, activations or activation layer at the cut layer is consistent across the different clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> having different types of data, there is no requirement that the number of layers at the client-side networks <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A be the same.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">The synchronization of the learning process with multiple clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> can be done either in centralized mode or peer-to-peer mode. In the centralized mode, before starting training with the server <b>710</b>, a client <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> updates its client-side model <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A by downloading the model parameters from a trusted third-party server <b>710</b>, which retains the updated client-side model uploaded by the last trained client. On the other hand, in peer-to-peer mode, the client <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> updates its client-side model by directly downloading it from the last trained client. As noted above, previously-trained models may have a data type similarity to a current client that needs to update its model. For example, the similarity may be based on the data be images, textual data, speech data, video data, temporal data, and so forth. Thus, there may be an intelligent selection of which previously-trained client model to use to download from a peer. The processing by the server <b>710</b> can also be split in some cases between some processing on the server side and other processing at a federated server on the client side.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">As introduced above, client one <b>702</b>, client two <b>704</b> and client three <b>706</b> could have different data types. The server <b>710</b> will create two parts of the network and sends one part <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A to all the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>. The system repeats certain steps until an accuracy condition or other condition is met, such as all the clients sending data to the part of the network that they have, and sends the output to the server <b>710</b>. The server <b>710</b> calculates the loss value for each client and the average loss across all the clients. The server <b>710</b> can update its model using a weighted average of the gradients that it computes during back-propagation and sends the gradients back to all the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>. The clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> receives the gradients from the server <b>710</b> and each client <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> performs the back-propagation on their client-side network <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A and computes the respective gradients for each client-side-network <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A. The respective gradients from the client-side networks <b>702</b>A, <b>704</b>A, <b>706</b>A can then be transmitted back to the server <b>710</b> which conducts an averaging of the client-side updates and sends the global result back to all the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">It is noted that the server <b>710</b> functionality can be also broken into several servers that each perform the different operations (such as updating its model by one server and averaging the local client updates by another server, each located in different areas). In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> all process disparate types of data which normally would or could not be processed to develop an AI model.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">For example purposes, the A-fib model from above can be used to illustrate the process. Client one <b>702</b> could have ECG data, client two <b>704</b> could have X-ray data, and client three <b>706</b> could have genetic data. Client one <b>702</b>, for example, could be a hospital, client two <b>704</b> could be a medical diagnostics imaging company and client three <b>706</b> could be a bank or financial institution, in a manner depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. One of the clients could also have time-based data such as progressive information about the patient relative to weekly visits to the hospital for checkups.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The approach shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates how the system can implement new user instructions that allow a user to bring different data types together with the &#x201c;correct&#x201d; processing before the split or cut layer or as shown in the blind decorrelation block <b>708</b>. Each of those parts of the model can be independent, and will operate independently. In one aspect, the processing performed by the blind correlation block <b>708</b> will result in an activation layer or activations that are transferred to the server <b>710</b>. This approach is similar to the approach described above with the addition of the differences in data type amongst the clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">The server <b>710</b> will combine those activation layers in one of a multitude of ways. The server <b>710</b> can average them (which is also described above), but it could also concatenate them into one long activation layer. In another aspect, the server <b>710</b> could apply any mathematical function to achieve the desired combination of the activation layers. The server <b>710</b> can then process the combined activation layers further using any appropriate network architecture. In one aspect, a server on the client side can receive gradients and average the gradients to generate a global model of the various clients <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and send the global model to the server <b>710</b> for concatenation or for further processing.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">The ideas shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> represent an expansion and application of the split-federated learning tool set and provides a platform of off-the-shelf tools to bring disparate data types together into a superset AI model.

In this regard, although the different AI/ML techniques are different, as long as the resulting data at the cut layer is consistent and properly configured, the forward propagation and back propagation can occur and the models can be trained.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">In order to assist one of skill in the art to understand how the MMAI approach might work, the following is an example of actual commands per data type coming from the three data providers <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>.

The output of the solution disclosed herein is the Nth smallest value.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">The number of participants can be termed &#x201c;m&#x201d; and 1&#x2264;i&#x2264;m. The total numbers in the combined list Si is S=s1+ . . . +sn. The algorithm disclosed herein enables the various parties to securely compute the Nth value of the combined list Si. Note that the approach could be used a number of different times to find various Nth values. Also note that in this example, the data is numerical although in other aspects the data might not be numerical or might be a combination of numerical data and non-numerical data.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">Next, several examples shall be provided of the algorithm in practice. Assume in one example that there are the three parties shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> with data: L1=[1, 5, 6, 10], L2=[7, 0, 100] and L3=[3, 4, 550]. The sorted combined list is S<sub>i</sub>=[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 20, 100, 550]. An unsorted list can be W=[1, 5, 6, 20, 7, 01, 100, 3, 4, 550]. The goal is to determine or compute the Nth value in the combined list. Note that the list, if it were sorted as in Si above, that the third position, for example, would have a value of 3. In the example, we'll assume that the goal is to find the value in the third position. The value of N can be set by the participants or in some other fashion.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">The value of m is the number of participants which is 3 in this case. The value sj is the number of data in the list belonging to a user j. For example, user 1 has a sj value of 4 and the other two users have a sj value of 3. The value S is the total number of the data s1+s2++2 m, which in this case is 10.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">The SMPC (secure multi-party computation) protocol disclosed herein is equipped with SecureMult and SecureCompare on Ring R. An example of such protocols is found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/828,216, filed on Mar. 24, 2020. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference. These are multi-party primitives enabling parties to perform multiplication and comparison securely as would be known by one of skill in the art. A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations and which prevents values from becoming too large. A ring is a set R equipped as noted above with two binary operations which can be +(addition) and * (multiplication) satisfying three sets of axioms called ring axioms. First, R is an abelian group under addition that has a number of requirements. Next, R is a monoid under multiplication with several requirements and third, the multiplication is distributive with respect to addition with several distributivity requirements. One of skill in the art will understand more of the ring structure in math.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">In this example Ring R=[Z]264. This means that all the integers from 0 to 264 in the ring. The modulus of the ring is 264. In this example, the maximum value of the ring is 264 and if a number goes above 264, it gets wrapped around and starts over at 1. For example, if the modulus is 7, and a number being processed by the ring results in 11 (such as 5+6), the value would not be 11 because the maximum value of the ring is 7, but the number of would be 4. The reasons for the use of the Ring is to prevent the use of unlimited or infinite numbers when performing the operations disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">The protocol or algorithm includes performing a loop of steps until the loop ends on step (5). The first (1) step involves one of the parties creating m additive shares (m-1 shares for other users and 1 for themselves) from their list and distributing them among the other users and themselves. The goal of step (1) is to generate three sets of shares W1, W2, W3 of the set W used for the rest of the process to enable the parties to compute the Nth smallest value of the combined list securely.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">To do so, user number i, for each element A in their respective list, generates m&#x2212;1 random numbers r1, . . . , ri&#x2212;1, ri+1, . . . , rm&#x2212;1 (from the Ring) and distributes them between the other parties and sets their own share: ri=A&#x2212;r1&#x2212;r2&#x2212; . . . &#x2212;ri&#x2212;1&#x2212;ri+1 . . . &#x2212;rm&#x2212;1.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">Note that in step (1), each party computes their additive shares for each value A in their respective lists and shares the (m&#x2212;1) additive shares (one share of the group of additive shares) to the other parties and computes their own additive share for their own value in the propose position.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">This setup is needed to use the SMPC PROTOCOL which uses both the SecureMult and SecureCompare algorithms. See the patent application incorporated above by reference for data on the SecureCompare algorithm and how it works in practice.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">In the above example, party 2 has [7, 0, 100]. For each number in the list (say 7 for party 2), the respective party generates 2 random numbers (say 5, &#x2212;2) and sends r1=5 to party 1 and sends r3=&#x2212;2 to party 3 and sets his own share r2=7&#x2212;5&#x2212;(&#x2212;2)=4. If the system adds 5, &#x2212;2 and 4, the result is 7 and that's why this is called additive sharing. This process will be repeated for all numbers in the list. Each party gets only one share of the original value (7). The end of this process, for the one value 7 for the first party, each party's share will be as follows: Part 1 share: 5; Party 2 share: 4; Party 3 share: &#x2212;2. For each number in each list, each party gets one number as a &#x201c;share&#x201d; of that number. If the system repeats the process for all numbers in all lists, each party will end up with S=s1+s2+ . . . +sm shares. S=10 in this example.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">In one example, here could be an example of the sets of shares each party would have. If these lists are added, the W=[1, 5, 6, 20, 7, 0, 100, 3, 4, 550] would be obtained:</p><p id="p-0133" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i><sub>1</sub>=[3,0,2,&#x2212;3,4,5,50,12,8,214]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0134" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i><sub>2</sub>=[&#x2212;4,7,3,14,6,4,35,&#x2212;9,2,150]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0135" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i><sub>3</sub>=[2,&#x2212;2,1,9,&#x2212;10,&#x2212;2,15,0,&#x2212;6,186]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0136" num="0130">Note how for each position, if all the numbers are added, the appropriate value of W is obtained. Such as position 3, in which 2+3+1=6. Each party only has access to the respective list of shares which hides the values of the data from the other parties.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0131">Next in step (2), each party gets a share of a one-hot-code vector V of size S created by a trusted party. The goal of step (2) is to generate three sets of shares V1, V2, V3 associated with a hot-code vector V. Another goal is to select one of the numbers in the list randomly without letting the parties know which number that was selected. In other words, the goal is to select one number from the list of 10 numbers randomly but not tell the party which number they are evaluating. Each party has 10 numbers in their share of the combined list.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">The trusted party can have a computer system that performs the operations disclosed herein with the proper security and structure and management to consider being a trusted party. A hot-code vector is a vector consisting of only 0's and a 1 in which there is only a single &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the vector with all the other values being zero. In one example, V=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this example, it is the 6th position in the set of 10 values that is selected. However, how the system selects this number without telling the partis which value is being evaluated. Note that each of these 0's and the 1 is an additive share as defined above. For example, the system can generate randomly three sets of numbers:</p><p id="p-0139" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>1</sub>=[3,4,5, . . . ]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0140" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>2</sub>=[&#x2212;4,&#x2212;4,3, . . . ]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0141" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>3</sub>=[1,0,&#x2212;8, . . . ].<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0142" num="0133">The three parties will each get one of the randomly-generated set of numbers V1, V2, V3. The use of these three sets of numbers hides the selected number (the 6th position of V). Note that in the first position, the three shares (3, &#x2212;4, 1) add up to zero. The second position of the various V1, V2, V3 sets of numbers includes (4, &#x2212;4, 0) which adds up to zero, the third position adds up to zero as well (5+3&#x2212;8) and so forth. The sixth position of V has the &#x201c;1&#x201d; and the three shares in that case would add up to 1. Each of these sets of numbers is a respective V set. In step (3), each party, with their respective Vi set of numbers computes Ri=Sum(SecureMult(Wi,Vi)). For example, if W1=[3, 0, 2, &#x2212;3, 4, 5, 50, 12, 8, 214] and V1=[3, 4, 5, 3, &#x2212;2, 9, 3, 8, 3, &#x2212;4], then the sum of the secure multiplication of W1 and V1 (W1*V1) is 3*3+0*4+2*5+(&#x2212;3)*3+ . . . 214*(&#x2212;4)=R1. Assume in this example that R1=9, R2=17 and R3=&#x2212;6. These represent a share of a randomly selected number from the sets. There may be more details about how this secure multi-party multiplication operates to obtain these values but at a high level this is how it works. If you add these three numbers (9, 17 and &#x2212;6), the result is 20.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0134">Note that from the original W=[1, 5, 6, 20, 7, 0, 100, 3, 4, 550], the value of 20 is the in the 8th position of this list or the 8th smallest value. Each party then has a &#x201c;share&#x201d; at the end of step (3) of the 8th smallest value in the list or the number 20. None of the parties knows the number 20 but have shares of the number 20.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0135">Note as well that if V=[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] then the actual sum of the secure multiplication of V with W would be [0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], or 0+0+0+20+0 . . . +0=20. Neither the system nor the parties do this computation as they only have shares of W and V.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0136">Next, step (4) involves running the SecureCompare protocol on Ri and Wi to find the position of Ri in Wi. The parties get a set of V1, V2, V3 or shares of V as part of the SecureCompare protocol.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0137">Each party runs the SecureCompare (Ri, Wi) protocol and gets one share of the final result. The protocol returns the comparison result in &#x201c;real space&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0138">In step (5), if N=Pi+1 the protocol stops and returns Ri. In this case, N, the position the parties are trying to determine, is 3 and thus N does not equal 8 and the protocol is not ready to end but moves on to step (6).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0139">Step (6) involves determining if N&#x3e;Pi+1, which it is not. If it was, the system would remove all numbers smaller than Ri from their shares of W (or their Wi set) and set N=N&#x2212;(Pi+1). The process would then loop back to step (2) with the smaller number of shares in the respective Wi list.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0140">In step (7), if N&#x3c;Pi+1, then the system removes all number bigger than or equal to Ri (8) from their shares of W and then returns to step (2). In this case, since 3 is less than 8, for party 1, the new W1 becomes [3, 0, 2, &#x2212;3, 4, 5, 8] with 50, 12, 214 being removed.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0141">Then, with the new W1, the system now has 7 values in this set and once the steps are performed by each of the three parties, the process starts returns to step (2) with a new set of W1, W2, W3.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>1200</b> embodiment related to the use of shares to determine an Nth smallest value. The method <b>1200</b> enables separate parties to compute securely an Nth smallest value in a combined list of values from m number of parties W. In one example, the method is performed across multiple computing devices (an example of which is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) in that each party has their own secure computing systems and share data with each other but then perform the computations and comparisons securely on their own systems with the data they receive.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0143">The method <b>1200</b> can include (1) creating, by each party of the m parties, m additive shares for each value in a respective list of values for each party of the m parties to yield m lists of additive shares for each party of them parties (<b>1202</b>), (2) distributing, from each party of the m parties, m&#x2212;1 lists of additive shares from the m lists of additive shares for each party by distributing one of the m&#x2212;1 lists of additive shares to each other party of the m parties to yield a respective combined list of shares Wi having S values for each of the m parties, wherein S equals the total number of values in the combined list of values from the m parties (<b>1204</b>), (3) receiving, from a trusted party and by each of the m parties, a respective list of additive shares Vi associated with a hot-code vector V comprising a value of 1 randomly assigned a position in V and the rest of the values being 0 (<b>1206</b>), (4) computing, by each party of the m parties and via a SecureMult protocol, Ri=Sum(SecureMult(Wi,Vi,) (<b>1208</b>), (5) applying a comparison protocol to compare, by each party of the m parties, R against all elements in W, such that each party learns a total number of values in W that are smaller than R as a value Pi, where Pi is one share of the total number of values in W that are smaller than R and after combining all Pi values, all parties learn P, wherein a position or R in W is equal to P+1 (<b>1210</b>), (6) when N=P+1, returning, from each party, a value Ri and concluding the method (<b>212</b>), (7) when N&#x3e;P+1, removing, by each party, all numbers smaller than Ri (and Ri as well) from each party's Wi and setting N=N&#x2212;(P+1) to yield a new Wi and new N (<b>1214</b>), (8) when N&#x3c;P+1, removing, by each party, all numbers bigger than Ri (and Ri as well) from Wi to yield a new Wi (<b>1216</b>) and (9) returning to an earlier step such as step (3) (<b>1218</b>). Other secure multiplication and comparison protocols can be used as well other than those listed above for the parties to be able to compute the data they need in a secure way.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0144">The hot-code vector V has a number of values equal to S. This number of values S can change as the method iterates because the respective values of Wi are reduced in iterations which don't end in step (6). In step (7) the respective Wi is reduced where all numbers smaller or equal to Ri are removed and in step (8) it's all numbers bigger than or equal to Ri are removed from Wi. As these operations are performed in the shared space, it is each party operating on their &#x201c;additive shares&#x201d; that they received from the other parties and not on the actual raw data. This can be in contrast to &#x201c;real space&#x201d; in which the parties are operating on the real data and not additional shares of the data.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0145">The comparison protocol can be the SecureCompare protocol as discussed above. The method can loop or iterate from step (9) to step (3) until N=Pi+1. At that point, the method is done and the value of Ri is returned to the other parties or each respective party knows the value of Ri. Because each party operates in the &#x201c;shared space&#x201d; where they are operating on lists of numbers that are &#x201c;shares&#x201d; of the actual raw data, each party does not know what numbers are being compared. An owner of a value in the combined list only learns in the end that the value in the combined list W is smaller or bigger than a number the owner of the value does not know from the combined list W. The SecureMult protocol and the SecureCompare protocol operate on a Ring R set equipped with two binary operations. In one example, the Ring R=[Z]264 but other values of the modulus 264 can also be used as needed depending on the application of the method. The SecureMult protocol and the SecureCompare protocol include multi-party computation primitives enabling each party to perform multiplication and comparison securely.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0146">In another example, each party will have a secure and separate computer server or system.
