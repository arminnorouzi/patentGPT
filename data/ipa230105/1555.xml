There is a user-actuatable trigger <b>13</b> on the handle. A removable and rechargeable power tool battery pack <b>50</b> powers the pipe clamp driver tool <b>10</b>. The battery pack <b>50</b> may be of the type shown in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,598,705; 7,661,486; or U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0331335. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,598,705; 7,661,486; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0331335 are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the pipe clamp driver includes a motor <b>60</b>. The motor <b>60</b> of the exemplary embodiment is a brushless motor, but a brushed motor or other motors may be used. The motor <b>60</b> drives a transmission <b>61</b>. The transmission <b>61</b> in turn is connected to a drive shaft <b>62</b>. There is a home position magnet <b>63</b> on the drive shaft <b>62</b> and a home position sensor <b>64</b> adjacent to the home position magnet. The drive shaft <b>62</b> is supported by a ball bearing <b>65</b>. There may be various other ball or other bearings in the pipe clamp driver <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A spring engine <b>100</b> is positioned at an end of the drive shaft <b>62</b> opposite the transmission <b>61</b>. The spring engine <b>100</b> is secured in the housing <b>11</b> with a support structure <b>78</b>. The spring engine <b>100</b> includes a pair of drive springs <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and drives a driver blade <b>110</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). At the front of the tool there is a nose <b>201</b> and a contact trip <b>202</b>. The contact trip <b>202</b> is depressed to allow operation of the driver <b>10</b> and avoid driving when the driver nose <b>201</b> is not adjacent to a pipe. A magazine <b>200</b> holds a plurality of pipe clamps, such as the pipe clamp <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>. The magazine <b>200</b> feeds the pipe clamps to the nose <b>201</b> for driving. A platform <b>204</b> is biased upwardly towards the nose <b>201</b> by a biasing member, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to feed the pipe clamps to the correct position within the nose <b>201</b>. The pipe clamps may be collated into a collated set of pipe clamps <b>305</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. When operated, the spring engine <b>100</b> drives the driver blade <b>110</b> so that it drives a pipe clamp <b>300</b> at the nose <b>201</b> into a workpiece.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate various front perspective views of the pipe clamp driver <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the pipe clamp driver <b>10</b> without any pipe clamps loaded into the magazine <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the driver blade <b>110</b> in a firing or full compression position.

In the pickup/full extension position, the pipe clamp <b>300</b> has been driven by the driver blade <b>110</b> and will have been set into a workpiece when positioned against a workpiece before firing.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate the mechanical spring engine <b>100</b> in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side perspective view of the mechanical spring engine <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side cut-away view of the engine <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the drive shaft <b>62</b> feeds into the spring engine <b>100</b>. In particular, an end of the drive shaft <b>62</b> is connected to a drive wheel <b>66</b>. The drive wheel <b>62</b> includes a pair of drive pins <b>67</b> and <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The spring engine <b>100</b> includes a pair of drive springs, outer drive spring <b>101</b> and inner drive spring <b>102</b>. Outer drive spring <b>101</b> has a greater diameter than inner drive spring <b>102</b> and inner drive spring <b>102</b> is radially inside of outer drive spring <b>101</b>. The springs are held on a front end by a carriage <b>70</b> and at a rear end by a rear support surface <b>75</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the driver blade <b>110</b> is held by the carriage <b>70</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the carriage <b>70</b> is connected to the drive wheel <b>66</b>, and particularly is selectively connected to the drive wheel pins <b>67</b> and <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown, the driver blade <b>110</b> is connected to the carriage <b>70</b> at a carriage connector portion <b>73</b>. This causes the driver blade <b>110</b> to move with the carriage, both forward toward the nose <b>200</b> of the driver <b>10</b> and rearward toward the rear support surface <b>75</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The driver blade <b>110</b> has a first projection <b>111</b> and a second projection <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first projection and the second projection are spaced apart from one another at a distance S. The distance S may be at least 15 millimeters, at least 20 millimeters, at least 25 millimeters; at least 30 millimeters; at least 40 millimeters; or at least 50 millimeters. The distance S is measured in a direction transverse to a direction of travel of the carriage <b>70</b> and the driver blade <b>110</b>. The projections <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> contact nails <b>301</b> in the pipe clamp <b>300</b>. Having a forked driver blade <b>110</b> including two projections <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, allows the driver blade <b>110</b> to contact and drive at two different points at the same time. That is, the projection <b>111</b> can contact one nail <b>301</b> on a first side of a pipe clamp <b>300</b> while the projection <b>112</b> contacts another nail <b>301</b> on an opposite side of the pipe clamp <b>300</b>. This allows a relatively wide fastener, here a pipe clamp <b>300</b>, to be driven by the driver <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In operation, the motor <b>60</b> drives the transmission <b>61</b>, which rotates the drive wheel <b>66</b>. The drive wheel pins <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> interact with the carriage <b>70</b> to move the carriage <b>70</b> backwards towards the rear support surface <b>75</b> and compress the springs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. The carriage <b>70</b> is then decoupled and driven forward by the springs <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. The driver blade <b>110</b> is driven by the carriage <b>70</b>. The driver blade <b>110</b> contacts the pipe clamp <b>300</b> to drive the pipe clamp <b>300</b> held at the nose <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the driver blade <b>110</b>, including dimensions of the exemplary embodiment.

For convenience, the pipe clamps may be collated into sticks of multiple pipe clamps, for example, ten to twelve pipe clamps. The pipe clamps are held together rigidly enough for handling, while being able to break apart during firing. That is, when the driver blade <b>110</b> drives a pipe clamp, the pipe clamp must separate from the collated stick.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to the exemplary embodiments, the pipe clamps are held together by an interference fit between features that are part of the plastic clamp portion of the pipe clamps. In particular, there is at least one rib and one pocket on each clamp. The direction of the rib and pocket are parallel to the drive direction (i.e., the direction in which the pipe clamp is driven into a workpiece). This allows the top pipe clamp in a collated pipe clamp stick to slide off during the driving.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">An end view of a pipe clamp <b>300</b> with a mechanical collation feature is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>44</b></figref>.
