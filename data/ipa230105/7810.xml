It is therefore necessary within the design of the braking resistor assembly, but also in the configuration of the system connectivity, to ensure sufficient heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heat dissipation from the braking resistors can be accomplished, for example, by transferring heat across the surface of the braking resistors to an airflow. Although this can be implemented for example in the form of passive convection cooling, the cooling performance, i.e. the heat dissipation, is relatively low. However, a higher cooling performance can be realized by active cooling, in particular by virtue of a higher airflow rate and also a defined temperature of the cooling air.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention provide an alternative to conventional cooling concepts for braking resistors in a gantry of a computed tomography device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a gantry for a computed tomography device,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">wherein the gantry has a support structure, a pivot bearing, a rotating frame, a first braking resistor for electromotively braking a rotational movement of the rotating frame, and a heat conductor for dissipating heat from the first braking resistor,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein, via the pivot bearing, the rotating frame is rotatably mounted relative to the support structure about an axis of rotation and has a set of rotating frame components,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein the support structure has a fan for generating an airflow for cooling the set of rotating frame components and a pressure duct for guiding the airflow along at least one flow path,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">wherein the pressure duct has a pressure duct wall disposed between the heat conductor and the airflow</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the heat conductor and the pressure duct wall are interconnected to form a heat-conductor-to-pressure-duct-wall connection that is detachable, form-fitting, planar, and thermally conductive,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the heat can be transferred from the first braking resistor to the airflow via the heat conductor, the heat-conductor-to-pressure-duct-wall connection and the pressure duct wall.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the pressure duct wall constitutes a heat sink for transferring heat from the first braking resistor to the airflow.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, it can be provided that the gantry further has a rotary drive, in particular a motor, for electromotively driving the rotational movement of the rotating frame.
