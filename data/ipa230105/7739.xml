The internal resistances of loads cause the induced eddy currents to generate heat in loads itself.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, the induction coils are selectively operable to be fed by an alternating current (hereinafter indicated with AC current), which is provided by an electronic control system. The electronic control system generally comprises an inverter circuit providing the AC current to the corresponding induction coil, and an electronic control unit, which is configured to control the inverter circuit to vary the frequency of AC current flowing in the induction coil in order to regulate the electric power transferred from the inverter circuit to the load, i.e. the pieces of cookware containing food, based on a target cooking temperature.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some kind of inverter circuits have a quasi-resonant topology/architecture, i.e. QR inverter circuits, wherein a switching section includes a single power switching device, such as a IGBT-switch (acronym of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), which receives a pulsed enabling signal from a driver unit controlled in turn by the electronic control unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The induction cooking appliances provided with QR inverter circuits are particularly affected by losses of the IGBT-switch, which may reduce life-time of the inverter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">US20180176998 discloses a method for evaluating the necessary switch-on duration for making zero-voltage switching of a quasi-resonant inverter in an induction cooktop. The method includes: providing a pulse to turn a switching element associated with the quasi-resonant inverter, determining the peak voltage, i.e. the maximum voltage, across the switching element during the switch-off duration, determining whether the peak voltage across the switching element is greater than a threshold for the switch-off duration, and finally, when the peak voltage across the switching element is greater than the threshold, determining that the switch-on duration is sufficient for zero-voltage switching of the switching element.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF
