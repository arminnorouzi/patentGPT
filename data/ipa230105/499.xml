The joints are formed where two or more skeletal bones meet. Many joints permit movement between those two or more bones.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Between the joints of a body that permit motion, typically, cartilage is found. Cartilage provides lubrication for the motion and absorbs some of the forces to which a joint is subjected.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cartilage may wear down over time. As a consequence, the bones making up a joint may come into contact leading to pain and reduced joint function. Other causes of joint damage is arthropathy. Arthropathy, such as arthritis, is a disease of the joint that may lead to conditions such as pain, stiffness and swelling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An option to treat damaged joints is to replace the parts of the joint that are degraded or diseased with a prosthesis. A commonly used prosthesis is a total joint prosthesis. The total joint prosthesis is used to replace native or natural joint parts with an artificial joint. For example, in a total hip replacement procedure, a natural hip joint may be treated with a total hip replacement prosthesis. The total hip replacement prosthesis includes an artificial femoral part and an artificial acetabular part.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During a surgical procedure to replace a joint, the joint is prepared to receive its respective part using specialized instrumentation. One such instrument is a reamer. Reamers are an instrument used to remove parts of a bone to be replaced and may be used to shape the bone to receive the appropriate prosthetic member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a total hip replacement, reamers and impactors may be used to prepare the acetabulum of a recipient to receive a replacement cup prosthesis. Acetabular reamers are typically hemispherical and are used prepare a correspondingly shaped cavity in the acetabulum. Impactors are typically used to impact various parts used in other parts of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A known modular acetabular impactor and reamer system is disclosed by a US patent application with patent publication number US <b>2016</b>/<b>175</b>,<b>112</b>. The modular acetabular impactor and reamer system includes a main body extending between a proximal handle end and a distal end. The system also includes a transmission rotatingly extending within the main body. The transmission has an accessory mount. The system also has at least one impactor handle and a reamer handle removably coupled to the main body proximal handle end. The impactor handle has a drive shaft to drive rotation relative to the impactor handle. The reamer handle has a drive mount to drive rotation relative to the reamer handle. The system also has at least one impactor cup and a reamer module removably coupled to the main body distal end. The transmission and the at least one impactor cup and the reamer module correspondingly rotate relative to the main body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This known modular acetabular impactor and reamer system features multiple components and may be complicated to configure or switch between the different modes of operation.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an instrument configurable as a reamer and an impactor. The instrument has a body, a drive and an adjustable handle. The body has a distal end spaced apart from a proximal end relative to a longitudinal axis. The body has a handle coupling located near the proximal end. The body defines a channel running between the distal end to the proximal end. The drive has a first connector, a second connector and a drive shaft. The first connector is located adjacent the distal end of the body. The first connector is adapted to be connected to a driven instrument, such as, for example, a reamer head. The second connector is located adjacent the proximal end of the body. The second connector is adapted to be connected to a driving instrument, such as, for example, a power tool. The drive shaft is arranged in the channel. The drive shaft couples the second connector to the first connector. The adjustable handle is located near the distal end of the body. The adjustable handle comprises a grip spacing apart a leading end from a trailing end along a handle axis. The leading end couples the handle to the handle coupling. The trailing end is shaped to define an impaction plate. The adjustable handle is arrangeable relative to the body in a first and a second position. In the first position the leading end is arranged relative to the handle coupling such that the handle axis is offset relative to the longitudinal axis. In the second position the leading end is arranged relative to the handle coupling such that the handle axis is parallel to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A benefit of the instrument of the present invention is that the same handle can be used for different procedures. The provision of a single handle that enables the instrument to be adapted for at least a first and a second function may result in a less complicated process for configuring the instrument for different purposes. For example, the handle enables the instrument, in one configuration, to be adapted for use as a reamer and, in another configuration, to be adapted for use as an impactor. Such a handle may be easier to configure and improve efficiency with respect to known handles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, in the second position, the impaction plate is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, in the first position, the second connecter is engageable by the driving instrument, and the adjustable handle can be gripped by a user to provide additional support.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the adjustable handle is rotatably coupled to the handle coupling distal end of the body.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the adjustable handle is coupled to the handle coupling by a joint, the joint configured to enable adjustable handle to be swiveled between the first and second positions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the adjustable handle is removable from the handle coupling to enable arrangement of the adjustable handle in one of the first or second positions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the handle coupling has a faceted recess and the leading end of the adjustable handle is faceted. The leading end of the adjustable handle may be removable from the faceted recess and, due to the facets, may be capable of being selectively arranged into the faceted recess in either the first or the second position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, when viewed in cross section, the faceted recess and the faceted leading end have the same polygonal shape.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the instrument has a holding mechanism to hold the handle in the first and second positions. Preferably, the holding mechanism includes a latch to retain the handle in one of the first or second positions and a release mechanism to unlatch the latch so that the handle can be moved between the first and second positions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an instrument having a body, a drive mechanism and an actuator. The body has a proximal end and a distal end. The body defines a channel running from an opening in the proximal end to an opening in the distal end. The drive mechanism has a first coupling located near the proximal end connected by a drive shaft located in the channel to a second coupling located near the distal end. The draft shaft arranged to transmit torque applied to one of the couplings to the other. The actuator is arrangeable between a first and a second position relative to the first coupling. In the first position the actuator is engaged with the first coupling and is manipulatable to transmit an applied torque to the first coupling.

In the first exemplary function, the instrument is used for reaming. In the second exemplary function, the instrument is used for impaction. To switch between one functional mode and the other, the instrument has an adjustable handle. The adjustable handle is rearrangeable between first and second positions. In the first position, handle is arranged to facilitate reaming. In the second position, the handle is arranged to facilitate impaction.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0053">The adjustable handle has a grip spacing apart a leading end from a trailing end along a handle axis. The leading end has a handle coupling configured to couple the adjustable handle to the instrument relative to a longitudinal axis running from a proximal end to a distal end of the instrument. The handle coupling enables the handle to be adjusted between the plurality of functional modes. The trailing end defines an impaction plate.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0054">The handle can be adjusted relative to the longitudinal axis of the instrument between the first and second positions. In the first position, the leading end is arranged relative to the instrument so that the handle is offset relative to the longitudinal axis of the instrument. In the second position, the leading end is arranged relative to the handle coupling such that the handle axis is parallel to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0055">With the handle in the first position, the instrument is arranged in a reaming configuration.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0056">With the handle in the second position, the handle is arranged in impaction configuration. In this configuration, the impaction plate located in the trailing end is arranged to be struck with a surgical hammer by an operator.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0057">The instrument of the present invention has a reconfigurable handle that enables the instrument to be adapted for at least a first and a second function.
