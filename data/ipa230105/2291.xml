In particular, the production of such mixtures of colored and non-colored particles finds application in the production of commercial washing powders having a speckled appearance. In addition, such mixtures are valuable for brand recognition purposes: through the coloring of a specific weight percentage of a product, the customer can subsequently, through imaging techniques know that he has been provided with the product that he intends to use.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a mixture of colored and non-colored particles is produced from two production lines, one line producing colored particles and the other line producing non colored particles, and subsequent mixing of the colored and non-colored particles. An alternative to this production method is to produce a final non-colored product, for subsequent processing of part of this final product through a coloring step, after which the resulting colored particles are mixed with the non-colored particles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A problem with the conventional production of mixtures of colored and non-colored particles therefore is the cost associated to separate production lines. In the case of a coloring line downstream the production line for a non-colored product, a problem is that additional time, and hence costs, are required for producing the final mixture of colored and non-colored particles. In addition, the coloring agent then is present on the colored particles as an external coloring layer added onto finished non-colored particles. There is a risk that the coloring layer will be rubbed-off during storage and transportation of the mixture. This is especially relevant for products that require loading and discharge from the production site, before being processed to a bagging unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">GB 389508A relates to the production of fertilizers in granular form and its principal object is to reduce the tendency of such fertilizers to cake on storage or transport in bulk. It discloses the coating of such fertilizers with a thin smooth layer of&#x2014;a suitable anti-caking agent such as rock phosphate, calcium carbonate, talc or asbestos. The invention is suitably carried into effect by agitating a quantity of granules, which are preferably previously dried as far as possible, with a small quantity of powdered anti-caking agent e.g. 0.5-3 percent by weight of the granules. Colored granules may be obtained by using a colored non-caking substance (e.g. red iron oxide) or by admixing a suitable colored material (e.g. ultramarine) with the non-caking substance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The prior art does not suggest a process to produce a mixture of colored and non-colored fertilizer particles, in which the colored fertilizer particles are fully colored and their amount is precisely controlled, and without the need for using separate production lines for the production of differently colored fertilizer particles. The prior art also does not suggest a system for performing such a process. There thus remains a need for a cost-efficient process to produce a mixture of colored and non-colored fertilizer particles, in which the colored fertilizer particles are fully colored and their amount is precisely controlled, and also a need for a system for performing such a process. Such process should allow for the color to be either well absorbed in the fertilizer particles to be colored or adsorbed onto the surface of those fertilizer particles. Finally, the process should be versatile and allow for the production of a mixture of non-colored fertilizer particles and differently colored fertilizer particles without the need for using separate production lines for the production of differently colored particles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art also does not suggest a mixture of colored and non-colored fertilizer particles in which the colored fertilizer particles comprise a coloring layer that is both water soluble, and protected in order to prevent the rub-off of the color.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a method is disclosed for the continuous production of a mixture of fully colored and non-colored fertilizer particles having a median size of about 1 to 6 mm with a predefined ratio of fully colored and non-colored fertilizer particles, starting from a stream A of non-colored fertilizer particles, wherein the method comprises the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a1) continuously separating the stream A of non-colored particles into a stream C of non-colored fertilizer particles and one or more parallel streams B1, B2, . . .

It is therefore apparent that the color used for the coloring is different than the color of the non-colored fertilizer particle. A fully colored fertilizer particle thus comprises no or essentially no uncolored areas on its outer surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0054">The inventors have discovered that the method of the disclosure allows for the continuous production of a mixture of colored and non-colored fertilizer particles, with predefined ratios of one or more types of fully colored fertilizer particles and non-colored particles. Such mixtures are particularly useful for brand recognition purposes. The method avoids the need for subjecting part of the finished fertilizer product (obtained after a fertilizer particles production unit) to a (batch) coloring step and subsequently mixing the colored fertilizer particles with non-colored fertilizer particles. Therefore, the method of the disclosure results in reduction of the production time. In addition, the method of the disclosure avoids the need for preparing differently colored and non-colored fertilizer particles through separate process lines. Consequently, the method of the disclosure results in saving of production costs, both associated to the production equipment and to the operation of this equipment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0055">The method further presents the advantage that additional time is provided in steps c1) and also d1) for the color to either dry following adsorption onto the fertilizer particle, or to be absorbed by the fertilizer particle. In other words, step c1) allows for additional time for the completion of the coloring step b1).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0056">The use of non-rub-off coloring agents enables for a coloring layer to stay onto each colored fertilizer particle, which in turn allows for the control of the amount of fully colored fertilizer particles, downstream in the process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0057">The person skilled in the art will understand that the method can be performed such that only part of streams B1, B2, . . . Bn comprising the colored fertilizer particles, obtained from step b1) may be joined with the particle stream C in step c1), such that over time a buffer of colored fertilizer particles is accumulated while performing step b1). Alternatively, a buffer of colored fertilizer particles can be produced by performing the step b1) on fertilizer particles identical to those of the particles in the particle stream A, before performing the steps a1) to d1) of the method of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0058">According to one embodiment of the method of the disclosure, the process step d1) comprises coating the fertilizer particles with a non-coloring coating agent. As defined herein, the non-coloring agent is a substantially colorless agent that will not interfere with the imaging analysis of the mixture fertilizer product, in order for the customer to recognize and validate a certain brand. In particular, the non-coloring coating agent is a mixture comprising an amine-based active ingredients and mixtures of mineral oils and mineral waxes. When coated with one of those agents, the fertilizer particles will be protected from moisture and preserve their strength and not aggregate to each other, which is especially relevant for hygroscopic fertilizer particles. In addition, those agents may act as anti-caking agents. Moreover, those agents contribute to protecting a coloring layer onto the surface of each colored fertilizer particle, such that the coloring layer does not rub-off from the particle. As mentioned above, such coating step further provides the benefit of additional time for the color to either dry following adsorption onto the fertilizer particles, or to be absorbed by the fertilizer particles. In other words, the coating step allows for additional time for the completion of the coloring step b1).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0059">According to one embodiment of the method of the disclosure, the coloring agent is a water-soluble, polymeric coloring agent.
