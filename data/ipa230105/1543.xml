It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the disclosure. The figures may not be drawn to scale.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Coated abrasive articles are known in the art, and often include abrasive particles embedded in a make coat layer on a backing and coated with a size coat that can reduce shelling of the abrasive particles from the backing. Supersize or other functional layers, including functional layers as well as primer or laminate layers, can also be added to add functionality and/or change parameters of a coated abrasive article.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally, pattern coated abrasive articles exhibit better abrading efficiency than non-patterned coated abrasive articles. This may result from more efficient swarf removal from a workpiece, judicious engineering of the abrasive area, or the facilitation of lubricant and/or grinding aid to the work surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, a &#x201c;pattern&#x201d; on a coated abrasive article refers to an intentional placement of material on a backing, such that a portion of the backing, or a portion of the previous layer, remains uncoated. A patterned make coat, therefore, covers some, but not all, of a backing, such that portions of backing remain uncovered. A patterned layer of abrasive particles, similarly, may result in some, but not all, of a make coat being covered with abrasive particles. A pattern includes intentional designs with or without a repeating unit. A pattern may extend from a center of an abrasive disc, or a center axis of an abrasive belt, to an edge of an abrasive disc or abrasive belt. Pattern-coating is intended to include any suitable method of forming well-defined areas of a given material coating as well as open areas devoid of a given material coating. The patterned abrasive area can therefore be designed independent of any pattern present on the fabric substrate, to optimize both abrasive performance, dust extraction and antiloading properties. A pattern may include lines, swirls, polygonal shapes, letters, or numbers. Additionally, other text or product information could also be provided on the coated abrasive article. A pattern may also include color, such that portions of a final coated abrasive article have a first color, and portions of a final coated abrasive article have a second color.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also known in the art that abrasive particles may be pattern coated and/or aligned on a backing surface. In some embodiments, patterned drop coating can be achieved using an alignment tool by methods analogous to that described in PCT Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. 2016/205133 (Wilson et al.), 2016/205267 (Wilson et al.), 2017/007703 (Wilson et al.), 2017/007714 (Liu et al.). Transfer coating using a tool having patterned cavities can be analogous to that described in U.S. Pat. Appln. Publ. No. 2016/0311081 A1 (Culler et al.). In some embodiments, abrasive particles can be applied onto the make layer through a patterned mesh or sieve.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alignment of abrasive particles may be accomplished using electrostatic coating or magnetic coating, as described in PCT Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. WO2018/080703 (Nelson et al.), WO2018/080756 (Eckel et al.), WO2018/080704 (Eckel et al.), WO2018/080705 (Adefris et al.), WO2018/080765 (Nelson et al.), WO2018/080784 (Eckel et al.), WO2018/136271 (Eckel et al.), WO2018/134732 (Nienaber et al.), WO2018/080755 (Martinez et al.), WO2018/080799 (Nienaber et al.), WO2018/136269 (Nienaber et al.), WO2018/136268 (Jesme et al.), WO2019/207415 (Nienaber et al.), WO2019/207417 (Eckel et al.), WO2019/207416 (Nienaber et al.), and U.S. Provisional Nos. 62/914,778 filed on Oct. 14, 2019 and 62/875,700 filed Jul. 18, 2019, and 62/924,956, filed Oct. 23, 2019.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The terms &#x201c;cured&#x201d;, &#x201c;curing&#x201d; and &#x201c;curable&#x201d; refer to joining polymer chains together by covalent chemical bonds, usually via crosslinking molecules or groups, to form a network. Therefore, in this disclosure the terms &#x201c;cured&#x201d; and &#x201c;crosslinked&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate views of a coated abrasive article in accordance with embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, coated abrasive article <b>100</b> comprises backing <b>110</b> having first major surface <b>112</b> and second major surface <b>114</b> opposite first major surface <b>112</b>.

A size layer <b>140</b> is disposed over and bonded to make layer <b>120</b>, and abrasive particles <b>130</b>. Optional supersize layers or other functional layers are disposed over and bonded to size layer <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, one example form of a coated abrasive article is a coated abrasive disc <b>150</b>. However, other coated abrasive articles are also envisioned, such as abrasive belts.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Exemplary suitable materials for the backing include polymeric films, metal foils, woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, paper, vulcanized fiber, nonwovens, foams, screens, mesh, laminates, combinations thereof, and treated versions thereof. The coated abrasive article may be in the form of a sheet, disc, belt, pad, or roll. The backing may be rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible. In some embodiments, the backing should be sufficiently flexible to allow the coated abrasive article to be formed into a loop to make an abrasive belt that can be run on suitable grinding equipment. For applications where stiffness of the backing is desired, a flexible backing may also be used by affixing it to a rigid backup pad mounted to the grinding tool. For off-hand grinding applications where stiffness and cost are concerns, vulcanized fiber backings are typically preferred. In some embodiments, the backing may be circular and may comprise a continuous uninterrupted disc, while in others it may have a central arbor hole for mounting. Likewise, the circular backing may be flat or it may have a depressed central hub, for example, a Type 27 depressed center disc. In some embodiments, the backing has a mechanical fastener, or adhesive fastener securely attached to a major surface opposite the abrasive layer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The make layer, size layer and the optional supersize layer comprise a resinous binder which may be the same or different. Exemplary suitable binders can be prepared from corresponding binder precursors such as thermally curable resins, radiation-curable resins, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Binder precursors (e.g., make layer precursors and/or size layer precursors) may comprise, for example, glue, phenolic resin, aminoplast resin, urea-formaldehyde resin, melamine-formaldehyde resin, urethane resin, free-radically polymerizable polyfunctional (meth)acrylate (e.g., aminoplast resin having pendant &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated groups, acrylated urethane, acrylated epoxy, acrylated isocyanurate), epoxy resin (including bis-maleimide and fluorene-modified epoxy resins), isocyanurate resin, and mixtures thereof. Of these, phenolic resins are preferred, especially when used in combination with a vulcanized fiber backing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Phenolic resins are generally formed by condensation of phenol and formaldehyde, and are usually categorized as resole or novolac phenolic resins. Novolac phenolic resins are acid-catalyzed and have a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than 1:1. Resole (also resol) phenolic resins can be catalyzed by alkaline catalysts, and the molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol is greater than or equal to one, typically between 1.0 and 3.0, thus presenting pendant methylol groups. Alkaline catalysts suitable for catalyzing the reaction between aldehyde and phenolic components of resole phenolic resins include sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, organic amines, and sodium carbonate, all as solutions of the catalyst dissolved in water.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Resole phenolic resins are typically coated as a solution with water and/or organic solvent (e.g., alcohol). Typically, the solution includes about 70 percent to about 85 percent solids by weight, although other concentrations may be used. If the solids content is very low, then more energy is required to remove the water and/or solvent. If the solids content is very high, then the viscosity of the resulting phenolic resin is too high which typically leads to processing problems.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Phenolic resins are well-known and readily available from commercial sources. Examples of commercially available resole phenolic resins useful in practice of the present disclosure include those marketed by Durez Corporation under the trade designation VARCUM (e.g., 29217, 29306, 29318, 29338, 29353); those marketed by Ashland Chemical Co. of Bartow, Fla. under the trade designation AEROFENE (e.g., AEROFENE 295); and those marketed by Kangnam Chemical Company Ltd. of Seoul, South Korea under the trade designation PHENOLITE (e.g., PHENOLITE TD-2207).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Binder precursors can further comprise optional additives such as, for example, fillers (including grinding aids), fibers, lubricants, wetting agents, surfactants, pigments, dyes, coupling agents, resin curatives, plasticizers, antistatic agents, and suspending agents. Examples of fillers suitable for this invention include wood pulp, vermiculite, and combinations thereof, metal carbonates, such as calcium carbonate, e.g., chalk, calcite, marl, travertine, marble, and limestone, calcium magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate; silica, such as amorphous silica, quartz, glass beads, glass bubbles, and glass fibers; silicates, such as talc, clays (montmorillonite), feldspar, mica, calcium silicate, calcium metasilicate, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium silicate; metal sulfates, such as calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, sodium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate; gypsum; vermiculite; wood flour; aluminum trihydrate; metal oxides, such as calcium oxide (lime), aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, and metal sulfites, such as calcium sulfite.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Binder precursors may be applied by any known coating method, including, for example, including roll coating, extrusion die coating, curtain coating, knife coating, gravure coating, and spray coating.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The basis weight of the make layer utilized may depend, for example, on the intended use(s), type(s) and grade(s) of abrasive particles, and nature of the coated abrasive disc being prepared, but typically will be in the range of from 1, 2, 5, 10, or 15 grams per square meter (gsm) to 20, 25, 100, 200, 300, 400, or even 600 gsm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a method of making a pattern coated abrasive article in accordance with embodiments described herein.

It is contemplated that, in some embodiments, it may be more efficient to apply some layers in a coated abrasive article evenly, and only a subset of the layers with the desired pattern. It may also be helpful to have the pattern applied in all, or almost all layers. However, applying the pattern in a subset of layers may provide functional differences in abrasive efficiency, or it may serve to associate an abrasive article with a specific manufacturer, or to detect counterfeit products from a different manufacturer. Additionally, pattern coating may require special tooling. Reducing a number of coatings that require a pattern may, therefore, reduce the cost of manufacturing. However, improvements of pattern coating can still be seen when only a subset of the coatings are patterned. For example, a patterned make coat with a full size coat helps resist shelling.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In block <b>210</b>, a backing is provided. Exemplary suitable materials for the backing include polymeric films, metal foils, woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, paper, vulcanized fiber, nonwovens, foams, screens, mesh, laminates, combinations thereof, and treated versions thereof. Optionally, coated abrasive articles may further comprise, for example, a backsize (that is, a coating on the major surface of the backing opposite the major surface having the abrasive coat), a presize or a tie layer (that is, a coating between the abrasive coat and the major surface to which the abrasive coat is secured), and/or a saturant which coats both major surfaces of the backing. The backing may also have a laminate applied, as described, for example, in co-owned, pending U.S. Provisional Applications 62/945,242 and 62/945,244, both filed on Dec. 9, 2019.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In block <b>220</b>, a make coat is provided. The make coat may is applied as a curable make layer deposited on a major surface of a backing. Applying the make coat may be accomplished by any suitable method including, for example, spray coating, curtain coating, slot coating, roll coating, and/or knife coating. Coating weights will depend on the application, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the make coat precursor is applied on the backing with a pattern, as indicated in block <b>222</b>. For example, a make coat precursor may be spray coated through a mask, such that make coat precursor contacts and covers the backing substrate in a desired pattern. However, in other embodiments, the make coat precursor is applied as an even coating, as indicated in block <b>224</b>, such that the entire backing substrate receives a substantially even coating of make coat precursor. Other methods are also possible including gravure coating, flexographic printing, patterned roll-coating, screen printing or stencil printing, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In block <b>230</b>, abrasive particles are provided. As discussed herein, abrasive particles can include crushed abrasive particles, platey abrasive particles, and/or shaped abrasive particles. Applying abrasive particles may include, in some embodiments, providing abrasive particles of a first size, and a second size. Providing abrasive particles may also include, in some embodiments, providing multiple types of abrasive particles, such as shaped abrasive particles and crushed abrasive particles.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some preferred embodiments, at least some of the abrasive particles can be deposited according to a predetermined pattern. Examples of patterns include rectangular grids, parallel stripes, hexagonal grids, parallel wavy lines, checkerboard, spiral, and an array of partially-filled circles. Some example patterns are illustrated in U.S. Provisional Applications 62/945,242, filed on Dec. 9, 2019.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment where a patterned make coat precursor is applied in block <b>220</b>, it may not be necessary to deposit abrasive particles in a pattern, as particles landing on areas of the backing without make coat precursor will not adhere to the backing. Therefore, it may be possible to apply abrasives evenly over a make coat precursor, as indicated in block <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, it is also expressly contemplated that, regardless of whether a make coat is applied evenly or in a pattern, there may be benefits to applying abrasive particles in a pattern, as indicated in block <b>232</b>. For example, particles may be applied more densely in different areas of an abrasive article. Additionally, particles of different sizes may be applied in different patterns. Further, shaped abrasive particles may be applied in a different pattern, on the same article, than crushed abrasive particles. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pattern&#x201d; refers to the overall pattern formed by the abrasive particles, not to the individual abrasive particles that make up the pattern.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After, or during, deposition of abrasive particles, the curable make layer precursor is sufficiently cured (e.g., using heat and/or electromagnetic radiation) such that the make layer and the abrasive particles are secured to the backing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In block <b>240</b>, a size layer is applied. Applying a size layer may include, in some embodiments, applying a size layer precursor that is later cured to create the size layer. The size layer may be applied on a fully, or at least partially cured make layer. Coating may be accomplished by any suitable method including, for example, spray coating, curtain coating, slot coating, roll coating, and/or knife coating. Coating weights will depend on the application, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The curable size layer precursor is cured, for example, using heat and/or electromagnetic radiation. The size coat, in one embodiment, is applied in a pattern, as indicated in block <b>242</b>. The size coat may be applied as a pattern regardless of whether the make coat or abrasive particles are pattern coated. For example a size coat may be applied in a pattern to indicate a manufacturer or grade of the abrasive article. Additionally, a size coat may be applied as an even coating, as indicated in block <b>244</b>, over a pattern coated layer of abrasive particles and/or a pattern coated make coat layer. Because of the relative size of abrasive particles compared to an abrasive article, an evenly coated size coat may at least partially obfuscate patterning of the abrasive particles, creating an abrasive article that looks similar to a non-pattern coated abrasive article.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In block <b>250</b>, an additional functional layer may be provided. A functional layer may be applied in addition to, or as, a supersize coat. The functional layer may be deposited in a pattern, as indicated in block <b>252</b>, which may be the same or different from any abrasive particle pattern layer. Additionally, in some embodiments, the functional layer is applied in an even coating, as indicated in block <b>254</b>. For example, it may be desired to have grinding aid, for example, evenly deposited on an article. Additionally, the functional layer may also include grinding aids and/or anti-loading materials. For example, a supersize coat may be applied in a pattern to indicate a manufacturer or grade of the abrasive article.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A grinding aid is defined as particulate material, the addition of which to an abrasive article has a significant effect on the chemical and physical processes of abrading. In particular, it is believed that the grinding aid may: (1) decrease the friction between the abrasive particles and the workpiece being abraded; (2) prevent the abrasive particles from &#x201c;capping&#x201d;, i.e., prevent metal particles from becoming welded to the tops of the abrasive particles; (3) decrease the interface temperature between the abrasive particles and the workpiece; (4) decrease the grinding forces; and/or (5) have a synergistic effect of the mechanisms mentioned above. In general, the addition of a grinding aid increases the useful life of the coated abrasive article.
