The gas turbine engine <b>104</b> can be coupled to an aircraft <b>108</b>, where the aircraft <b>108</b> can include multiple instances of the gas turbine engine <b>104</b>. The gas turbine engine <b>104</b> can include a fan section <b>110</b>, a compressor section <b>112</b>, a combustor section <b>114</b>, and a turbine section <b>116</b>. The fan section <b>110</b> drives air along a bypass flow path, while the compressor section <b>112</b> drives air along a core flow path for compression and communication into the combustor section <b>114</b> then expansion through the turbine section <b>116</b>. A fan case <b>118</b> of the fan section <b>110</b> can be covered by a cowling <b>120</b> and may provide an installation surface that is cooler than other sections <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> of the gas turbine engine <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An engine control <b>122</b> can be mounted on the fan case <b>118</b> and covered by the cowling <b>120</b>. The engine control <b>122</b> is configured to monitor and control operation of the gas turbine engine <b>104</b> in real-time. In order to transfer configuration items, such as programs and data to and from the engine control <b>122</b>, contemporary systems typically require that the cowling <b>120</b> is opened and multiple cables of bundled wires are coupled to the engine control <b>122</b>. Such a process can ensure deliberate actions are taken in extracting data and performing updates to the engine control <b>122</b>; however, the process can be slow and require large lengths of customized cables. In embodiments, the communication adapter <b>102</b>, also referred to as a gas turbine engine communication gateway, is configured to establish communication with the engine control <b>122</b> and wireless communication with one or more offboard systems <b>106</b> external to the aircraft <b>108</b>. Similar to the engine control <b>122</b>, the communication adapter <b>102</b> can be mounted on the fan case <b>118</b> and covered by the cowling <b>120</b> of the gas turbine engine <b>104</b>.

In alternate embodiments, the communication adapter <b>102</b> can send a request to the engine control <b>122</b> to provide aircraft parameters received via the aircraft bus <b>218</b> and/or engine parameters computed by the engine control <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The communication adapter <b>102</b> can manage credentials and user authentication to limit access of the memory system <b>212</b> of the engine control <b>122</b>. User authentication can be defined for particular users or classes of users, such as equipment-owner users, maintenance technicians, engineering users, and the like. For example, a maintenance technician may have authority to adjust trimmable constants or reprogram certain regions of the memory system <b>212</b>. An engineering user may have authority to reprogram an operating system, boot program code, or application software in the memory system <b>212</b>, in addition to having permissions of the maintenance technician and the equipment-owner user. If user authentication fails, for instance, by user credentials not being recognized with respect to user authentication data, then the communication adapter <b>102</b> can block access of the offboard systems <b>106</b> from reading from or writing to the memory system <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Configuration items received for the engine control <b>122</b> and/or the communication adapter <b>102</b> may be encrypted using various cryptographic methods to further enhance security. For example, the communication adapter <b>102</b> can apply a cryptographic algorithm using one or more parameters received and cryptographic information to decrypt an encrypted configuration item. A combination of transmitted and stored cryptographic information can be used together for decryption based on &#x2018;shared secrets&#x2019; such that not all of the information is sent from the offboard systems <b>106</b> nor stored completely within the communication adapter <b>102</b>. After decryption, authenticity of the configuration item can be verified using, for example, a digital signature of the configuration item. The resulting file can be a decrypted and authenticated configuration item, which may be temporarily stored in memory system <b>222</b> or otherwise buffered during authentication and passed to the engine control <b>122</b> upon authentication.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Separating the communication adapter <b>102</b> from the engine control <b>122</b> can enable the communication adapter <b>102</b> and the engine control <b>122</b> to have different expected service life durations. For example, to stay compatible with changes in wireless communication technologies used by the offboard systems <b>106</b>, the communication adapter <b>102</b> may be upgraded at a faster interval than the engine control <b>122</b>. The communication adapter <b>102</b> can have a lower processing and storage capacity than the engine control <b>122</b> to reduce power requirements, weight, and other costs associated with the communication adapter <b>102</b>. Since the communication adapter <b>102</b> does not actively control the gas turbine engine <b>104</b>, development cycles may be reduced as compared to implementing flight critical control algorithms and hardware of the engine control <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of configuration items <b>300</b> of the engine control <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The configuration items <b>300</b> can include one or more of a boot control <b>310</b>, identification data <b>312</b>, an operating system <b>314</b>, an application <b>316</b>, constant data <b>318</b>, and/or configurable data <b>320</b>. Further, there can be multiple instances of the configuration items <b>300</b>, such as multiple instances of the application <b>316</b>, constant data <b>318</b>, configurable data <b>320</b>, and/or other items. The configuration items <b>300</b> can have different levels of criticality and authentication required. The boot control <b>310</b> can manage the loading and/or initialization of other configuration items <b>300</b>. The identification data <b>312</b> can define a number of configuration identifiers to confirm items such as an engine serial number <b>322</b>, an engine control serial number <b>324</b>, an engine control configuration version <b>326</b>, and other such identifiers.

One or more applications <b>316</b> that use constant data <b>318</b> and/or configurable data <b>320</b> can be invoked by the operating system <b>314</b>. The application <b>316</b> can be, for example, configured to control operation of the gas turbine engine <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The configurable data <b>320</b> can include adjustable parameters to tune monitoring performance and control performance of the engine control <b>122</b>, such as engine control trim data <b>328</b> and fault limit data <b>330</b>.

For example, the memory system <b>212</b> can include supplemental data storage, such as a data storage unit or programming plug to store configuration information, such as the identification data <b>312</b> and/or the configurable data <b>320</b>. Supplemental data storage can be accessed through an alternate memory interface, such as a serial interface of the engine control <b>122</b> rather than a primary memory bus of the engine control <b>122</b> that may be used to access executable instructions of the configuration items <b>300</b> and/or various types of data.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of a configuration management database <b>400</b> of an offboard system <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to track multiple engine configurations, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
