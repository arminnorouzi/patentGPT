Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Touch detection devices capable of detecting an external proximity object, what are called touch panels, have recently been attracting attention. Touch panels are mounted on or integrated with a display device, such as a liquid crystal display device, and used as display devices with a touch detection function. The touch screen panel described in U.S. Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0202829, for example, includes a plurality of detection electrodes formed in a matrix (row-column configuration). The touch screen panel described in U.S. Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0202829 performs touch detection on a display region based on capacitance changes in the detection electrodes. Display devices with a touch detection function include a button having an input function in a peripheral region around a display region. Widely known are techniques for integrating such an input button in the peripheral region of touch panels and display devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0202829, however, does not describe touch detection on the peripheral region. It may possibly be difficult for the detection electrodes provided in the display region to perform touch detection on the peripheral region.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A display device according to one aspect includes a substrate, a plurality of first electrodes disposed in a matrix in a display region of the substrate, a plurality of second electrodes disposed in a peripheral region on an outside of the display region of the substrate, a driver configured to supply a drive signal to the first electrodes and the second electrodes, and a plurality of wires coupled to the respective first electrodes.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a display device <b>1</b> includes a display panel <b>10</b>, a controller <b>11</b>, a gate driver <b>12</b>, a source driver <b>13</b>, a first electrode driver <b>14</b>, and a detector <b>40</b>. The display panel <b>10</b> includes a display portion <b>20</b> and a touch sensor <b>30</b>. The display portion <b>20</b> displays an image. The touch sensor <b>30</b> is a detection device that detects touch input.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The display panel <b>10</b> is a display device in which the display portion <b>20</b> and the touch sensor <b>30</b> are integrated. Specifically, part of members, such as electrodes and substrates, of the display portion <b>20</b> are also used as electrodes and substrates of the touch sensor <b>30</b> in the display panel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The display portion <b>20</b> includes liquid crystal display elements serving as display elements. The display portion <b>20</b> includes a plurality of pixels provided with the display elements and has a display surface facing the pixels. The display portion <b>20</b> receives video signals Vdisp to display an image composed of the pixels on the display surface. The display panel <b>10</b> may be a device in which the touch sensor <b>30</b> is mounted on the display portion <b>20</b>. The display portion <b>20</b> may be an organic electroluminescence (EL) display panel, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The controller <b>11</b> supplies control signals to the gate driver <b>12</b>, the source driver <b>13</b>, the first electrode driver <b>14</b>, and the detector <b>40</b> based on the video signals Vdisp supplied from the outside. The controller <b>11</b> is a circuit that controls a display operation and a detection operation performed by the display device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gate driver <b>12</b> supplies scanning signals Vscan to one horizontal line to be a target of display drive in the display panel <b>10</b> based on the control signals supplied from the controller <b>11</b>. As a result, one horizontal line to be a target of display drive is sequentially or simultaneously selected.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The source driver <b>13</b> is a circuit that supplies pixel signals Vpix to respective sub-pixels SPix (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) of the display portion <b>20</b>. Part of the functions of the source driver <b>13</b> may be mounted on the display panel <b>10</b>. In this case, the controller <b>11</b> may generate the pixel signals Vpix and supply them to the source driver <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first electrode driver <b>14</b> is a circuit that supplies display drive signals Vcomdc to first electrodes COML (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) of the display panel <b>10</b>. In touch detection, the first electrode driver <b>14</b> supplies detection drive signals Vcom to the first electrodes COML and second electrodes <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>55</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The controller <b>11</b> according to the present embodiment causes the display portion <b>20</b> to perform a display operation of performing display and causes the touch sensor <b>30</b> to perform a detection operation of detecting an object to be detected in a time-division manner. The first electrode driver <b>14</b> supplies the drive signals Vcomdc and Vcom to the first electrodes COML and the second electrodes <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>55</b> based on the control signals supplied from the controller <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The touch sensor <b>30</b> performs touch detection based on the basic principle of touch detection by a self-capacitance method (also referred to as a self-method). If the touch sensor <b>30</b> detects an object to be detected in a contact state, the touch sensor <b>30</b> outputs detection signals Vdet<b>2</b> to the detector <b>40</b>. The touch sensor <b>30</b> can also perform touch detection based on the basic principle of touch detection by a mutual capacitance method (also referred to as a mutual method). If the touch sensor <b>30</b> detects an object to be detected in a contact state by the mutual capacitance method, the touch sensor <b>30</b> outputs detection signals Vdet<b>1</b> to the detector <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present specification, a &#x201c;contact state&#x201d; indicates a state where an object to be detected is in contact with the display surface or in proximity to the display surface close enough to consider it in contact therewith. A &#x201c;non-contact state&#x201d; indicates a state where an object to be detected is neither in contact with the display surface nor in proximity to the display surface close enough to consider it in contact therewith.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The detector <b>40</b> is a circuit that determines whether a touch is made by an object to be detected on the display surface of the display panel <b>10</b> based on the control signals supplied from the controller <b>11</b> and on the detection signals Vdet<b>1</b> output from the display panel <b>10</b> in mutual capacitance touch detection. The detector <b>40</b> also determines whether a touch is made by an object to be detected on the display surface of the display panel <b>10</b> based on the control signals supplied from the controller <b>11</b> and on the detection signals Vdet<b>2</b> output from the display panel <b>10</b> in self-capacitance touch detection. If a touch is detected, the detector <b>40</b> calculates the coordinates at which the touch input is made, for example.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The detector <b>40</b> includes an analog front end circuit <b>48</b>, a signal processor <b>44</b>, a coordinate extractor <b>45</b>, and a detection timing controller <b>46</b>. The analog front end circuit <b>48</b> (hereinafter, referred to as an AFE <b>48</b>) includes a detection signal amplifier <b>42</b> and an analog/digital (A/D) converter <b>43</b>. The AFE <b>48</b> is an analog signal processing circuit that converts the detection signals Vdet<b>1</b> and Vdet<b>2</b> into digital signals and outputs them to the signal processor <b>44</b>. The detection timing controller <b>46</b> controls the A/D converter <b>43</b>, the signal processor <b>44</b>, and the coordinate extractor <b>45</b> such that they operate synchronously with one another based on the control signals supplied from the controller <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In touch detection, the detection signal amplifier <b>42</b> amplifies the detection signals Vdet<b>1</b> supplied from the display panel <b>10</b>. The A/D converter <b>43</b> samples analog signals output from the detection signal amplifier <b>42</b> at a timing synchronized with the drive signals Vcom, thereby converting the analog signals into digital signals.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The signal processor <b>44</b> is a logic circuit that determines whether a touch is made on the display panel <b>10</b> based on the output signals from the A/D converter <b>43</b>. The signal processor <b>44</b> performs processing of extracting a signal (absolute value |&#x394;V|) of the difference between the detection signals caused by a finger. The signal processor <b>44</b> compares the absolute value |&#x394;V| with a predetermined threshold voltage. If the absolute value |&#x394;V| is lower than the threshold voltage, the signal processor <b>44</b> determines that the object to be detected is in the non-contact state. By contrast, if the absolute value |&#x394;V| is equal to or higher than the threshold voltage, the signal processor <b>44</b> determines that the object to be detected is in the contact state or a proximity state. The detector <b>40</b> thus can perform touch detection.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The coordinate extractor <b>45</b> is a logic circuit that calculates, when the signal processor <b>44</b> detects a touch, the touch panel coordinates of the touch. The coordinate extractor <b>45</b> outputs the touch panel coordinates as output signals Vout. The coordinate extractor <b>45</b> may output the output signals Vout to the controller <b>11</b>. The controller <b>11</b> can perform a predetermined display operation or a predetermined detection operation based on the output signals Vout.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The detection signal amplifier <b>42</b>, the A/D converter <b>43</b>, the signal processor <b>44</b>, the coordinate extractor <b>45</b>, and the detection timing controller <b>46</b> of the detector <b>40</b> are provided to the display device <b>1</b>. The configuration is not limited thereto, and all or part of the functions of the detector <b>40</b> may be provided to an external control substrate, an external processor, or the like. The coordinate extractor <b>45</b>, for example, may be provided to an external processor different from the display device <b>1</b>. In this case, the detector <b>40</b> may output the signals processed by the signal processor <b>44</b> as the output signals Vout. Alternatively, the AFE <b>48</b> may be provided to the display device <b>1</b>, and the signal processor <b>44</b> and the coordinate extractor <b>45</b> may be provided to an external processor. In this case, the detector <b>40</b> may output the digital signals processed by the A/D converter <b>43</b> as the output signals Vout.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The following describes the basic principle of mutual capacitance touch detection performed by the display device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the basic principle of mutual capacitance touch detection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining an example of an equivalent circuit in mutual capacitance touch detection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of an example of waveforms of a drive signal and a detection signal in mutual capacitance touch detection. While the following describes a case where a finger is in contact with or in proximity to a detection electrode, the object to be detected is not limited to a finger and may be a stylus, for example.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a capacitance element C<b>1</b> includes a pair of electrodes, that is, a drive electrode E<b>1</b> and a detection electrode E<b>2</b> facing each other with a dielectric D interposed therebetween. The capacitance element C<b>1</b> generates fringe lines of electric force extending from the ends of the drive electrode E<b>1</b> to the upper surface of the detection electrode E<b>2</b> besides lines of electric force (not illustrated) generated between the facing surfaces of the drive electrode E<b>1</b> and the detection electrode E<b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first end of the capacitance element C<b>1</b> is coupled to an alternating-current (AC) signal source (drive signal source) S, and a second end thereof is coupled to a voltage detector DET. The voltage detector DET is an integration circuit included in the detection signal amplifier <b>42</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the AC signal source S applies an AC rectangular wave Sg at a predetermined frequency (e.g., a frequency of the order of several kilohertz to several hundred kilohertz) to the drive electrode E<b>1</b> (first end of the capacitance element C<b>1</b>), an output waveform (detection signal Vdet<b>1</b>) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> appears via the voltage detector DET.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the non-contact state, an electric current depending on the capacitance value of the capacitance element C<b>1</b> flows. The voltage detector DET illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> converts fluctuations in the electric current depending on the AC rectangular wave Sg into fluctuations in the voltage (waveform V<sub>0 </sub>indicated by the solid line (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the contact state, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, capacitance C<b>2</b> generated by the finger is in contact with the detection electrode E<b>2</b> or in proximity to the detection electrode E<b>2</b> close enough to consider it in contact therewith. The fringe lines of electric force between the drive electrode E<b>1</b> and the detection electrode E<b>2</b> are blocked by a conductor (finger). As a result, the capacitance element C<b>1</b> acts as a capacitance element having a capacitance value smaller than that in the non-contact state. The voltage detector DET converts fluctuations in an electric current I<sub>1 </sub>depending on the AC rectangular wave Sg into fluctuations in the voltage (waveform V<sub>1 </sub>indicated by the dotted line (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this case, the waveform V<sub>1 </sub>has amplitude smaller than that of the waveform V<sub>0 </sub>described above. Consequently, the absolute value |&#x394;V| of the voltage difference between the waveform V<sub>0 </sub>and the waveform V<sub>1 </sub>varies depending on an effect of an external object, such as a finger, in contact with or in proximity to the detection electrode from the outside. The voltage detector DET resets charge and discharge of a capacitor based on the frequency of the AC rectangular wave Sg by switching in the circuit. With the period Reset, the voltage detector DET can accurately detect the absolute value |&#x394;V| of the voltage difference.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, the detector <b>40</b> compares the absolute value |&#x394;V| with the predetermined threshold voltage, thereby determining whether an external proximity object is in the non-contact state or in the contact or proximity state. The detector <b>40</b> thus can perform touch detection based on the basic principle of mutual capacitance touch detection.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The following describes the basic principle of self-capacitance touch detection with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the basic principle of self-capacitance touch detection and illustrates a non-contact state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the basic principle of self-capacitance touch detection and illustrates a contact state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining an example of an equivalent circuit in self-capacitance touch detection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram of an example of waveforms of a drive signal and a detection signal in self-capacitance touch detection.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The left figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a state where a detection electrode E<b>3</b> is coupled to a power source Vdd by a switch SW<b>1</b> but is not coupled to a capacitor Ccr by a switch SW<b>2</b> in the non-contact state.

Consequently, the self-capacitance method determines whether operating input is made by a finger or the like using the fact that the voltage change characteristics of the capacitor Ccr vary depending on the presence of the capacitance Cx<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Specifically, an AC rectangular wave Sg (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) at a predetermined frequency (e.g., a frequency of the order of several kilohertz to several hundred kilohertz) is applied to the detection electrode E<b>3</b>. The voltage detector DET illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> converts fluctuations in the electric current depending on the AC rectangular wave Sg into fluctuations in the voltage (waveforms V<sub>4 </sub>and V<sub>5</sub>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the voltage level of the AC rectangular wave Sg rises by an amount corresponding to voltage V<sub>6 </sub>at time T<sub>01</sub>.
