On the other hand, also topical skin disorder treatments are sometimes accompanied by undesirable side-effects, especially at high doses.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure provides novel tapinarof/PDE4 combination compositions and takes aim at minimizing undesirable side-effects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention provides a topical combination composition comprising tapinarof, a PDE4 inhibitor and optionally at least one additional active agent selected from a retinoid, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor), a corticosteroid of potency class 1-4, an acaricide and combinations thereof.

The compositions of the instant disclosure and the combination of tapinarof with a PDE4 inhibitor are cancelling or diminishing this side-effect. The PDE4 inhibitor in the composition of this disclosure is selected from roflumilast, apremilast, crisaborole, rolipram, cilomilast, ibudilast, piclamilast and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the roflumilast is roflumilast free base, roflumilast N-oxide, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also provided is a topical combination composition further comprising at least one additional active agent selected from about 0.025% w/w to about 0.5% w/w of at least one retinoid; from about 2% w/w to about 10% w/w benzoyl peroxide (BPO); from about 0.1% w/w to about 3.0% w/w at least one Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor); from about 0.01% w/w to about 0.25% w/w at least one corticosteroid of potency class 1-4; from about 0.5% to about 5% w/w at least one acaricide selected from permethrin, ivermectin and crotamiton; and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It occurred to the present inventors, that topical combination compositions comprising tapinarof and a PDE4 inhibitor, optionally further comprising at least one additional active agent, may allow treatment of skin disorders for longer periods of time, exhibit improved therapeutic effects and also exhibit synergistic or additive effects in the treatment of a skin disorder. As a result, the combination compositions allow using lower dosage of the actives and diminish the product's side-effects like folliculitis, local irritation and contact dermatitis. The optional addition of at least one additional active agent selected from at least one retinoid; benzoyl peroxide (BPO); at least one Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor); at least one corticosteroid of potency class 1-4; at least one acaricide selected from permethrin, ivermectin and crotamiton; and combinations thereof further broadens the therapeutic activity scope of the tapinarof-PDE4 active agent combination composition.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the combination of tapinarof with a PDE4 inhibitor and optionally with an additional active agent provides additive and/or synergistic effects, enabling lower concentrations and dosages of the active agents, thus minimizing their side-effects. Both tapinarof and the PDE4 inhibitor have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities and their combinations have better activity than each of its constituents.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">&#x201c;Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is the major enzyme class responsible for the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular second messenger that controls a network of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators&#x201d; (Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology (Seventh Edition), 2016, Elsevier).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, there is provided a topical composition comprising from about 0.25% w/w to about 3.0% w/w tapinarof, from about 0.25% w/w to about 3% w/w of a PDE4 inhibitor and a carrier suitable for topical administration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some other embodiments, there is provided a topical combination composition further comprising about 0.025% w/w to about 0.5% w/w of at least one retinoid; from about 2% w/w to about 10% w/w benzoyl peroxide (BPO); from about 0.1% w/w to about 3.0% w/w at least one Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor); from about 0.01% w/w to about 0.25% w/w at least one corticosteroid of potency class 1-4; from about 0.5% to about 5% w/w at least one acaricide selected from permethrin, ivermectin and crotamiton; and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The tapinarof-PDE4 inhibitor combination composition of this invention has a double advantage vs. the use of tapinarof or an PDE4 inhibitor as single drugs: on the one hand the PDE4 inhibitor has the potential to alleviate the tapinarof side-effects, especially at high concentrations, and on the other hand the synergistic and/or additive effect may enable using lower active agent amounts. The addition of an PDE4 inhibitor to tapinarof potentiates the tapinarof therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There is an unmet need for methods of treatment of a skin disorder using topical combination compositions comprising tapinarof, PDE4 inhibitor, and optionally additional active agent in lower doses, devoid of serious side-effects, which may be used for extended periods of time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">Active Agents in the Compositions of this Disclosure:</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Tapinarof</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Tapinarof (3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans-stilbene, benvitimod, GSK2894512) is a first-in-class drug, whose mechanism is not yet fully understood. It is being developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (Stiefel, a GSK company) and Dermavant as a topical drug for treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. It was shown in both mouse models and in vitro human skin studies to inhibit specific proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 and interleukin-17A, and enhance skin barrier function (J Invest Dermatol. 2017 October; 137[10]:2110-9).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">According to Jancin B.

It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at a time.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">Rosacea's typical symptom is small, red, pus-filled bumps on the skin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin on the nose, cheeks, and forehead.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">Flare-ups often occur in cycles.
