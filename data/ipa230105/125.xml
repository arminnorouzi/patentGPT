Other studies even suggest that infants could perceive pain more acutely than adults and older children.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Infants and young children can experience diverse types of pain, from acute pain to established pain, which could for example be caused by inflammation that may become chronic. In infants and young children, like in adults, pain is associated with reactions such as increased heart rate, faster and shallower respirations leading to lower oxygen saturation, and higher arterial pressure. Such reactions caused by prolonged or repeated exposure to pain have been found to have a negative impact on the development of infants and young children and may lead for example to abnormal development of the pain system such as hyperalgesia or to impaired regulation of stress-related hormones, such as increased production of cortisol. See for example Ziraldo, Breanne, &#x201c;Infant Pain Management&#x201d; (2010); <i>Senior Honors Theses; </i>198, which can be obtained from Liberty University, Virginia, USA and is available at the date of filing under http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/honors/198.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Infants and young children are particularly exposed to specific sources of pain, such as abdominal pain. Causes of abdominal pain include abdominal discomfort and abdominal disorders. One example of a common cause of discomfort is for example colic. The cause of colic is not completely understood but it seems related to gut hypersensitivity to pain, so that gut distension caused by the normal passage of gas or feces leads to pain in colicky infants, causing extensive crying periods, poor sleep and reduced quality of life for both the infant and the parents. Abdominal pain may also result from other causes of discomfort such as impaired stool patterns, exposure to new food, bloating and cramps. Disorders also occur, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, e.g. infectious diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and functional abdominal pain disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a serious chronic and destructive disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It includes Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Functional abdominal pain disorders and non-destructive disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal migraine and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS). A further detailed definition of functional abdominal pain disorders is provided in Hyams et al.; Childhood Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: Child/Adolescent; Gastroenterology 150 (2016):1456-1468.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore desirable to reduce nociception in infants and young children. However, side effects associated with pain management medicines may be even more problematic in infants and young children than in adults. It would therefore be of particular interest to identify means of reducing nociception in infants and young children that are non-pharmacological and associated with low risk for the infant or young child. It would also be particularly advantageous to identify ingredients specially adapted to human infants and/or young children and capable of reducing nociception.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Mother's milk is recommended for all infants. However, in some cases breast feeding is inadequate or unsuccessful for medical reasons or the mother chooses not to breast feed. Infant formulae have been developed for these situations. Fortifiers have also been developed to enrich mother's milk or infant formula with specific ingredients.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such cases, it would be even more preferred to provide means to reduce nociception and thus to reduce the incidence of pain in infants and young children through nutritional intervention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The effect of nutritional ingredients, such as human milk oligosaccharides on pain has already been investigated in the prior art. US2016/0243139 discloses the use of synthetic compositions containing one or more human milk mono- or oligosaccharides for treating visceral pain. According to the teaching of this document, a large variety of human milk mono- and oligosaccharides can be used, the preferred ones being 2&#x2032;-FL, 3&#x2032;FL, DFL, LNnT, 3&#x2032;-SL, 6&#x2032;-SL or LNFP-1 and the most preferred ones being a mix of 2&#x2032;-FL and LNnT or LNT.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">WO2016/139329 relates to compositions for use in improving stool consistency or frequency in infants or young children, such effects being associated with prevention and/or treatment of colic and/or gut discomfort. For this benefit, a nutritional composition comprising at least one fucosylated oligosaccharide and at least one N-acetylated oligosaccharide is used. The fucosylated oligosaccharide and the N-acetylated oligosaccharide may be selecting within a broad list. Most preferred fucosylated oligosaccharide is 2-FL and most preferred N-acetylated oligosaccharide is LNnT.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would be useful to further optimize the effect of nutritional compositions on reduction of nociception in all infants and children.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some specific populations of infants and young children are particularly in need of compositions able to reduce perception of pain. Such infants and young children are for example preterm infants, low birth weight infant, and/or growth-retarded infants or young children. Indeed such infants are often experiencing adverse medical conditions and require significantly more frequent medical intervention than term infants and infants having experienced normal development. Many of such medical interventions are unfortunately painful for the infant or young child, which is thus faced with repeated and sometimes acute pain. For such infants it is particularly advantageous to complement pharmacological pain management with nutritional compositions capable of reducing nociception.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is clearly a need for developing suitable methods to reduce nociception in infants and young children.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There is also a need to deliver such health benefits in a manner that is particularly suitable for the young subjects (infants and young children), in a manner that does not involve a classical pharmaceutical intervention, as these infants or young children are particularly fragile.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There is a need to deliver such health benefits in these infants or young children in a manner that does not induce side effects and/or in a manner that is easy to deliver, and well accepted by the parents or health care practitioners.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There is also a need to deliver such benefits in a manner that does keep the cost of such delivery reasonable and affordable by most.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">There is thus clearly a need to develop alternative methods than the classical pharmaceutical intervention such as the use of pharmaceutical analgesics, at least because of the associated risk of side effects.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">There is also a need to develop alternative methods to reduce nociception in infants and young children which could also provide additional health benefits to the infants and young children.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present inventors have found that a composition comprising 2&#x2032;-FL can advantageously be used to reduce nociception in an infant or a young child. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that this oligosaccharide achieves this benefit, by increasing the production of kynurenic acid by the microbiota of the subject consuming 2&#x2032;-FL and via the consequent activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) by Kynurenic Acid. Kynurenic acid has in fact been found toto be able to trigger activation of the GPR35 receptor (Wang, et al 2006. Kynurenic acid as a ligand for orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. J Biol Chem. 281:22021-22028).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The receptor GPR35, which is highly expressed for example in the gastrointestinal tract, has been identified in numerous studies as being involved in the reduction of nociception and its activation has been described as causing analgesia (see for example Resta et al.; <i>Kynurenic acid and zaprinast induce analgesia by modulating HCN channels through GPR</i>35 <i>activation</i>; Neuropharmacology 108 (2016), 136-143; Cosi et al.; <i>G</i>-<i>protein coupled receptor </i>35 (<i>GPR</i>35) <i>activation and inflammatory pain: Studies on the antinociceptive effect of kynurenic acid and zaprinast</i>, Neuropharmacology 60 (2011), 1227-1231; and Zhao et al.; <i>Targetting of the Orphan Receptor GPR</i>35 <i>by Pamoic Acid: A Potent Activator of Extracellular Signal</i>-<i>Regulated Kinase and &#x3b2;</i>-<i>Arrestin</i>2 <i>with Antinociceptive Activity</i>; Mol Pharmacol 78(2010):560-568). Based on such studies, compounds capable of activating the GPR35 receptors have been considered for application as analgesic drugs and screening of GPR35 activators has been suggested as a method for identifying new analgesic drugs. Therefore, activation of the GPR35 receptor by Kynurenic Acid produced via fermentation of 2&#x2032;-FL via the gut microbiota provides strong basis for use of compositions comprising such human milk oligosaccharide for the benefit of reducing nociception.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Given the ability of the composition according to the present invention and comprising 2&#x2032;-FL to increase the production of Kynurenic acid by the microbiota of the recipient, such composition is also intended for use in the prevention and/or treatment of conditions which may benefit by the presence or increase of kynurenic acid production in the gut as already described in the literature. Such conditions include, but are not limited to: preventing and/or treating obesity or obesity associated metabolic dysfunctions (Milart et al, 2019. Kynurenic acid as the neglected ingredient of commercial baby formulas. Sci Rep. 9:6108 and Agudelo et al. 2018. Kynurenic Acid and Gpr35 Regulate Adipose Tissue Energy Homeostasis and Inflammation. Cell Metab. 27:378-392 e375., in preventing and/or treating of depression Savitz, 2017. Role of Kynurenine Metabolism Pathway Activation in Major Depressive Disorders. Curr Top Behav Neurosci. 31:249-267, promoting neuroprotection (Klein et al 2013. The neuroprotector kynurenic acid increases neuronal cell survival through neprilysin induction. Neuropharmacology. 70:254-260), preventing and/or treating inflammatory conditions (Wang et al, 2018. Kynurenic acid, an IDO metabolite, controls TSG-6-mediated immunosuppression of human mesenchymal stem cells. Cell Death Differ. 25:1209-1223 and Wang et al, 2006.

These carbohydrates are highly resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating that they may display essential functions not directly related to their caloric value. It has especially been illustrated that they play a vital role in the early development of infants and young children, such as the maturation of the immune system. Many different kinds of HMOs are found in the human milk. Each individual oligosaccharide is based on a combination of glucose, galactose, sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid), fucose and/or N-acetylglucosamine with many and varied linkages between them, thus accounting for the enormous number of different oligosaccharides in human milk&#x2014;over 130 such structures have been identified so far. Almost all of them have a lactose moiety at their reducing end while sialic acid and/or fucose (when present) occupy terminal positions at the non-reducing ends. The HMOs can be acidic (e.g. charged sialic acid containing oligosaccharide) or neutral (e.g. fucosylated oligosaccharide).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0090">A &#x201c;fucosylated oligosaccharide&#x201d; is an oligosaccharide having a fucose residue. It has a neutral nature. Some examples are 2-FL (2&#x2032;-fucosyllactose), 3-FL (3-fucosyllactose), difucosyllactose, lacto-N-fucopentaose (e.g. lacto-N-fucopentaose I, lacto-N-fucopentaose II, lacto-N-fucopentaose III, lacto-N-fucopentaose V), lacto-N-fucohexaose, lacto-N-difucohexaose I, fucosyllacto-N-hexaose, fucosyllacto-N-neohexaose, difucosyllacto-N-hexaose I, difucosyllacto-N-neohexaose II and any combination thereof. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the fucosyl-epitope of the fucosylated oligosaccharides may act as decoy at the mucosal surface. By a competition effect, it may prevent and/or limit the action of the pathogens responsible of infections (of viral or bacterial origin) or of their secreted components (e.g. toxins), especially by avoiding their binding to natural ligands, and without to be bound by theory, this is believed to therefore reduce the risk of infections/inflammations, and particularly the risk of LRT/ear infections and/or inflammations. In addition, the fucosylated oligosaccharides are thought to boost growth and metabolic activity of specific commensal microbes reducing inflammatory response and creating an environment unfavourable for pathogens thus leading to colonization resistance.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0091">The expressions &#x201c;fucosylated oligosaccharides comprising a 2&#x2032;-fucosyl-epitope&#x201d; and &#x201c;2-fucosylated oligosaccharides&#x201d; encompass fucosylated oligosaccharides with a certain homology of form since they contain a 2&#x2032;-fucosyl-epitope, therefore a certain homology of function can be expected. Without wishing to be bound by theory the 2&#x2032;-fucosyl-epitope of these fucosylated oligosaccharides is believed to be particularly specific to pathogens (or their secreted components) involved in the LRT and/or ear infections.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0092">The expression &#x201c;N-acetylated oligosaccharide(s)&#x201d; encompasses both &#x201c;N-acetyl-lactosamine&#x201d; and &#x201c;oligosaccharide(s) containing N-acetyl-lactosamine&#x201d;. They are neutral oligosaccharides having an N-acetyl-lactosamine residue. Suitable examples are LNT (lacto-N-tetraose), para-lacto-N-neohexaose (para-LNnH), LNnT (lacto-N-neotetraose) and any combinations thereof. Other examples are lacto-N-hexaose, lacto-N-neohexaose, para-lacto-N-hexaose, para-lacto-N-neohexaose, lacto-N-octaose, lacto-N-neooctaose, iso-lacto-N-octaose, para-lacto-N-octaose and lacto-N-decaose.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0093">The expression &#x201c;at least one fucosylated oligosaccharide&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one N-acetylated oligosaccharide&#x201d; means &#x201c;at least one type of fucosylated oligosaccharide&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one type of N-acetylated oligosaccharide&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0094">A &#x201c;precursor of HMO&#x201d; is a key compound that intervenes in the manufacture of HMO, such as sialic acid and/or fucose.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0095">A &#x201c;sialylated oligosaccharide&#x201d; is a charged sialic acid containing oligosaccharide, i.e. an oligosaccharide having a sialic acid residue.

If the final product is to be a powder, they may likewise be added at this stage if desired.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0189">The liquid mixture is then homogenised, for example in two stages.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0190">The liquid mixture may then be thermally treated to reduce bacterial loads, by rapidly heating the liquid mixture to a temperature in the range between about 80&#xb0; C. and about 150&#xb0; C. for a duration between about 5 seconds and about 5 minutes, for example. This may be carried out by means of steam injection, an autoclave or a heat exchanger, for example a plate heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0191">Then, the liquid mixture may be cooled to between about 60&#xb0; C. and about 85&#xb0; C. for example by flash cooling. The liquid mixture may then be again homogenised, for example in two stages between about 10 MPa and about 30 MPa in the first stage and between about 2 MPa and about 10 MPa in the second stage. The homogenised mixture may then be further cooled to add any heat sensitive components, such as vitamins and minerals. The pH and solids content of the homogenised mixture are conveniently adjusted at this point.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0192">If the final product is to be a powder, the homogenised mixture is transferred to a suitable drying apparatus such as a spray dryer or freeze dryer and converted to powder. The powder should have a moisture content of less than about 5% by weight. The fucosylated oligosaccharide(s) and the N-acetylated oligosaccharide(s) may also or alternatively be added at this stage by dry-mixing or by blending them in a syrup form of crystals, along with the probiotic strain(s) (if used), and the mixture is spray-dried or freeze-dried.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0193">If a liquid composition is preferred, the homogenised mixture may be sterilised then aseptically filled into suitable containers or may be first filled into the containers and then retorted.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0194">In another embodiment, the composition of the invention may be a supplement.

The study design involved supplementing the CHO-free YCFA medium with different carbohydrates 0.5% final concentration, either lactose (F1 control) or 2&#x2032;FL alone, a combination of 2&#x2032;FL and LnNT, or a combination of 2&#x2032;FL, diFL, 3&#x2032;SL, 6&#x2032;SL, LNT and LNnT. Four fermentation replicates (F1-F4) were conducted for each subject, and supernatants were collected after 24 hours and 48 hours. YCFA is a complex medium containing tryptone, yeast extract, and various minerals, vitamins, and short chain fatty acids; however, the typical CHO components (glucose, maltose, and cellobiose) were excluded in this case.<br/>For metabolite analysis, samples were extracted and split into equal parts for analysis on LC/MS/MS and Polar LC platforms. Proprietary software was used to match ions to an in-house library of standards for metabolite identification and for metabolite quantitation by peak area integration.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Results</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0205">We assessed the effect on KYNA of supplementing the media of in vitro fermented infant stool samples with various combinations of HMOs.
