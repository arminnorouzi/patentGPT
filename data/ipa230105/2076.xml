Floor-grounding points are either grounded through individually driven electrodes or are electrically bonded together in a grid system with the entire system grounded to underground metal piping or driven electrodes. Grounding the aircraft is usually done to protect the aircraft and personnel against hazards from lightning discharge, provide current return paths, protect personnel from shock hazard, and prevent accumulation of static charge.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Floor-grounding receptacles are supposed to be designed to minimize the tripping hazard; however that is only true so long as nothing is connected to the connecting point. Once a grounding cable is attached to a grounding point, it creates a tripping hazard. This is especially true when multiple grounding cables are attempted to be connected to the same grounding point. Another issue arises with damage to the cable connections at the grounding point as a result of vehicles driving around the airport hangar.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a novel device that connects to the airplane hangar grounding point which allows for multiple safe connections reduces tripping hazards for connected cables, and helps prevent damage to connected cables from vehicles in motion inside the hanger.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, in one embodiment, there is a grounding disk having a top and a bottom for use on an airport hangar grounding point comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a) a grounding connector on the bottom of the grounding disk capable of connecting to the airport hangar grounding point;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">b) a plurality of connecting grounding points connected to the grounding connector, each connecting grounding point having a connection point on the top of the grounding disk for attachment to a grounding cable and positioned below the top of the grounding disk;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">c) wherein the top surface of the grounding disk is tapered from a center of the top surface to a peripheral edge of the top surface; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">d) wherein the grounding disk can support at least 1000 lbf.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the top of the grounding disk.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cut away view of the grounding disk showing what is underneath the top of the grounding disk and the tapered shape.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the bottom of the grounding disk.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0014">While this invention is susceptible to embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure of such embodiments is to be considered as an example of the principles and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described.

The term &#x201c;means&#x201d; preceding a present participle of an operation indicates a desired function for which there is one or more embodiments, i.e., one or more methods, devices, or apparatuses for achieving the desired function and that one skilled in the art could select from these or their equivalent in view of the disclosure herein, and use of the term &#x201c;means&#x201d; is not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">As used herein, the term &#x201c;grounding disk&#x201d; refers to a device that fits onto an airport hangar grounding point to provide both multiple connecting grounding points, as well as protection of the cables from vehicles driving over the airport hangar grounding point. The airport hangar grounding point is normally a vertical electrical connection point, such as a vertical rod. The grounding disk fits over the airport hangar grounding point and makes an electrical connection and splits off to make two or more connecting grounding points. It is noted that there are recesses in the top of the grounding disk for attaching the grounding cable and since it is recessed below, the top protects the cable connection if someone runs over the grounding disk with a vehicle. In the embodiment shown in the drawings, the disk is round, but any shape can serve the purpose including rectangular, and the like. The grounding disk is reinforced, such that it can support at least 1000 lbf (pound force). The grounding disk, in another embodiment, is about 11 to 14 inches in diameter. The disk has a center height in one embodiment of about 1.5 to about 2.5 inches. In one embodiment, the disk is made of a reinforced plastic, but metal and other materials can be used as long as they don't cause faulty grounding.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;airport hangar grounding point&#x201d; refers to built into the floor grounding bars or rods used during the refueling process to ensure that the plane and the refueling apparatus are at the same electrical potential and to dissipate the electrical charge that is generated by the fuel transfer process. The airplane is connected to the airport hangar grounding point by use of a grounding cable.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;grounding connector&#x201d; refers to a connector at the bottom of the grounding disk capable of connecting to an airport hangar grounding point. Shown in the figures, is an example of a connecting point for fitting on an upright airport hangar grounding point. The grounding disk has a recessed cavity for accepting the airport hangar grounding point and making an electrical connection.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;capable of connecting&#x201d; refers to the grounding connector being of a shape and configuration to attach electrically to the airport hangar grounding point. It can do this by any method of connection, including a recessed grounding connector, and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;connecting grounding points&#x201d; refers to connectors that connect a grounding cable in a position to ensure a solid clip, screw, connecting attachment, bayonet type connector, plug, or the like. This replaces the use of spring-loaded clips that can easily be kicked loose.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;grounding cable&#x201d; refers to a cable that at one end connects to an airplane or other device that needs grounding, and at the other end is connected to one of the static grounding points in the hangar floor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;top surface&#x201d; refers to the uppermost portions of the top of the grounding disk, as opposed to the recesses on the top that are designed to attach a grounding cable to, and protect the connection of the grounding cable to the grounding connector. The figures help with understanding the top surface. In one embodiment, the top surface is textured.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;positioned below the top surface&#x201d; refers to the channels that one can connect a grounding cable to and since they are in a recess, the channels protect the grounding cable from damage resulting from running over a cable connector.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tapered&#x201d; refers to the grounding disk being higher in the middle and tapering down to the edge of the grounding disk. This allows a vehicle to run over the grounding disk without dislodging or damaging the grounding disk. In one embodiment, the disk is about 2 inches high in the center and tapers down to a quarter to a half inch at the edges. In one embodiment, the disk is about 13 inches in diameter.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0030">Now referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective top view of the grounding disk of the present invention.
