This probably occurs due to expansion of the stacking faults, specifically, plane defects with recombination energy obtained when minority carriers injected through the p-n diode recombine with majority carriers. The expansion originates from, for example, a basal plane dislocation in a silicon carbide substrate. The stacking faults obstruct the current flow. Hence, the expansion of the stacking faults reduces the current and increases the forward voltage, thus causing reduction in the reliability of a semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such increase in the forward voltage also occurs in vertical metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) made of silicon carbide. Each of the vertical MOSFETs includes a parasitic p-n diode (body diode) between a source and a drain. When the forward current flows through this body diode, the reliability in the vertical MOSFETs also deteriorates similarly to the p-n diode. When a body diode of a SiC-MOSFET is used as a free-wheeling diode of a MOSFET, the characteristics of this MOSFET are sometimes degraded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are following three methods for solving the problem in the reliability which is caused by the passage of the forward current through the parasitic p-n diode. The first method is converting a basal plane dislocation inherited from a SiC substrate to an epitaxial growth layer into a threading edge dislocation for preventing expansion of stacking faults (for example, see Non-Patent Document 1). The second method is forming a buffer layer higher in impurity concentration on a SiC substrate and enhancing recombination of holes and electrons in the buffer layer for preventing stacking faults from a basal plane dislocation in the SiC substrate (for example, see Non-Patent Document 2). The third method is introducing a recombination center into a region with a parasitic p-n diode and reducing holes to be injected for preventing recombination of holes and electrons in the vicinity of a basal plane dislocation in a SiC substrate (for example, see Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: WO2015/189929</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Non-Patent Document 1: &#x201c;Influence of growth conditions on basal plane dislocation in 4H-SiC epitaxial layer&#x201d;, Journal of Crystal Growth 271 (2004) 1-7</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-Patent Document 2: &#x201c;Short minority carrier lifetimes in highly nitrogen-doped 4H-SiC epilayers for suppression of the stacking fault formation in PiN diodes&#x201d;, JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS Vol. 120, pp115101, 2016</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The technologies disclosed in Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2 produce some advantages for preventing degradation in the characteristics of a SiC-MOSFET.

Next, the interlayer insulating film <b>43</b> made of silicon oxide is formed by low pressure CVD.

Next, the residual metal film other than the silicide resulting from the reaction is removed by wet etching. The residual silicide becomes the ohmic electrodes <b>71</b>.

Reduction in traps of minority carriers caused by the point defects increases the lifetime &#x3c4;1 of minority carriers in the first active region <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Then, the field insulating film <b>51</b>, the gate insulating film <b>41</b>, the gate electrode <b>42</b>, the interlayer insulation film <b>43</b>, the ohmic electrodes <b>71</b>, the source pad <b>3</b>, and the gate pad <b>2</b> are formed similarly to Embodiment 1, thus completing the SiC-MOSFET <b>102</b>.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">B-3.
