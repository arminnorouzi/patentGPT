id="p-0001" num="0000">Several embodiments disclosed herein relate to the compositions comprising engineered Natural Killer (NK) cells that express a chimeric receptor, the chimeric receptor imparting to the NK cells an enhanced ability to target specific cells, such as cancerous cells or those affected by an infectious disease. Several embodiments relate to NK cells that target cells expressing natural ligands of NKG2D, where the NK cells comprise transmembrane and/or signaling domains that lead to cytotoxic and/or cytolytic effects when the NK cells bind a target cell. Uses of NK cell compositions to treat diseases are also provided for in several embodiments.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

A goal of immunotherapy is to initiate or augment the response of the patient's immune system, for example, to boost the ability of immune cells, such as Natural Killer (NK) cells to damage, kill, or otherwise inhibit damaged or diseased cells. One immunotherapy approach is the recombinant expression of chimeric receptors in immune cells for targeted recognition and destruction of the aberrant cells. In general, chimeric receptors comprise an extracellular receptor domain that recognizes ligands on target cells, an anchoring transmembrane domain, and an effector domain that transduces activating signals upon ligand binding. Some embodiments disclosed herein utilize chimeric receptors having that general structure, or having variations in that general structure. Additionally, in several embodiments, the transmembrane domain and the effector domain are separate peptides fused together. In several other embodiments, the transmembrane and the effector domain are derived from the same peptide. In some such embodiments, the transmembrane and effector domains comprise a single peptide (e.g., one peptide that passes through the membrane and is also poised to initiate a signaling cascade). As discussed in more detail below, truncations, mutations, additional linkers/spacer elements, dimers, and the like are used to generate chimeric receptor constructs that exhibit a desired degree of expression in an immune cell (e.g., an NK cell), induce cytotoxic activity from the NK cell, balanced with a degree of target avidity that avoids adverse effects on non-target cells. The recombinant expression of chimeric receptors as disclosed herein on the surface of immune cells can redirect the targeting of immune cells to aberrant cells of interest as well as augment the immune activation upon engagement.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">NK Cells for Immunotherapy</heading><p id="p-0139" num="0139">One immunotherapy approach involves administering to patients T cells engineered to express chimeric receptors to elicit a positive immune response. However, a drawback of this approach is that it necessitates the use of autologous cells to prevent the induction of graft-versus-host-disease in the patient. As is provided in several embodiments disclosed herein, compositions comprising engineered NK cells enjoy several advantages. For example, either autologous or donor-derived allogeneic cells can be employed with an NK cell approach. Additionally, according to several embodiments, the engineered NK cells as provided for herein do not significantly increase cytotoxicity against normal cells. Further, NK cells have a significant cytotoxic effect, once activated. In view of this, it is unexpected that the engineered NK cells as provided for herein, are able to further elevate that cytotoxic effect, thus providing an even more effective means of selectively killing diseased target cells. Accordingly, in several embodiments, there is provided a method of treating or preventing cancer or an infectious disease, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of NK cells expressing the chimeric receptors described herein. In one embodiment, the NK cells administered are autologous cells. In a further embodiment, the NK cells administered are donor-derived (allogeneic) cells.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0140">In several embodiments, engagement and activation of a recombinant NK cell (e.g., by binding to a ligand on a target cell) expressing a chimeric receptor leads to the direct killing of the stressed and/or aberrant cell (e.g., tumor cells, virally-infected cells, etc.) by cytolysis. Accordingly, in several embodiments, there is provided a method of enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity, comprising administering NK cells engineered to express the chimeric receptors described herein. In one embodiment, the NK cells administered are autologous cells. In a further embodiment, the NK cells are donor-derived (allogenic) cells.

The cytotoxic activity of these innate immune cells is regulated by the balance of signaling from inhibitory and activating receptors, respectively, that reside on the cell surface. The former bind self-molecules expressed on the surface of healthy cells while the latter bind ligands expressed on aberrant cells. The increased engagement of activating receptors relative to inhibitory receptors leads to NK cell activation and target cell lysis. Natural killer Group 2 member D (NKG2D) is an important NK cell activating receptor that recognizes a number of ligands expressed on stressed and aberrant cells. The surface expression of various NKG2D ligands is generally low in healthy cells but is upregulated upon malignant transformation or viral infection. Non-limiting examples of ligands recognized by NKG2D include, but are not limited to, MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3, ULBP4, ULBP5, and ULBP6, as well as other molecules expressed on target cells that control the cytolytic or cytotoxic function of NK cells.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0142">NKG2D's ability to recognize a plurality of surface markers of cell stress and infection make it a potentially useful component of a chimeric receptor-based immunotherapy approach. However, complicating the use of NKG2D as a chimeric receptor is its relationship with partner DAP10. NKG2D is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that forms homodimers and assembles with two homodimers of DNAX-activating protein 10 (DAP10) to yield hexameric complexes on the membrane surface. This NKG2D-DAP10 association is necessary for both surface membrane expression of endogenous NKG2D as well as for transduction of the activation signal upon ligand binding. In several embodiments, a full length NKG2D is used. In one embodiment, full length NKG2D has the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. According to several embodiments disclosed herein, polynucleotides encoding chimeric receptors are provided wherein the extracellular receptor domain is a fragment of NKG2D that lacks its native transmembrane or intracellular domains yet advantageously retains its ability to bind native ligands of NKG2D, as well as transduce activation signals upon ligand binding. Thus, in several embodiments, the chimeric receptor encoded by the polypeptides disclosed herein does not comprise DAP10. In several embodiments, the NKG2D fragment is encoded by SEQ ID NO. 2. In several embodiments, the fragment of NKG2D is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% homologous with full-length wild-type NKG2D.

In NK cells, ionic interactions between the transmembrane region of NKG2D allow association with its adaptor protein DAP10 (Wu et al., 1999). Upon ligand binding, NKG2D signals are transduced through the signaling motif, Y&#xd7;NM, found on DAP10. CD3&#x3b6; transduce signals through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM; Lanier, 2008).

NK cells expanded from PBMC of healthy adult donors were transduced with one of the two chimeric receptors. Mock-transduced NK cells were used as control (transduced with empty MSCV vector containing GFP only). The presence and relative abundance of the chimeric receptors were determined through staining the NK cells with a Per-CP conjugated anti-NKG2D antibody. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts representative flow cytometry data related to the percentage of NKG2D-positive NK cells after transduction with Mock (left panel), NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6; (center panel) or NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6; (right panel) constructs. Mock transduced NK cell showed no NKG2D expression with the antibody used (which does not showing staining above an isotype-matched nonreactive antibody, despite the naturally high NKG2D expression on activated NK cells), while just under 60% of cells transduced with the NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6; construct exhibited NKG2D expression above the isotype-matched non-reactive antibody control, and over 80% of NK cells transduced with the NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6;. Pooled data for the percentage of NKG2D positive NK cells from all donors is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.

In several embodiments, enhanced expression of the construct can be achieved by repeated transduction of the NK cells with a particular construct. In several embodiments, the components of the constructs can be delivered to a cell in a single vector, or alternatively using multiple vectors. Depending on the embodiment, the construct itself may lead to enhanced expression, for example a linear or head to tail construct may yield increased expression because of a lesser degree of in-cell assembly that a multiple subunit construct requires.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0222">Further to successfully expressing NKG2D constructs on NK cells, effective signaling of the NK cells is required to act on target cells. To evaluate the potency of the two populations of transduced NK cells, cytotoxicity assays were performed using to cell lines that are sensitive to NK cell activity, REH (suspension cells) and U-2 OS (adherent cells). Data summarizing the percentage cytotoxicity of the different groups of NK cells against REH cells and across independent donors at two E:T ratios are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> (error bars represent standard deviation; all experiments are done in triplicates; n=3 (P&#x3c;0.001)). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, NK cells expressing either NKG2D chimeric receptor (NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6; shown with an arrow labeled (a) and NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6; shown with an arrow labeled (b)) had a significantly higher cytotoxicity against REH for all three donors as compared to mock NK cells (shown with an arrow labeled (c)).

Chimeric receptor-expressing NK cells also showed elevated cytotoxicity against U-2 OS when compared to mock-transduced NK cells (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> depicts NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6; shown with an arrow labeled (a), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> depicts NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6; shown with an arrow labeled (b) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> depicts mock NK cells shown with an arrow labeled (c)).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0223">These data provide evidence that NK cells can not only be engineered to express chimeric receptor constructs, but those cells that express the chimeric receptors are able to be activated and successfully generate enhanced cytotoxic effects against target cells. Importantly, these data also show that there is only a slight decrease in the potency of the cells when in the presence of a greater number of target cells (doubled in this experiment). This suggests that the desired cytotoxic effects of the engineered NK cells can still be realized, even when the NK cells are present in smaller numbers vis-&#xe0;-vis target cells, as would likely be the case in clinical use. Moreover, these data indicate that, according to some embodiments, a lesser density or degree of chimeric receptor expression on a given NK cell does not necessarily result in coordinately reduced cytotoxic effects, and can be associated with an unexpected efficacy of the NK cells in view of their lesser construct expression. Additionally, these data embody the unexpectedly enhanced cytotoxicity that is achieved according to several embodiments. While non-engineered NK cells are cytotoxic, and express a significant amount of NKG2D upon activation, it is unexpected that the engineered cells disclosed herein can push the cytotoxic effects significantly beyond what can be considered an already elevated ceiling (e.g., native NK cell cytotoxicity).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0224">Further to the cytotoxicity data, the mechanism by which the NK cells are exerting these effects was examined, by evaluating the production if interferon-gamma (IFN&#x3b3;) by the NK cells expressing the various NKG2D constructs. IFN&#x3b3; is a key cytokine produced and released by NK cells (typically during an innate immune response) that recruits macrophages and has immunostimulatory effects. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows the relative amount of IFN&#x3b3; production (measured by MFI) in Mock (left panel), NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells (center panel), and NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells (right panel) with or without stimulation by REH cells. NK cells were stained by APC-conjugated anti-IFN&#x3b3; antibody for intracellular IFN&#x3b3;. Data was analyzed by paired t test. These data show that each of the three groups of NK cells were observed to have a similar level of IFN&#x3b3; production without stimulation, with an increase observed after stimulation by REH cells. As provided for in several embodiments, engineered NK cells expressing NKG2D constructs can lead to robust cytokine production. The presence of a target cell (here, REH cells) to which the engineered NK cells responds sets into motion the biochemical cascade which leads to IFN&#x3b3; production and ultimately cytotoxic effects. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the NKG2D-41BB-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells show a robust production of IFN&#x3b3; in the presence of stimulatory REH cells. Interestingly, the NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells failed to show a similar degree of response. This is further demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, where levels of IFN&#x3b3; between different groups of NK cells after stimulation with REH cells (median values were represented; data was analyzed by unpaired t test) are evaluated. All IFN&#x3b3; experiments were conducted in triplicates, with three independent donors, n=9. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows that IFN&#x3b3; production by NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells was not significantly different from mock-transduced NK cells. In contrast, the NKG2D-41BBCD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells show a significant increase in IFN&#x3b3; production as compared to mock-transduced NK cells. These data are interesting because they demonstrate that, as discussed herein, signaling by a chimeric receptor in response to ligand binding is an essential step in generating cytotoxic effects against a target cell of interest. However, there is not a singular pathway through which the various constructs signal, as NK cells transduced with two different chimeric receptors both exhibit relatively similar cytotoxicity, but without mirroring levels of IFN&#x3b3; production. Thus, according to some embodiments, constructs are provided that achieve cytotoxic effects through an elevated production of IFN&#x3b3;, or other immunostimulatory cytokine, as compared to normal NK cells. However, in several embodiments, increased production of IFN&#x3b3; is not necessarily achieved or detected, rather another immunostimulatory pathway can be exploited by a given chimeric construct to achieve elevated cytotoxic effects.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;CD16 and CD16-4-1BB Containing NKG2D Constructs</heading><p id="p-0225" num="0225">Additional constructs were generated to evaluate expression, cytotoxicity and cytokine production. As provided for herein, several embodiments relate to constructs comprising a truncated NKG2D (in some embodiments codon optimized), that employ a CD16 transmembrane and/or signaling domain. The constructs generated for evaluation in this experiment are schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, which show the structure of A) NKG2D-CD16 and B) NKG2D-CD16-41BB chimeric receptors. Both chimeric receptors rely on the transmembrane region of CD16 to associate with either CD3&#x3b6; or FcR&#x3b3;. The plasmids used to generate these constructs are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. As discussed above, in several embodiments, the constructs employed rely on endogenous expression of CD3&#x3b6; or FcR&#x3b3;, however, in several embodiments the plasmid encoding the chimeric receptor (or a separate plasmid) is configured to elevate expression of CD3&#x3b6; and/or FcR&#x3b3; by the NK cell, thereby enhancing the potency of the cells.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0226">As above, expression levels of the constructs were evaluated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> depicts representative flow cytometry data for mock (left panel), NKG2DDAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells (center panel), and NKG2D-CD16-expressing NK cells (Experiments were conducted using cells from three independent donors represented by different symbols. Data was analyzed by paired t test). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows summary data relating to the percentage of cells that that express NKG2D (and hence the constructs). As expected, mock-transfected NK cells show low levels of NKG2D expression with the antibody used. In contrast, both of the engineered constructs exhibited significantly enhanced expression, with NKG2D-CD16-transduced NK cells expressing 35.8%&#xb1;6.9% greater expression as compared to mock-transduced NK cells. Additionally, as evaluated by MFI (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>), NKG2D-CD16-transduced NK cells also exhibited increased expression of the construct. These data are important to demonstrate that the constructs can effectively be introduced into NK cells and are expressed.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0227">Having established expression of the constructs, their ability to exhibit cytotoxic effects was evaluated. As discussed above, NK cells from three donors were tested for cytotoxic effects against REH cells and U-2 OS cells, each at three E:T ratios (all experiments were done in triplicate, n=3). Interestingly, the enhanced expression of the NKG2D-CD16 construct as compared to mock NK cells did not result in increased cytotoxicity (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, error bars represent standard deviations). As with the prior example, NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells (shown with an arrow labeled (a)) did exhibit an increased cytotoxicity. With respect to cytotoxicity against U-2 OS cells, the NKG2D-CD16 (shown with an arrow labeled (b)) did exhibit an increased cytotoxicity as compared to mock NK cells (shown with an arrow labeled (c)) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref>). These data indicate that the degree of cytotoxic impact on a particular given target cell type may vary with the NK construct used. In some embodiments, a particular construct may not be as effective, however, in several embodiments, combinations of populations of NK cells can be used and exhibit synergistic effects. In other words, a population of NK cells, with a portion expressing NKG2D-CD16 and a portion expressing NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6; (or other combination of any of the constructs disclosed herein), may exhibit unexpectedly enhanced cytotoxicity as compared to either sub-population alone.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0228">Interferon-7 production was measured next, in order to confirm the mechanism of action of the transfected NK cells. The NK cells expressing the various constructs were either stimulated by REH cells, or not, and the production of IFN&#x3b3; was measured. These data are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> (data was analyzed by paired t test). All groups of NK cells had similar level of IFN&#x3b3; without stimulation, and an increase after incubation with REH cells. The NKG2D-CD16-expressing NK cells exhibited an increase in IFN&#x3b3; production of 634&#xb1;211 MFI, which was greater than the increase exhibited by the mock-transduced NK cells (423&#xb1;70 MFI). However, the increase was lower than that observed for NKG2D-DAP10-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells, which increased 2041&#xb1;411 MFI. In line with data, according to several embodiments the production of IFN&#x3b3; is correlated with the cytotoxic effects that NK cells expressing certain constructs exhibit.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0229">In accordance with several embodiments disclosed herein, multiple signaling regions may be used. Additional experiments were conducts to evaluate the expression of a NKG2D-CD16-41BB in expanded NK cells (experiments were conducted using cells from one donor). The expression data is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> shows raw flow cytometry data that demonstrate that the addition of the 4-1BB signaling region does not significantly impair the expression of the construct by NK cells, as compared to the NKG2D-CD16 construct. This is also reflected in the summary histogram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> that shows the relative amount of NKG2D receptors on the surface of each of the NK cell groups tested. The NKG2D-CD16-41BB shows slightly reduced MFI as compared to NKG2D-CD16, but both constructs show elevated expression versus mock.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0230">Cytotoxic effects were evaluated as described above, using both REH and U-2 OS cells as targets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref> depict the resultant data (error bars represent standard deviations; all experiments were conducted in triplicates, n=3). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> shows the cytotoxic effects of the constructs against REH cells. Similar to the experiment above, the NKG2D-CD16-expressing cells shown with an arrow labeled (b)) did not show significantly elevated cytotoxic effects as compared to mock NK cells shown with an arrow labeled (a). In contrast, NK cells expressing NKG2D-CD16-41BB (shown with an arrow labeled (c)) showed enhanced cytotoxicity against REH cells. With respect to efficacy against U-2 OS cells, both the NKG2D-CD16 and NKG2DCD16-41BB expressing cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity, with the NKG2D-CD16-41BB expressing cells exhibiting a more robust cytotoxic effect. This demonstrates that, in accordance with several embodiments, use of a combination of signaling domains can result in unexpected enhancements in the efficacy of a transduced NK cell. Thus, as described above, several embodiments employ two or more transmembrane/signaling domains that work synergistically together to yield enhanced cytotoxicity against target cells.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;Additional NKG2D Constructs</heading><p id="p-0231" num="0231">Additional constructs with varying extracellular domains, transmembrane domains, and intracellular effector domains were generated to evaluate their expression and cytotoxicity. The 12 constructs generated for evaluation in this experiment are schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Some of these variant chimeric receptors rely on a CD16 transmembrane region to associate with either CD3&#x3b6; or FcR&#x3b3;.

Variant construct expression persisted in the NK cells of two donors 7 days following transduction, with Variants 8 and 9 showing particularly elevated levels as evaluated by MFI (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref>). These data are important to demonstrate that the constructs can effectively be introduced into NK cells and are expressed. Having established expression of the constructs, their ability to deliver cytotoxic effects in transduced NK cells was also evaluated. The cytotoxicity of the NKG2D variant constructs 4, 8, and 9 were evaluated 14 days post-transduction into NK cells at a 1:1 E:T ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0232" num="0232">Further variant constructs were generated and are schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, which show the structure of chimeric receptors comprising various extracellular domains, transmembrane domains, and intracellular effector domains.

As above, expression levels of the constructs were evaluated. As evaluated by MFI (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref>), NK cells transduced with engineered constructs exhibited increased expression of the chimeric receptor relative to mock transduced cells.

When evaluated at a 1:2 E:T ratio, chimeric constructs 16-7, 39-1, 39-2, 39-3, and 39-5 each enhanced the cytotoxic effects of their respective transduced NK cells relative to the mock control. As exogenous expression of activating receptors can lead to NK cell anergy and cell death, the engineered constructs were transduced into two donor NK cells and survival was evaluated after 21 days.

The expression, cytotoxicity, persistence, and cytokine production mediated by these 7 constructs were evaluated in this Example relative to three of the NK39 constructs described in Example 3 (NK39-5, NK39-6, NK39-10) as well as a version of NK16 that bicistronically expresses membrane-bound interleukin 15 (NK26-8). In accordance with several embodiments disclosed herein, multiple signaling regions may be used. Some of these variant chimeric receptors rely on an effector domain comprising CD3zeta and/or another signaling domain (e.g., OX40, CD28, and/or 4-1BB costimulatory domains) to transduce signaling upon ligand binding, while other variant chimeric receptors comprise a CD3zeta transmembrane domain that recruits full-length CD3zeta molecule to the synapse via dimerization. As disclosed herein, these constructs are further configured to co-express membrane-bound IL15.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0235">As above, the ability of NK cells to effectively express these constructs was first assessed. NK cells expanded from the PBMC of four donors were transduced with the variant constructs (or an empty MSCV control vector containing GFP only) and NKG2D expression was evaluated by MFI after 3 days. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, mock-transfected NK cells show relatively low levels of NKG2D expression. In contrast, the engineered variant constructs exhibited significantly enhanced expression, with NK45-4 (NKG2D-OX40-CD3&#x3b6;) showing surprisingly robust expression in all donors. OX40 is expressed in activated NK cells, but its role has not been well-established. A variant chimeric receptor with an effector domain containing a CD28 costimulatory domain (NK45-2; NKG2D-CD28-CD3&#x3b6;) also demonstrated robust expression 3 days post-transduction.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0236">Having established expression of the variant constructs, their ability to exert cytotoxic effects was evaluated as above using REH and HL60 cells as targets. The potency of NK cells from four donors were examined against REH cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>) and HL60 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>) at 1:1 E:T ratios 14 days post-transduction. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref>, the engineered constructs exerted an enhanced cytotoxicity against both REH and HL60 cells in all four donors as compared to mock NK cells. In addition to its pronounced expression profile, cells expressing NK45-4 (NKG2D-OX40-CD3&#x3b6;) also exhibited surprisingly elevated cytotoxicity relative to the mock control and the other constructs tested. NK cells expressing NK45-1 and NK45-2 also demonstrated pronounced cytotoxicity in these assays. These data demonstrate that, in accordance with several embodiments, use of a combination of signaling domains (particularly an OX40 costimulatory domain) can result in unexpected enhancements in the efficacy of a transduced NK cell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-B</figref> depict the cytotoxic activity against U2OS cells of the NK cells transduced with several of the variant constructs at various E:T ratios (1:2 and 1:4) and assessed over a more extended period of time. Surprisingly, NK cells transduced with the 45-4 construct appear to maintain cytotoxic activity through the time course. Advantageously, these experiments indicate that, according to several embodiments disclosed herein, the NKG2D variant constructs provide unexpectedly enhanced cytotoxicity over an extended period of time, which, depending on the embodiment, can range from 2-3 days, 3-5 days, 5-7, days, 7-8 days, 8-10 days, 10-14 days, 14-21 days, or 21-50 days (and any range in between those listed, including endpoints). In several embodiments, even longer durations of cytotoxic effects are achieved.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0237">Further to the cytotoxicity data, the mechanism by which the NK cells are exerting these effects was examined by evaluating their production of IFN&#x3b3;, TNF&#x3b1;, and GM-CSF following stimulation with REH cells. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-C</figref>, expression of each of the variant constructs yielded enhanced cytokine secretion relative to the production of IFN&#x3b3;, TNF&#x3b1;, and GM-CSF exhibited by the GFP-expressing control NK cells. The chimeric receptor NK45-1 consistently mediated high cytokine production, which is surprising because this construct expresses at substantially lower levels than NK26-8 (from which it differs only with regards to the hinge region). Thus, these data demonstrate the unexpected importance of the hinge regions disclosed herein to mediating robust cytokine production in response to stimulation. Additionally, NKG2DOX40-CD3&#x3b6;-expressing NK cells also showed an elevated production of IFN&#x3b3;, TNF&#x3b1;, and GM-CSF.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0238">As exogenous expression of activating receptors can lead to NK cell anergy and cell death, the engineered constructs were transduced into two donor NK cells and the total cell count was evaluated 7, 14, and 21 days post-transduction. Surprisingly, the unexpectedly robust expression of NK45-4 does not come at the cost of reduced NK cell persistence in culture, as the total cell count remained at levels comparable to the GFP-expressing control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A and <b>27</b>B</figref>). Likewise, other NK cells expressing variant constructs at high levels continued to proliferate in the 2 donors for at least 3 weeks post-transduction. Collectively, these data demonstrate that, in accordance with several embodiments disclosed herein, engineered constructs can successfully be expressed at high levels in NK cells and mediate cytotoxic effects, and further, that this enhanced expression does not come at the detriment of reduced NK cell proliferation and/or survival.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0239">It is contemplated that various combinations or subcombinations of the specific features and aspects of the embodiments disclosed above may be made and still fall within one or more of the inventions.
