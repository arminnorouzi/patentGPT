application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 21183522.8, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventive concept relates to an integrated photonic device. In particular, the present inventive concept relates to using the integrated photonic device for wavelength division multiplexing and a sensor system in which such integrated photonic device is incorporated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical signals are useful for carrying information. For instance, sensors may be read out using optical signals. In many applications it is undesirable to have electronic connections to sensors and therefore optical signals are advantageously used for carrying information from the sensors. Use of optical signals instead of electronic signals is for instance advantageous in applications where the electronic signals may affect the sensor or the environment in which signals are propagated (such as in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner), in applications where heat dissipation from electronic signals needs to be avoided (such as for sensors arranged on skin or in brain tissue), in applications in explosive environments, and in applications in environments with electronic noise.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an array of sensors, it may be desired that multiple sensors are read out in parallel, which implies that a plurality of optical signals each dedicated to a unique sensor in the array are to be transferred from the array of sensors. However, it may often be desired that the plurality of optical signals is transferred in a single cable (e.g. an optical fiber), such that a lightweight cable may be used and that the arrangement for read-out of the sensors is compact. For instance, use of a single lightweight cable is useful in catheter-based applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) allows multiplexing different signals while maintaining integrity of the signals. Thus, WDM may be used to allow multiple signals to be transferred through a single optical fiber and allow the signals to be separated (thanks to the signals using different wavelengths) after having been transferred such that each signal may be separately processed. Using WDM, optical signals for interrogating an array of sensors may be transmitted through a single optical fiber and the response from the array of sensors may also be transmitted back through a single optical fiber. In WDM, the available optical bandwidth is split into wavelength channels and each channel can be used to address an individual sensor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a multiplexing set-up, a de-multiplexer is needed for separating the wavelengths of the optical signals that are to interact with respective sensors. Further, a multiplexer is needed for combining the optical signals from the respective sensors. The de-multiplexer and the multiplexer may both be realized as an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The function of the AWG can be inverted. Thus, if the AWG functions as a de-multiplexer to split an optical signal input at a first side of the AWG to a plurality of optical signals of different wavelengths output at a second side of the AWG, the AWG also functions as a multiplexer to combine a plurality of optical signals of different wavelengths input at the second side to a single optical signal output at the first side. This implies that a single optical fiber may be used to transfer an interrogation signal towards an array of sensors. The interrogation signal is then split by the AWG to a plurality of signals that interact with the sensors and are reflected back to the AWG and again combined by the AWG into the single optical fiber. This optical set-up may be called a reflection-mode sensor read-out.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the reflection-mode sensor read-out light traveling from the AWG in the single optical fiber needs to be separated from light traveling towards the AWG. This may be achieved using an optical circulator. However, the optical circulator is a bulky, expensive component. Further, the reflection-mode sensor read-out may suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio, because spurious reflections in the set-up may even have a larger amplitude than the light being received back after being modified by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an alternative, a first AWG may be used as a de-multiplexer to split an optical signal towards an array of sensors. The optical signals may then interact with respective sensors to be modified by the sensors and may then be further passed to a second AWG for combining the optical signals again. This optical set-up may be called a transmission-mode sensor read-out. In this case, there is no confusion between signals traveling towards sensors and from sensors, as the signals are travelling in different optical fibers. However, the first and second AWGs need to be identical such that the wavelength channels are arranged at exactly the same wavelengths. Using silicon photonics, it is very difficult to manufacture two identical AWGs, because even small variations in fabrication process are detrimental to absolute wavelength accuracy of the AWGs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Different wavelengths of light may also be used in systems wherein spectral information is to be obtained, such as in light detection and ranging (LIDAR) applications. In such cases, an optical beam may be used to scan a scene or an object. A dispersive beamforming element may be used so that different wavelengths are emitted in different directions of the optical beam.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to reduce time needed to scan the scene, parallel light sources can be used. The light from these light sources needs to be combined into a single waveguide feeding the beamforming element, and such combination can be done with a first AWG.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It can be desirable to use the same beamforming element to collect radiation being reflected from the scene into a combined signal. Then, the optical signals corresponding to the different light sources need to be separated in order to detect each optical signal separately. This separation can be done with a second AWG. However, if the wavelength channels of the second AWG do not match extremely well with the first AWG, then this will not work successfully.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is therefore a need of improvement of optical set-ups in wavelength division multiplexing applications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An objective of the present inventive concept is to provide an optical arrangement that is suitable for integrated photonic devices and which facilitates use of wavelength division multiplexing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This and other objectives of the present inventive concept are at least partly met by the invention as defined in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are set out in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect, there is provided an integrated photonic device for wavelength division multiplexing, said photonic device comprising: a wavelength-splitting/combining component having a first side and a second side, wherein the wavelength-splitting/combining component is configured to be re-used for both splitting a single signal to be split, wherein the signal to be split comprises plural wavelengths, to plural split signals, wherein each of the plural split signals is related to a unique wavelength band, and combining plural signals to be combined, wherein each of the plural signals to be combined is related to a unique wavelength band, to a single combined signal, wherein the wavelength-splitting/combining component comprises at least one output channel for providing an output signal and at least one response channel for receiving a response input signal from a light interaction induced by the output signal, wherein the output channel and the response channel are connected to different ports of the wavelength-splitting/combining component, and wherein the component comprises at least one additional channel on either the first side or the second side, which additional channel is dedicated to be used only in splitting the single signal to be split or in combining the plural signals to be combined.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thanks to the set-up according to the first aspect, the same wavelength-splitting/combining component is used both for splitting a signal (de-multiplexing) and for combining plural signals (multiplexing). This implies that the same component is used both for de-multiplexing and multiplexing optical signals. Hence, there is no issue with different components needing to be identical, such that more lenient requirements on accuracy in production of the integrated photonic device is provided.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, the use of a single wavelength-splitting/combining component implies that a size of the integrated photonic device may be small such that a size of a chip carrying the integrated photonic device may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The use of a single wavelength-splitting/combining component is further advantageous if a response from the integrated photonic device needs to be calibrated or shifted (e.g. to match laser wavelengths), since such calibration or shifting of response of the integrated photonic device is simplified for a single wavelength-splitting/combining component compared to a device comprising two components.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the wavelength-splitting/combining component is set up such that the response input signal is received at a different channel than the output channel through which an output signal was provided. This implies that the response from light interaction induced by the output signal is not reflected back into the same wavelength channel through which the output signal is provided.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wavelength-splitting/combining component has a reciprocity in its optical function such that if light of a particular wavelength would travel from a particular port on the first side to another particular port on the second side, then light of that wavelength incident on the particular port on the second side would travel back to the corresponding particular port on the first side. Hence, by providing the response input signal in a different port of the wavelength-splitting/combining component, the reciprocity of the photonic device will ensure that an input signal (which generates the output signal(s)) and a response output signal (based on the response input signal) will not interfere with each other. Rather, the input signal and the response output signal will also be provided on different ports of the wavelength-splitting/combining component. This implies that no circulator may be necessary in the set-up in order to separate light traveling from the wavelength-splitting/combining component from light traveling towards the wavelength-splitting/combining component.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wavelength-splitting/combining component is configured to propagate light incident on the first side to be output on the second side. The wavelength-splitting/combining component could be configured such that the wavelength-splitting/combining component splits a single light signal incident on the first side to plural signals output on the second side and combines plural light signals incident on the second side to a single signal output on the first side. However, the wavelength-splitting/combining component could alternatively be configured such that the wavelength-splitting/combining component splits a single light signal incident on the second side to plural signals output on the first side and combines plural light signals incident on the first side to a single signal output on the second side.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wavelength-splitting/combining component can be configured such that the output channel and the response channel are both connected to ports at the same side of the wavelength-splitting/combining component, such as being connected to different ports at the second side of the wavelength-splitting/combining component. However, it should be realized that the output channel and the response channel could alternatively be connected to ports at different sides of the wavelength-splitting/combining component. This implies that the wavelength-splitting/combining component could be configured to split a single light signal incident on a first port on the first side to plural split signals output on a first set of ports on the second side and to combine plural light signals incident on a second set of ports on the first side to a single light signal output on a second port on the second side, wherein the ports of the first set of ports differ from the first port and the ports of the second set of ports differ from the second port.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The wavelength-splitting/combining component can be configured to generate a plurality of output signal based on a single input signal, which is split by the wavelength-splitting/combining component into the plurality of output signals. Then, a plurality of response input signals would be provided back to the wavelength-splitting/combining component to be combined by the wavelength-splitting/combining component into a single response output signal. Alternatively, the wavelength-splitting/combining component can be configured to generate a single output signal based on a plurality of input signals, which are combined by the wavelength-splitting/combining component into the single output signals. Then, a single response input signals would be provided back to the wavelength-splitting/combining component to be split by the wavelength-splitting/combining component into a plurality of response output signals. Since the output channel and the response channel are connected to different ports, the response output signal(s) will not be provided on the same port that received the input signal(s). On one of the sides of the wavelength-splitting/combining component, wavelength channels may have a dual function to provide output from the wavelength-splitting/combining component of a first light signal in a first wavelength band and provide input to the wavelength-splitting/combining component of a second light signal in a second wavelength band different from the first wavelength band. Thus, the wavelength channel may be involved both in splitting signals and combining signals by the wavelength-splitting/combining component. However, since the first wavelength band differs from the second wavelength band, signals on the other side of the wavelength-splitting/combining component corresponding to the first light signal and the second light signal would still not be associated with the same channel(s) of the wavelength-splitting/combining component. This implies that at least one additional channel input or output is provided on one of the sides of the wavelength-splitting/combining component, which additional channel is dedicated to either a splitting action or a combining action of the wavelength-splitting/combining component.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;signal to be split comprises plural wavelengths&#x201d; should be construed as the signal to be split comprising a broadband signal spanning a broad range of wavelengths that may be split into a plurality of narrower wavelength bands or that the signal to be split comprises a signal comprising a plurality of distinct wavelength bands or a combination of the above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;unique wavelength band&#x201d; should be construed such that two wavelength bands being mutually unique may or may not be partially overlapping but may not be completely overlapping.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should further be realized that the wavelength-splitting/combining component may be configured to function for a set of signals. Thus, the wavelength-splitting/combining component may be configured to interact with plural sets of signals, each set including a unique signal to be split, such that each of the signals to be split may be split to respective plural signals in the respective set of signals. For instance, different ports on the wavelength-splitting/combining components may be dedicated to different sets of signals.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an embodiment, the wavelength-splitting/combining component is configured to receive an input signal as the single signal to be split and to split the input signal to a plurality of output signals in a plurality of output channels, wherein the wavelength-splitting/combining component comprises a plurality of response channels for receiving response input signals as the plural signals to be combined, wherein each response channel is configured to receive the response input signal from light interaction induced by a unique output signal, wherein different response channels receive response input signals from light interaction induced by different output signals, and wherein the wavelength-splitting/combining component is configured to combine the plurality of response input signals in the plurality of response channels to a single response output signal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, a single input signal is split by the wavelength-splitting/combining component and a plurality of response input signals are combined to a single response output signal. Thus, this embodiment is particularly suited for providing signals for interrogating an array of sensors and using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) for transferring information read-out from the array of sensors in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this configuration, the plurality of output signals forms the plural split signals. Further, the single response output signal forms the single combined signal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an embodiment, an output channel of the plurality of output channels is configured to transfer the output signal to a sensor and wherein a response signal from the sensor based on the output signal is received in a response channel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hence, the output signal is configured to interact with a sensor in order to generate the response signal, which is provided as a response input signal to the wavelength-splitting/combining component.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each output channel may be configured to transfer the output signal to a respective sensor in an array of sensors. This implies that responses from sensors in the array of sensors are received in the plurality of response channels.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an embodiment, a waveguide is configured to function as both an output channel and a response channel, such that a first output signal of a first wavelength is provided in the waveguide towards a first sensor and a second response input signal from the first sensor or a second sensor based on the response from a second input signal of a second wavelength is provided in the waveguide back towards the wavelength-splitting/combining component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This implies that the same waveguide may be used both for output signals and response input signals. Since these are provided in different wavelengths, the response output signal provided from the wavelength-splitting/combining component will not interfere with the input signal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The re-use of the waveguides implies that fewer number of ports may be needed in the wavelength-splitting/combining component for handling the output channels and the response channels, such that the number of ports need not correspond twice the number of sensors from which signals are to be read out. This implies that the integrated photonic device may be compact.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, a specific sensor may be interrogated with at least two wavelengths, such that responses based on the first output signal and the second input signal may be provided from the same sensor. This may improve reliability and/or accuracy of read-out from the sensor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment, the wavelength-splitting/combining component is configured to combine a first set of a plurality of response input signals in a first set of a plurality of response channels to a first, single response output signal and a second set of a plurality of response input signals in a second set of a plurality of response channels to a second, single response output signal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, all response input signals need not necessarily be combined to a single response output signal. This may allow an improved flexibility in arranging the response channels in relation to the wavelength-splitting/combining component. For instance, the wavelength-splitting/combining component may be configured to properly combine signals if the response input signals are arranged with increasing wavelengths along a sequence of ports of the wavelength-splitting/combining component. By allowing a first set of response channels to be combined to a first response output signal and a second set of response channels to be combined to a second response output signals, the wavelengths of the response channels need not be arranged to continuously increase along ports.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Also, by differentiating between different sets of response input signals, response input signals may be grouped to allow analysis of separate groups of response input signals.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an embodiment, the wavelength-splitting/combining component is an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), or an echelle grating.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wavelength-splitting/combining component may be a passive optical component providing a multiplexing and corresponding de-multiplexing functionality.
