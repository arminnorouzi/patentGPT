The pressure of the water pumped into the sealed portion of the well sufficiently high to exceed the breaking point of the surrounding rocks. When the breaking point is reached, the formation fractures and water rushes rapidly into the fractures, inflating the fractures and extending deeper into the rock. The water pumped into the sealed portion of the well is generally treated with chemicals and/or thickeners (e.g., guar gum, etc.) to create a viscous gel that facilitates the ability of the water to carry grains of particulate matter (e.g., frac sand, etc.) in suspension. Accordingly, the rush of water carries billions of grains of frac sand deep into the fractures. Frac sand is a crush-resistant material produced for use by the petroleum industry that is typically a relatively high-purity quartz sand with durable and round grains. In some examples, a few thousand tons of frac sand is required to stimulate a single well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During fracturing operations, a fluid mixture that includes water and particulate matter (e.g., frac sand, earth, and/or other particulate matter, etc.) is returned from the well to a frac sand separator. The frac sand separator separates water from the particulate matter of the frac return mixture. For example, the particulate matter is forced to the bottom of a vessel of the frac sand separator, while water is removed via an outlet from the top of the vessel. In some examples, some water remains with the particulate matter, forming a slurry. The vessel of the frac sand separator must be periodically emptied to continue a fracturing operation. Currently, the determination of when to empty the vessels of frac sand separators is performed manually by an operator. For example, the operator may touch the vessel to determine the level of the particulate matter (e.g., the level of the slurry containing the particulate matter, etc.) within the vessel using the perceived temperature of the vessel. The operator then decides whether or not to empty the vessel based on the determined level. In other examples, the operator determines when to empty the vessel using instinct or a predetermined timing (e.g., every 20 minutes or so, etc.). But, manually determining when to empty the vessel of a frac sand separator may be unreliable, time-consuming, and/or costly, which may increase the costs of fracturing operations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

The sand separator is configured to separate water of the fracking return mixture from particulate matter of the fracking return mixture. The sand separator includes an outlet. The frac sand separator system includes a collection container fluidly connected to the outlet of the sand separator for receiving the particulate matter from the sand separator. The frac sand separator system includes at least one outlet valve fluidly connected between the outlet of the sand separator and the collection container. The frac sand separator system includes a computing device operatively connected to the at least one outlet valve. The computing device includes a processor configured to automatically open the at least one outlet valve such that the particulate matter is released from the sand separator into the collection container.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Certain embodiments of the disclosure provides a more reliable, less time-consuming, and/or less costly determination of when to empty the vessel of a sand separator. Certain embodiments of the disclosure reduce or eliminate the determinations and/or operations performed by a human operator during a fracturing operation, thereby reducing or eliminating human error, the amount of labor performed by operators, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary frac sand separator system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The frac sand separator system <b>100</b> is associated with a well <b>102</b> of a subsurface earth formation <b>104</b>. The frac sand separator system <b>100</b> includes a sand separator <b>108</b> having an inlet <b>110</b> that is fluidly connected to a return conduit <b>106</b> of the well <b>102</b>. During fracturing operations, a fluid mixture that includes water and particulate matter (e.g., frac sand, earth, and/or other particulate matter, etc.) is returned from the well <b>102</b> to the inlet <b>110</b> of the sand separator <b>108</b> through the return conduit <b>106</b>. The fluid mixture returned from the well <b>102</b> to the sand separator <b>108</b> will be referred to herein as a &#x201c;fracking return mixture&#x201d;. The fracking return mixture may include hydrocarbons. The sand separator <b>108</b> separates the water of the fracking return mixture from the particulate matter of the frac return mixture. For example, the particulate matter is forced to the bottom (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of a vessel <b>168</b> of the sand separator <b>108</b>, while the water is removed via a water outlet <b>116</b> from the top (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the vessel <b>168</b>. In some examples, some water remains with the particulate matter, forming a slurry. For example, a slurry that contains the particulate matter is a mixture of approximately 90% particulate matter and approximately 10% water in some examples. The particulate matter (e.g., the slurry that contains the particulate matter, etc.) may include hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The vessel <b>168</b> of the sand separator <b>108</b> must be periodically emptied during fracturing operations. Accordingly, the sand separator <b>108</b> includes a particulate outlet <b>112</b> that is fluidly connected to a collection container <b>114</b> such that the particulate matter (e.g., the slurry that contains the particulate matter, etc.) can be released from the bottom of the vessel <b>168</b> into the collection container <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to some embodiments, the frac sand separator system <b>100</b> is freestanding on the ground, mounted to a trailer for towing between operational sites, mounted to a skid, loaded on a manifold, otherwise transported, and/or the like. The frac sand separator system <b>100</b> is not limited to being used with fracturing operations. Rather, the embodiments disclosed herein may be used with any other type of oil and gas operation (e.g., drilling operations, etc.) and any type of subsurface earth formation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a frac sand separator system <b>200</b> according to an exemplary embodiment.

The sand separator <b>208</b> is configured to separate water of the fracking return mixture from particulate matter of the frac return mixture. As described above, in some examples some water remains with the particulate matter such that the sand separator <b>208</b> separates the fracking return mixture into water and a slurry that includes the particulate matter. The sand separator <b>208</b> includes a particulate outlet <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The collection container <b>214</b> is fluidly connected to the particulate outlet <b>212</b> for receiving the particulate matter (e.g., the slurry containing the particulate matter, etc.) from the vessel <b>268</b> of the sand separator <b>208</b>. The frac sand separator system <b>200</b> includes one or more outlet valves <b>218</b> fluidly connected between the particulate outlet <b>212</b> and the collection container <b>214</b> for releasing the particulate matter from the vessel <b>268</b> of the sand separator <b>208</b> to thereby empty the vessel <b>268</b>.

For example, in some embodiments the sand separator is a cyclonic separator that is configured to force the particulate matter of the fracking return mixture to the bottom of the vessel <b>268</b>, while the water of the fracking return mixture is removed from the top of the vessel <b>268</b> via the water outlet <b>216</b>. Other types of separators are used in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The frac sand separator system <b>200</b> includes one or more temperature sensors <b>226</b> operatively connected to the vessel <b>268</b> of the sand separator <b>208</b> for measuring one or more temperatures within the vessel <b>268</b>.

The computing device optionally includes a display (not shown) for displaying various parameters, settings, data, and/or the like of the frac sand separator system <b>300</b> (e.g., pressures, temperatures, choke valve settings, weights, masses, particulate amounts, levels, discharge rates, the time of the most recent emptying of the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b>, the time of an upcoming emptying of the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b>, an operational status of the system <b>300</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As briefly described above, the computing device <b>320</b> is configured to automatically control the outlet valves <b>318</b> to automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b>. Specifically, the processor <b>322</b> of the computing device <b>320</b> is configured to automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby release the particulate matter (e.g., the slurry containing the particulate matter, etc.) from the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b> such that the particulate matter flows directly into the collection container <b>314</b> or flows into the scale <b>328</b> for eventual delivery to the collection container <b>314</b>. The computing device <b>320</b> thereby automatically empties the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> upon the passage of a predetermined amount of time. For example, the processor <b>322</b> may automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> every five minutes, every ten minutes, every 15 minutes, etc. In some examples, the time interval between automatic emptying events performed by the processor <b>322</b> is variable, for example becoming less frequent as the fracturing operation continues over time and less particulate matter is returned from the well, etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on a mass of the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b> (e.g., based on a change in the total mass of the vessel <b>368</b>, based on a level of the particulate matter within the vessel <b>368</b> determined from a measured mass of the vessel <b>368</b>, when a measured mass of the vessel <b>368</b> equals or exceeds a predetermined mass, etc.). For example, the processor <b>322</b> may automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on a measured mass of the vessel <b>368</b> received from the mass sensor <b>344</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on a level of the particulate matter within the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b> (e.g., when the particulate matter reaches a predetermined maximum allowed level within the vessel <b>368</b>, when the vessel <b>368</b> is &#x2153;rd full of particulate matter, when the vessel is half full of particulate matter, when the vessel <b>368</b> is &#xbe; full of particulate matter, etc.). For example, the processor <b>322</b> may automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on a measured level of the particulate matter within the vessel <b>368</b> received from the level sensor <b>342</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another example, the processor <b>322</b> may automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on one or more measured temperatures received from one or more of the temperature sensors <b>326</b>. Specifically, in some examples the processor <b>322</b> determines the level of the particulate matter within the vessel <b>368</b> based on one or more measured temperatures within the vessel <b>368</b> received from the temperature sensor(s) <b>326</b>. When the level determined from the temperature(s) received from the temperature sensor(s) <b>326</b> equals or exceeds a predetermined level, the processor <b>322</b> automatically opens one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b>. In one specific example, the processor <b>322</b> of the computing device determines whether to automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> using two measured temperatures, namely: (1) a first measured temperature of water and/or the particulate matter at a first location within the vessel <b>368</b> that is below a predetermined maximum allowed level of the particulate matter; and (2) a second measured temperature of water at a second location within the vessel <b>368</b> that corresponds to the predetermined maximum allowed level of the particulate matter. For example, the processor <b>322</b> automatically opens one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> when the temperature differential between the first and second measured temperatures approaches zero (e.g., is less than a predetermined value).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one specific example, the processor <b>322</b> of the computing device determines whether to automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> using three measured temperatures, for example temperatures measured at a low, mid, and high levels (i.e., locations) within the vessel <b>368</b>. The processor <b>322</b> compares at least some of the measured temperatures and automatically opens one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> when the temperature differentials trend toward a predetermined target value (e.g., within approximately 1%, within approximately 2%, within approximately 5%, within approximately 10%, within approximately 15%, within approximately 17%, within approximately 20%, etc.).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically open one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> based on whether particulate matter is detected within the water outlet <b>316</b> by the particulate sensor <b>378</b> (e.g., which may indicate that the vessel <b>368</b> is full of particulate matter, etc.).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Once the particulate matter has been emptied from the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b>, the processor <b>322</b> of the computing device <b>320</b> is configured to automatically close one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b>. In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically close one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> upon the passage of a predetermined amount of time (e.g., after the outlet valve(s) <b>318</b> have been open for a predetermined period of time, etc.). For example, the processor <b>322</b> may automatically close the outlet valve(s) <b>318</b> after the outlet valves(s) <b>318</b> have been open for approximately 30 seconds, approximately one minute, approximately 2 minutes, approximately 5 minutes, etc. In other words, in such an example, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to leave the outlet valve(s) <b>318</b> open to thereby automatically empty the particulate matter from the sand separator <b>308</b> for a predetermined fixed amount of time.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">But, in some examples, the amount of time that the outlet valve(s) <b>318</b> are open and thus the sand separator <b>308</b> is being emptied of the particulate matter is variable. For example, in some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically close one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> based on: (1) one or more measured temperatures of the vessel <b>368</b> received from one or more of the temperature sensors <b>326</b>; (2) one or more measured masses of the vessel <b>368</b> received from the mass sensor <b>344</b>; (3) a measured pressure within the particulate outlet <b>312</b> received from the pressure sensor <b>348</b>; and/or (4) an amount of particulate matter detected within the particulate outlet <b>312</b> by the particulate sensor <b>346</b>. Moreover, in some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to automatically close one or more of the outlet valves <b>318</b> based on a level of the particulate matter within the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b> (e.g., a measured level received from the level sensor <b>342</b>, determined by the processor <b>322</b> based on one or more measured temperatures of the vessel <b>368</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> of the computing device <b>320</b> is configured to record one or more weights measured by the scale <b>328</b> of the particulate matter discharged from the sand separator <b>308</b> into the collection container <b>314</b>.

For example, the processor <b>322</b> may select the position of the choke valve <b>324</b> to reduce the pressure of the particulate matter exiting the vessel <b>368</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b>. Moreover, and for example, the processor <b>322</b> may select the position of the choke valve <b>324</b> to control a pressure drop within the particulate outlet <b>312</b> of the sand separator <b>308</b> by minimizing a pressure drop to a predetermined value or less (e.g., approximately 700 psi or less, approximately 500 psi or less, approximately 300 psi or less, etc.). In other words, the processor <b>322</b> may control the choke valve <b>324</b> to prevent the pressure within the particulate outlet <b>312</b> from dropping more than a predetermined value (e.g., more than approximately 300 psi, more than approximately 500 psi, more than approximately 700 psi, etc.). In some examples, the processor <b>322</b> is configured to control the choke valve <b>324</b> (e.g., automatically open or close the choke valve <b>324</b>, etc.) based on a pressure within the particulate outlet <b>312</b>, for example a measured pressure received from the pressure sensor <b>348</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The automatic opening and closing of the outlet valves <b>318</b> of the frac sand separator system <b>300</b> performed by the computing device <b>320</b> provides a more reliable, less time-consuming, and/or less costly determination of when to empty the vessel of a sand separator.

In one instance, the computing unit is configured with tangible hardware elements, or machines, that are integral, or operably coupled, to the nodes to enable each device to perform a variety of processes and operations. In another instance, the computing unit may encompass a processor (not shown) coupled to the computer-readable medium (e.g., computer storage media and communication media) accommodated by each of the nodes.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The role instances that reside on the nodes support operation of service applications, and may be interconnected via application programming interfaces (APIs). In one instance, one or more of these interconnections may be established via a network cloud, such as public network <b>902</b>. The network cloud serves to interconnect resources, such as the role instances, which may be distributed across various physical hosts, such as nodes <b>932</b> and <b>934</b>. In addition, the network cloud facilitates communication over channels connecting the role instances of the service applications running in the data center <b>916</b>. By way of example, the network cloud may include, without limitation, one or more communication networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and/or wide area networks (WANs). Such communication networks are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet, and therefore need not be discussed at length herein.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example Operating Environment</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Although described in connection with the example computing devices <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>800</b>, examples of the disclosure are capable of implementation with numerous other general-purpose or special-purpose computing system environments, configurations, or devices.
