Seeds are typically planted in trenches formed by discs or other mechanisms of a planter row unit. Seed-delivery systems, in particular ones that deliver the seed from the meter to the trench with air, can convey the seed with high enough velocity that some seeds bounce out of the trench. A seed that has bounced out, lying on top of the ground, has a high risk of not germinating.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, a seed tab for a planter has an elongate body configured for attachment to a seed boot of a seed meter. The elongate body has a curved surface defining a first arc having an axis of curvature in a first direction. The curved surface exhibits a concave cross-section defining a second arc having an axis of curvature in a second direction generally perpendicular to the first direction.

The second seeder row unit includes a second furrow opener, a second seed boot configured to deliver seed from the second seeder row unit to a second furrow formed by the second furrow opener, and a second seed tab comprising a second elongate body configured for attachment to the second seed boot. The first and second elongate bodies each have a curved surface defining a first arc having an axis of curvature in a first direction and a concave cross-section defining a second arc having an axis of curvature in a second direction generally perpendicular to the first direction. The first elongate body is a mirror image of the second elongate body.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming what are regarded as embodiments of the present disclosure, various features and advantages of the disclosure may be more readily ascertained from the following description of example embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified side view of a row unit for planting;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified cross-sectional view of a seed-delivery mechanism including a seed tab;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified top view of the seed-delivery mechanism and seed tab shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a simplified bottom rear view of the seed-delivery mechanism and seed tab shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates two seed-delivery mechanisms and two seed tabs adjacent one another in a mirror-image configuration.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The illustrations presented herein are not actual views of any planter or portion thereof, but are merely idealized representations that are employed to describe example embodiments of the present disclosure.

The seeder row unit <b>100</b> has a frame <b>102</b> coupled to a frame of the seeding machine, such as by a bar clamp <b>104</b>. Seeds are typically delivered to the seeder row unit <b>100</b> by gravity or pneumatically by a seed tube <b>106</b> that extends down from a lower part of the seeding machine. The seed tube <b>106</b> may be, for example, a plastic or metal tube. In another embodiment, the frame <b>102</b> may carry a seed meter assembly, which may include a mini-hopper holding seeds from a main seed hopper on the seeding machine or a commodity cart associated with the seeding machine.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The frame <b>102</b> carries furrow opener <b>108</b> configured to rotate relative to the frame <b>102</b> on a bearing assembly <b>110</b>, which may be aligned with or angled with respect to the travel direction of the seeding machine. In the illustrated example, the furrow opener <b>108</b> is angled with respect to a travel direction D to form a generally V-shaped furrow when the furrow opener <b>108</b> cuts into the ground into which the seeds are deposited. A rotating seed press wheel <b>112</b> is mounted to the frame <b>102</b> behind the furrow opener <b>108</b> for pressing deposited seeds into the seed furrow. A rotating closing wheel <b>114</b> is mounted to the furrow opener <b>108</b> immediately behind the seed press wheel <b>112</b> to collapse the seed furrow and cover the deposited seeds with a loose layer of soil.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Seeds are directed from the seed tube <b>106</b> downwardly into a seed boot assembly <b>116</b> disposed along and to a rear side of the furrow opener <b>108</b>. The seed boot assembly <b>116</b> includes a seed boot <b>118</b> and a seed tab <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the seed boot <b>118</b> may also include a boot liner (not shown), such as flexible tube or other liner material, that may couple directly to the seed tube <b>106</b>, or indirectly via an adapter. In certain embodiments, the seed boot <b>118</b> may be a rigid assembled or monolithic component. The seed boot <b>118</b> may mount to the frame <b>102</b> in any suitable manner, for example, by an integrally formed mounting tab <b>122</b>, a pivot bolt or pin, and/or a spring to bias the seed boot <b>118</b> into the furrow opener <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified cross-sectional view of a seed-delivery mechanism <b>200</b> that includes a seed boot <b>118</b> and the seed tab <b>120</b> attached to the seed boot <b>118</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified top view of the seed tab <b>120</b> and a portion of the seed boot <b>118</b> to which the seed tab <b>120</b> is attached. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a simplified view of the seed tab <b>120</b> from the bottom rear.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the seed boot <b>118</b> defines a seed passage <b>202</b> that has an inlet end <b>204</b> and an outlet end <b>206</b>. The inlet end <b>204</b> is located in front of the mounting tab <b>122</b> and the bearing assembly <b>110</b>, with respect to the travel direction D of the seeder row unit <b>100</b>. The outlet end <b>206</b> is located below and behind the mounting tab <b>122</b> and the bearing assembly <b>110</b>. An integrally formed vane <b>124</b> projects downward and rearward from the outlet end <b>206</b>. The vane <b>124</b> forms a laterally outer side wall for the outlet end <b>206</b> of the seed boot <b>118</b>. The furrow opener <b>108</b> is positioned close to the seed boot <b>118</b> and effectively forms a laterally inner side wall for the outlet end <b>206</b> of the seed boot <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated example, the seed boot <b>118</b> follows a generally straight trajectory from a side perspective, extending downward and rearward at approximately 35-50 degrees, and in some cases about 45 degrees, from horizontal when mounted to the frame <b>102</b> as shown, depending on the depth and height setting of the frame <b>102</b> from the ground. The seed passage <b>202</b> may also have a generally straight, uniform cross-section between the inlet end <b>204</b> and the outlet end <b>206</b>. Generally, however, the seed passage <b>202</b> is curved to provide adequate clearance between the seed boot <b>118</b> and the bearing assembly <b>110</b> of the furrow opener <b>108</b>. In the illustrated example, the seed passage <b>202</b> has a contoured inner dimension that follows a slightly curved trajectory (e.g., in the laterally outward to inward direction) configured to help reduce side to side (i.e., lateral) seed bounce within the seed boot <b>118</b>, or to otherwise effect seed bounce that causes the seeds to follow a trajectory that expels the seeds in straight lines directly behind the seed boot <b>118</b>. This helps to reduce the number of seeds being deposited at locations other than at the bottom of the furrow (e.g., outside the furrow when the seed boot is running above the ground plane.) The seed passage <b>202</b> may have a generally circular cross-section at the inlet end <b>204</b> and a portion of its length, and have a non-circular cross-section through the remainder of its length and at the outlet end <b>206</b>, transitioning smoothly from the generally circular cross-section to an oblong cross-section having a smaller lateral (sideways) dimension than its height dimension at the outlet end <b>206</b>. The outer surface dimensions and configuration of the seed boot <b>118</b> may also vary. However, in the illustrated example, little or none of the seed boot <b>118</b> extends beyond the laterally inner side of the furrow opener, and the vane <b>124</b> may be positioned and configured to skim across the surface of the furrow wall opposite the furrow opener <b>108</b>. This may reduce wearing of the seed boot <b>118</b> and aid in enclosing the seeds deposited from the seed boot <b>118</b>, in part by reducing boot-to-soil contact that may tend to widen the top of the furrow inadvertently.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described, the seed boot <b>118</b>, including the vane <b>124</b>, in combination with the furrow opener <b>108</b> and the furrow walls, operates to enclose or confine, or otherwise define, the volume in which seeds may be deposited from the seed boot <b>118</b>. The seed tab <b>120</b> also helps to define this volume, and directs the seeds downward toward the bottom of the furrow.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the seed tab <b>120</b> has an elongate body having a first end <b>208</b> coupled to the seed boot <b>118</b> and a second end <b>210</b> opposite the first end <b>208</b>. At the first end <b>208</b>, a generally planar surface <b>212</b> may couple the seed tab <b>120</b> to the seed boot <b>118</b> through a hole <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) defined through the generally planar surface <b>212</b>, typically by a screw or other fastener. In other embodiments, the first end <b>208</b> may have another shape of surface to match a different shape of the seed boot <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second end <b>210</b> has a curved surface <b>214</b> defining a first arc having an axis of curvature <b>216</b> in a first direction; that is, the axis of curvature <b>216</b> extends in a direction perpendicular to the paper in the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Therefore, the curved surface <b>214</b> has an arc having a radius of curvature <b>218</b> centered about the axis of curvature <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the curved surface <b>214</b> also exhibits a concave cross-section <b>402</b> defining a second arc with an axis of curvature <b>404</b> in a second direction generally perpendicular to the first direction. The concave cross-section <b>402</b> has a radius of curvature <b>406</b> centered about the axis of curvature <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the seed tab <b>120</b> has a first portion having an approximately constant width adjacent the first end <b>208</b>. That is, in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the body of the seed tab <b>120</b> is bounded by parallel planes <b>304</b>. The seed tab <b>120</b> has a second portion having a tapered width adjacent the second end <b>210</b>. That is, in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the body of the seed tab <b>120</b> is bounded by angled planes <b>306</b>, which may intersect at any selected angle. For example, the angle formed by the angled planes <b>306</b> may be approximately equivalent to the angle formed by the furrow opener <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and thus, the sides of the seed tab <b>120</b> may be flat against the sides of the furrow when the seeder row unit <b>100</b> is used in a planting operation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also depicts that a maximum width of the tapered second portion may be greater than the constant width of the first portion. The wider part of the tapered second portion may be in the form of a &#x201c;step&#x201d; outward when viewed from the top of the seed tab <b>120</b> toward the bottom. In particular, a notch <b>308</b> or cutout may be present, and the portion of the seed tab <b>120</b> above the notch <b>308</b> may be narrower than the portion of the seed tab <b>120</b> immediately below the notch <b>308</b>. The notch <b>308</b> may enable the seed tab <b>120</b> to extend laterally past the vane <b>124</b>, which is typically on one side of the seed boot <b>118</b> or the other. The extended (wider) portion of the seed tab <b>120</b>, which is also concave as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, may be configured to limit or prevent seeds leaving the seed boot <b>118</b> from bouncing laterally outward, and instead directs the seeds downward toward the bottom of the furrow. If the notch <b>308</b> is on one side only, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the seed tab <b>120</b> is asymmetrical.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The curved surface <b>214</b> may be defined mathematically as a saddle surface, or a surface having a saddle point. That is, the curved surface <b>214</b> curves upward in one direction at a certain point, and downward in another direction. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the curved surface <b>214</b> at the saddle point <b>408</b> curves downward left and right in the plane of view, and upward in and out of the plane of view (i.e., toward and away from the viewer). Note that the location of the saddle point <b>408</b> may vary based on which direction is defined as &#x201c;up.&#x201d; Nonetheless, the curved surface <b>214</b> has curvature in opposite directions at the same point. The different curvature tends to direct seeds toward the center of the seed tab <b>120</b> and along the length of the seed tab <b>120</b>, toward the bottom of the furrow.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the seed tab <b>120</b> is secured to the seed boot <b>118</b>, the shape of the interior of the seed boot <b>118</b> may have a smooth transition to the shape of the underside of the seed tab <b>120</b>, and the seed tab <b>120</b> may match the curvature of the seed boot <b>118</b>. In other words, the seed tab <b>120</b> may have the same shape as a portion of a hypothetical smooth extension of the seed boot <b>118</b>. Thus, the radius of curvature <b>406</b> of the seed tab <b>120</b> may be approximately the same as the radius of curvature of the seed boot <b>118</b> at the point of connection of the seed tab <b>120</b> to the seed boot <b>118</b>. Dashed line <b>222</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> traces the lower extent of the interior surface of the seed boot <b>118</b> and the upper extent of the curved surface <b>214</b> of the seed tab <b>120</b>. If these surfaces are aligned and have approximately the same curvature, seeds traveling outward from the seed boot <b>118</b> may have a relatively lower chance of bouncing out of the furrow before being directed downward by the seed tab <b>120</b>. The curved surface <b>214</b> may be discontinuous (e.g., offset) from the generally planar surface <b>212</b> used to secure the seed tab <b>120</b> (as shown by the dashed line <b>220</b> above the dashed line <b>222</b>) to position the curved surface <b>214</b> in line with the interior surface of the seed boot <b>118</b>. This discontinuity or &#x201c;step down&#x201d; may enable the seed tab <b>120</b> to match the curvature of the interior of the seed boot <b>118</b> more closely than a conventional seed tab that lacks the discontinuity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An effect of the shape of the seed tab <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is that the seed tab <b>120</b> is asymmetrical and not reversible. Thus, planters that have seed meters with different seed boots <b>118</b>, typically a &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; orientation indicated as seed boot <b>118</b>L and seed boot <b>118</b>R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, may require different seed tabs <b>120</b>L and <b>120</b>R, with seed tab <b>120</b>L being a mirror image of seed tab <b>120</b>R. Though having two different, non-interchangeable parts is less desirable from a maintenance perspective (e.g., manufacturing and stocking additional parts), the improvement in performance of the seed tabs <b>120</b> may warrant the complication.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another effect of the shape of the seed tab <b>120</b> shown is that the curved surface <b>214</b> of the seed tab <b>120</b> pushes seeds downward earlier than conventional straight seed tabs because the open volume between the bottom of the seed tab <b>120</b> and the furrow is smaller than for a conventional straight seed tab. A smaller radius of curvature <b>218</b> may decrease the open volume. Typically, the radius of curvature <b>218</b> may be from about 4 inches (10.16 cm) to about 18 inches (45.72 cm), such as from about 6 inches (15.24 cm) to about 9 inches (22.86 cm). The radius of curvature <b>406</b> may be smaller than the radius of curvature <b>218</b>. For example, the radius of curvature <b>406</b> may from about 1 inch (2.54 cm) to about 6 inches (15.24 cm).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another effect of the shape of the seed tab <b>120</b> shown is that the seed tab <b>120</b> is relatively less likely to catch or snag on debris in the furrow because the angle of the second end <b>210</b> of the seed tab <b>120</b> is closer to horizontal than the angle of a conventional straight seed tab.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The seed tab <b>120</b> may be formed of a single material or of multiple materials. For example, the portion of the seed tab <b>120</b> near the first end <b>208</b> may be a flexible material (e.g., a polymer) to enable the seed tab <b>120</b> to flex to the shape of the furrow and glide over rocks or other objects. The portion of the seed tab <b>120</b> near the second end <b>210</b> may include a wear-resistant material (e.g., a metal) to enable the seed tab <b>120</b> to have a long useful life. Thus, the seed tab <b>120</b> having at least two materials may have beneficial properties from both materials.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The seed tabs disclosed herein may benefit a farmer by helping to control the consistency of seed depth during planting. More consistent seed depth can lead to better crop growth because, for example, early-emerging plants are less likely to shade later-emerging plants. More consistent seed depth may therefore translate into higher crop yield and better return-on-investment for the farmer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additional non-limiting example embodiments of the disclosure are described below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiment 1: A seed tab for a planter comprising an elongate body configured for attachment to a seed boot of a seed meter.
