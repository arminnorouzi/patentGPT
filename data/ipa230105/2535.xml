However, the end use of the fiber-reinforced plastic molded part may be applied to other applications as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The manufacturing processes used for the production of composites parts typically falls into two separate categories, prepregs or infusion resins. Prepregs consist of reinforcing fibers, either continuous or discontinuous, which are pre-impregnated with the resin such that it can be handled and then subsequently molded and cured. Prepregs include continuous fiber reinforced tapes and fabrics as well as discontinuous fibers, also known as chopped fibers, which are termed Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) or Bulk Molding Compound (BMC) and often exhibit a high degree of latency allowing the infused fibers to have an improved shelf-life. Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) resins are flowable either at room temperature or when heated such that they can be infused into the reinforcing fibers and subsequently cured. It is desirable for the infusion resin to be of a sufficiently low viscosity to allow the resin to flow into the fibers with minimal time. RTM resins are most often infused into the fibers in a mold which is then cured to give a desired final shape. Control of flow rates in combination with desirable reaction times and viscosity has proven elusive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The formation of polyisocyanurates is known to be a slow process which is often considered a secondary reaction in the formation of polyurethanes and polyureas. Isocyanurates are formed through the trimerization of three isocyanates and have been widely used for decades to increase the thermal stability of polyurethanes, epoxies and polyureas. Isocyanurates are also widely used in the production of foams due to its excellent flammability resistance, however high density polymers based essentially on polyisocyanurates alone have not found use without the formation of additional linkages which act to increase the toughness of the polymer. To overcome a defect widely known as friability of polyisocyanurate foams or brittleness, polyisocyanurates have required an inclusion of high percentages of reactants that consume isocyanate groups and limit the fraction of isocyanurates in the polymer. U.S. Pat. No. 3,676,380A describes the use of 1 to 10% of an aliphatic diol to form polyurethane linages which increase the elasticity of the polymer. U.S. Pat. No. 3,793,236 describes trimerizing an isocyanate-terminated polyoxazolidone prepolymer by means of a trimerization catalyst such as a tertiary amine. The inventors describe the resulting polymer as exhibiting low friability and high flame resistivity due to the incorporation of oxazolidone linkages. CN Pat. App. Pub. No. 103,012,713A discloses that foams with a high degree of pure polyisocyanurate crosslinking density have very brittle properties and &#x201c;no practical value.&#x201d; The inventors use 10-50% epoxy resin to achieve reduced brittleness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When polyisocyanurates are used in the production of dense plastics with a low void content, the materials are widely known to be brittle without the incorporation of linear bonds, chain extenders or flexible groups that act to increase toughness, i.e. oxazolidones disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,793,236; 8,501,877; U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0151138A1); urethanes disclosed in (EP Pat. Nos. 226,176B1; EP 0,643,086A1 U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,334,379; 9,334,379); and ureas disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,617,032 B2; and CN Pat. No. 103,568,337B). For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,651 teaches cured isocyanate/epoxy blends with an epoxy to isocyanate ratio less than 1:5 are extremely brittle and get increasingly worse with increasing concentration of diphenylmethane diisocyanate concentration (MDI) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,135 teaches that that when less than 20% epoxy is included in the polyisocyanurate polymer, it exhibits poor mechanical properties. These two patents teach that it is not possible to obtain a polymer with high strength and toughness with less than 20% epoxy or less than 20% oxazolidone which is the result of the reaction between an isocyanate and an epoxy at high temperature. EP Pat. App. No. 3,189,088A1 further teaches that &#x201c;polyisocyanurate comprising materials are known to be very difficult to toughen and some may be too brittle to toughen effectively&#x201d; and &#x201c;attempts to increase the fracture toughness in the past often came at the expense of changes (typically reduction) in modulus and of reductions in thermal properties e.g. glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) thereby creating unacceptable limits on the applicability of the resulting composite.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">US Pat. App. Pub. No. 2018/0051119 A1 teaches that the molar ratio of the at least one epoxy resin to the at least one isocyanate resin should be at least 0.4:1 and most preferably 1:1 and that this ratio leads to &#x201c;particularly advantageous properties with the glass transition temperature, the modulus of elasticity and impact resistance.&#x201d; These preferred ratios far exceed catalytic amounts of epoxy to achieve desirable tensile strength, tensile stiffness and tensile strain to failure results. Furthermore, the aforementioned patents clearly teach that polymers and foams composed essentially of polyisocyanurates exhibit a high degree of brittleness.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">While the prior art references described above disclose various efforts to improve physical properties of polymers containing polyisocyanurates by reacting various active hydrogen containing molecules. Accordingly, there is a need for improvement for a cured composition which is essentially free of the reaction product of these moieties and provides the high strength, high stiffness, high strain to failure, high toughness and high glass transition temperature required by modern polymers, fiber reinforced polymers and adhesives.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to low room temperature viscosity RTM resins that are composed primarily of an isocyanate reaction mixture that includes polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) of the time disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/029,998, the contents of which are included herein by reference for brevity of the present application, and their use in the manufacture of fiber reinforced composites through resin transfer molding or pultrusion. The predominately isocyanate infusion resin is mixed with a catalyst and subsequently infused into the reinforcing fibers through wet infusion, resin transfer molding, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM), reaction injection molding, high pressure resin transfer molding (HP-RTM) or pultrusion and cured through heating the polymer such that it cures to the form of the mold. The cured fiber reinforced composites possess high strength, high stiffness, high glass transition temperature and fire resistance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The reaction mixture described in the present invention has found that can be infused into a fiber preform and cure to form a rigid composite with a high glass transition temperature in under 10 minutes and in particular in least 5 minutes, and in another embodiment at least 3 minutes and in still a further embodiment can be cured in 90 seconds or less.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the invention provides a method for producing a fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite through resin transfer molding; the method comprising the following steps.

Next, reinforcing fibers are placed or arranged in the die or mold. In refinement, the fibers are inserted into the die in either a batch process or continuously as performed during pultrusion. Alternatively, the fibers can be wet infused from a bath or closed injection box and wound onto a mandrel. It should be understood that fibers or solids can be woven and even wetted or impregnated with reaction mixture prior to entering the die cavity or equivalent forming tooling. Further, as used herein, reinforcing solids includes fibrous materials, such as, for example fiber glass, carbon fibers, woven fibers or any fibrous material that enhances mechanical properties of a structural part. Still further, reinforcing solids includes particulate solids such, for example graphene, zeolite, or any other particulate solid that enhances mechanical properties of a structural part. Next, a liquid reaction mixture is provided. The liquid reaction mixture comprises at least one liquid, aromatic polyisocyanate and a catalyst composition. In refinement, the liquid reaction mixture can also comprise at least one liquid, aliphatic polyisocyanate. In refinement, the liquid reaction mixture can comprise a internal mold release agent. In another embodiment, the reaction mixture is polysiloxane or and equivalent. However, alternative types of internal release agents are also within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Next, the liquid reaction mixture is infused into the mold or die containing fibers. In refinement, this infusion occurs by high pressure resin transfer molding (HP-RTM), wet infusion, resin transfer molding, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) or reaction injection molding. In refinement the reaction mixture may be infused at room temperature or heated to reduce the viscosity to less than 1,000 cP for infusion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Next, the die or mold is heated to at least 80&#xb0; C. to cure the reaction mixture infused into the reinforcing fibers through the self-reaction of the isocyanate groups. Finally, the cured fiber reinforced composite is removed from the die cavity or mold.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In further refinement, the at least one aromatic polyisocyanate includes polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) such that the at least one aromatic polyisocyanate has an average functionality greater than 2.1, in particular at least 2.2, or at least 2.5 and even greater than 2.7. In refinement, the catalyst composition includes at least one epoxide which may be monofunctional or polyfunctional in a proportion to the total reaction mixture of up to 10%, in particular between 0.01% and 5%. In an alternative embodiment, the catalyst composition includes at least one epoxide which may be monofunctional or polyfunctional in a proportion to the total reaction mixture of up to 10%. In further refinement, the catalyst composition includes at least one epoxide which may be monofunctional or polyfunctional in a proportion to the total reaction mixture of between 0.5% and 4%. In further refinement, the catalyst composition includes at least one epoxide which may be monofunctional or polyfunctional in a proportion to the total reaction mixture of between 1.0% and 2.5% and in a further embodiment 2%.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, the liquid reaction mixture includes a room temperature viscosity below 2,000 cP. In yet another embodiment, the liquid reaction mixture should have a viscosity below 1,000 cP when heated to 70&#xb0; C. Still further, the liquid reaction mixture includes a room temperature viscosity of at 250 cP and at 70&#xb0; C. a viscosity of 20 cP. It should be understood that viscosity of the liquid reaction mixture can be tailored for a particular application, such as, for example restricted volume die cavities and the like to avoid voids or other defects that could occur when viscosity has not been optimized.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another refinement, when the die or mold is heated to between 80&#xb0; C. and 120&#xb0; C. the reaction mixture infused into the fiber's cures in under 2 hours. In another refinement, when the die or mold is heated to between 120&#xb0; C. and 150&#xb0; C., the reaction mixture infused into the fiber's cures in under 1 hour. In another refinement, when the die or mold is heated to between 120&#xb0; C. and 180&#xb0; C., the reaction mixture infused into the fiber's cures in under 10 minutes. In another embodiment, the die or mold is heated to between 100&#xb0; C. and 180&#xb0; C. resulting in a cured fiber reinforced composite in less than 5 minutes. In another refinement, the die is heated to between 100&#xb0; C. and 180&#xb0; C. resulting in a cured fiber reinforced composite in a less than 3 minutes. In another refinement, the die is heated to between 100&#xb0; C. and 180&#xb0; C. resulting in a cured fiber reinforced composite in a less than 1 minute.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cured composition also displays unexpected, and significant increases in glass transition temperature (Tg) when subject to ambient aging. The cured composition displays a Tg above 160&#xb0; C. independent of the temperature at which the composition is cured. In another refinement and upon aging of the cured reinforced composition for several weeks under ambient conditions the Tg continues to increase above 300&#xb0; C.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x201c;At least one,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to 1 or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more. In connection with components of the catalyst compositions described herein, this information does not refer to the absolute amount of molecules, but to the type of the component. &#x201c;At least one epoxy resin&#x201d; therefore signifies, for example, one or more different epoxy resins, which is to say one or more different types of epoxy resins. Together with quantities, the quantities refer to the total amount of the correspondingly identified type of component, as already defined.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">&#x201c;Liquid,&#x201d; as used herein, denotes compositions that are flowable at room temperature (20&#xb0; C.) and normal pressure (1,013 mbar).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When referring to a chemical moiety, &#x201c;Substantially Free&#x201d; means a molar fraction of molecules containing that particular moiety of less than 10% in the reaction mixture or cured composition. In some cases, &#x201c;Substantially Free&#x201d; means the molar fraction of molecules containing that particular moiety of less than 7.5% and even less than 5% in the reaction mixture or cured composition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The viscosity of the liquid composition described herein is in particular low enough for the composition to be pumpable and capable of wetting and impregnating fiber materials, for example, such as are used for fiber-reinforced plastic parts. In one embodiment of the invention the reaction mixture has a viscosity between 100 and 300 cP at room temperature and a viscosity of 10 to 50 cP when heated to 65&#xb0; C. In various embodiments, the reaction mixture has a viscosity of less than 50 cP at a temperature of 50&#xb0; C. So as to determine the viscosity, the resin mixture is produced at room temperature using a suitable mixer, and the viscosity is determined on a spindle type rheometer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention has found that the infusion of reinforcing fibers with a predominately isocyanate reaction mixture that includes polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI), and a catalyst results in a cured composition with high strength, Young's modulus, glass transition, and toughness. The reaction mixture is composed primarily of isocyanates and substantially free of polyols and polyamines.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, a dense polymer is one that is substantially free of voids with a void content less than 10% and even less than 2%. The present invention achieves a fiber reinforced composite articles with high strength, fracture toughness and high glass transition temperature (greater than 160&#xb0; C.), through the polymerization of a reaction mixture of containing polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate and a catalytic amount of epoxy while being substantially free of molecules containing active hydrogen moieties such as hydroxyls, primary and secondary amines, carboxylic acids, thiols, and others known to one of skill in the art. The present invention further demonstrates that contrary to expectations, the presence of aliphatic uretdione, aliphatic trimer, or aliphatic iminooxadiazinedione which are reaction products of two or three aliphatic isocyanates accelerates the polymerization reaction enabling greater isocyanate conversion and improved mechanical strength at lower cure temperature.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cured fiber reinforced composite resulting from the polymerization of the essentially isocyanate reaction mixture lacks fracture toughness and strength without the use of polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) as a fraction of the reaction mixture. Therefore, it is desirable to produce an average isocyanate functionality greater than 2.1, in particular at least 2.2, more preferably at least 2.5 and still more preferably greater than 2.7 is selected. The present invention includes epoxy in an amount representative of being a catalyst and therefore does not significantly affect material properties.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Oligomeric MDI in the sense of this application means a polyisocyanate mixture of higher-nuclear homologues of MDI, which have at least 3 aromatic nuclei and a functionality of at least 3.

Typically, the monomer content of the polymeric MDI is in the range from 25 to 85 wt. %, based on the total mass of the pMDI such that the average functionality is greater than about 2.1.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to pMDI, the isocyanate mixture in step 1) may contain monomeric or oligomeric isocyanates. Monomeric isocyanate includes the customary aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aliphatic di- and/or polyisocyanates and especially aromatic isocyanates which are known from polyurethane chemistry. Aromatic isocyanates, especially the isomers of the MDI series (monomeric MDI) and TDI are particularly beneficial.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Isocyanates useful in embodiments disclosed herein may include isocyanates, polyisocyanates, isocyanate carbodiimides, uretidiones and trimers composed of such isocyanates. Suitable polyisocyanates include any of the known aromatic, aliphatic, alicyclic, cycloaliphatic, and araliphatic di- and/or polyisocyanates. Inclusive of these isocyanates are variants such as uretidiones, isocyanurates, carbodiimides, iminooxadiazinedione, among others which are produced through the reaction between isocyanates.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Suitable aromatic diisocyanate compounds may include for example xylylene diisocyanate, metaxylylene diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, 1,4-naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-toluidine diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-diphenyl ether diisocyanate, m- or p-phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-biphenylene diisocyanate, 3,3&#x2032;-dimethyl-4,4&#x2032;-biphenylene diisocyanate, bis(4-isocyanatophenyl)-sulfone, isopropylidenebis (4-phenylisocyanate), and the like.

C. for 1 hour followed by 2 hours at 180&#xb0; C. whereas the present invention cures at 170&#xb0; C. in under 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Short beam strength of composite specimens.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Short Beam Strength</entry><entry>Glass Transition Temperature</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Example 1</entry><entry>48.36 &#xb1;
