For example, the valid time is N milliseconds (ms) or N slots, and N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">If the valid time of the search space set expires, the search space set is invalid. If the valid time of the search space set does not expire, the search space set is valid.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">It can be understood that the parameter of the search space set may further include an existing parameter specified in an existing protocol.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Further, the valid time of the search space set may be configured by using higher layer signaling (for example, RRC signaling).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">Step <b>202</b>: Switch to a first search space set group if the terminal executes a target behavior, where the first search space set group is any one of the at least two search space set groups.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The target behavior is used to trigger the terminal to automatically switch to the first search space set group, and the first search space set group may also be referred to as a target search space set group.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">The switching to a first search space set group means that UE monitors a PDCCH according to a search space set configuration of the first search space set group, that is, the UE switches to the first search space set group to monitor the PDCCH. That is, the terminal no longer monitors the PDCCH according to a previous search space set configuration.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">For example, before switching to the first search space set group, the terminal monitors a physical downlink control channel according to a second search space set group, where the second search space set group is a search space set group other than the first search space set group in the at least two search space set groups. If the terminal executes the target behavior, the terminal no longer monitors the PDCCH according to the second search space set group.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In some embodiments, the target behavior may be configured by a network side. For example, the terminal receives configuration information of the target behavior from a network device. For example, the terminal receives higher layer signaling (for example, RRC signaling) from the network device, and the higher layer signaling carries the configuration information of the target behavior of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">In some embodiments, the target behavior includes one or more of the following:</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">(1) Sending uplink data scheduled by a configured grant.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">For example, uplink data scheduled by a type 1 and/or type 2 configured grant is sent.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">For example, the terminal automatically switches to the first search space set group when sending the uplink data scheduled by the type 1 and/or type 2 configured grant (for example, the uplink data is transmitted by using a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)).
