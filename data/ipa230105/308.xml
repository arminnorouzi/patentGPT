In addition, also in the industrial field, an endoscope system that enters the inside of a device through a slight gap and enables various inspections is widely used as a system that greatly contributes to security and safety of society.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a light source of an endoscope system, a lamp light source such as a xenon lamp, an LED light source, and the like have been mainly used so far, but in recent years, an endoscope system using a laser light source has also started to be introduced. Laser light sources have many advantages such as high brightness, low power consumption, compactness, and fast startup, and are expected to be used more and more in the future.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a laser is used as the light source, a video scope is required to have a structure in which high-output laser light does not leak out of a protective tube. As a situation in which light leaks from the protective tube of the video scope, basically, it is assumed that an optical fiber is damaged. Therefore, by suppressing damage of the optical fiber in the protective tube, it is possible to suppress light from leaking out of the protective tube. A technique for suppressing breakage of an optical fiber is disclosed in, for example, JP 2019-51022 A.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A light guide unit according to an aspect of the present invention includes: a light guide member that guides narrow band light; a protection member that is formed of a material having heat resistance to the narrow band light and surrounds the light guide member and has flexibility due to distribution of a gap smaller than a diameter of the light guide member; and a light diffusing member that covers the protection member from outside and diffuses the narrow band light.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an endoscope system;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an endoscope system;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a configuration of a protection member;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line V-V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light diffusing member;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the light diffusing member;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit according to a second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit according to a third embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit according to a fourth embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is not easy to completely prevent breakage of the optical fiber. For example, even if a structure for protecting the optical fiber is thickened so that the optical fiber is not damaged by an external force, such a countermeasure is limited because a diameter of an insertion portion of the video scope is limited. In particular, in an endoscope system having a small diameter such as an oral endoscope and a nasal endoscope, it is difficult to completely prevent breakage of the optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an endoscope system <b>1</b>. Hereinafter, a configuration of the endoscope system <b>1</b> common to each embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the endoscope system <b>1</b> includes a video scope <b>10</b> which is an endoscope having an imaging element, and a video processor <b>20</b>. The endoscope system <b>1</b> may further include a light source device <b>30</b> and a display device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The video scope <b>10</b> is not particularly limited, but is, for example, a flexible endoscope. The video scope <b>10</b> may be, for example, a video scope used for examination or treatment of a respiratory system such as a bronchus, or may be a video scope used for examination or treatment of a digestive system. Furthermore, the video scope <b>10</b> is not limited to a medical video scope, and may be an industrial video scope.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video scope <b>10</b> includes an operation unit <b>11</b> operated by an operator, an insertion portion <b>12</b> to be inserted into a subject, a universal cord <b>13</b> extending from the operation unit <b>11</b> and connected to the video processor <b>20</b> and the light source device <b>30</b>, and a connector unit <b>14</b> provided at an end of the universal cord <b>13</b>. The video scope <b>10</b> outputs, to the video processor <b>20</b>, an electric signal obtained by imaging the subject in a state where the insertion portion <b>12</b> is inserted into the body cavity of the subject.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The video processor <b>20</b> is a control device that controls the operation of the endoscope system <b>1</b>. For example, the video processor <b>20</b> converts a signal from the video scope <b>10</b> into a video signal and displays an image of the subject on the display device <b>40</b>. In addition, the video processor <b>20</b> may control the light source device <b>30</b>, for example, based on the video signal, and may perform processing relating to automatic dimming control.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The light source device <b>30</b> is a device that supplies narrow band light to the video scope <b>10</b>, and specifically includes a laser light source that emits laser light as narrow band light. The laser light source included in the light source device <b>30</b> is not particularly limited, but for example, emits blue laser light. In this case, the endoscope system <b>1</b> may illuminate the subject with white light in which blue and yellow light are mixed by providing a fluorescent substance that is excited by blue laser light and emits yellow light at the distal end of the video scope <b>10</b>. Here, the blue laser beam has been exemplified, but the light source device <b>30</b> may emit laser beams of other wavelengths, or may switch or simultaneously emit laser beams of a plurality of different wavelengths. Specifically, the wavelength of the laser light emitted from the light source device <b>30</b> may be any wavelength in the visible light region (about 380 nm to 780 nm), for example. Furthermore, the wavelength of the laser light emitted from the light source device <b>30</b> may be outside the visible light region, and may be, for example, a wavelength in the ultraviolet region or the infrared region. Note that the light source device <b>30</b> may further include a semiconductor light source for narrow band imaging (NBI) observation, and the endoscope system <b>1</b> may appropriately switch between normal observation with white light and NBI observation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The display device <b>40</b> is, for example, a liquid crystal display, but may be another type of display device such as an organic EL display, a plasma display, a CRT display, an LED matrix panel, electronic paper, or a projector. The endoscope system <b>1</b> may further include an endoscope hanger (not illustrated), and the video scope <b>10</b> may be hung and stored on the endoscope hanger.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the endoscope system <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the video scope <b>10</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> are connected by the universal cord <b>13</b>, but the endoscope system described in the present disclosure may be, for example, a wireless endoscope system <b>2</b> in which the video scope <b>50</b> and the video processor <b>21</b> are wirelessly communicably connected as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this case, the video scope <b>50</b> included in the endoscope system <b>2</b> includes an operation unit <b>51</b> operated by the operator and an insertion portion <b>52</b> inserted into the subject, and may further include a light source device <b>53</b> instead of the light source device <b>30</b> placed on an endoscope rack. In addition, the video scope <b>50</b> may operate by power supplied from a battery provided in the video scope <b>50</b> instead of receiving power supply from a commercial power source in a wired manner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the endoscope system <b>1</b> configured as described above, the laser light emitted from the light source device <b>30</b> is guided by the optical fiber to the universal cord <b>13</b>, the operation unit <b>11</b>, and the insertion portion <b>12</b> of the video scope <b>10</b> in order, and the subject is irradiated with the laser light from the distal end of the video scope <b>10</b>. That is, the insertion portion <b>12</b> of the video scope <b>10</b> is an example of a light guide unit that guides the laser light to the subject.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the video scope <b>10</b>, unlike the universal cord <b>13</b> and the operation unit <b>11</b>, the insertion portion <b>12</b> is a portion to be inserted into the subject, and thus is usually designed to have a diameter as small as possible. Therefore, in the video scope <b>10</b>, in general, the optical fiber is easily broken in the insertion portion <b>12</b> having a relatively thin structure surrounding the optical fiber as compared with the universal cord <b>13</b> and the operation unit <b>11</b>, and if the optical fiber is broken, the laser light emitted from the optical fiber easily breaks through the relatively thin surrounding structure and leaks out.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, a light guide unit (video scope) according to each embodiment described below prevents a strong laser beam from leaking to the outside even if the optical fiber is broken by devising the structure of the insertion portion. Hereinafter, each embodiment will be specifically described.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a configuration of a protection member <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line V-V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light diffusing member <b>103</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit <b>100</b>. Hereinafter, a structure of an insertion portion of the light guide unit <b>100</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the insertion portion of the light guide unit <b>100</b> includes an optical fiber <b>101</b> that is a light guide member that guides narrow band light, a protection member <b>102</b> surrounding the optical fiber <b>101</b>, and a light diffusing member <b>103</b> covering the protection member <b>102</b> from the outside. Note that the narrow band light is laser light in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The optical fiber <b>101</b> is, for example, a multimode optical fiber, but the light guide member may be a bundled optical fiber in which a plurality of optical fibers are bundled. The material of the optical fiber <b>101</b> is, for example, glass, but may be another material such as plastic that is less likely to break than glass. The optical fiber <b>101</b> has a columnar shape, more desirably a cylindrical shape. Hereinafter, a case where the optical fiber <b>101</b> has an outer diameter D will be described as an example.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The protection member <b>102</b> is a member that protects a member disposed outside the protection member <b>102</b> from a member accommodated inside the protection member <b>102</b>. Even if the optical fiber <b>101</b> is broken and damaged, the protection member <b>102</b> plays a role of confining the optical fiber <b>101</b> so that the broken optical fiber <b>101</b> does not break through the insertion portion and stick out to the outside. Therefore, the protection member <b>102</b> is not made of a material such as rubber that is easily melted by laser light, but is made of a material having heat resistance to at least laser light guided by the optical fiber <b>101</b>. Specifically, the protection member <b>102</b> is desirably, for example, a metal material that is less likely to melt down even when irradiated with laser light.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the metal material used for the protection member <b>102</b> desirably has a high absorptivity with respect to the laser light guided by the optical fiber <b>101</b>, and specifically desirably has a higher absorptivity with respect to white light. This is because the protection member <b>102</b> can play a role of confining the optical fiber <b>101</b> and a role of weakening the laser beam emitted from the broken optical fiber <b>101</b>. More specifically, as the material of the protection member <b>102</b>, stainless steel (SUS) having a high absorption rate for blue light is desirable. Note that the laser light guided by the optical fiber <b>101</b> is not limited to blue. Therefore, when the wavelength of the laser light to be guided is a color different from blue, the light guide unit desirably includes a protection member made of a material having a high absorption rate for the wavelength of the color different from blue.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, the insertion portion is required to be deformed in accordance with the shape of the subject in the subject. Therefore, the protection member <b>102</b> is configured to have flexibility even when the protection member is formed of a material that is relatively hardly deformed such as metal. Specifically, the protection member <b>102</b> has flexibility due to distribution of small gaps, and desirably has a network structure formed by knitting a metal material as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example. By having the network structure made of a metal material, it is possible not only to prevent melting down even when laser light is irradiated, but also to avoid breakage of the protection member <b>102</b> even when a large force is locally applied to the protection member <b>102</b> due to contact with the optical fiber <b>101</b>. Note that, in order to configure the protection member <b>102</b> to be deformable at an arbitrary position in an axial direction, it is desirable that the gaps be distributed along an axial direction of the optical fiber <b>101</b>, and it is more desirable that gaps G periodically exist along the axial direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, if the gap formed in the protection member <b>102</b> is too large, there is a possibility that the broken optical fiber <b>101</b> passes through the gap. Therefore, a gap smaller than the outer diameter of the optical fiber <b>101</b> is formed in the protection member <b>102</b>. Specifically, for example, when the network structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is formed, a diagonal length of the rectangular gap G formed by the network structure is desirably smaller than the outer diameter D of the optical fiber <b>101</b>. In addition, in a case where the two diagonal lengths (a diagonal length D<b>1</b> and a diagonal length D<b>2</b>) of the rectangle are different, the longer diagonal length D<b>2</b> is desirably smaller than the outer diameter D of the optical fiber <b>101</b>, and at least the shorter diagonal length D<b>1</b> is desirably smaller than the outer diameter D of the optical fiber <b>101</b>. Note that a cross-sectional shape of a metal material <b>102</b><i>b </i>constituting the protection member <b>102</b> is desirably a flat shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. This is because the metal material is a knitted, flat linear member that is bent to form a cylindrical shape. This makes it possible to include small gaps in the metal material and maintain high flexibility as compared with a case of knitting the metal material having a cylindrical cross-sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light diffusing member <b>103</b> is a member that diffuses the light incident on the light diffusing member <b>103</b> inside or on a surface of the light diffusing member <b>103</b> and emits the diffused light from the light diffusing member <b>103</b>. Even if the optical fiber <b>101</b> is broken and damaged, the light diffusing member <b>103</b> plays a role of reliably and sufficiently weakening the light intensity per unit area of the laser light emitted from the broken optical fiber <b>101</b>. In order to achieve the purpose of reliably and sufficiently weakening the light intensity, a light diffusing member that diffuses the laser light is used for the light diffusing member <b>103</b> instead of a light shielding member that shields the laser light by absorbing the laser light. This is because a light diffusing member that diffuses light is less likely to be destroyed by laser light than a light shielding member that absorbs light.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Specifically, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the light diffusing member <b>103</b> may contain fine particles such as silica as light diffusion particles <b>104</b>, and the laser light may be diffused by the light diffusion particles <b>104</b>. The light diffusion particles are not particularly limited. Any light diffusion particle can be adopted for the light diffusing member <b>103</b>. As a result, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, laser light L<b>1</b> emitted from the broken optical fiber <b>101</b> is diffused by the light diffusion particles <b>104</b>, and diffused light L<b>2</b> having a weakened light intensity per unit area is emitted from the light diffusing member <b>103</b>, so that it is possible to prevent the strong laser light from leaking from the insertion portion.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the light guide unit <b>100</b> configured as described above, even if the optical fiber <b>101</b> is damaged, it is possible to prevent strong light from leaking from the light guide unit <b>100</b> to the outside. Therefore, even when restriction is imposed on the diameter of the insertion portion as in the endoscope system <b>1</b>, the laser light source can be adopted as the light source of the endoscope system.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light diffusing member <b>113</b>.

The light diffusing member <b>113</b> is a light diffusing member that diffuses laser light with irregular bumps <b>114</b> formed on the surface. Even in a case where the light diffusing member <b>113</b> is provided instead of the light diffusing member <b>103</b>, it is possible to prevent strong laser light from leaking out of the insertion portion, similarly to a case where the light diffusing member <b>103</b> is provided.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, the structure in which the light diffusing member diffuses light may be the light diffusion particles contained in the light diffusing member or the bumps formed on the surface of the light diffusing member, and in any case, the light diffusing member is configured to be translucent in order to transmit light. This feature makes it possible to have a manufacturing advantage in that it is possible to cure the adhesive applied to the inner side of the light diffusing member with the ultraviolet ray irradiated from the outside in the manufacturing process of the light guide unit.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a light guide unit <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining the action of the light guide unit <b>200</b>.

The friction reducing member <b>201</b> plays a role of avoiding generation of a large frictional force when the side surface of the optical fiber <b>101</b> comes into contact with the protection member <b>102</b> during normal use of the light guide unit <b>200</b>, and instead, and preventing the optical fiber <b>101</b> from being damaged by friction with the protection member <b>102</b> by the side surface of the optical fiber <b>101</b> coming into contact with the friction reducing member <b>201</b> having a lower friction coefficient than the protection member <b>102</b>. As described above in the first embodiment, the protection member <b>102</b> has, for example, a network structure made of a metal material. Therefore, when the optical fiber <b>101</b> is in direct contact with the protection member <b>102</b>, a large friction occurs between the optical fiber <b>101</b> and the protection member <b>102</b>, and the surface (side surface) of the optical fiber <b>101</b> made of glass or plastic is damaged. The friction reducing member <b>201</b> covers the protection member <b>102</b> from the inside to prevent such a large friction from occurring. A material having a low friction coefficient is desirably used for the friction reducing member <b>201</b>, and for example, but not limited to, a fluororesin such as poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) may be used.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, it is desirable that the friction reducing member <b>201</b>, the protection member <b>102</b>, and the light diffusing member <b>103</b> are integrally formed without a gap. Hereinafter, these are collectively referred to as a braided tube <b>202</b>. A specific method of manufacturing the braided tube <b>202</b> is not particularly limited, but for example, the braided tube <b>202</b> may be formed by winding a metal material on the friction reducing member <b>201</b> to form the protection member <b>102</b> having a network structure, and further press bonding the light diffusing member <b>103</b> thereon.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the light guide unit <b>200</b> configured as described above, also, similarly to the light guide unit <b>100</b>, even if the optical fiber <b>101</b> is damaged, it is possible to prevent strong light from leaking from the light guide unit <b>200</b> to the outside.

Hereinafter, a structure of an insertion portion of the light guide unit <b>400</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the light guide unit <b>400</b> is different from the light guide unit <b>300</b> in including a spacing member <b>401</b> that holds an interval between the light diffusing member <b>103</b> and the light shielding member <b>301</b> within a predetermined range. The other points are similar to those of the light guide unit <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The spacing member <b>401</b> is a member that is provided between members to keep the spacing between the members within a predetermined range. The intensity of the laser light diffused by the light diffusing member <b>103</b> greatly changes according to a distance from the light diffusing member <b>103</b>, and attenuates as the distance from the light diffusing member <b>103</b> increases. As described above, since the light shielding member <b>301</b> is a member made of rubber or the like that shields light by absorbing light, if the light shielding member <b>301</b> is too close to the light diffusing member <b>103</b>, there is a possibility that the light shielding member <b>301</b> melts down in a case where the intensity of the laser light emitted from the light diffusing member <b>103</b> is strong. In order to avoid such a situation from occurring, the spacing member <b>401</b> plays a role of adjusting the intensity of the laser light incident on the light shielding member <b>301</b> to a range that the light shielding member <b>301</b> can endure while preventing the insertion portion from being excessively thick by holding the interval between the light diffusing member <b>103</b> and the light shielding member <b>301</b> within a predetermined range. The spacing member <b>401</b> is inevitably irradiated with a laser beam stronger than the light shielding member <b>301</b>. Therefore, unlike the light shielding member <b>301</b>, the spacing member <b>401</b> is desirably made of a material that does not melt down even when irradiated with a relatively strong laser beam, and thus, for example, a metal or the like is desirable similarly to the protection member <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The spacing member <b>401</b> also plays a role of maintaining the overall shape of the insertion portion. Therefore, it is desirable that the spacing member <b>401</b> is made of a material having a certain degree of hardness, and in this respect, it is also desirable that the spacing member is metal. Since the insertion portion moves inside the subject while being deformed in accordance with the shape of the subject, the spacing member <b>401</b> that plays a decisive role in the overall shape of the insertion portion is required to have both a certain degree of hardness and flexibility. In order to satisfy such a demand with the spacing member <b>401</b> made of metal, it is desirable that the spacing member <b>401</b> includes a corrugated tube. Since the spacing member <b>401</b> includes the corrugated tube, the insertion portion can be configured to be neither too soft nor too hard, so that it is possible to realize a light guide unit that is easy to handle.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the light guide unit <b>400</b> configured as described above, since the risk that the light shielding member <b>301</b> is destroyed by the laser light can be further reduced, even if the optical fiber <b>101</b> is damaged, the light can be more reliably prevented from leaking from the light guide unit <b>400</b> to the outside. In addition, since moderate hardness and flexibility are both achieved by the spacing member <b>401</b>, it is possible to obtain a light guide unit that is easy to handle.
