The detection area Z is, for example in the embodiment, a 120-degree horizontal range in rear of the vehicle <b>1</b>. In the embodiment, objects in the detection area Z include a vehicle A, a vehicle B, a vehicle C, and a ground surface G of the road on which the vehicle <b>1</b> is moving.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>1</b> moves at 60 km/h on the road; the vehicle A and vehicle B move on at 30 km/h and 50 km/h on the road, respectively, in a direction identical with the moving direction of the vehicle <b>1</b>; the vehicle C moves at 40 km/h on the road in a direction opposite to the moving direction of the vehicle <b>1</b>. By calculation of the velocity calculation unit <b>211</b>, the relative velocity of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle A is 30 km/h; the relative velocity of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle B is 10 km/h; the relative velocity of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle C is 100 km/h due to the opposite direction of movement; and the relative velocity of the vehicle with respect to the ground surface G is 60 km/h. Also, in the reflection points of the object in the detection area Z, the amount of the reflection points by the ground surface G is the most, so as to be considered as the modal value of the reflection points. When the modal values add up to reach a certain amount, the relative velocity corresponding to the modal value is outputted, and the information of this relative velocity is included in the third signal S<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A further detailed description is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, which illustrates the distribution of the relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> with respect to the ground surface G, the vehicle A, the vehicle B, and the vehicle C acquired by the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b> from the third signal S<b>3</b>. It is clear that the distribution of the reflection points of the relative velocity of 60 km/h covers the largest area, so as to be deemed as the modal value. When it reaches a certain amount, the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b> identifies the ground surface G as the static object, so that the relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> with respect to the ground surface G is determined as the velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> (60 km/h). Accordingly, based on the third signal S<b>3</b>, the objects in the detection area Z are identified as a static object or a moving object, whereby the relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> with respect to the static object is determined as the velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Notably, the wire <b>201</b> disposed in the wire recess <b>101</b> is applied for providing power from the vehicle and for the controller area network (CAN) <b>1</b><i>b </i>to provide the velocity signal of the vehicle <b>1</b> to the radar device <b>20</b>, thereby achieving the blind spot detection or anti-collision detection functions. If the radar device <b>20</b> itself comprises said functions and is capable of detecting the velocity of the vehicle, the wiring of the wire <b>201</b> can be relatively simple for the purpose of providing the power. In such case, space of the wire recess <b>101</b> can be reduced for preventing the structural strength of the pedal body <b>10</b> from being lowered.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a plurality of vehicle velocity are continuously sampled along the time window T during the movement of the vehicle, the movement average accumulation subunit <b>214</b> continuously carries out the movement average accumulation on the sampled vehicle velocity. The time window above is preferably between 0.05 to 0.3 seconds. In the embodiment, the time window T is set at 0.1 seconds, which means that the modal value calculation unit <b>23</b> calculates the modal value of the most amount of the relative velocity for confirming the static object at an interval of 0.1 seconds and determining the velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> as the sampled velocity. Therefore, when the vehicle <b>1</b> moves for a period of time, N sets of sample vehicles are continuously acquired along the time window T each 0.1 seconds (as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). The movement average accumulation subunit <b>213</b> continuously carries out the movement average accumulation on the acquired N sets of sampled velocity, so as to acquire a curve of an average velocity which varies with time in the duration of the vehicle <b>1</b> movement (as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The curve also represents the variation of the movement velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the embodiment, the movement average accumulation subunit <b>214</b> predetermines a velocity error. When the velocity difference of the sample velocity consecutively acquired in the time window T is greater than the velocity error, the later sampled velocity will not be included in the movement average accumulation. Preferably, the velocity error ranges from 1 km/h to 5 km/h. In the embodiment, the velocity error is 5 km/h. For example, the ground surface G is determined as the static object at a certain time window T, and the sampled velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> is acquired as 60 km/h, and multiple vehicles approach the rear of the vehicle <b>1</b> quickly, and then keep moving at the velocity of 60 km/h to occupy most of the detection area Z. Currently, the relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> with respect to the multiple vehicles behind is 0 km/h. With the determination of the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b>, the multiple approaching vehicles are misrecognized as the modal value and deemed as the static object. The sampled velocity at the moment is 0 km/h. In the time window T of 0.1 seconds, the velocity difference between two sampled velocity obviously surpasses the predetermined velocity error of 5 km/h, so that the sampled velocity of 0 km/h will be excluded from the movement average accumulation, thereby preventing the velocity determination error.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment, when a moving object in the detection area Z is identified as an approaching object, a warning signal S<b>4</b> is generated to trigger the warning motion of the warning indicator <b>1</b><i>a</i>, wherein warning motion varies along with the shortening of the time to collision of the approaching object and the vehicle <b>1</b>. In fact, the time to collision can be related to the operation period of the signal output (such as controlling PWM). Therefore, the warning signal S<b>4</b> can trigger the warning motion generated by the warning indicator <b>1</b><i>a </i>to strengthen. Taking the said warning light as the example of the warning indicator <b>1</b><i>a</i>, when the predicted time to collision of the approaching object with respect to the vehicle <b>1</b> becomes shorter, the lightness of the warning light becomes greater, the flashing frequency become faster, the comparison of light colors becomes stronger, or the colors of light become different (such as green/yellow/red) for identification of the urgency degree. Alternatively, taking the buzzer as the example, when the time to collision of the approaching object with respect to the vehicle <b>1</b> becomes shorter, the sound of the buzzer becomes louder.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The radar detection device <b>20</b> comprises a land change assistance (LCA) mode, which can increase the warning degree under a high collision risk coefficient according to the direction indicator signal of the CAN, the helm angle signal generated by the steering wheel and the aforementioned time to collision. For example, at the moment of the direction indicator signal being imputed, the warning indicator <b>1</b><i>a </i>outputs a red light or a high frequency flashing representing a risky situation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, the static object in the present invention includes not only the ground surface (road), but also objects such as road railings, trees, electric poles that cannot move. The moving object in the present invention includes not only the vehicles moving on the ground surface, but also objects such as motorcycles, pedestrians, or animals that can move. The approaching object in the present invention indicates the moving object which is relatively approaching the vehicle <b>1</b>. For example, when a vehicle (or motorcycle) enters the detection area Z from the rear of the vehicle <b>1</b> and approaches the vehicle <b>1</b>, the vehicle (or motorcycle) is deemed as the approaching object.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the embodiment, the central processing module <b>21</b> further comprises a movement determination switch unit <b>215</b>, which has a low distance resolution mode and a high distance resolution mode. The movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> can identifies the movement direction of the vehicle <b>1</b>. When the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> identifies that the vehicle <b>1</b> is moving forward, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> operates in the low distance resolution mode; when the vehicle <b>1</b> is identified as moving backward, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> operates in the high distance resolution mode.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Regarding the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b>, the distance resolution is the index of the ability of the radar system identifying two targets at a certain distance. In other words, it represents the smallest distance required for differentiating two targets. In the embodiment, the low distance resolution mode has a distance resolution ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters; the distance resolution mode has a distance resolution ranging from 5 to 30 centimeters. Also, in a possible embodiment, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> changes the signal bandwidth of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to switch the low distance resolution mode and the high distance resolution mode. For example, at an initial frequency of 77 GHz, when the signal bandwidth is 4 GHz, the distance resolution of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is about 3.75 cm; when the signal bandwidth is 2 GHz, the distance resolution of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is about 7.5 cm; when the signal bandwidth is 1 GHz, the distance resolution of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is about 15 cm; when the signal bandwidth is 600 MHz, the distance resolution of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is about 25 cm. Therefore, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> changes the signal bandwidth of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to switch the low distance resolution mode and the high distance resolution mode for adjusting the distance resolution.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> of the present invention identifies that the vehicle <b>1</b> is moving forward, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> switches the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to operate in the low distance resolution mode, so as to apply the blind spot detection (BSD) for detecting vehicles or other objects approaching from the read side of the vehicle <b>1</b>. When the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> identifies that the vehicle <b>1</b> is reversing, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> switches the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to operate in the high distance resolution mode, so as to serve as a reverse radar for detecting the obstacles in the rear of the vehicle during the reversing of the vehicle <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> of the present invention automatically detects the moving direction of the vehicle <b>1</b>, such that the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is automatically switched to operate in the low distance resolution mode or the high distance resolution mode. Thus, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> has different modal values for application in blind spot detection or providing a reverse radar detection function.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Based on the fact that the distance resolution of the low distance resolution mode ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters, and the distance resolution of the high distance resolution mode ranges from 5 to 30 centimeters, the detection of railing, electric pole, or small obstacle can be detected with a more precise resolution, thereby preventing error or abnormal detection issues. When the present invention is applied for blind spot detection, the obstacles to be detected are larger objects such as other vehicles. Therefore, instead of precise resolution, a larger detection range is needed, which requires a farther radar refection detection ability for providing a sufficient time for driver reaction. Thus, the present invention serves as both the blind spot detector and a reverse radar with the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> which is applicable in the low distance resolution mode and the high distance resolution mode, thereby fulfilling different demands in different moving statuses of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the half power beam width (HPBM) of the sending and receiving module <b>22</b> on the H-plane ranges from 130 to 180 degrees, and the half power beam width of the sending and receiving module <b>22</b> on the E-plane ranges from 35 to 90 degrees.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is noted that the blind spot detection and reversing radar detection shall have different reaction to the reflected vertical signal. For example, objects such as a metal manhole cover on the ground or a ditch cover will produce strong reflection signal. However, in blind spot detection and reversing radar detection, such objects will not cause any influence. As for higher level objects such as a flowerpot, stair, or animal like cat or dog, during blind spot detection, the reflection signals of those objects will be considered as objects passing near the vehicle which cause no effects on movement safety. However, during reversing radar detection, those reflection signals may influence the vehicle safety and shall therefore be considered. Therefore, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the central processing module <b>21</b> of the present invention further comprises a vertical signal determination unit <b>216</b>, which divides the second signal S<b>2</b> received by the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> in the vertical direction into a lower layer signal, a middle layer signal, and a higher layer signal. Therein, in the high distance resolution mode, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> ignores the lower layer signal. In the low distance resolution mode, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> ignores the lower layer signal and the middle layer signal. Furthermore, the lower layer signal is the reflection signal from 0 to 10 centimeters above the ground surface, the middle layer signal is the reflection signal from 10 to 30 centimeters above the ground surface, and the higher layer signal is the reflection signal from 30 centimeters above the ground surface.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in a possible embodiment, the central processing module <b>21</b> is electrically connected with the controller area network (CAN) <b>1</b><i>b </i>for acquiring the gear signal of the vehicle <b>1</b>, so as to detect the moving direction status of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another possible embodiment, the velocity calculation unit <b>211</b> calculates the relative velocity of the object in the detection area Z with respect to the vehicle <b>1</b>, so as to identify if the object is a static object or a moving object, and identify the moving direction and the velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> based on the relative moving direction and relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> and the static object, providing a determination basis for the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b>. Notably, the &#x201c;speed&#x201d; refers to the traveling route passed through by the object in a unit time, which does not include the direction thereof; the &#x201c;velocity&#x201d;, which is different from the &#x201c;speed&#x201d;, describes the physical quantity of the speed and direction of the object movement. In the embodiment, when the speed of the vehicle is higher than a threshold value, the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> directly determines that the vehicle <b>1</b> is in a status of moving forward, so as to control the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to be switched to the low distance resolution mode. For further explanation, the threshold value can be set as 40 kilometers. Since a driver seldom reverses the vehicle <b>1</b> at 40 km/hour, the possible moving status of the vehicle <b>1</b> can be determined accordingly by referring to status of the reflection signal and the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the objects in the detection area Z are mostly static objects such as the ground surface, divisional island or railings, and other moving objects (such as those approaching or leaving the vehicle <b>1</b>) just account for a small portion. Therefore, most of the reflection signals having the same velocity detected by the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> can be determined as static objects, and other second signals S<b>2</b> having different velocities are determined as moving objects. Accordingly, by cooperating the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b> and the velocity calculation unit <b>211</b>, the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b> determines the objects having the same velocity in the most amount in the detection area Z as static objects. Furthermore, when in a traffic jam or when the vehicle velocity is slower, other vehicles in the rear may be too close to the vehicle <b>1</b>, so that most of the second signals S<b>2</b> in the detection area Z of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> are reflected by the vehicle in the rear of the vehicle <b>1</b>, causing an error of determination. However, because the wheels in movement are revolving fast, so that the reflection signal produced by the wheels can be received by the radar for identification. Therefore, the second signals S<b>2</b> of a target vehicle having the wheels signal features or the second signals S<b>2</b> from above the wheels can be screened and excluded first, so as to ensure the correctness of the speed calculation result of the modal value calculation unit <b>213</b>. Thus, the central processing module <b>21</b> of the present invention further comprises an interference elimination unit <b>217</b>, which excludes the second signals S<b>2</b> of a vehicle having a wheel reflection feature. When the vehicle speed is lower than the threshold value, the interference elimination unit <b>217</b> preferentially detects and excludes the vehicle reflection signal, and the velocity calculation unit <b>211</b> subsequently identifies the moving direction of the vehicle, based on which the movement determination switch unit <b>215</b> carries out the determination process and controls the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> to be switched to the low distance resolution mode or the high distance resolution mode.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a possible embodiment, the present invention further comprises a path prediction module <b>23</b> electrically connected with the central processing module <b>21</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, because the detection angle of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is smaller than 180 degrees, at least a detection blind area Z<b>1</b> exists on the left and the right side of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b>. The path prediction module <b>23</b> acquires the velocity and direction information of the approaching object according to the reflection signal of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b>, wherein the positions of the aforementioned reflected sample points are accumulated to form an approximate line (as a solid line) for detecting the relative movement direction, speed and angle, thereby predicting the moving path P of the approaching object. When the path prediction module <b>23</b> calculates that the approaching object entering the detection blind area Z<b>1</b>, the warning can still be provided until the approaching object leaves the detection blind area Z<b>1</b>. Therefore, erroneous judgement of the driver due to the blind area of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> is effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the description above, the features of the present invention are clear.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The pedal <b>100</b> of the present invention comprises the installation space <b>17</b> for receiving the radar device <b>20</b>. The pedal body <b>10</b> applies the interlaced straight ribs <b>15</b> and arc ribs <b>16</b> and the reinforcement space <b>18</b> thereby formed having reinforcement structure therebetween in increase the structural strength of the pedal <b>100</b>. Therefore, the pedal <b>100</b> has better weight bearing capability, and provides protection to the radar device <b>20</b> in the installation space, thereby ensuring the effective operation of the radar device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the vehicle <b>1</b> is not towing objects, the pedal <b>100</b> is installed on the rear of the vehicle <b>1</b> for passenger to enter or leave the vehicle <b>1</b>. Besides, the radar device <b>20</b> in the pedal <b>100</b> provides the vehicle <b>1</b> with blind spot detection and reversing detection functions, so as to prevent collision accidents without the need of complicated wiring structure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The reinforcement pillar <b>19</b> and connection ribs <b>191</b> form a radiation structure similar to the shape of the sun. Also, each reinforcement pillar <b>19</b> and connection rib <b>191</b> extend toward the pedaling face <b>13</b> to be connected with the pedaling face <b>13</b> by one end. Therefore, the reinforcement pillar <b>19</b> is disposed in an approximate parallel arrangement with the direction imposing force of a person stepping on the pedal body <b>10</b>, so as to directly bear the pedaling force, thereby providing a greater weight bearing capability and protecting the radar device <b>20</b> in the installation space <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The installation space <b>17</b> has three sides corresponding to the reinforcement spaces <b>18</b>, so that the installation space <b>17</b> is surrounded by more reinforcement spaces <b>18</b>, thereby providing a higher structural protection to the radar device <b>20</b> disposed in the installation space <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The radar device <b>20</b> detects the relative velocity of the object in the detection area Z with respect to the vehicle <b>1</b> for identifying the static objects and moving objects, thereby identifying the relative velocity of the vehicle <b>1</b> with respect to the static object as the movement speed of the vehicle, so as to achieve the blind spot detection function according to the vehicle speed information. The pedal <b>100</b>, provided with speed detection function itself, does not need to acquire the vehicle speed signal of the vehicle <b>1</b>. Therefore, the pedal <b>100</b> does not need to be connected with the CAN of the central controlling system of the vehicle <b>1</b> to operate. The installation is simple, and the cost is reduced.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the present invention is applied for reversing detection in the high distance resolution mode, the detection of railing, electric pole, or small obstacle can be detected with a more precise resolution, thereby preventing error or abnormal detection issues. When the present invention is applied for blind spot detection, the obstacles to be detected are larger objects such as other vehicles. Therefore, instead of precise resolution, a larger detection range is needed, which requires a farther radar refection detection ability for providing a sufficient time for driver reaction. Thus, when serving as the blind spot detector or the reverse radar, the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b> can operate in the low distance resolution mode or the high distance resolution mode, thereby fulfilling different demands in different moving statuses of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The path prediction module <b>23</b> acquires the speed and direction information of the approaching object through the reflection signal by use of the signal sending and receiving module <b>22</b>, so as to predict the movement path of the approaching object. Therefore, even if the approaching object enters the detection blind area, the warning will still be generated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
