Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a laser processing head, particularly a laser processing head that emits two laser beams having different wavelengths, a laser processing system including the laser processing head, and a method of determining abnormality of the laser processing system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A laser processing system performs laser processing such as cutting, welding, and drilling of a workpiece. In the laser processing system, a laser processing head irradiates a workpiece with a laser beam emitted from a laser oscillator and guided through an optical fiber. The laser processing head is provided with a condensing optical system for condensing the laser beam and irradiating the workpiece with the laser beam.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During the laser processing, spatter or the like in which the workpiece is melted and scattered may adhere to an optical component provided in the laser processing head. When spatter adheres in this manner, the laser beam is scattered inside the laser processing head, and the workpiece cannot be irradiated with the laser beam with desired power, which may lead to a processing defect and deterioration in processing quality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to cope with such a problem, for example, PTL 1 discloses a laser processing system that generates an inspection laser beam having a lower output than a processing laser beam by a laser oscillator and irradiates a workpiece with the inspection laser beam via a laser processing head. Inside the laser processing head, a light receiver that receives return light reflected by the workpiece is provided. On the basis of intensity of the return light detected by the light receiver, a degree of contamination of a protective glass covering a light irradiation port of the laser processing head is determined, and a degree of power reduction of the processing laser beam with which the workpiece is irradiated is determined. When the degree of power reduction is small, an output of the processing laser beam is corrected to perform the laser processing, and when the degree of power reduction is large, the laser processing is interrupted.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">PTL 1: Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2016-097412</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, a hybrid laser processing system using two types of laser beams having different wavelengths, such as near-infrared light and blue light, for example, has been known. The hybrid laser processing system combines two types of laser beams having different wavelengths on an identical optical axis by a laser processing head, condenses the combined two types of laser beams, and irradiates the workpiece with the condensed laser beams. The hybrid laser processing system can utilize strengths of the laser beams and complement limitations of the laser beams, and thus has more advantages than a conventional laser processing system using only one type of laser beam.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a hybrid laser processing system, it is also required to determine an internal state of the laser processing head as in PTL 1. There has also been a demand for detecting reflected return light from a workpiece and determining a processing state of the workpiece on the basis of a result of the detection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional configuration disclosed in PTL 1, it is difficult to determine the processing state of the workpiece and the internal state of the laser processing head by separating reflected return light from the workpiece and vignetting light in an optical component inside the laser processing head. In particular, in the hybrid laser processing system, a plurality of optical components are disposed in an optical path of each laser beam, and it is more difficult to determine the state of these optical components.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure has been made in view of the above points, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a laser processing head that irradiates a workpiece with laser beams having different wavelengths and a laser processing system including the laser processing head, the laser processing head being capable of determining a processing state of the workpiece on the basis of reflected return light.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A laser processing head of the present disclosure includes a housing, and a plurality of optical components disposed in the housing, in which the housing includes a first light entrance port through which a first laser beam enters, a second light entrance port through which the second laser beam enters, a light irradiation port through which the first laser beam and the second laser beam are emitted to outside, and a partition wall that separates an optical path of the first laser beam entering through the first light entrance port from an optical path of the second laser beam entering through the second light entrance port, the second laser beam has a wavelength shorter than a wavelength of the first laser beam, the laser processing head includes a first photodetector provided around the optical path of the first laser beam entering through the first light entrance port, and a second photodetector provided around the optical path of the second laser beam entering through the second light entrance port, the first photodetector is disposed opposite to the second photodetector across the partition wall, the first photodetector receives light in a second wavelength band including the wavelength of the second laser beam, the second photodetector receives light in a first wavelength band including the wavelength of the first laser beam, and at least some of the plurality of optical components are disposed in the housing to make an optical axis of the first laser beam emitted from the light irradiation port and an optical axis of the second laser beam substantially coincide with each other by changing the optical path of at least one of the first laser beam or the second laser beam.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A laser processing system of the present disclosure includes the laser processing head, a first laser oscillator that emits the first laser beam, a second laser oscillator that emits the second laser beam, a first optical fiber that is connected to the first light entrance port and transmits the first laser beam emitted from the first

oscillator to the laser processing head, in which the laser processing head irradiates a workpiece with at least one of the first laser beam or the second laser beam.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method of determining abnormality of the present disclosure is a method of determining presence or absence of abnormality in the laser processing system, the method including, when the workpiece is irradiated with the second laser beam, determining whether there is abnormality in a processing state of the workpiece or a state of an optical component in the housing based on an output signal of the first photodetector, and when the workpiece is irradiated with the first laser beam, determining whether there is abnormality in the processing state of the workpiece or the state of the optical component in the housing based on an output signal of the second photodetector.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure allows determination of the processing state of the workpiece in the
