APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of and priority to DK Patent Application No. PA201970608 dated Sep. 30, 2019, and is a U.S. national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of co-pending International Application No. PCT/EP2020/076257 filed on Sep. 21, 2020, the contents of each are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an injection-molding tool configured for being mounted in an injection-molding apparatus for automated molding of work pieces in plastics. The injection-molding tool comprising at least two separate mold parts forming a set of mold cavities, and the separate mold parts include an inlet mold part having a mold inlet for injection of liquid plastics from the injection-molding apparatus, and a second mold part, and where the mold parts have abutting side faces facing a common mold separation plane, and where the abutting side faces form a set of runner channels extending between the mold inlet and the mold cavities, and where the runner channels comprise two flow channels being mutually joined at a junction at the downstream end of the two flow channels.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Advances in the art usually precede changes in fields and disciplines that are ancillary to the art. One example of this phenomenon is in the area of injection molding. US Published Patent Application 2004/0047943 discloses an injection-molding tool for a quick and efficient uniform heating of a compound prior to entering a mold cavity. Here, the spaced flow channels are arranged at intersecting angles to each other to create cross sectional flow, and thereby an increased mixing of the material flowing in the intersecting flow channels. This structure uniformly increases the temperature of the injected compound as the compound flows from the injection port to the various drop gates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need in the relevant art for a molding tool with cold runners, capable of quickly moving molten material to all mold cavities without increasing injection pressure and temperature.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure is directed to an injection-molding tool with cold runners, where the cold runner channels or injection runner channels allow to quickly convey molten material to all mold cavities, but without unnecessary increase of the injection pressure and the temperature of the molten material, or without unnecessarily long cooling times for cooling the material in the injection runner before demolding.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This is accomplished by the use of two flow channels that are linear and extend parallel to each other until a junction, and are completely or partly separated by a linear separating wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the molding tool, the molding tool further comprises a closing mold part, and wherein the second mold part is arranged between the inlet mold part and the closing mold part, and where the closing mold part and the second mold part has second abutting side faces facing a second common mold separation plane, and where the second abutting side faces forms the mold cavities.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The two flow channels may have a cross section that is circular, semi-circular, elliptical, semi-elliptical, polygonal, or any other cross section in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction in the flow channels allowing the molten material to be conveyed efficiently through the flow channels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously the two parallel flow channels, and optionally the separating wall, extends from the mold inlet and all the way to the runner branch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, it is advantageous if the separating wall is configured such that the two flow channels are open to each other at the side of the flow channels being closest to each other. Thereby the demolded distributor part is more stiff, and easier to demold.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be appreciated that the subject disclosure can be implemented and utilized in numerous ways, including without limitation as a process, an apparatus, a system, a device, and a method for applications now known and later developed. These and other unique features of the apparatus disclosed herein will become more readily apparent from the following description and the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">So that those having ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosed apparatus appertains will more readily understand how to make and use the same, reference may be had to the following drawings</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a distributor or runner channel in an injection mold in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of the cross section of the main runner channel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The subject technology overcomes many of the prior art problems associated with injection-molding tools.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The advantages, and other features of the apparatus disclosed herein, will become more readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description of certain preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings, which set forth representative embodiments of the present invention and wherein like reference numerals identify similar structural elements.
