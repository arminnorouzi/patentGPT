In particular, in the field of robots, if it becomes possible to dispose a large number of sensors at a tip portion of a robot hand at a high density, it also becomes possible to control the robot hand more precisely. It is therefore desirable to provide a force sensor module that is able to be disposed at a high density and with a high resolution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A force sensor module according to one embodiment of the present disclosure includes multiple force sensors disposed in series. The force sensors each include multiple sensor sections, a support substrate, and an organic member. The multiple sensor sections have respective force detection directions different from each other. The support substrate is separately provided for each of the force sensors and supports the multiple sensor sections. The organic member is provided in common to the force sensors. The organic member fixes the multiple force sensors in series and has a groove at a location corresponding to a gap between two support substrates adjacent to each other. The organic member is flexible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the force sensor module according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the multiple force sensors are disposed in series by the flexible organic member. Accordingly, for example, it is possible to dispose the multiple force sensors at a high density independently of a shape of an installation target. In addition, in the present disclosure, the groove is formed in the organic member at a location corresponding to the gap between two support substrates adjacent to each other. Accordingly, when a force is inputted to the organic member from an outside, the force from the outside is inputted to the force sensor corresponding to an input position, and propagation of the force from the outside to a force sensor at a position away from the input position is suppressed. That is, the organic member has both a function of supporting the multiple force sensors in series and a function of selectively inputting the force from the outside to the force sensor corresponding to the input position. Therefore, in the present disclosure, it is possible to achieve high-density disposing of the multiple force sensors and high-resolution detection by the multiple force sensors.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a plan configuration of a force sensor module according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a cross-sectional configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of the cross-sectional configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of the plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of the plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a plan configuration of a force sensor module according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a cross-sectional configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of the cross-sectional configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of the plan configuration of the force sensor module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some embodiments of the present disclosure are described below in detail with reference to the drawings.
