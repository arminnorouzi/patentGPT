num="0001">This application claims priority to United Kingdom patent application no. 1919026.3 filed Dec. 20, 2019.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to synthetic degradable biomedical adhesives which bond in wet and dry conditions, such as those encountered during medical procedures.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adhesives capable of bonding in wet environments are well suited for biomedical applications. However, most commercially available adhesives suffer major compromises in bond strength, curing time and/or biocompatibility, rendering them inappropriate for many clinical applications. Conventional adhesives generally require clean, dry surfaces for optimal performance which renders them ineffective for binding in wet environments. Furthermore, the vast majority of conventional adhesives are not biodegradable or resorbable and lack suitable mechanical properties to be used as tissue adhesives or sealants. This has greatly limited the application of surgical adhesives in biomedical applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dental adhesives such as glass ionomer cements (GICs), two-part epoxies and light-cured methacrylate resin systems are generally toxic, slow curing, and require an external light source, acid etching, multiple cure cycles and/other multi-step surface pretreatment techniques. Due to the toxicity and/or extensive preparation required for these materials, they have not been approved for use outside of oral applications where the lack of alternative wet adhesives have necessitated their use [1].</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adhesives which have been approved for clinical use include fibrin, cyanoacrylate, gelatin-resorcin formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde, and PEG-based glues. These adhesive systems all are limited by low bonding under wet conditions and/or poor cytocompatibility [2-9].</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PEG-based adhesives, which are extensively used, are relatively non-degradable and are associated with adverse swelling issues which can cause nerve and organ damage [8].</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Catechol-containing polymeric adhesives inspired by aquatic, marine mussels are of interest due to the natural ability of mussels to bind to a multitude of surfaces under heavily biofouled conditions. Mussel adhesion is reversible and capable of withstanding fluctuations in temperature and ionic strength [10-12]. The four main components of the mussel adhesive are: 1) acid mucopolysaccharides which act as primers; 2) adhesive proteins consisting mainly of polyphenolic proteins rich in the catechol 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and lysine; 3) fibrous proteins that act as an attachment thread between mussel and substrate; and 4) polyphenoloxidase to promote intermolecular cross-linking [13, 14].</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Branched PEG and grafted catechol-containing polymer derivatives have demonstrated adhesion to biological tissues, but the requirement for solvents and long curing durations renders them unsuitable for most clinical applications [15-18]. In general, these systems are composed of non-degradable polymers and require the use of solvents which may be toxic and impede curing and bonding of the adhesive. Solvent removal is further required for the adhesives to function optimally and is generally accomplished by evaporation or other means of removal. The lengthy duration of the solvent removal process (on average lasting up to multiple days) is an important consideration when designing biocompatible adhesives [6, 19].</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 8,673,286 discloses poly(alkylene oxide) adhesives using branched (10-20 kDa-PEG)<sub>4 </sub>backbones, functionalized with DOPA<sub>4</sub>, DOPA-Boc, DOPA<sub>3</sub>-Lys<sub>2</sub>, DOHA or DOPA with ester or urethane linkages. These adhesives must be solubilized in PBS and mixed in situ by hand in the presence of a water-solubilized oxidant (NaIO<sub>4</sub>) prior to use.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">PCT Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 2017/044896 discloses high molecular weight water soluble adhesives made of linear and branched structures made from PEG or PEGylated polyols, functionalized internally with DOPA using isocyanates. The disclosed formulations require the use of large amounts of filler material, such as dicalcium phosphate, to increase the mechanical properties of the adhesive. The adhesives further include long PEG segments which are non-biodegradable as well as hexamethyl diisocyanate which can produce toxic alkyl diamine biproducts when degraded.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 8,916,652 discloses branched structures made from PEG-based polyol oligomers. Structures described in the patent are functionalized internally with DOPA, DOPA-Lys, or DOHA using amide/urea linkages. Several disclosed formulations further contain ester or urethane linkages within the branches. All of these disclosed formulations, however, require the use of solvent for application; the adhesives are prepared for use by separately dissolving the polymer and NaIO<sub>4 </sub>as a crosslinking agent in PBS and mixing at a ratio of 1:1 before being spread onto the surface using a spray apparatus.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">US Pat. Appl. Publ. No. 2010/0137903 discloses substrates (e.g. films, meshes, etc.) which are treated with high molecular weight bioadhesives based on branched PEG oligomers for use in hernia repairs. Application of these adhesives onto substrates requires a curing procedure in which a first oxidant is added to the adherend substrate and then a weight is placed over the adhesive interface and held stationary for at least 1 hour. In some cases, a second application of oxidant is employed. A prolonged application period as described in this application is not practical or possible in most surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 8,754,285 B2 discloses the synthesis of thin films designed to adhere to a wide assortment of surfaces. The polymer adhesives consist of PCL, PEG and DOPA groups linked through ester and urethane linkages. Although these catechol-containing hydrogels have demonstrated pH-triggered curing and have potential for use as surgical adhesives [20], their complex preparation (constant stirring and careful pH control) limits their practical clinical applications. Furthermore the adhesives disclosed in the patent use toxic solvents, which are of significant concern for in vivo translation. Furthermore, the complexity of this application process is significant, and much more difficult than the current standard of care.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">All of the above adhesives suffer from similar disadvantages selected from complex, application strategies involving solvents. Organic solvents are required for application, and spreading and surface penetration strategies may be required. These limitations highlight the need for alternate adhesives which perform in wet conditions; have low toxic reactivity with cells, are easy to process and apply and are biodegradable; and yet have sufficient mechanical properties for given needs. Additionally, for successful clinical entry, the adhesives must be easy and straightforward to use within the confines of a clinical setting and minimally affecting workflow. Multi-step application processes with significant curing times represent a significant burden to clinical workflows and will not be tolerated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure provides:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first embodiment, a water insoluble adhesive comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">a compound of structure 1</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="42.84mm" wi="121.33mm" file="US20230001046A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Structure I<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">wherein</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">the compound has a Tg lower than 25&#xb0; C.;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">the compound is water insoluble;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0022">B is a branched or unbranched oligomer derived from a polyester, polyether,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0023">polyalkylene glycol, polysilicone or polycarbonate with a MW&#x3c;10,000 g/mol;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0024">Linker L is an urethane, urea bond, or amide bond;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0025">Linker L&#x2032; is an urethane or urea bond;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0026">A is a chain extender of Mw 3000 g/mol comprising substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl and/or aromatic groups;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0027">W is a terminal adhesive selected from an adhesive benzene-1,2-diol derivative or an adhesive benzene-1,2,3-triol derivative;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0028">m is 0 or 1; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0029">n is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0030">a cross-linked polymer produced by cross-linking compounds of structure 1.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0013" num="0031">2.

id="p-0069" num="0134">Wet conditions encompass environments which include, but are not limited to, water, water with proteins and/or salts and/or blood and/or other biological macromolecules.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0135">Physiological conditions refer to wet conditions at pH 7.4&#xb1;0.3 and temperature of 37.5&#xb1;3&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0136">Water insoluble is defined as the ability of a material to resist dissolution and/or the formation of a heterogenous mixture when a solvent-free material is mixed with water in concentrations greater than 0.5 wt/wt % at physiological temperatures (37.5&#xb1;3&#xb0; C.). Visible particles of the materials will remain separate and heterogeneous as a solid or gel when the material is hand mixed in water at a concentration of 0.5 wt/wt % at physiological temperatures (37.5&#xb1;3&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0137">Crosslinking is defined as the formation of a chemical bond, inclusive of covalent bonding and chelation, between two existing macromolecules (for example: adhesive-adhesive crosslinking, adhesive-protein crosslinking).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0138">Curing is defined as the chemical process of converting a macromolecule into a higher molecular weight polymer via crosslinking reactions.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0139">Setting is defined as an irreversible change in the state of a material, from flowable to rigidified, which occurs during curing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0140">Implant is defined as any material that is designed to function in contact with the human body.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0141">Tm (Melting temperature) is defined as the temperature (or temperature range) at which a well defined first order transition occurs, as determined by an endothermic event in a differential scanning calorimetry thermogram. If there is no such transition, as is common for amorphous materials, Tm will be defined by the beginning of the substance's ability to flow or spread under an applied force (i.e., temperature within the linear viscoelastic region on a stress-sweep viscoelastic curve at which the viscous modulus&#x3e;elastic modulus (tan &#x3b4;&#x3e;1)).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0142">Tg (Glass transition temperature) is defined as the temperature (temperature range) where the polymer transitions from a hard, glassy material to a soft, rubbery material as determined by changes in the heat capacity (Cp), reversible heat flow curves, and material rigidity or hardness obtained from differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical assessment and needle penetrometer or indentation experiments, respectively.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0143">In the present disclosure, soft tissue refers to connective and/or fatty and/or fibrous soft tissues and/or any organ tissue consisting primarily of low calcified content relative to biomolecule content (e.g. collagens, glycosamino glycans, elastin, etc.). Soft tissues connect, surround, or support bones, organs and other structures in the body. In one embodiment, soft tissues refer in particular to sub-epidermal fatty and/or fibrous tissues. Examples of soft tissues include tendons, muscles, skin, ligaments, nerves, vessels, fascia, fibrous tissues and synovial membranes. In another embodiment soft tissues make up the protein base structures of vital organs such as the heart, blood vessels, intestines, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0144">In the present disclosure, hard tissues are mineralized and rigid tissues containing significant amounts of hydroxyapatite. Examples of hard tissues include bone, enamel, dentin and cementum.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0145">The present disclosure provides an adhesive that may be used to glue or secure hard tissue to hard tissue, hard tissue to implant, hard tissue to soft tissue, soft tissue to soft tissue, soft tissue to implant or implant to implant.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0146">The use of structures described in the present disclosure may eliminate or reduce the need to use staples, sutures, tacks, screws or the like to secure or repair damaged tissues or to secure implants or devices within the body.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0147">Many previously described adhesives are comprised of polymeric chains that are decorated with periodic or randomly distributed branching side chains containing adhesive functional groups. This contributes to high intermolecular bonding (requiring solvents to assist with application and surface wetting) and poor accessibility of adhesive functional groups to the substrates where adhesion is desired.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0148">Adhesives described in the present disclosure when compared to known bioadhesives may be characterized by a rapid high degree of surface wetting/adhesion in a biological environment, easy adherence and retention of the water insoluble adhesive to substrates, and/or elimination of solvent requirement. Such biological environment may reflect the constraints of biological elements (protein, aqueous fluids, temperature, fatty tissue, bony tissue, cells, etc.).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0149">The present disclosure describes water insoluble adhesive compounds consisting of short linear or short branched oligomer chains capped only at their terminal ends with phenyl moieties with two or three hydroxyl groups acting as adhesive moieties as well as cross-linked polymers prepared from these compounds. The oligomer chains may have a MW between 50 and 10,000 g/mol, in other embodiments, between 50 g/mol, 100 g/mol, 500 g/mol or 1000 g/mol and 5,000 g/mol, in other embodiments between 50 g/mol, 100 g/mol, 500 g/mol or 1000 g/mol and 3,000 g/mol. The water insoluble adhesive may be prepared in such way that it will degrade over a period of time when exposed to biological conditions. Alternatively, the water insoluble adhesive may be non-degradable when exposed to biological conditions.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0150">The present disclosure provides water insoluble adhesives which are biocompatible and non-toxic; wherein biocompatible refers to a material which does not induce an observable biological response (e.g. immunological) upon contact with cellular, tissue or other bodily fluids/components [21], and non-toxic refers to a material which does not have an observable negative effect on cell viability. Furthermore, when the compounds of the water insoluble adhesive are tailored to be degradable, the degradation products are biocompatible and non-toxic.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0151">Having adhesive moieties at the terminal ends, while not bound by theory, the compounds of the present disclosure allow the adhesive moieties to preferentially orient to the substrate surface with minimal steric hindrance, and therefore rapid adhesion. Terminal functionalization of adhesive moieties onto the oligomeric backbone may also allow structural control, as many internally functionalized block or grafted polymers have adhesive moieties randomly oriented off of the backbone. Terminal grafting may also reduce the viscosity of the adhesives, as their bulk disrupts packing, reducing intermolecular forces.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0152">Suitably, the oligomers have a MW&#x3c;10,000 g/mol, preferably less than &#x3c;5,000 g/mol or &#x3c;3,000 g/mol. The use of oligomers with a a Mw&#x3c;5,000 g/mol, and especially a Mw&#x3c;3000 g/mol greatly reduces intermolecular interactions associated with them due to smaller size and reduced cumulative forces between oligomers. The reduction in intermolecular interactions between the oligomers of the compound of structure 1 may allow the adhesive of the present disclosure to be prepared without the use of a solvent resulting in faster setting/curing, low/no toxicity and improved usability of the adhesive, as solvent has been reported to interfere with adhesive bonding and presents its own toxicity concerns [22-25]. In some embodiments, the oligomer suitable has a molecular weight &#x3e;50 g/mol, &#x3e;100 g/mol, &#x3e;300 g/mol or greater than 500 g/mol.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0153">It is well accepted that adhesives formulated for use in biomedical applications ideally may have some or many of the following characteristics [26-31]:<ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0024" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0024-0001" num="0154">bond rapidly or on demand when in contact with a surface</li>        <li id="ul0024-0002" num="0155">cure in a controllable manner</li>        <li id="ul0024-0003" num="0156">work over a suitable range of temperatures</li>        <li id="ul0024-0004" num="0157">adhere to materials without the necessity of pre-treatment or cleaning</li>        <li id="ul0024-0005" num="0158">exhibit adhesion strength which is maintained over the duration of the desired application</li>        <li id="ul0024-0006" num="0159">have strong bonding and curing strength</li>        <li id="ul0024-0007" num="0160">are biodegradable</li>        <li id="ul0024-0008" num="0161">obviate the need for a solvent</li>        <li id="ul0024-0009" num="0162">have no smell</li>        <li id="ul0024-0010" num="0163">achieve desirable aesthetic properties</li>        <li id="ul0024-0011" num="0164">are easy to work with and easy to apply</li>        <li id="ul0024-0012" num="0165">easy to incorporate a catalyst to achieve curing, or cures without catalyst are easy and inexpensive to manufacture</li>        <li id="ul0024-0013" num="0166">work well in wet, dry and situations where contaminants may be present.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0089" num="0167">Depending on the structure, the Mw, and the formulation of the compounds of present disclosure, the adhesives described in the present disclosure may have at least one of the criteria listed above.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Water Insoluble Adhesives</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0168">According to an embodiment, an adhesive is described.

In order to achieve a desirable mechanical property and desired setting speed, in some embodiments, the water insoluble adhesive may benefit from the inclusion of crosslinking agents or curing agents.

In another embodiment, the setting speed is &#x2264;1 minute. In another embodiment, the setting speed is &#x2264;30 seconds. In another embodiment, the setting speed is &#x2264;10 seconds. The use of such agents may improve the rigidity and cohesive strength of the adhesives while reducing creep and deformation. 4-alkylbenzene-1,2-diol derivative or a 5-alkylbenzene-1,2,3-triol derivative may be chelated with the use of suitable complexing agents (e.g. Fe(III) salts), and/or irreversibly crosslinked via the use of oxidants, light, basic pH, and enzymes. In some embodiments, the compounds of Structure 1 may have a lower Tg or melting point than the operational temperature. Under such conditions, a curing agent or crosslinking agent is useful to rigidify the adhesives, providing increased cohesive strength. When a crosslinking agent such as an oxidant or a chelating agent is included within the water insoluble adhesive, it may promote covalent crosslinking of the catechol groups with other catechols and/or tissue.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0191">According to an embodiment, the adhesive of the present disclosure may further comprise a biological agent, pharmaceutical agent or diagnostic agent covalently bound or complexed to the compound or entrapped within the adhesive.

According to another embodiment, the water insoluble adhesives of the present disclosure may be solvent free.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0193">The solvent-optional or solvent-free nature of the water insoluble adhesive of the present disclosure is advantageous as numerous solvents are known to be toxic and may impede with the bonding of the adhesive to the substrate and may even interfere with the crosslinking and curing process if crosslinking agents or curing agents are used. For example, it is known that adhesives dissolved in solvents typically have reduced cohesive and adhesive properties and rely on diffusion or evaporation of the solvent for improved mechanical performance. Depending on the environment and the nature of the solvent, this diffusion or evaporation of the solvent may be on the order of minutes, hours, days or even longer periods of time. Solvents have been known to cause toxicity or other undesirable effects including intoxication and strong odors [31-32]. Furthermore, using a water insoluble adhesive that does not require a solvent is advantageous for biomedical applications as it alleviates the need for the solvent to evaporate, diffuse or be removed by another mechanism, which are frequent requirements when an adhesive system includes a solvent.

None of the adhesives displayed sharp or well-defined melting points; instead they all possessed well defined and narrow glass transition temperatures. These indicated the absence of crystalline domains and the inherent nature of their amorphous state, respectively. Higher glass transition temperatures are typical of glassy materials, whilst materials with lower glass transition temperatures remain amorphous for longer/until lower temperatures.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0279">Variations in the glass transition temperatures of the non-crosslinked adhesives (Table 3a) were observed related to the inherent glass transition temperatures of the oligomeric backbone chemistry and were also related to oligomer length and catechol functionalization degree.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0280">Adhesive mixtures which were physically blended (i.e., not chemically crosslinked; Table 3a) generally displayed only a single glass transition temperature between the range of the two mixtures, indicating complete solubilization of the adhesives with each other upon mixing. Typically, the resulting glass transition temperature was more heavily weighted towards the major weight constituent of the mixture, as can be seen from the changes in the mixing ratio between Adhesive 5a and Adhesive 2b in Table 3a.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0281">Table 3b, on the other hand, shows that upon heating the adhesives in the presence of the crosslinking agents, the glass transitions shifted to notably higher temperatures, indicative of the successful rigidification of the low molecular weight&#x2014;insoluble adhesives described herein. Importantly, Table 3b shows that similar degrees of rigidification could be obtained with the use of facile non-toxic crosslinking agents such as iron (III) phosphate, which is widely used in nutritional supplements for humans, as compared to more toxic crosslinkers such as the periodate (TBAP) or caustic iron (III) chloride.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0282">However, while Table 3b shows a relative insensitivity of the adhesives to the nature of the crosslinking agent, it does reveal that the different adhesives do not respond to crosslinking-mediated rigidification in the same manner. For example, upon crosslinking, Adhesive 2a undergoes a change in Tg of &#x2212;50&#xb0; C., whilst Adhesive 2b and Adhesive 5 undergo a substantially smaller increase in Tg of &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. each. Consideration of the catechol group densities of the different adhesives does not readily explain this difference in the rigidification of the adhesives; both Adhesives 2a and 5 possess similar catechol group densities per unit mass of adhesive (2 mmol/g) whilst the catechol density of Adhesive 2b is 1.5 mmol/g. On the other hand, the steric complexities of the adhesives&#x2014;which affect and eventually limit the interactions of the adhesive moieties with the crosslinkers&#x2014;do increase with their molecular masses, indicating that the lower molecular weight systems are more amenable to rigidification upon crosslinking compared to larger molecular weight systems (MW of adhesives 2a, 2b and 5 are 1401, 2018 and 3019, respectively). Thus, with careful tuning based on informed structure-property correlations, it is possible to identify and select specific adhesive-only and/or adhesive-adhesive combinations that, when crosslinked, would present a range of tunable material properties such as the desired degree of rigidity, setting rate, and/or different degrees of hardness and/or flexibility.</p><heading id="h-0053" level="1">Example 11: Testing Adhesion on Different Interfaces</heading><p id="p-0203" num="0283">This section presents evidence that the adhesives are functional with a variety of adherends, and, therefore, their utility for a wide range of medical device applications.</p><heading id="h-0054" level="1">Example 11 a: Skin/Glass</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0284">Porcine skin was fixed to a dry glass microscopy slide using Adhesive 2a adhesive. 100 mg of adhesive was spread evenly on a warmed glass slide and a strip (3.0 cm&#xd7;10.0 cm&#xd7;1.0 cm) of porcine skin freshly obtained from a local butcher was pressed by hand force onto the slide with the skin side in contact with the adhesive coated side of the glass slide for approximately 5 seconds.

Here we define adhesion strength in shear, in either compression or tension depending on the sample type. Adhesion strength values were obtained from the maximum stress (converted to Pa from the applied force and cross-sectional area in contact between the two substrates tested). Adhesion was tested using a variety of temperatures, substrates, and formulations with and without induced crosslinking.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0290">In general, adhesives with higher crosslinking density, higher melting temperatures and/or higher Tg values were less elastic, with little or no plastic deformation and a catastrophic failure mechanism. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, this is typical of materials with reduced elasticity and reflective of elevated crosslinking and/or being tested in a rigid or glassy state where there is limited plastic deformation of the adhesive oligomers, thus limiting rearrangement and elastic deformation or strain hardening. The less rigid adhesives generally failed by a ductile failure mode following a degree of plastic deformation.</p><heading id="h-0060" level="1">Example 12a: The Effect of Crosslinkers and Substrates</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0291">To determine the effect of different crosslinkers on adhesion strength, several oxidants and complexing agents were mixed into adhesives at different weight ratios and applied to samples and allowed to cure.

On the other hand, Adhesive 2b presented no apparent improvements in its cohesive strength with the use of oxidants or complexing agents (Table 4a). This difference in performance upon crosslinking between the adhesives can be directly linked to their crosslinked glass transition temperatures; recall from Table 3b that upon crosslinking, the Tg of Adhesive 2a moves to above room temperature, whilst that of Adhesive 2b is still well below room temperature. This means that under the adhesion strength test condition, the crosslinked Adhesive 2a is tested in its glassy state, while crosslinked Adhesive 2b is still flowable and thus easily sheared at room temperature. This result teaches that improving adhesion strength/crosslink density with the use of crosslinking agents is strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification that occurs during the curing process and, therefore, on the molecular weights of the adhesive, as was previously discussed in Example 10.</p><heading id="h-0061" level="1">Example 12b: The Effect of Temperature on Adhesive Strength</heading><p id="p-0217" num="0295">Adhesives were tested at temperatures above and below their glass transition temperatures in order to determine the influence of temperature on their performance.

Since no oxidants were used in these experiments to induce crosslinking, the results presented reflect the natural cohesive strengths of the reported dry adhesive formulations. As is typical of all thermoplastic/hotmelt adhesives, the adhesives, without crosslinking, were vulnerable to the temperature at which they were tested, typically presenting higher adhesion strengths at temperatures well below their glass transitions.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0297">In formulations with glass transitions far below 37&#xb0; C., the adhesive strengths are considerably reduced at room temperature or physiological temperatures, and the adhesives fail cohesively. For example, Adhesive 2a and Adhesive 2b exhibit poor cohesion at simulated physiological temperatures, undergoing flow and creep behaviour when minimal forces are applied. However, when doped with an adhesive with a Tg closer to 37&#xb0; C. (e.g. Adhesive 5), the glass transitions are shifted towards higher temperatures, allowing these materials to be functional at physiological temperatures, thereby increasing their utility.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0298">Compared to all of the pure adhesives, Adhesive 5 has a uniquely high glass transition temperature which accounts for its high cohesive strengths well above its Tg (at 37&#xb0; C.) without the necessity for a crosslinking agent. This feature is unique among the many formulations found in the patent literature which require co-oxidants to achieve practical cohesive strength within a finite period under wet conditions. This novel finding capitalizes on uniquely defined thermal transitions that the material undergoes. The polymer is naturally adhesive, even at room temperature.</p><heading id="h-0062" level="1">Example 12c: Testing Adhesion Under Wet Conditions</heading><p id="p-0222" num="0299">Compared to the starting oligomers, the adhesives possess increased hydrophilicity on account of the urethane and urea linkages present in the adhesives, in addition to the already existing ester group linkages of the starting oligomers. While these are desirable for biodegradability, these same properties also can make the adhesives susceptible to failure due to water ingress during use.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0300">Possible strategies to reduce water ingress include increasing the hydrophobic domains within the adhesive system by blending with more hydrophobic adhesives and/or additives such as high molecular weight (HMW) PCL, and/or increasing the crosslinking within the adhesive network so as to decrease the swelling potential of the adhesive itself whilst maintaining or improving the cohesive integrity of the system.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0301">To assess the performance of the adhesives for use under surgical conditions, the adhesive strengths of various physically linked and chemically crosslinked adhesive samples were investigated.

In particular, water ingress and/or solubility is the downfall of many adhesives, especially when they are not fully dry from solvents. The suitability of these adhesives for use in surgical applications was assessed using adhesive tests on samples which were wet or submerged for 24 h. However, submerged samples do not reflect the in vivo environment, but more show the resistance to water ingress. In fact, maintaining strength in vivo may actually prove easier, as there is far less diffusion and available water at the implant.</p><heading id="h-0064" level="1">Example 13a: Water Ingress</heading><p id="p-0233" num="0308">Compared to the starting oligomers, the adhesives possess increased hydrophilic domains on account of the urethane and urea linkages present in the adhesives, in addition to the already existing ester group linkages of the starting oligomers. While these are desirable for biodegradability, these same properties also can make the adhesives susceptible to failure due to water ingress during use. To reduce water ingress, high molecular weight (HMW) PCL and sodium carbonate (a cross-linking agent) were combined with the adhesives. HMW PCL increases the hydrophobicity of the adhesive due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the PCL itself. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, sodium carbonate may act as both a second phase strengthener and a cross-linker. It will dissolve in the presence of water to increase the local pH surrounding the adhesive, possibly stimulating oxidation of the dopamine residues, thus resulting in crosslinking. This crosslinking could further reduce water ingress and support adhesion. Both additives may not be necessary to prevent ingress, especially because of the low surface area exposed to physiological fluid in vivo; however, both are shown here as proof of principle.</p><heading id="h-0065" level="2">Wet Bone Substrate Preparation</heading><p id="p-0234" num="0309">Process of preparing adhesives for the device:</p><p id="p-0235" num="0310">Prior to testing, the adhesives were processed to incorporate different mixtures of specific adhesives or additives. Additives can be oxidants, polymers or second phase strengtheners. Here we combined Adhesive 2a with PCL (&#x2dc;90 kDa) and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>at a 35:60:5 ratio, respectively, for protection against water ingress. HMW PCL increases hydrophobicity and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>provides second-phase strengthening and the possibility for pH induced crosslinking in the event of water ingress. The adhesive mixtures were homogenized by cryo-milling on a Retsch CryoMill (Retsch, Del.) equipped with a 50 mL steel milling jar with 4 steel ball bearings. Samples were cooled to &#x2212;196&#xb0; C. using one 10 min precooling cycle prior to 8&#xd7;5-minute cryomilling cycles at 30 Hz. Adhesive mixtures were allowed to return to room temperature before being removed from the steel milling jar.

The mold was placed on the platen between PTFE liners. Platens were heated to 190&#xb0; C., and the pellets were heated until translucent. A top sheet was applied to the melt and &#x2dc;2 metric tonnes of pressure was applied, pressing the melted polymer pellets into the mold. Locking vice grips were then attached to the plates on three sides to maintain pressure when removing from the press. Full pressure was held for &#x2dc;30 s before slowly being released. The template was plunged into a sink filed with cold water to quench the polymer films from the melt. When the plates were cold, the vice grips were removed, and the PCL sheet was carefully removed from the mold. Sheets were trimmed to the mold dimensions with scissors, and further cut into 1.0&#xd7;4.0 cm strips. An area of 1.5&#xd7;1.0 cm was marked on each strip for consistent adhesive application. Marked regions on the strips were crimped using vice-grips to increase flexibility and provide a texture. PCL strips were plasma treated for 2 min under a partial oxygen atmosphere using a plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, USA) with an attached oxygen tank.</p><heading id="h-0067" level="2">Preparation of Device:</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0313">To prepare samples, the adhesive formulation was warmed to room temperature before exposing to atmosphere (preventing condensation). The adhesive formulation was warmed using a forced air, electric heat gun to allow for spreading onto the bone using a spatula. The PCL strip was pressed by hand onto the adhesive for &#x2dc;10 s to form the adhesive backing. Wet bones were incubated for 5 minutes in PBS and blotted dry before applying the adhesive.

Bone samples were prepared in the same manner. The adhesive was applied to the wet bone surface and the PCL film was applied to the adhesive. However, due to slow curing of the commercial adhesive, the film was held for up to 5 minutes before moving to incubator. In one case, lab tape was wrapped around the bone to hold the PCL in place while the adhesive cured for 5 minutes. Delamination (due to incomplete curing) was observed on the edge of most samples and additional cyanoacrylate was added to the edges to accommodate.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0315">Samples were loaded mechanically, immediately after removing from the 37&#xb0; C. environment.
