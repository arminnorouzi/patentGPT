Further, as the integral type blood pressure measurement device, a wearable device to be mounted on a wrist is also considered (for example, see Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application No.: JP 2019-118418 A).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are tendons, bones and muscles in a wrist. Due to the shape of a living body such as the tendons, bones, and muscles, unevenness occurs in a region where an artery of the wrist is present. Since the shape of the tendons, bones, and muscles vary depending on the user, the uneven shape of the region of the wrist with which a sensing cuff is brought into contact varies depending on the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a state where blood pressure is measured, air in a sensing cuff is required to be evenly present in the sensing cuff</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-described blood pressure measurement device is required to improve the measurement accuracy of blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a cuff structure capable of improving the accuracy of blood pressure detection, and the blood pressure measurement device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect, a cuff structure is provided that includes a sensing cuff configured in a shape that is long in one direction, the sensing cuff configured to come into contact with a region of a wrist where an artery is present, a pressing cuff configured in a shape that is long in one direction and, the pressing cuff provided on a side of the sensing cuff opposite from the wrist side surface, the pressing cuff configured to press the sensing cuff against the wrist by being inflated, and a wall portion provided along at least one edge portion along a longitudinal direction of the sensing cuff, the wall portion having a leading end surface configured to come into contact with the wrist.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sensing cuff and the pressing cuff are inflated by being fed with the fluid, and include a bag-like structure such as an air bag.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this aspect, the blood pressure measurement device is mounted on the wrist and the pressing cuff is inflated so that a wall portion presses the wrist. Since the wall portion presses the wrist, the unevenness of the region of the wrist where the artery is present can be reduced. Here, the unevenness of the wrist means unevenness caused by a portion of a living body such as a tendon, a muscle, and a bone of the wrist. By reducing the unevenness of the wrist, the sensing cuff to which air is supplied can be adhered to the region of the wrist where the artery is present by the pressure of the sensing cuff to the wrist caused by the inflation of the pressing cuff</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, since the unevenness of the wrist is reduced, even when the sensing cuff to which air is supplied is pressed against the wrist by the inflated pressing cuff, it is possible to prevent the sensing cuff from being collapsed. Here, the collapse means that the wrist side and the pressing cuff side of the inner surface of the sensing cuff come into contact with each other. By preventing the collapse of the sensing cuff, the fluid can be uniformly present in the sensing cuff.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, since the wall portion presses the wrist, the wrist follows the end surface of the wall portion. As a result, the sensing cuff can be suitably adhered to the wrist.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this manner, the sensing cuff can be suitably adhered to the region of the wrist where the artery is present, and the fluid can be uniformly present in the sensing cuff, and thus the accuracy of the blood pressure measurement can be improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, since the wall portion is configured to face the tendon that is present between the radial artery and the ulnar artery of the wrist in a state where the blood pressure measurement device is mounted on the wrist, the tendon can be pushed by the wall portion. By pushing the tendon by the wall portion, the sensing cuff can be adhered to the wrist in a wide range including the radial artery and the ulnar artery.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, when a pair of wall portions is provided along each of edge portions along the longitudinal direction of the sensing cuff, the pair of wall portions presses the wrist. Since the wrist is pressed by the pair of wall portions, a portion of the wrist between the pair of wall portions follows an end surface of the wall portions. Thus, the region of the wrist that follows the end surface of the wall portions can be increased, so that the sensing cuff can be more suitably adhered to the wrist.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the cuff structure of the aspect described above, a cuff structure is provided that includes a back plate provided between the pressing cuff and the sensing cuff, wherein the wall portion is provided on the back plate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this aspect, the wall portion is supported by the back plate, and thus the wall portion can be stably pressed against the wrist.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, a number of parts of the cuff structure can be prevented from increasing. Therefore, the efficiency of the assembling work of the blood pressure measurement device can be improved.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the cuff structure of the aspect described above, a cuff structure is provided wherein a plurality of grooves orthogonal to the longitudinal direction are formed on the leading end surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect, the wall portion is easily deformed along the circumferential direction of the wrist. As a result, it is possible to prevent the work of mounting the blood pressure measurement device on the wrist from being difficult.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the cuff structure of the aspect described above, a cuff structure is provided wherein the wall portion has a height such that the wall portion protrudes beyond the sensing cuff and the sensing cuff is adhered to the wrist in a state where the sensing cuff is inflated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect, when the pressing cuff is inflated by supplying air to the sensing cuff after the blood pressure measurement device is mounted on the wrist, the sensing cuff comes into contact with the wrist after the wall portion pushes the region of the wrist where the artery is present. As a result, it is possible to suitably adhere the sensing cuff to the region of the wrist where the artery is present.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an aspect, a blood pressure measurement device is provided that includes a device main body, a curler provided on the device main body, and a cuff structure provided on the curler, the cuff structure including a sensing cuff configured in a shape that is long in one direction, the sensing cuff configured to come into contact with a region of a wrist where an artery is present, a pressing cuff configured in a shape that is long in one direction, the pressing cuff provided on a side of the sensing cuff opposite from the wrist side surface, the pressing cuff configured to press the sensing cuff against the wrist by being inflated, and a wall portion provided along at least one edge portion along a longitudinal direction of the sensing cuff, the wall portion having a leading end surface configured to come into contact with the wrist.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect, the blood pressure measurement device is mounted on the wrist and the pressing cuff is inflated so that a wall portion presses the wrist.

Here, the collapse means that the wrist side and the pressing cuff side of the inner surface of the sensing cuff come into contact with each other. By preventing the collapse of the sensing cuff, the fluid can be uniformly present in the sensing cuff.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, since the wall portion presses the wrist, the wrist follows the end surface of the wall portion. As a result, the sensing cuff can be suitably adhered to the wrist.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this manner, the sensing cuff can be suitably adhered to the region of the wrist where the artery is present, and the fluid can be uniformly present in the sensing cuff, and thus the accuracy of the blood pressure measurement can be improved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, since the wall portion is configured to face the tendon that is present between the radial artery and the ulnar artery of the wrist in a state where the blood pressure measurement device is mounted on the wrist, the tendon can be pushed by the wall portion.

Here, the unevenness of the wrist <b>200</b> is unevenness caused by a living body such as the tendon <b>220</b>, a bone, and a muscle of the wrist <b>200</b>. Since the unevenness in the region of the wrist <b>200</b> where the artery is present is reduced, the sensing cuff <b>73</b> is suitably adhered to the wrist.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Furthermore, since the unevenness in the region of the wrist <b>200</b> where the artery <b>210</b> is present is reduced, it is possible to prevent the sensing cuff <b>73</b> from being collapsed even when air is supplied and the sensing cuff <b>73</b> is pressed against the wrist <b>200</b> by the inflated pressing cuff <b>71</b>. Here, the collapse means that the wrist <b>200</b> side and the back plate <b>72</b> side of the inner surface of the sensing cuff <b>73</b> come into contact with each other. As a result, it is possible to uniformly inflate the sensing cuff <b>73</b>. Since the sensing cuff <b>73</b> can be inflated uniformly, the pressure inside the sensing cuff <b>73</b> can be made uniform. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the pressure acting on the region of the wrist <b>200</b> to which the sensing cuff <b>73</b> is adhered can be substantially constant.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Furthermore, since the pair of wall portions <b>76</b> presses the region of the wrist <b>200</b> where the artery is present, the wrist <b>200</b> follows the leading end surface <b>76</b><i>a </i>of the wall portion <b>76</b>.

Since the wrist <b>200</b> is pressed by the pair of wall portions <b>76</b>, a portion of the wrist <b>200</b> between the pair of wall portions <b>76</b> follows the leading end surface <b>76</b><i>a. </i>Therefore, since the region of the wrist <b>200</b> that follows the leading end surface <b>76</b><i>a </i>of the wall portion <b>76</b> can be increased, the sensing cuff <b>73</b> can be more suitably adhered to the region of the wrist <b>200</b> where the artery <b>210</b> is present.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Furthermore, the pair of wall portions <b>76</b> is provided on the back plate <b>72</b>, and thus the pair of wall portions <b>76</b> is supported by the back plate <b>72</b>.

Therefore, the efficiency of the work of fixing the back plate <b>72</b> to the curler <b>5</b> can be improved. Further, when the curvature of the curler <b>5</b> and the curvature of the wrist <b>200</b> are different from each other, the curler <b>5</b> is deformed in accordance with the wrist <b>200</b> by tightening the belt <b>4</b> when the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> is mounted on the wrist <b>200</b>. At this time, the wall portion <b>76</b> can be easily curved by the plurality of grooves <b>76</b><i>b, </i>so that the efficiency of mounting work of the blood pressure measurement device <b>1</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, the plurality of grooves <b>76</b><i>b </i>formed on the leading end surface <b>76</b><i>a </i>of each of the pair of wall portions <b>76</b> are aligned with the grooves <b>72</b><i>a </i>of the back plate <b>72</b> in the direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the wall portions <b>76</b>, so that the bending points of the back plate <b>72</b> and the wall portions <b>76</b> can coincide with each other.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">That is, the back plate <b>72</b> is curved as a whole by being bent at the grooves <b>72</b><i>a, </i>and the wall portion <b>76</b> is curved as a whole by being bent at the grooves <b>76</b><i>b</i>. Since the grooves <b>72</b><i>a </i>and the grooves <b>76</b><i>b </i>are aligned with each other, the bending points of the back plate <b>72</b> and the wall portion <b>76</b> can coincide with each other.

Additionally, the flow path body <b>83</b> is formed in a shape that is long in one direction and has less width than the width of the air bag <b>81</b> in the lateral direction and formed with a leading end having a circular shape. The flow path body <b>83</b> includes the connection portion <b>84</b> on the leading end.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The flow path body <b>83</b> is configured by thermally welding a portion of sheet members <b>86</b>, which is adjacent to a region of the sheet members <b>86</b> constituting the air bag <b>81</b>, in a frame shape long in one direction, in a state where the connection portion <b>84</b> is disposed on the two sheet members <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Note that, a portion of the welded portion <b>81</b><i>a, </i>where the two sheet members <b>86</b> are welded in a rectangular frame shape, is not welded and the air bag <b>81</b> provided with the flow path body <b>83</b> are constituted to be continuous with a welded portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>constituting the flow path body <b>83</b>, and thus the air bag <b>81</b> fluidly communicates with the flow path body <b>83</b>. The connection portion <b>84</b> is connected to the flow path portion.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The tensile cuff <b>74</b> is fluidly connected to the pump through the flow path portion. The tensile cuff <b>74</b> is fixed to the hand back side of the wrist <b>200</b> of the curler <b>5</b>. The tensile cuff <b>74</b> is inflated to press the curler <b>5</b> such that the curler <b>5</b> is spaced apart from the wrist <b>200</b>, thereby pulling the belt <b>4</b> and the curler <b>5</b> toward the hand back side of the wrist <b>200</b>. The tensile cuff <b>74</b> includes, for example, a plurality of air bags <b>101</b> and a connection portion <b>103</b> provided on the air bag <b>101</b> facing the curler <b>5</b>.
