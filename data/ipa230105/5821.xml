Semiconductor device <b>10</b> is located on bus bar <b>15</b>. Power flows through the metal bus bar in a direction different from the direction of the heat flow in the metal heat sink.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The polyimide layer <b>30</b> is bonded to the metal bus bar <b>15</b> and metal heat sink without adhesive. The bond to the metal bus bar and to the metal heat sink is effected by using heat and optionally pressure. By bonding the polyimide to the metal bus bar and metal heat sink under these conditions air pockets (voids) are eliminated which makes the resulting bus bar more reliable, consistent and robust. The metal bus bar may be a metal, a metal alloy or a combination of metals. Exemplary metals and metal alloys include aluminum and aluminum alloys. The metal bus bar may have a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the polyimide layer. In some embodiments, the polyimide layer coefficient of thermal expansion is 90 to 110% of the metal bus bar coefficient of thermal expansion.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The metal heat sink may be a metal, a metal alloy or a combination of metals. Exemplary metals and metal alloys include aluminum and aluminum alloys. The metal heat sink may have a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the polyimide layer. In some embodiments, the polyimide layer coefficient of thermal expansion is 90 to 110% of the metal heat sink coefficient of thermal expansion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The metal bus bar is bonded to the metal heat sink by locating the polyimide layer between the metal bus bar and the metal heat sink to form a stack and then subjecting the stack to a temperature that is greater than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide and less than the degradation temperature of the polyimide. Representative temperatures are 380&#xb0; C. to 420&#xb0; C. While at that temperature, the stack may be subjected to an elevated pressure (greater than atmospheric pressure). The stack may be subjected to the elevated temperature for a time sufficient to result in bonding, more specifically for a time sufficient to allow the polyimide at the surface of the metal bus bar and the metal heat sink to flow into the surface structure of the metal bus bar and the metal heat sink, thus forming a bond without voids. After the metal bus bar and the metal heat sink have been bonded a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor power device is attached to the metal bus bar using an appropriate attachment means such as a threaded fastener.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Bonding the polyimide portion to the metal portion facilitates fabrication of the semiconductor article as there is no need to locate a separate thermal pad or multiple thermal pads between the bus bar and heat sink. Additionally, semiconductor article produced as described above has more resilience to temperature cycling and a higher operating temperature. The higher operating temperature improves the power density of the device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Semiconductor device <b>10</b> may be a semiconductor power device or any other semiconductor device without limitation. The semiconductor device includes at least one semiconductor chip and may further include one or more circuit boards including insulating circuit boards and printed circuit boards. Examples of semiconductor chips include a switching element such as insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and a power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (power MOSFET) and a diode such as a freewheeling diode (FWD). Also, elements such as a reverse conducting (RC)-IGBT, including integrated IGBT and FWD, and reverse blocking (RB)-IGBT may be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The semiconductor article is not limited to a single semiconductor device, a single bus bar and a single heat sink. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a single semiconductor device, a single bus bar and a single heat sink for simplicity.
