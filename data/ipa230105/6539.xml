In order to achieve input current shaping and rapid adjustment of output voltage, a two-stage circuit architecture is mainly used in high-power applications. The front-end circuit is a power factor correction circuit (PFC), and the back-end circuit is an isolated DC-DC circuit with a resonant conversion topology. Further, the PFC circuit is often implemented by a BOOST circuit, and the isolated DC-DC circuit usually includes an inverter circuit, a resonant circuit and a rectifier circuit, but the efficiency and power density of the two-stage circuit architecture are unsatisfactory. Due to the use of high-voltage devices, it is difficult to further increase the switching frequency and improve the heat and power distribution of the transformer and EMI characteristics in the circuit.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are by examples, and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a power conversion device.
