During a flight, an attendant may periodically pass through an internal cabin to distribute refreshments. For example, an attendant may push a galley cart through an aisle of an internal cabin. The galley cart retains beverages and snacks, for example. Passengers may select certain beverages and snacks from the attendant.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, manually maneuvering carts and delivering items therefrom poses certain drawbacks. For example, attendants and passengers may not be aware of the current inventory of various items during a flight, nor if there will be suitable inventory for a future flight. Additionally, manually inspecting a cart for desired items requested by passengers can be inefficient. For example, a passenger may request an item only to find out that the item is no longer available after the attendant searches the cart. Additionally, there can be ergonomic issues with heavy carts and safety issues with runaway carts that are improperly stowed. Further, sorting trash and waste stored within a cart can be a time consuming task that is susceptible to human error.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, known carts provide little to no opportunity for passengers to be able to customize orders. Additionally, access to items such as food and beverages may be limited to specific times during a flight, and service can be slow and limited with no options available for specific food restrictions and preferences.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A need exists for a system and a method for efficiently and effectively providing items to passengers aboard a vehicle during a trip.
