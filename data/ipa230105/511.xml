Examples of the disclosure relate to ergonomic handles that control multiple degrees of freedom of the medical device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some medical procedures, a physician has to hold and manipulate multiple devices at a same time. For example, during endoluminal surgeries, a physician holds and manipulates a scope (e.g. an endoscope) with one hand (e.g. the left hand) while manipulating the scope shaft with the other hand (e.g. the right hand), to position the scope in a patient's body lumen. The physician or a technician then introduces an accessory device into a working channel of the scope and positions the accessory within the patient. Currently, accessories often do not have the capability to be manipulated independently and intuitively, in all degrees of freedom necessary for positioning and actuating the accessory. Additionally, manipulation of the scope and accessory device can lead to muscle fatigue and stress over the length of a procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure is directed to overcoming one or more of these above-referenced challenges or other challenges in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects of the disclosure relate to, among other things, ergonomic medical device handles that allow for a single hand to control multiple degrees of freedom of the medical device in a neutral or relatively-neutral position.

Shaft <b>1050</b> can be made of flexible materials, rigid materials, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Distal end <b>1030</b> is at or adjacent to the distal end of shaft <b>1050</b>. Distal end <b>1030</b> is comprised of a distal articulable section <b>1020</b> of shaft <b>1050</b> (e.g. an articulation joint) and an end effector <b>1025</b>. A transition zone <b>1040</b> is proximal to the distal articulable section <b>1020</b> of shaft <b>1050</b>, and provides a transition between the articulable section and a more proximal portion of shaft <b>1050</b>.

Handle <b>11</b> includes a handle body <b>18</b> and three actuators: actuator/trigger <b>12</b> and knobs <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Strain relief <b>20</b> provides the junction between handle <b>11</b> and a shaft (not shown). Actuator <b>12</b> is on a proximal end of handle <b>11</b> and may control the actuation (e.g. open/close movement) of the end effector <b>1025</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, moving actuator <b>12</b> away from handle body <b>18</b> can open (or otherwise actuate) the end effector (not shown), and moving the lever into handle body <b>18</b> can close (or otherwise actuate) the end effector. Alternate actions are also within the scope of this embodiment. For example, moving actuator <b>12</b> into handle body <b>18</b> (distally) can open the end effector, and moving actuator <b>12</b> away from handle <b>11</b> can close the end effector.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Knob <b>14</b> is located on a forward face of handle <b>11</b>, e.g. a side of the handle facing away from the user when device <b>10</b> is in use.

Knob <b>14</b> can control the rotational movement of the end effector <b>1025</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, rotating knob <b>14</b> to the left can rotate the end effector in a counterclockwise motion, and rotating knob <b>14</b> to the right can rotate the end effector in a clockwise motion, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Knob <b>16</b> is located on a side face of handle <b>11</b>, e.g. on the left side of the handle body <b>18</b> when device <b>10</b> is in use. A plane of rotation of knob <b>16</b> is parallel or substantially parallel to the center axis of device <b>10</b>. Knob <b>16</b> can control the articulation direction of distal end <b>1030</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, rotating knob <b>16</b> clockwise can result in the left articulation of the distal end, and rotating knob <b>16</b> in a counterclockwise motion can result in the right articulation of the distal end, or vice versa.

For example, handle <b>11</b> may include only actuator <b>12</b> and rotation knob <b>14</b>, or any other subset or combination. As another example, actuator <b>12</b> can control the articulation of distal end <b>1030</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), knob <b>14</b> can control the actuation (e.g. open/close movement) of end effector <b>1025</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and knob <b>16</b> can control the rotation of distal end <b>1030</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

Actuator <b>12</b> includes a slot <b>13</b> and an extension <b>15</b>. Slot <b>13</b> can be many shapes and sizes to enable a user to insert a finger through slot <b>13</b>. For example, slot <b>13</b> can be ovular, as shown, circular, square, rectangular, etc. Extension <b>15</b> extends into handle body <b>18</b> and includes a linear rack <b>24</b> along the distal-most end of extension <b>15</b>, opposite the end having slot <b>13</b>. Rack <b>24</b> meshes with a pinion gear <b>26</b> such that, when actuator <b>12</b> is moved inward and outward of handle body <b>18</b> (through a slot in the top of handle body <b>18</b>), pinion gear <b>26</b> rotates clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. Pinion gear <b>26</b> meshes with a movable rack <b>28</b>, and rack <b>28</b> is coupled to a control wire <b>30</b> in a manner that restricts movement of control wire <b>30</b> along its axis relative to rack <b>28</b>, yet permits rotational movement of wire <b>30</b> relative to rack <b>28</b>. As pinion gear <b>26</b> rotates, rack <b>28</b> moves up or down within handle body <b>18</b> (depending on the direction of rotation of pinion gear <b>26</b>). And as rack moves up and down, wire <b>30</b> moves with it.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, knob <b>14</b> is fixedly coupled to a pinion gear <b>48</b>. Pinion gear <b>48</b> meshes with a pinion gear <b>50</b>, and pinion gear <b>50</b>, in turn, is coupled to control wire <b>30</b>. Control wire <b>30</b> is coupled to gear <b>50</b> in a manner that allows wire <b>30</b> to translate up and down within gear <b>50</b>, yet also rotate with gear <b>50</b>. For example, a crimp having a square outer profile may be fixed to wire <b>30</b>, between wire <b>30</b> and gear <b>50</b>. Gear <b>50</b> may have a square shaped lumen at its center, to accept the square crimp. Rotation of gear <b>50</b> will therefore rotate the crimp and wire <b>30</b>. When knob <b>14</b> is rotated, therefore, pinion gear <b>48</b> rotates in the same or similar rotational direction, causing the opposite rotation of pinion gear <b>50</b> and wire <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a close-up of the interactions between rack <b>24</b>, pinion gear <b>26</b>, and rack <b>28</b>. Rack <b>24</b> is comprised of a plurality of extensions <b>36</b> (e.g. teeth) and a plurality of indentions <b>38</b> (e.g. troughs) that mesh with a plurality of indentions <b>42</b> and extensions <b>40</b> on pinion gear <b>26</b>, respectively. In addition, the plurality of extensions <b>40</b> and plurality of indentions <b>42</b> from pinion gear <b>26</b> mesh with the plurality of indentions <b>46</b> and plurality of extensions <b>44</b> of rack <b>28</b>. Rack <b>28</b> may be comprised of two components that are mirror images of one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows one of those components. The other component (not shown) would come out of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and lay over the component shown to define a cavity in which a ferrule <b>32</b> sits. The two components of rack <b>28</b> may be coupled to completely or partially contain ferrule <b>32</b>. Adhesives, ultrasonic welding, or any other means commonly known in the art may couple the components of rack <b>28</b>. Ferrule <b>32</b> may be fixedly coupled to control wire <b>30</b> by a crimp, adhesive, or any other means commonly known in the art. Control wire <b>30</b> extends from the distal end of ferrule <b>32</b>, through a channel <b>31</b> defined within rack <b>28</b>. Channel <b>31</b> extends from cavity <b>29</b> to a distal end of rack <b>28</b>. Control wire <b>30</b> then extends through handle body <b>18</b>, strain relief <b>20</b>, the shaft of device <b>10</b>, to the distal tip of device <b>10</b>. At the distal tip, wire <b>30</b> connects to a distal assembly in a manner that actuates an end effector of the distal assembly, in any suitable manner known in the art.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Rack <b>24</b>, pinion gear <b>26</b>, and rack <b>28</b> interact such that, when rack <b>24</b> is moved inward and outward of handle body <b>18</b>, the plurality of indentions <b>38</b> and plurality of extensions <b>36</b> mesh with the plurality of extensions <b>40</b> and plurality of indentions <b>42</b> of pinion gear <b>26</b> to move it clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. In turn, the plurality of extensions <b>40</b> and plurality of indentions <b>42</b> of pinion gear <b>26</b> mesh with the plurality of extensions <b>44</b> and plurality of indentions <b>46</b> of rack <b>28</b> such that, when pinion gear <b>26</b> is rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, the rack <b>28</b> is raised and lowered, respectively. When rack <b>28</b> is raised and lowered, ferrule <b>32</b> and control wire <b>30</b> are raised and lowered, accordingly. This movement correlates to the actuation of the distal assembly/end effector. Minor adjustments, including the addition of more pinion gears and racks, can be understood to enhance or change the desired movement. For example, the addition of another pinion gear between either rack <b>24</b> and pinion gear <b>26</b> or rack <b>28</b> and pinion gear <b>26</b> may result in an opposite action than that achieved with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. More specifically, pushing rack <b>24</b> distally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> result in proximal movement of rack <b>28</b> to, for example, open an end effector. Adding another gear as described above would result in distal movement of rack <b>24</b> causing distal movement of rack <b>28</b> to, for example, close an end effector.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an alternative cross-sectional view of medical device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, showing components within handle body <b>18</b> that are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

Steering wires <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be coupled to pulley <b>54</b> such that, when knob <b>16</b> is rotated, one of steering wires <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> is pulled into tension. Steering wires <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be connected to the distal tip (e.g. a distal end of an articulation joint), such that, when a steering wire <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> is pulled into tension, the distal tip (not shown) articulates accordingly. For example, rotating knob <b>16</b> counterclockwise may put tension on steering wire <b>56</b>, resulting in the articulation of the distal tip in a first direction, while rotating knob <b>16</b> clockwise may put tension on steering wire <b>58</b>, resulting in the articulation of the distal tip in a second direction opposite the first direction. Steering wires <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> may pass through tracks <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, which serve to confine the steering wires and prevent the wires from entangling with other components within the handle during use.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Aspects of the disclosure include methods of using device <b>10</b>.

Delivery and placement also can be in other body lumens or organs reachable via the GI tract, any other natural opening or body tract, bodily incision, or through a delivery device, such as an endoscope or sheath. Once the desired site is accessed, the user can actuate one or more actuators, including knobs <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and actuator <b>12</b>, with only one hand (or both hands if desired), to control the articulation of the distal end of the medical device, the actuation of the end effector, and/or the rotation of the end effector relative to the shaft of medical device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show an alternate embodiment of a medical device <b>110</b>. Medical device <b>110</b> includes a handle <b>111</b> having a handle body <b>118</b> and three actuators: lever <b>116</b>, knob <b>114</b>, and trigger <b>112</b>.

Lever <b>116</b> may control the articulation direction of distal end <b>1030</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, pushing lever <b>116</b> away (or up as shown in the Figures) can result in the left articulation of the distal end, and pulling lever <b>116</b> down may result in the right articulation of the distal end. Alternate actions are within the scope of this disclosure. For example, pushing lever <b>116</b> away can result in the right articulation of the distal end, and pulling lever <b>116</b> down can result in the left articulation of the distal end.

Knob <b>114</b> can control the rotational movement of the end effector <b>1025</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, rotating knob <b>114</b> to the left can translate to rotation of the end effector in a counterclockwise motion relative to the device shaft, and rotating knob <b>114</b> to the right can translate to rotation of the end effector in a clockwise motion relative to the shaft. Alternate actions are within the scope of this disclosure.

For example, trigger <b>112</b> can control the articulation of distal end <b>1030</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), knob <b>114</b> can control the open/close movement of end effector <b>1025</b> (shown in FIG. <b>1</b>), and knob <b>116</b> can control the rotation of the distal tip (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

Control wire <b>130</b> may be fixedly coupled to ferrule <b>152</b> by adhesives, crimps, or any alternative coupling methods commonly known in the art. A distal end of wire <b>130</b> (not shown) may be coupled to a distal assembly/end effector at a distal end of device <b>110</b>. When knob <b>114</b> is rotated, pinion gear <b>148</b> is rotated consequently. Thus, due to the intermeshing of the extensions and indentions of pinion gear <b>148</b> with pinion gear <b>150</b>, when pinion gear <b>148</b> is rotated, pinion gear <b>150</b> is subsequently rotated in the opposite direction. This movement consequently rotates pinion gear <b>166</b>, which is coupled to the distal end of shaft <b>164</b>. Due to the meshing of the extensions and indentions of pinion gear <b>166</b> with pinion gear <b>168</b>, when pinion gear <b>166</b> is rotated, pinion gear <b>168</b> rotates in the opposite direction. Because shaft <b>151</b> is coupled to pinion gear <b>168</b>, when pinion gear <b>168</b> is rotated, shaft <b>151</b> and ferrule <b>152</b> may rotate, accordingly. This movement translates to the rotation of the distal tip assembly/end effector relative to then shaft of medical device <b>110</b>. In addition, due to the arrangement of the parts in the handle body <b>118</b>, clockwise rotation of knob <b>114</b> results in clockwise rotation of wire <b>30</b>, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, lever <b>116</b> includes a cam <b>154</b>. Control wires <b>156</b> and <b>158</b> are coupled to cam <b>154</b> such that, when lever <b>116</b> is pushed up, cam <b>154</b> is rotated counterclockwise and tension is created in steering wire <b>156</b>. When lever <b>116</b> is pulled down, cam <b>154</b> rotates clockwise, creating tension in steering wire <b>158</b>. The tension created in steering wires <b>156</b> and <b>158</b> translates to articulation at the distal tip, since wires <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> are coupled to the distal tip (e.g. the articulation joint). Control blocks <b>128</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, and <b>163</b> of handle body <b>118</b> control the location of steering wires <b>156</b> and <b>158</b> in the handle and assist in guiding the wires <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> in the handle body <b>118</b> as the wires <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> translate.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Trigger <b>112</b> includes a slot <b>113</b> that enables a user to use a finger to actuate trigger <b>112</b>.

For example, the slot may be circular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, ovular, rectangular, or any shape to enable a user to use a finger to actuate trigger <b>112</b>. Rack <b>124</b> is fixedly coupled to trigger <b>112</b>. When trigger <b>112</b> is actuated (pulled into handle body <b>118</b> via a slot within handle body <b>118</b>), rack <b>124</b> is translated longitudinally into the handle, and towards the user. The extensions and indentions of rack <b>124</b> mesh with the indentions and extensions of pinion gear <b>126</b>. When rack <b>124</b> is translated longitudinally into the handle, pinion gear <b>126</b> rotates clockwise. This rotation of pinion gear <b>126</b> results in the lateral (up and down; proximal and distal) movement of a rack <b>163</b>. For example, when pinion gear <b>126</b> is rotated clockwise, rack <b>163</b> is raised (moved proximally). Similarly, when pinion gear <b>126</b> is rotated counterclockwise, rack <b>163</b> is lowered (moved distally). Rack <b>163</b> may be fixedly coupled to a shaft <b>165</b> by adhesives, welding, or any other means commonly known in the art. Shaft <b>165</b> is coupled to the proximal end of a pinion gear <b>168</b>. As previously described, pinion gear <b>168</b> is coupled to shaft <b>151</b> and ferrule <b>152</b> such that, when pinion gear <b>168</b> is raised or lowered, shaft <b>151</b> and ferrule <b>152</b> move accordingly.
