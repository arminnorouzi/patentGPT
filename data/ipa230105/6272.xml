id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithium ion battery cell experiences a swelling phenomenon since gas is generated therein depending on the use condition and environment. It is known that gas is mainly generated due to a side reaction of an electrolyte injected into the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The battery cell where the swelling phenomenon occurs has a deteriorated charge/discharge performance. In addition, if the pressure inside the battery cell exceeds a threshold value, a case of the battery cell is ruptured so that toxic gas is vented to the outside.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The case of the lithium ion battery cell is made of a flexible pouch film, for example Since the pouch film has weak rigidity, when the pressure inside the battery cell increases above the limit due to the swelling phenomenon, the sealing part with weak bonding force is ruptured so that gas is leaked to the outside.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The application field of the lithium ion battery cell is rapidly increasing not only to mobile devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, smart phones and smart pads, but also electric-driven vehicles (electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)), large-capacity energy storage systems (ESS), or the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, a battery module mounted on the electric-driven vehicle includes a plurality of battery cells connected in series and/or in parallel to secure a high energy capacity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">If some battery cells in the battery module cause a swelling phenomenon, the performance of the entire battery module is degraded. In addition, if the swelled battery cells cause venting while the electric-driven vehicle is running, toxic gas is ejected to the outside, and in the worst case, the charging and discharging of the battery cells that cause venting is stopped, which may result in sudden stop of the electric-driven vehicle. In addition, when a plurality of battery cells cause venting, toxic gas may ignite, which may lead to an accident in which the battery module explodes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, in a device equipped with a battery module, there is a need for developing a technology capable of easily detecting that the battery cells included in the battery module are swelling.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is designed to solve the problems of the related art, and therefore the present disclosure is directed to providing an apparatus and method capable of easily detecting that battery cells included in a battery module are swelling over the limit.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an apparatus for detecting swelling of a battery module, comprising: a battery module housing defining a space for accommodating the battery module; a swelling detection panel attached to a side surface of the battery module and having an edge in contact with an inner surface of the battery module housing; a slant portion protruding from the inner surface of the battery module housing and having a slant surface extending from at least a first location adjacent to the edge of the swelling detection panel to a second location while forming an angle with the inner surface; a contact sensor installed within the space of the battery module housing immediately adjacent to the second location; an alarm configured to output an alarm message visually or audibly; and a control unit operably coupled to the contact sensor and the alarm, wherein the contact sensor is configured to output a swelling detection signal in response to the swelling detection panel moving along the slant surface away from the second location such that the edge of the swelling detection panel contacts the contact sensor, and the control unit is configured to control the alarm unit to output the alarm message in response to receiving the swelling detection signal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the slant portion may protrude from a plurality of points along the edge of the swelling detection panel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the slant portion may have a right-angled triangular section.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the swelling detection panel may be made of an elastic plastic.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the contact sensor unit may be a piezoelectric sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the contact sensor unit may be a button switch.
