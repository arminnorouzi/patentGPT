Electric diffusers are devices for diffusing volatile substances in a closed environment, with the use of electrical energy that is used to activate heating elements, diffuser elements or dispensing elements, for the purpose of achieving optimum efficiency, optimum control over the dose and optimum control by the user over the adjustment of the dispensing amount.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This type of devices is specially designed to be used without the need for the cooperation of air currents, and even without specific restrictions on temperature, achieving good evaporation and/or diffusion of volatile substances.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some of these devices include motors, heaters or solenoid valves that allow the vapors to escape through diffusion or dispensing systems such as nozzles or wicks. These devices are based on a container for the volatile substance, an electrical system that allows diffusion and batteries or cells that power the system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some cases, the volatile substance is contained within a container in liquid form, and the electrical system is used to dispense doses by heating to evaporation, by spraying, nebulization, atomization, or other formats.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other cases, this container is usually presented inside a pressurized metal housing, which acts as a protection and as a support, and which includes the propellant gas of the volatile substance that is intended to be diffused.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among all the different systems for diffusing active substances, one stands out whose main advantage is the reduced energy required for its operation and therefore longer battery life.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These are electronic devices that feed a perforated metal disc attached to a piezoelectric element that rests on a capillary element that transports the active substance in liquid form from a container or reservoir that is replaced when all the substance is released.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This piezoelectric element vibrates when it is supplied with an alternating supply voltage at a frequency as close to the resonance frequency of the element. This vibration drives the fluid contained in the capillary element through the holes in the metal disc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The size of the particle is directly proportional to the size of the hole, and the range and flow of the nebulization depends directly on the amplitude with which said piezoelectric element vibrates.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The amplitude of this vibration can be affected by an excess or defect of the pressure exerted by the capillary element on the piezoelectric element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This variation is the result of the different elements that form the structure that supports them and their variation depending on their different manufacturing processes. Namely, the assembly tolerances, the manufacturing tolerances of the capillary element, the fluid container, the geometric tolerances of the piezoelectric element, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An excess of pressure can cause a decrease in the amplitude of vibration and, therefore, the range and flow would also be consequently reduced, being the extreme case in which the disc could not vibrate at all and, therefore, causing the device to stop working.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the contrary, a very low pressure, or the absence of contact between the perforated piezoelectric disc and the capillary element, would also result in a reduction in the range and flow rate of the active substance to be diffused.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For this reason, a known solution is the one described in document WO200597349 A1, wherein a spring is added to exert a sufficient, but not excessive, pressure on the piezoelectric disc that rests on the capillary element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The metal disc has a series of micro-perforations forming a total perforated surface, which is directly proportional to the nebulization flow. The greater the total surface, the greater the nebulization.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A drawback of the device described in this document is that, in order to obtain the best nebulization performance, the capillary element containing the fluid to be nebulized has to completely cover the same perforated surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, said device does not comprise any element that guarantees correct centering between the perforated surface and the surface of the capillary element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the presence of metal parts can cause noise, which can be annoying for users of the device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a device for diffusing volatile substances that solves the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the device for diffusing volatile substances of the invention, the aforementioned drawbacks are solved, presenting other advantages that will be described below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The device for diffusing volatile substances according to the present invention comprises:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">a container to house a liquid containing the volatile substances,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">a capillary element partially housed in said container,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">a perforated element through which volatile substances are diffused, and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">a piezoelectric element in contact with said perforated element and in contact with the capillary element, said piezoelectric element causing the vibration of said capillary element,</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">wherein the diffusion device also comprises an elastic element on which said piezoelectric element is mounted, said elastic element being attached to said container or to a housing surrounding said container.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a preferred embodiment, said capillary element defines a central longitudinal axis, and said elastic element is a body rotating around said central longitudinal axis of the capillary element.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, advantageously, said elastic element comprises a hole centered with respect to said central longitudinal axis of the capillary element, where said piezoelectric element is mounted.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, said elastic element is a bellows, and the lateral wall of said bellows is curved, defines two sections that form an acute angle, or comprises a plurality of folds, the width of the bellows being smaller towards the piezoelectric element than towards the container.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, said capillary element is a wick and said elastic element is made of a polymeric material.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a preferred embodiment, said piezoelectric element comprises a central deformation, which defines a cavity on its face facing the capillary element.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Said elastic element allows the piezoelectric element to be perfectly centered with respect to said capillary element.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The geometry of said elastic element allows a deformation equivalent to the sum of the manufacturing and assembly tolerances of the elements that characterize the quality and quantity of diffused or nebulized fluid.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, this elastic element maintains an adequate pressure to maintain the quality and quantity of diffusion or nebulization within the required parameters.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For a better understanding of what has been stated, some drawings are attached in which, schematically and only as a non-limiting example, a practical case of embodiment is represented.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a sectional elevation view of the upper part of the device for diffusing volatile substances of the present invention, according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional elevation view of the upper part of the device for diffusing volatile substances of the present invention, according to a second embodiment;
