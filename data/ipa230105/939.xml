id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, a quasi-drug composition, a feed additive, a drinking water additive, a feed, and drinking water for preventing, ameliorating, or treating porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus infection, each including, as an active ingredient, a complex including a curcuminoid-based compound and a licorice extract or a traction thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order for functional substances to exhibit efficacy, it is essential that they be absorbed into the blood and maintain durability for a predetermined period of time. Amino acids, glucose, and vitamins, which are water-soluble substances, reach the heart through the liver, and fat granules produced by decomposition of fat, most phytochemicals, and fat-soluble vitamins, which are fat-soluble substances, are absorbed into the heart. Eventually, water-soluble and fat-soluble substances meet in the heart and are transported to cells throughout the body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regarding the research trends related thereto, research to develop water-soluble complexes using phospholipids for fat-soluble substances has been actively conducted. However, there is a limitation in that various problems such as decomposition of the materials occur. Accordingly, there has been a demand for a technique for maximizing the efficacy while maximizing the absorption rate by making the fat-soluble substances water-soluble.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, one of the main causes that lower the productivity of industrial animals is viral enteritis, which inevitably occurs more than once during the breeding period of piglets, and causes continuous economic loss by lowering the growth rate and causing death.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, explosive outbreaks of variant porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) domestically and abroad have caused enormous economic damage. Development of vaccines and therapeutic agents may be considered as a means to effectively control variant PED coronavirus. There have been no therapeutic agents for variant PED coronavirus in the world, and therefore, development of therapeutic agents is very important in terms of productivity and added value in the swine industry. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop therapeutic agents capable of effectively controlling the epidemic diarrhea virus in industrial animals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have conducted research on novel therapeutic agents for PED coronavirus infection, and they found that use of a curcuminoid-based compound together with a licorice extract exhibits a synergistic effect of increasing the absorption rate of the curcuminoid-based compound in the body to effectively prevent and treat PED coronavirus infection, thereby completing the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus infection, the pharmaceutical composition including, as an active ingredient, a complex including a curcuminoid-based compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a licorice extract or a fraction thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a food composition for preventing or ameliorating PED virus infection, the food composition including, as an active ingredient, a complex including a curcuminoid-based compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a licorice extract or a fraction thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a quasi-drug composition for preventing or ameliorating PED virus infection, the quasi-drug composition including, as an active ingredient, a complex including a curcuminoid-based compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a licorice extract or a fraction thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive for preventing or ameliorating PED virus infection, the feed additive including, as an active ingredient, a complex including a curcuminoid-based compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;

In contrast, the complex-administered group showed a survival rate of 80%, indicating 2-fold increase in the survival rate, as compared with the virus-infected group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">3-3. Observation of Fecal Consistency and Results</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">During the course of the experiment, fecal consistency was observed every day, and the fecal score of each individual was recorded and averaged. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: normal (0), pasty (1), semi-liquid (2), and liquid (3).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">As a result, a positive control group (virus), which was inoculated with the virus and not administered with the complex, showed a fecal score of 3 until 10 days after inoculation. In contrast, the experimental group administered with 200 mg/kg/day of the complex showed the same fecal consistency as the normal control group, day 10 after virus inoculation, indicating that the complex had very high efficacy of ameliorating and treating porcine epidemic diarrhea (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">3-4. Body Weight</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">Changes in the body weight according to the complex administration were examined for 14 days in the epidemic model of Example 3-2. As a result, the mock-infected group showed a 1.5-fold increase in the body weight from the start to the end of the test period, and the virus-infected group showed no significant difference in the body weight. In contrast, the complex-administered group showed a 1.5-fold increase in the body weight, indicating that the body weight was increased even though infected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">3-5. Effect of Reducing Viral RNA in Feces/Small Intestine by Complex</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">3-5-1. Feces</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">Viral RNA in the feces tended to gradually decrease from day 3 after infection (PID3) to day 14 after infection (PID14) in the virus-infected group and the experimental group (raised together and 200 mg/kg/day administered), except for the mock-infected group. In the virus-infected group, virus was detected until the end of the test period. In contrast, in the complex-administered group, viral RNA was not detected from day 11 after infection (PID11) to the end date, indicating the high efficacy of ameliorating and treating porcine epidemic diarrhea (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">3-5-2. Duodenum</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">Viral RNA in the duodenum tended to gradually decrease from day 3 after infection (PID3) to day 14 after infection (PID14) in the virus-infected group and the experimental group (raised together and 200 mg/kg/day administered), except for the mock-infected group. At the end of the test period (PID14), viral RNA in the duodenum showed an about 5-fold decrease in the complex-administered group, as compared with the virus-infected group, indicating the high efficacy of ameliorating and treating porcine epidemic diarrhea (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">3-5-3.

As a result, an about 36-fold decrease, an about 82-fold decrease, and an about 60-fold decrease were observed in TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, and IL-8, respectively, indicating that the complex has very high anti-inflammatory activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">3-7. Gross Clinical Symptoms</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">The piglets of the negative control group showed no clinical symptoms including diarrhea during the experiment period, and they maintained a normal intestinal morphology and small intestinal barrier. In contrast, the positive control group (virus) continuously showed diarrhea symptoms from day 1 after virus inoculation to the end of the experiment or death. Characteristic gross clinical symptoms were depression, anorexia immediately before/after diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and weight loss due to severe watery diarrhea. Characteristic autopsy findings were that the small intestine was filled with fluid, and the contents were visually observed due to gas distension and thinning of the serous membrane. On day 3 after being raised together, the small intestine of the experimental group administered with the complex of 200 mg/kg/day showed a thinner wall of the small intestine and distension due to watery fluid and gas, but maintained the shape of the mucosal folds, similar to the virus-infected group. On day 10 after being raised together, the small intestine of the experimental group administered with the complex of low or high concentrations maintained the normal intestinal morphology and intestinal barrier, and the distinct mucosal folds, similar to the mock-infected group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">During the experimental period, all the experimental groups except for the negative control group showed lowered intake rates over the period after inoculation. In particular, the positive control group (virus) showed a sharply lowered intake rate from day 3 after being raised together. However, the complex-administered group maintained an intake rate of about 30% or more higher than that of the virus-infected group, indicating that treatment of the complex has the efficacy of improving anorexia and decreased physical strength due to virus infection.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">3-8. Histopathological Examination</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">At the end of the experiment, each individual was euthanized and autopsied, and the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) was collected and divided into pieces, fixed in 10% neutral formalin, and subjected to common procedures for preparing pathological tissue samples to prepare Hematoxylin &#x26; Eosin stained slides of each tissue, which were used to perform histopathologic examination for villous atrophy of the small intestine. The villous atrophy of the small intestine was compared by obtaining a villi:crypt ratio.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">As a result, in the small intestine of the negative control group, the villi projected in the normal finger-like shape, and the crypts were normal in size. In contrast, in the piglets of the positive control group, the virus proliferated in the villus epithelial cells of the small intestine, and the villus epithelial cells were sloughed off. As a result, villous atrophy and fusion occurred, and the proliferation of the crypts to replace the sloughed villi was prominently observed. In addition, hyperemia and hemorrhage were observed in the lamina propria, and mononuclear cell infiltration was observed. As compared with the positive control group, the experimental group treated with the complex of 200 mg/kg/day showed that the overall length of the villi increased, and the villi projected in the normal finger-like shape, and the size of the crypt was also normal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">As described above, the curcumin-licorice saponin water-soluble complex, in which the water solubility of the curcuminoid-based compound, curcumin was increased using the licorice extract, exhibited excellent inhibitory efficacy against PED coronavirus.
