The compound features can be used in a data integrity classifier to evaluate the quality of data retrievable from the memory cells and thus control the operations to read data from the memory cells. A memory sub-system can be a storage device, a memory module, or a hybrid of a storage device and memory module. Examples of storage devices and memory modules are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In general, a host system can utilize a memory sub-system that includes one or more components, such as memory devices that store data. The host system can provide data to be stored at the memory sub-system and can request data to be retrieved from the memory sub-system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An integrated circuit memory cell (e.g., a flash memory cell) can be programmed to store data by the way of its state at a threshold voltage. For example, if the memory cell is configured/programmed in a state that allows a substantial current to pass the memory cell at the threshold voltage, the memory cell is storing a bit of one; and otherwise, the memory cell is storing a bit of zero. Further, a memory cell can store multiple bits of data by being configured/programmed differently at multiple threshold voltages. For example, the memory cell can store multiple bits of data by having a combination of states at the multiple threshold voltages; and different combinations of the states of the memory cell at the threshold voltages can be interpreted to represent different states of bits of data that is stored in the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, after the states of integrated circuit memory cells are configured/programmed using write operations to store data in the memory cells, the optimized threshold voltage for reading the memory cells can shift due to a number of factors, such as charge loss, read disturb, cross-temperature effect (e.g., write and read at different operating temperatures), etc., especially when a memory cell is programmed to store multiple bits of data.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Conventional calibration circuitry has been used to self-calibrate a memory region in applying read level signals to account for shift of threshold voltages of memory cells within the memory region. During the calibration, the calibration circuitry is configured to apply different test signals to the memory region to count the numbers of memory cells that output a specified data state for the test signals. Based on the counts, the calibration circuitry determines a read level offset value as a response to a calibration command.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At least some aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by classifying the bit error rate of data retrievable from memory cells using signal and noise characteristics measured near estimated locations of optimized read voltages of the memory cells and using at least compound features computed from the signal and noise characteristics measured for the multiple optimized read voltages. The compound features can be computed efficiently using an iterative or progressive technique where the compound features are calculated initially based on signal and noise characteristics measured for lower optimized read voltages while signal and noise characteristics for higher optimized read voltages are being measured or have not yet been measured. The compound features are further updated based on the signal and noise characteristics measured for each higher optimized read voltage when the signal and noise characteristics for the higher optimized read voltage become available. The classification result of the bit error rate can be used to select a processing path in reading data from the memory cells. For example, based on the bit error rate classification, the memory sub-system can decide whether to further calibrate the read voltages, to skip error detection and data recovery, to skip reading the memory cells for soft bit data by applying read voltages that have a predetermined offset from the optimized read voltages, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, a memory cell programmed to store multiple bits of data is to be read using multiple read voltages to determine the states of the memory cells at the read voltages and thus the multiple bits stored in the memory cell. The optimized read voltages for reading the multiple states can shift due to data retention effects, such as quick charge loss (QCL), storage charge loss (SCL), etc., and/or other effects. A calibration operation can be performed for each of the read voltages to determine the respective optimized read voltages. During the calibration of each read voltage, a set of signal and noise characteristics of the memory cells can be measured. The multiple set of signal and noise characteristics associated with the multiple optimized read voltages can be used to construct features as input for a predictive model for classifying the bit error rate of data that can be retrieved from the memory cells using the multiple optimized read voltages. Such features can include compound features. A compound feature is based on multiple sets of signal and noise characteristics associated with multiple optimized read voltages respectively.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some situations, the optimized read voltages can shift over a period of time in a same direction (e.g., towards lower voltages, or towards higher voltages). In general, different optimized read voltages can shift by different amounts, where the higher ones in the optimized read voltages may shift more than the lower ones in the optimized read voltages. A predictive model can be used to predict the shift of a higher optimized read voltage based on the shift(s) of one or more lower optimized read voltages. Thus, once the lower optimized read voltages are determined through calibration, the shift of an optimized read voltage higher than the lower optimized read voltages can be predicted/estimated to correct the initial estimation of the expected location of the higher optimized read voltage. Using the corrected estimation, the calibration for the higher optimized read voltage can be performed to identify an optimized read voltage with improved precision and/or to avoid a failure in calibration.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example computing system <b>100</b> that includes a memory sub-system <b>110</b> in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.
