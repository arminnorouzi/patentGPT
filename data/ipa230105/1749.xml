As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the transponder <b>20</b> includes an IC substrate <b>21</b> that stores data and an antenna <b>22</b> that transmits and receives data in a non-contact manner. By using the transponder <b>20</b> as described above to write or read information related to the tire on a timely basis, the tire can be efficiently managed. Note that &#x201c;REID&#x201d; refers to an automatic recognition technology including: a reader/writer including an antenna and a controller; and an ID tag including an IC substrate and an antenna, the automatic recognition technology allowing data to be communicated in a wireless manner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The overall shape of the transponder <b>20</b> is not particularly limited, and for example, a pillar- or plate-like shape can be used as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. In particular, the transponder <b>20</b> having a pillar-like shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is suitable as it can conform deformation of the tire in many directions. In this case, the antenna <b>22</b> of the transponder <b>20</b> projects from each of both end portions of the IC substrate <b>21</b> and exhibits a helical shape. Accordingly, the transponder <b>20</b> can conform deformation of the tire during traveling, allowing the durability of the transponder <b>20</b> to be improved.

Additionally, in a case where the transponder<b>20</b> is disposed further on the outer side than the position P<b>2</b> in the tire radial direction, metal interference with the belt layer <b>7</b> occurs, leading to the tendency to degrade the communication performance of the transponder <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the pneumatic tire described above, the transponder <b>20</b> may be disposed between a position P<b>3</b> located on the outer side of and 5 mm away from an upper end <b>6</b><i>e </i>of the bead filler <b>6</b> in the tire radial direction and the position P<b>2</b> located on the inner side of and 5 mm away from the end <b>7</b><i>e </i>of the belt layer <b>7</b> in the tire radial direction. In other words, the transponder <b>20</b> may be disposed in a region S<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The region S<b>2</b> is a flex zone with a small rubber gauge, and the transponder <b>20</b> disposed in the region S<b>2</b> mitigates attenuation of radio waves during communication of the transponder <b>20</b>, allowing the communication performance of the transponder <b>20</b> to he effectively improved.

Additionally, preferably, the tire component disposed away from the transponder <b>20</b> is the innerliner layer <b>9</b> or the carcass layer <b>4</b>, which are disposed adjacent to the transponder <b>20</b>.

By properly setting the relative dielectric constant of the coating layer <b>23</b> as described above, radio wave transmissivity can be ensured during emission of a radio wave by the transponder <b>20</b>, effectively improving the communication performance of the transponder <b>20</b>. Note that the rubber constituting the coating layer <b>23</b> has a relative dielectric constant of from 860 MHz to 960 MHz at ambient temperature. In this regard, the ambient temperature is 23&#xb1;2&#xb0; C and 60%&#xb1;5% RH in accordance with the standard conditions of the JIS standard. The relative dielectric constant of the rubber is measured after 24 hour treatment at 23&#xb0; C and 60% RH. The range from 860 MHz to 960 MHz described above corresponds to the allocated frequency of the RFID in the current UHF band, but in a case where the allocated frequency is changed, the relative dielectric constant in the range of the allocated frequency may be specified as described above.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, with the transponder <b>20</b> covered with the coating layer <b>23</b>, a thickness t of the coating layer <b>23</b> preferably ranges from 0.5 mm to 3.0 mm, and more preferably ranges from 1.0 mm to 2.5 mm. In this regard, the thickness t of the coating layer <b>23</b> is the thickness of the rubber at a position where the rubber includes the transponder <b>20</b>, and is, for example, a rubber thickness obtained by summing a thickness t<b>1</b> and a thickness t<b>2</b> on a straight line extending through the center of the transponder <b>20</b> and orthogonally to the tire inner surface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.
