This process is also called regeneration of the desiccant. The regeneration gas is typically a hot gas.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although this is the principle of adsorption, the invention can also be applied to the principle of absorption.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a vessel will dry, it will absorb moisture from the compressed gas to be dried, saturating the desiccant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This vessel is then regenerated, typically allowing warm air to pass through it. This warm air will extract moisture from the desiccant and regenerate it.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Before the vessel is used again to dry compressed gas, it will first be cooled.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Methods are already in place wherein part of the dried compressed gas is branched off and expanded at the outlet of the drying device. As a result, the gas will cool down and then pass through the vessel to cool it down.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Afterwards, the used gas is blown off.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This method has the disadvantage that one loses part of the compressed and dried air to be able to cool the vessel, which is obviously undesirable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are also methods in which ambient air is passed through the vessel in question.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This can be sucked in, for example, by means of a blower or the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is possible that the sucked in air is passed through the vessel a number of times, passing each time through an air-to-air cooler to be cooled down.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A disadvantage of this is that it is never possible to cool below the ambient temperature. At high ambient temperatures, there is a risk that the sucked in air will be insufficiently cooled, so that the temperature of the vessel will not drop sufficiently after cooling.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, if the cooler fails, the sucked in air will not be cooled, which can also cause the temperature of the vessel to drop insufficiently.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As a result, the vessel will not be able to extract as much moisture from the gas to be dried during its next adsorption cycle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The remaining moisture in the compressed gas can cause problems for the final consumers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another disadvantage is that by using ambient air, moisture will also enter the vessel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a result, the dew point at the outlet of the drying device can become too high, which is obviously undesirable.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This invention aims at solving at least one of the aforementioned and other disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To this end, the invention concerns a method for drying compressed gas by means of a drying device with an inlet for compressed gas to be dried and an outlet for dried compressed gas, comprising at least two vessels filled with a regenerable desiccant and a controllable valve system consisting of a first valve block and a second valve block which connects the aforementioned inlet, respectively the outlet, to the aforementioned vessels, wherein the controllable valve system is being regulated as such that at least one vessel will dry compressed gas, while the other vessel is successively regenerated and cooled, wherein, by regulating the valve system, the vessels dry each in turn compressed gas, characterized in that the method consists of providing a first and a second cooling cycle to cool the vessel being cooled, with the first cooling cycle consisting of sending ambient air through the vessel and the second cooling cycle consisting of drying, to branch off compressed gas at the aforementioned outlet, expand it and pass it through the vessel to be cooled, after which this gas is then blown off, applying the first or second cooling cycle, or both, depending on predetermined conditions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An advantage of such a method is that one will always be able to cool with the first cooling cycle, which is the most energy efficient, but still, if necessary and by choosing the predetermined conditions appropriately, one will be able to apply the second cooling cycle which is much more robust and secure as a kind of &#x2018;fail-safe&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this way, the compressed gas is always properly dried, even if, for example, the ambient temperature becomes too high, and in addition, the second cooling cycle is only used under the conditions that it is necessary.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, after the vessel being cooled with the first cooling cycle, the method consists of measuring or determining the temperature in this vessel or at the outlet of this vessel and, if this temperature is higher than a predetermined maximum temperature, additional cooling of this vessel with the second cooling cycle.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This has the advantage that always the most energy efficient first cooling cycle will be used to cool the vessel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second cooling cycle will only be used to further reduce the temperature of the vessel if necessary.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, when the second cooling cycle is switched on, this second cooling cycle will only have to perform a limited additional cooling, which means that it will have to be used for a shorter period of time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another preferred embodiment, the method includes the step of determining or measuring the dew point at the outlet or determining or measuring an average dew point at the outlet over a predetermined period of time prior to cooling the vessel being cooled, and:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">if this dew point is equal to or higher than a predetermined maximum dew point, cool this vessel with the second cooling cycle; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">if this dew point is lower than the predetermined maximum dew point, cool this vessel with the first cooling cycle.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">In this case, if the dew point is too high, only the second cooling cycle will be applied. Dry air is used for the second cooling cycle, so that moisture can also be extracted from the vessel in question during the cooling process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">In this way, the vessel will be dried at the same time and additionally regenerated.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">It is important to note that the dew point is thus determined or measured when the vessel in question is in the adsorption phase, i.e. the dew point is determined or measured when the vessel in question is drying gas.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">It is also possible to measure or determine the dew point during all or part of the adsorption phase and then take an average of it.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">The invention also concerns a drying device which will allow the aforementioned method to be applied, i.e. to be able to apply both the first and second cooling cycles.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">To this end, the invention has as object a drying device for drying compressed gas, which drying device is equipped with an inlet for compressed gas to be dried and an outlet for dried compressed gas, wherein the drying device includes at least two vessels filled with a regenerable desiccant and a controllable valve system consisting of a first valve block and a second valve block which connects the aforementioned inlet, respectively the aforementioned outlet, to the aforementioned vessels, wherein the valve system is being regulated as such that at least one vessel will dry compressed gas, while the other vessel is successively regenerated and cooled, the vessels drying each in turn the compressed gases being controlled by the valve system, characterized in that the drying device is further equipped with a blower to suck in ambient air, a gas release port and a four-way valve that will allow either the blower or the gas release port to be connected to the vessels via the &#x201c;first&#x201d; valve block in such a way that, when the four-way valve connects the blower to the &#x201c;first&#x201d; valve block, the ambient air sucked in by the blower can enter the vessel being cooled via the four-way valve and the &#x201c;first&#x201d; valve block, in which the drying device is further equipped with a branch pipe capable of branching off dried compressed gas, expanding it and leading it through the &#x2018;second&#x2019; valve block to the vessel being cooled in such a way that, when the four-way valve connects the gas release port with the &#x2018;first&#x2019; valve block, the branched gas can, after passing through the vessel being cooled, be discharged through the gas release port.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">An advantage of such a drying device is that it will allow the use of a method according to the invention, i.e. to apply both the first cooling cycle and the second cooling cycle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">By cleverly controlling the components of the drying device, in particular the four-way valve and the valve system, all necessary circuits can be created in a relatively compact way.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">It goes without saying that all the aforementioned advantages of the method can also be applied to the device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

regenerable moisture absorber <b>3</b> is also called desiccant.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">It is of course possible that there are more than two vessels <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">The drying device <b>1</b> further comprises a valve system <b>4</b> consisting of a first valve block <b>5</b> and a second valve block <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">The first valve block <b>5</b> will connect vessels <b>2</b> to an inlet <b>7</b> for dried compressed gas, while the second valve block <b>6</b> will connect vessels <b>2</b> to an outlet <b>8</b> for dried compressed gas.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">The aforementioned valve blocks <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are a system of different pipes and valves which can be regulated in such a way that at any one time at least one vessel <b>2</b> is being regenerated, while the other vessel <b>2</b> or the other vessels <b>2</b> are drying the compressed gas, wherein by regulating the valve system <b>4</b> the vessels <b>2</b> will each in turn dry compressed gas.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">Furthermore, according to the invention, the drying device <b>1</b> is equipped with a four-way valve <b>9</b>, a blower <b>10</b> for the intake of ambient air and a gas release port <b>11</b> for the release of gas, which are configured in such a way that in a first position of the four-way valve <b>9</b> the blower <b>10</b> is connected to the vessels <b>2</b> via the first valve block <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and in a second position of the four-way valve <b>9</b> the gas release port <b>11</b> is connected to the vessels <b>2</b> via the first valve block <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">Of course, it is not excluded that instead of a blower <b>10</b>, other means are provided for the intake of ambient air.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">It is also possible that instead of a four-way valve <b>9</b>, a valve block with, for example, four valves or air inlets or other means can be used that can achieve the same configuration as the four-way valve <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drying device <b>1</b> is such that in the first position of the four-way valve <b>9</b>, the ambient air sucked in by the blower <b>10</b> through the four-way valve <b>9</b> and the first valve block <b>5</b> can enter the vessel <b>2</b> which is being cooled.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">Of course, the valve block <b>5</b> is regulated in the appropriate way to enable the right flow path for the gas.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">In addition, the drying device <b>1</b> is equipped with a branch pipe <b>12</b> which can branch off dried compressed gas, expand it and lead it via the second valve block <b>6</b> to the vessel <b>2</b> which is being cooled.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">In this case, the aforementioned branch pipe <b>12</b> contains an expansion valve <b>13</b> to expand the branched dried compressed gas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">The aforementioned branch pipe <b>12</b> is preferably at least partially

id="p-0057" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the drying device <b>1</b> is such that, when the four-way valve <b>9</b> is in the second position, the branched
