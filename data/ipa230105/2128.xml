The lid of the box <b>116</b> is shown with the insert <b>112</b> already inserted into an indented receiving space. The insert may be secured to the indented receiving space using a suitable mechanism such as adhesion, hook and loop (e.g., Velcro&#x2122;), tight fit, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The indented receiving spaces and inserts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are shown with a shape of an octagon. However, the intended receiving space and corresponding insert may be of any shape and size. For example, an indented receiving space and corresponding insert may have a shape with multiple sides, for example, a square shape, an octagon shape, a triangle shape, etc. Or the insert may have a substantially round shape, or another shape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The insert may be made of metal, plastic, or any suitable material. The insert may include engraving, prints, decals, and other suitable marking on at least one of its surfaces.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some exemplary applications, a user may remove an insert from the lid of a box and interchange it with another insert with similar shape and size.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the recess or indented receiving space may have a depth substantially equal to the thickness of the corresponding interchangeable insert. In these embodiments, when the insert is inserted or installed into the indented receiving space, the top surface of the insert is flush with the top edge of the lid. In some embodiments, the recess or indented receiving space may not have a depth equal to the thickness of the corresponding interchangeable insert.

In this example, because the inserts <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> have the same size and shape, and the indented receiving shapes of boxes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> also have the same size and shape, the inserts <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> are interchangeable with either box <b>102</b> or <b>104</b>.

If a certain feature, element, component, function, or step is described with respect to only one embodiment, then it should be understood that that feature, element, component, function, or step can be used with every other embodiment described herein unless explicitly stated otherwise. This paragraph therefore serves as antecedent basis and written support for the introduction of claims, at any time, that combine features, elements, components, functions, and steps from different embodiments, or that substitute features, elements, components, functions, and steps from one embodiment with those of another, even if the following description does not explicitly state, in a particular instance, that such combinations or substitutions are possible.

Furthermore, any features, functions, steps, or elements of the embodiments may be recited in or added to the claims, as well as negative limitations that define the inventive scope of the claims by features, functions, steps, or elements that are not within that scope.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, as such may, of course, vary.
