Rather, they are merely examples of devices and methods that are consistent with some aspects of this disclosure as detailed in the attached claims.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method for information interaction in a live broadcast room provided in this disclosure can be applied to the application environment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, including a first terminal, a second terminal and a server. The first terminal and the second terminal are respectively terminals corresponding to user accounts playing different roles in the live broadcast room. For example, the first terminal is the terminal corresponding to the audience of the live broadcast room, and there may be multiple first terminals. The audience can enter the live broadcast room of the anchor through the first terminal, to watch or play a screen corresponding to the live broadcast room (the terminal corresponding to the audience is also known as &#x201c;audience terminal&#x201d;). The second terminal is the terminal corresponding to the anchor in the live broadcast room, through which the anchor can create the live broadcast room and broadcast live (the terminal corresponding to the anchor is also called &#x201c;anchor terminal&#x201d;). The server may be used as the server of the live broadcast room to exchange information with the first terminal and the second terminal, which is used to realize the data stream synchronization between the anchor terminal and the audience terminal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this disclosure, the first terminal and the second terminal may be electronic devices with built-in live broadcast function, which may be but not limited to a variety of personal computers, laptops, smart phones and tablet computers. The server may be but is not limited to an independent server or a server cluster composed of multiple servers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for information interaction in a live broadcast room according to an embodiment of the disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method is applied to the first terminal (i.e., the audience terminal of the live broadcast room) as an example, and includes following operations <b>210</b>-<b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>210</b>, a repurchase request initiated against a target resource in historical order information is received. An order corresponding to the target resource is generated based on the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this disclosure, the historical order information may be viewed on an order details page of a shopping platform or through a preset order entrance of the live broadcast room. The historical order information developed based on the order details page of the shopping platform contains multiple order information of a user in the past. The generation channels of orders may be diversified, for example, some orders are generated by placing orders in the live broadcast room, while others are generated by placing orders in other ways. The historical order information based on the live broadcast room mainly refers to the order information associated with the live broadcast room, such as the order information placed through the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, a corresponding operation control is displayed in a play interface as the order entrance, and the historical order information may be expanded based on the live broadcast room as follows. In a play state of the live broadcast room, a trigger operation for the preset order entrance in the play interface of the live broadcast is received, and in response to the trigger operation, the historical order information of the current user account is obtained, in which the historical order information is order information associated with the live broadcast room, and then the historical order information is displayed in the play interface of the live broadcast room. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the most on the left side is the play interface of the live broadcast room, preset with the operation control <b>310</b> as the order entrance. The user clicks the operation control <b>310</b>, and an order information window <b>320</b> is displayed, as shown in the middle figure (b). In the order information window <b>320</b>, the historical order information placed by the user in the past through the live broadcast room may be viewed, and the user can initiate the repurchase request for each resource in the order information window <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The target resource in this disclosure is the resource purchased through the live broadcast room. Therefore, the historical order information expanded through the above means contains at least one resource purchased through the live broadcast room, which may be the resource placed and purchased, or the resource placed but not purchased.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one example, a page/window for historical order information is opened in the same way as described above, where the corresponding repurchase entrance control is provided for resources purchased through the live broadcast room. The repurchase request for the target resource may be initiated in the following ways: displaying the historical order information, which contains at least one resource purchased through the live broadcast room; receiving the trigger operation on the repurchase entrance control corresponding to the target resource in the historical order information, to generate the repurchase request initiated against the target resource. The repurchase entrance control may be displayed in the historical order information in an explicit way or a hidden way. The explicit way refers to displaying a button for repurchase at a corresponding position of the target resource in the order information display page, as the repurchase request control, and the user can trigger the button to initiate the repurchase request for the target resource. The hidden way refers to that, the in the order information display page, when the user clicks the order information corresponding to the target resource, a button for repurchase is displayed on the order information corresponding to the target resource, and the user can trigger the button to initiate the repurchase request for the target resource.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the one figure a on the left side is the history order page expanded based on the shopping platform, which contains order information of multiple resources, including at least one resource order <b>40</b> placed through the live broadcast room. A repurchase button <b>410</b> is provided below the resource order <b>40</b>. The user can initiate the repurchase request for resource <b>2</b> in the resource order <b>40</b> by clicking on the repurchase button <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As another example, as shown in figure B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a repurchase button <b>330</b> is provided in the order information window <b>320</b>. The user can initiate the repurchase request for corresponding resource <b>2</b> by clicking the repurchase button corresponding to resource <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>220</b>, in response to the repurchase request, when the live broadcast room corresponding to the order of the target resource is in a live state, a live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room is played, and repurchase request information corresponding to the target resource in displayed in a play interface.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this disclosure, in response to the repurchase request, the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource, that is, the live broadcast room corresponding to the order of the target resource, can be obtained based on the order information, and the current status information of the live broadcast room can be further obtained. For example, the user links to the purchase page of resource A through the live broadcast room of anchor A and places an order for resource A, from which the historical order information of resource A can be obtained. When the user initiates the repurchase request based on resource A in the historical order information, the live broadcast room corresponding to resource A can be obtained as the live broadcast room of anchor A. If anchor A corresponds to multiple live broadcast rooms, and different live broadcast rooms correspond to different live broadcast room identifiers, then which live broadcast room of anchor A corresponding to resource A can be determined according to the live broadcast room identifiers in the historical order information of resource A.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With above embodiments of the disclosure, for the target resource in historical order information, the user can quickly determine the live broadcast room through which the target resource is purchased in the past, and enter the live broadcast room, through the play interface of which displays the repurchase request information of the corresponding resource. Therefore, it is beneficial to improve the repurchase efficiency of historical broadcast resources in the live broadcast room by initiatively asking the anchor of the live broadcast room for the broadcast starting information of the corresponding resource.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, if the historical order information displayed in the above is the historical order information viewed through the order details page of the shopping platform, then the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource can be determined based on the order information of the target resource. The live broadcast room may be currently in a live state, or in a non-live state. If it is in the live state, it is possible to jump to the play interface of the corresponding live broadcast room from the previous historical order information display page. As an example, repurchasable resources in the history order have repurchase controls used to initiate repurchase requests. The repurchasable resources refer to those purchased through the live broadcast room. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the one picture a on the left side of which is the history order page displayed through the shopping platform, after the user triggers the repurchase control <b>410</b> corresponding to the resource order <b>40</b> to initiate the repurchase request for resource <b>2</b> in the resource order <b>40</b>, the corresponding live broadcast room with the room number <b>0001</b> is determined according to the order information of the resource order <b>40</b>, and when the live broadcast room is currently live, the play interface of the live broadcast room with the room number <b>0001</b> is switched to from the history order page, and the repurchase request information for the corresponding resource <b>2</b> is displayed in the play interface.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other embodiments, if the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource is currently in the live state, a confirmation window may be provided first, for the user to confirm whether to enter the live broadcast room now. After the user confirms to enter the live broadcast room, the play interface of the live broadcast room is jumped to from the previously described historical order information display page, and the live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room is played.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this case, when the user initiates the repurchase request for the resource purchased through the live broadcast room, it is generally that the corresponding resource is not available in the online store, or the price of the corresponding resource is higher than before, and the user hopes to repurchase the resource in the same live broadcast room based on the consideration of interests and the trust on the specific live broadcast room. Through the above example, the user does not need to find the corresponding live broadcast room and enter, especially when the user does not pay attention to the live broadcast room, which significantly improves the efficiency of entering the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another example, if the historical order information is the historical order information viewed by the user through the order entrance of the live broadcast room which is in the live state now, then after the user initiates the repurchase request for the target resource in the historical order information, the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource, that is, the live broadcast room which is currently live, can be determined, and in this case, the display window of historical order information can be closed, and the live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room can be returned to play, and the repurchase request information corresponding to the target resource can be displayed in the play interface (as shown in figure C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the order information window <b>320</b>, the user clicks on the repurchase button <b>330</b> corresponding to the resource order, to initiate the repurchase request for the resource <b>2</b> in the order, the live broadcast room corresponding to which order is the live broadcast room which is currently being played, and then the order information window <b>320</b> is closed from the play interface of the live broadcast room, and the live broadcast screen of the current live broadcast room is continued to be played. The play interface is shown in figure c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and the repurchase request information for resource <b>2</b> is displayed in the play interface. In this case, there is no need for the user to search for the historical order information placed through a live broadcast room among numerous historical order information, which is beneficial to improve the efficiency of repurchasing the historical broadcast resources of the live broadcast room concerned by users.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an example embodiment, the audience account initiates the repurchase application for the target resource, plays the live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room in the audience terminal, and displays the repurchase request information corresponding to the target resource in the play interface. After that, the method further includes: obtaining response information of an anchor account of the live broadcast room to the repurchase request, and displaying the response information in the play interface.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, after the user initiates the repurchase request for the target resource in the historical order information and enters the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource, the repurchase request information for the target resource can be seen at all play sides of the live broadcast room, in which the repurchase request information may include related information, such as resource information of the target resource and a number of repurchased resources, a number of accounts for repurchase and a repurchase price. The anchor in the live broadcast room can also receive the repurchase request information of the target resource, and can accept or ignore the repurchase request information in response. Acceptance response refers to that the anchor accepts the repurchase request for the target resource and makes a response about when the target resource will be broadcast again in the live broadcast room. Ignoring response refers to that the anchor has no broadcast plan for the target resource now. When the anchor makes the acceptance response or the ignoring response, the audience terminal in the live broadcast room can display the response made by the anchor, so that the audience in the live broadcast room can timely grasp the repurchase request result of the target resource.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, after the audience terminal obtains the response information of the anchor account to the repurchase request for the target resource, the method further includes cancelling the display of the repurchase request information of the target resource in the play interface of the terminal. That is, after the anchor responds to the repurchase request for the target resources initiated by the audience account, there is no need for the audience terminal in the live broadcast room to continue to display the repurchase information corresponding to the target resources, so the corresponding repurchase request information will no longer be displayed, to reduce the interference to the audience watching the live broadcast in the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, after the audience terminal obtains the response information of the anchor account of the live broadcast room to the repurchase request for the target resource, the method further includes: if the received response information is the acceptance response, obtaining a broadcast starting time set by the anchor terminal for the target resource, and displaying the broadcast starting time in the play interface.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With this embodiment, if the anchor of the live broadcast room makes the acceptance response to the repurchase request for the target resource, the audiences of the live broadcast room are generally notified of the starting time of next broadcast for the target resource (i.e., the broadcast starting time of the target resource). The anchor terminal can synchronize the acceptance response information and the set broadcast starting time to the audience terminal of the live broadcast room, which is convenient for the audience terminal to enter the live broadcast room in time to repurchase the target resource at the broadcast starting time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, after the audience terminal receives the broadcast starting time from the anchor terminal, the user can also set an appointment reminder for the broadcast starting time of the resource, so as to remind the user of the audience terminal to enter the live broadcast room for repurchase in time before the broadcast starting time of the target resource.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With the above embodiments of the disclosure, after the user initiates the repurchase request for the target resource in the historical order information, and enters the play interface of the corresponding live broadcast room, the repurchase information of the target resource can be seen on the play interfaces of all audiences in the live broadcast room. The audience may also have the need to buy the same target resource, and for the convenience of the audience to initiate the repurchase request for the target resource to the anchor, in an embodiment, the repurchase request information of the target resource displayed in the play interface of the audience terminal can be configured as interactive information, and the audience account performs interaction operation based on the repurchase request information, which is convenient to initiate the repurchase request for the target resource. As an implementation, in the repurchase request information displayed in the play interface of the live broadcast room, an operational control (such as &#x201c;attend&#x201d; button as shown in figure c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, as well &#x201c;participation&#x201d; button as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> <i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) are included, and the audience can conveniently initiate the repurchase request for the target resource by clicking on the operational control. Of course, the user can also initiate the repurchase request for the target resource from historical order information in the aforementioned way.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A backend server of the live broadcast room can count a number of repurchase accounts initiating the repurchase request for the target resource in real time. The counted number of repurchase accounts can include a number of a first kind of accounts that initiate repurchase requests based on the repurchase request information of the target resource displayed in the play interface, and can also include a number of a second kind of accounts that initiate repurchase requests based on the target resource in the historical order information. The first kind of accounts do not include any of the second kind of accounts to avoid double counting. After the number of repurchase accounts is counted, the information of the number of repurchase accounts can be synchronized to the anchor in the live broadcast room, so that the anchor can understand the demand of repurchases for the target resource and make decisions on whether to arrange the next broadcast for the target resource. The backend server of the live broadcast room can also synchronize the counted number of repurchase accounts to the audiences of the live broadcast room, so that the audiences can know the number of repurchase participants of the target resource and improve their attention to the target resource.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, in an embodiment, after the audience terminal plays the live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room and displays the repurchase request information corresponding to the target resource in the play interface, the method further includes: obtaining the number of repurchase accounts corresponding to the target resource, in which the number of repurchase accounts includes a number of audiences that initiate repurchase requests based on interactive operation on the repurchase request information displayed in the play interface (i.e., the number of the first kind of accounts) and a number of the second kind of accounts that initiate repurchase requests based on the target resource in the historical order information, wherein the first kind of accounts do not include any of the second kind of accounts to avoid repeat counting; and displaying the number of repurchase accounts corresponding to the target resource in the play interface.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">After the audience terminal obtains the number of repurchase accounts corresponding to the target resource from the server, when the number of repurchase accounts is inconsistent with the number of repurchase accounts obtained last time, the repurchase request information of the target resource displayed in the play interface is updated. When the number of repurchase accounts obtained this time is consistent with the number of repurchase accounts obtained in the previous time, the corresponding repurchase request information will not be updated. Thus, it is convenient for the anchor and audiences in the live broadcast rooms to know which resources have higher calls, which is conducive to improving the repurchase rate of corresponding resources.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, displaying the number of repurchase accounts corresponding to the target resource in the play interface includes: displaying a bullet screen corresponding to the target resource in the play interface, wherein the bullet screen includes information of the target resource and a participation control. The participation control is configured to initiate the repurchase request for the target resource when triggered. That is, the repurchase request information of the target resource is displayed in the way of bullet screen in the live broadcast room. Further, also in the bullet screen, the number of repurchase accounts for the target resource may be displayed. As an example, in the right area of the bullet screen, change information of the number of repurchase accounts for the target resource is dynamically displayed, for example, +1, +5, +10, which correspondingly shows that for the target resource, the number of accounts participating in repurchase increases by 1, 5 and 10.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the display style and display duration of bullet screen can be dynamically changed according to the time priority of the repurchase request for the target resource and the number of repurchase accounts. For example, when the repurchase request for the target resource is just initiated, the corresponding bullet-screen information can stay in the live broadcast interface for a longer time, or appear more frequently in the live broadcast interface, so that the anchor and/or the audience can see the bullet-screen information. As another example, when more audiences click the participation button in the bullet screen, the number of people involved in the repurchase for the target resource increases, and the bullet-screen information corresponding to the target resource can stay in the live broadcast interface for a longer time, or appear in the live broadcast interface more frequently, so that the anchor and/or the audience know what resources have high popularity.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an embodiment, after the audience terminal of the live broadcast room obtains the live broadcast room corresponding to the target resource, the method further includes: obtaining the current state of the live broadcast room; if the current state is the non-live state, displaying the broadcast reservation entrance corresponding to the live broadcast room, and receiving the broadcast reminder time configured through the broadcast reservation entrance; and outputting a reminder message to remind entering the live broadcast room at the arrival of the broadcast reminder time.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As stated in the foregoing, the historical order information may be the historical order information viewed by the user through the order details page. For the repurchase request for the target resource initiated based on the display page of the historical order information, the corresponding live broadcast room is determined based on the order information of the target resource, which currently may be in the live state, or may be in the non-live state. If the live broadcast room is in the non-live state, the broadcast time information set by the anchor account of the live broadcast room can be obtained, and the broadcast time information can be output on the page of initiating the repurchase request. In addition, to prevent the user from missing the starting time of the live broadcast room, a broadcast remind function may be provided, based on which function, the user can set the broadcast reminder time according to the broadcast starting time set by the anchor for the live broadcast room, in which the broadcast reminder time may be set as 5 minutes, 10 minutes before the broadcast starting time, or equal to the broadcast starting time. At the arrival of the broadcast reminder time, the terminal outputs corresponding reminder information, which may be the notification message of the live broadcast terminal, short message reminder or audio reminder output based on the reserved contact phone of the user, so that the users who apply for repurchase can enter the live broadcast room in time and improve the repurchase rate of resources.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a more detailed flow chart of a method for information interaction in a live broadcast room according to an exemplary embodiment.

After receiving the status information, the first audience terminal can output a prompt message, such as: the anchor is not live broadcasting now, please initiate again later. In other embodiments, the server can also obtain the broadcast starting time of the live broadcast room, and return the broadcast starting time to the first audience terminal. The first audience terminal can provide a broadcast reservation entrance for the live broadcast room to the first user, to receive the broadcast reminder time configured by the first user through the broadcast reservation entrance, and output the reminder message at the arrival of the broadcast reminder time, to remind entering the live broadcast room or initiating the repurchase for the target resource X again.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At <b>506</b>, the first audience terminal obtains the live streaming data of the live broadcast room of anchor account W, plays the live broadcast screen of the live broadcast room of anchor account W, and displays the repurchase request information of target resource X in the play interface. In the live broadcast room of the anchor account W watched by the second audience terminal, the repurchase request information for target resource X also appears.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As an example, the live broadcast rooms of the first audience terminal and the second audience terminal can display the bullet screen of the repurchase request information for the target resource X. The bullet screen may include resource information of the target resource X, such as the resource size, price, and name, and may include repurchase data for target resource X at the preset stage, such as the number of repurchase requests and the number of repurchase accounts.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the bullet screen may also contain a &#x201c;participate&#x201d; button. The audience can click the button to participate in the repurchase request for target resource X.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At <b>507</b>, the second user clicks the &#x201c;participate&#x201d; button in the bullet screen of the target resource X through the second audience terminal, participates in the repurchase of target resource X, and sends the participation information of the second user to the server.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Other audiences in the live broadcast room of anchor account W can not only enter the order list of the live broadcast room to initiate the repurchase for target resource X, but can also click the bullet screen of target resource X that has appeared in the live broadcast room and click the &#x201c;participate&#x201d; button to participate in the repurchase of target resource X. No matter how the account participates in the repurchase of target resource X, the server can count it into the number of repurchase accounts of target resource X. However, the account that participates in the repurchase of target resource X in different ways will not be counted repeatedly.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At <b>508</b>, the server synchronizes the number of people repurchasing target resource X to the audience terminal and anchor terminal in the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, the audience terminal of the live broadcast room can further display the number of the repurchase accounts for the target resource X. For example, when it is detected that the number of repurchase accounts changes, in the right area of the bullet screen, the change information of the number of repurchase accounts is dynamically displayed, such as +1, +10, which correspondingly shows that for the target resource, the number of people participating in repurchase increases by 1 and 10.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">At <b>509</b>, the anchor terminal, based on the current number of repurchase accounts for the target resource X, determines whether the display threshold preset by anchor W is reached. If so, the anchor terminal displays the repurchase request information of target resource X, which may include the number of repurchase accounts, resource information and quantity of repurchased resources, etc.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, in order to prevent part of the audience users in the live broadcast room from inciting others, or prevent the live broadcast of the anchor from being affected by too much repurchase request information, the bullet screen of the target resource can appear in the anchor terminal only when the repurchase request information of the target resource satisfies a condition preset by the anchor account (i.e., the anchor can set the repurchase notification threshold in advance). When the repurchase request information of the target resource meets the condition set by the anchor, the anchor terminal can display the repurchase request notice of the target resource. The repurchase notification threshold set by the anchor may be the number of repurchase users, the price value of resource or the number of times of historical broadcasting of the resource.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>510</b>, in the anchor terminal, the anchor makes a response to the repurchase request information corresponding to target resource X. For example, anchor W selects [reply] and sets the starting time of the next broadcast for target resource X. The anchor terminal synchronizes the response information to the audience terminal in the live broadcast room of anchor W. The anchor terminal sends the response information of the anchor to the server.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, when the anchor terminal displays the repurchase request information corresponding to the target resource X, it also provides the response operation entrance to the anchor, for example, the response operation control [reply] and the response operation control [ignore] are included. The anchor can make the response through the control operation of [reply] and [ignore].</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">When anchor W clicks &#x201c;answer&#x201d;, the anchor terminal may provide an inquiry window to ask anchor W whether repurchase for target resource X can be performed in this live broadcast, or to give the broadcast starting time of target resource X.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In an embodiment, no matter anchor W clicks [reply] or [ignore], the repurchase request channel of target resource X will be closed this time, including no longer displaying the repurchase request information of target resource X in the current live broadcast room of the anchor terminal. In addition, the users associated with the live broadcast room of anchor W (such as, users paying attention to the live broadcast room of anchor W, users who are currently watching the live broadcast room of anchor W) can receive corresponding notice, so that when the user associated with the live broadcast room initiates the repurchase request for target resource X again later, it is possible to prompt the user based on the response information of the anchor W, such as: the anchor of this resource has arranged to broadcast again at *** time, or the anchor of this resource has rejected the repurchase request. Through this embodiment, the interference of repurchase request information to anchor can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, in an embodiment, the background server can determine whether anchor W is willing to use the resource repurchase function according to the response information of anchor W. If anchor W chooses to ignore the resource repurchase request initiated by users for a long time, anchor W can be reminded to close the resource repurchase function when anchor W starts broadcasting. After that, the anchor terminal of anchor W will no longer display user's repurchase request information, and the associated users of the live broadcast room can no longer initiate repurchase requests related to the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">At <b>511</b>, the server synchronizes the response information of the anchor to the audience terminal of the live broadcast room, and then the response information of anchor W to the repurchase request for target resource X will be displayed in the live broadcast room of anchor W played by the first audience terminal and the second audience terminal. If the response made by anchor is to accept the repurchase request, the broadcast starting time set by the anchor for target resource X can also be displayed in the live broadcast room of the first audience terminal and the second audience terminal.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the broadcast starting time for the target resource X is clear, the server can synchronize the response information to the audience terminals of the live broadcast room of anchor W, guide the audience user of the live broadcast room to set repurchase reminder. If the audience user successfully set the repurchase reminder, then when the broadcast starting time arrives and the anchor starts to broadcast, the server notifies the user of the audience terminal to enter the live broadcast room for repurchase through push, IM or short message.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">With the above embodiments, the first user and the second user can initiatively send the repurchase request for the target resource X to the anchor, and the server can count repurchase request data in the data statistical dimension of resources or live broadcast rooms, and can also synchronize the counted repurchase request data to the anchor, so that the anchor can more timely know the users' repurchase demand of resources, and based on which, can make better decisions about which resources to broadcast in the live broadcast room.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, if the user successfully repurchases target resource X through the live broadcast room of anchor W, the server can count successful repurchase data in the data statistical granularity of resources or live broadcast rooms. In addition, the relevant statistical data can be synchronized to anchor W, and the number of successful repurchase of each resource and information of repurchase resource can also be learned from anchor W.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">It could be understood that the server can adjust the data statistical dimension according to specific scenarios, so as to provide more meaningful data for the audience users of the live broadcast room and the anchor.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method for information interaction in a live broadcast room according to an example embodiment, taking the side of the second terminal (i.e. the anchor terminal in the live broadcast room) as an example to illustrate.
