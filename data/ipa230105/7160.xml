As those skilled in the art would recognize, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The dynamic range of an imaging device may be defined as a ratio between the brightest and darkest image irradiance that the device is capable of measuring. In general terms, the dynamic range of human vision is on the order of 4,000 times greater than the dynamic range of a conventional imaging device. Due to the limited dynamic range, images taken by the imaging device of high-contrast scenes may contain regions with overexposed or underexposed pixels, and fail to convey the true image irradiance in these regions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Current art mechanisms exist for increasing the dynamic range of an image. Such mechanisms may include capturing multiple images at different exposures at different times (time multiplexing) or using different imaging devices (imager multiplexing) and merging the multiple exposures to generate a higher dynamic range image. The exposure settings of a camera generally include three components: aperture or f-stop (e.g., the size of an aperture permitting light to enter the camera); shutter speed or exposure time (e.g., the length of time that an image sensor is exposed to light); and gain or ISO (e.g., the magnitude of amplification applied to the signal detected by the image sensor). In the case of time multiplexing, different images are captured at different times (e.g., sequentially) and therefore these techniques may can generally be used only with static scenes, as the images may depict motion blur for any objects that move in the scene and/or moving objects may be in different locations in the different images. In addition, capturing multiple exposures using different aperture settings can also cause the appearance of different depths of field, resulting in some parts of the scene showing different levels of focus blur between different exposures. Yet another deficiency may be that capturing multiple exposures with different gain (ISO) settings may cause differences in sensor noise levels between the different exposures.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for capturing a high dynamic range (HDR) image with a single shot (e.g., a single exposure) and systems and methods for adjusting the camera parameters in real time according to the scene properties such that the dynamic range of the camera matches the radiance range of the scene. This is useful in various environments where the radiance range of lighting conditions may be large and may constantly be varying over time. For example, in various manufacturing applications, lighting conditions may change due to shadows cast by objects moving in front of light sources, changes in ambient light due to the movement or usage of machinery or manufacturing (e.g., light from arc welders, reflections from moving metal parts, etc.). Capturing high dynamic range images of a scene enables computer vision systems deployed in these environments to capture more detail, thereby improving the performance of these computer vision systems in performing vision tasks such as object detection, defect detection, object pose detection, object picking, and the like. Embodiments of the present disclosure are also applicable in other imaging contexts, such as capturing HDR images for computer vision tasks in outdoor environments with rapidly changing lighting conditions (e.g., barcode scanning, box scanning, and the like), HDR images for self-driving vehicles encountering high dynamic range scenes (e.g., scenes where part of the street is shaded and part of the street is in direct sunlight), capturing HDR images in hobbyist photography (e.g., imaging a subject in the shade while also capturing the sky on a sunny day or imaging the moon and the stars in a single shot), and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram depicting an imaging system <b>10</b> including crossed polarizers according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, an imaging system (e.g., a camera) includes a processing circuit or controller <b>12</b> and a camera matrix or image sensor <b>14</b> (e.g., an image sensor such as a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) digital image sensor or a charge coupled device (CCD) digital image sensor) having a plurality of light sensitive elements referred to herein as subpixels. The controller <b>12</b> may include a processor and memory storing instructions that configure the processor to perform functions to operate the imaging system. For example, the controller <b>12</b> may include or be implemented in a central processing unit (CPU), an application processor (AP) of a mobile device such as a smartphone, a field programmable gate array (FPGA), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an image signal processor (ISP), a digital signal processor (DSP), and the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each subpixel of the camera matrix or image sensor <b>14</b> is configured to detect light incident thereon and to output a signal (e.g., an analog voltage) representing the amount of light that was detected over the course of an exposure interval. In some embodiments, four adjacent subpixels (e.g., a 2&#xd7;2 array of subpixels) will be referred to as a pixel <b>15</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an expanded view of a pixel <b>15</b> including four subpixels <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, and <b>15</b><i>d</i>. The controller <b>12</b> may include or be coupled to read-out circuitry configured to read the signals that were output by the subpixels to capture image data (e.g., digital values) representing the amount of light that was detected by the subpixels during the exposure interval.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a micropolarizer mask or polarizer mask <b>16</b> is located in front of the image sensor, where the polarizer mask <b>16</b> has a repeating pattern of polarizer filters at different angles. In this embodiment, the polarizer filters are aligned with corresponding ones of the subpixels (e.g., there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the polarizer filters and the subpixels, where each polarizer filter is aligned with one corresponding subpixel). In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the polarizer mask <b>16</b> includes a repeating pattern of 2&#xd7;2 cells or blocks <b>17</b> of four polarizer filters <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b</i>, <b>17</b><i>c</i>, and <b>17</b><i>d </i>(e.g., having corresponding polarizing filter angles of 0&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0; and 135&#xb0;, where four subpixels making up a single block or cell <b>17</b> are shaded and also shown in expanded view) that are located in front of corresponding 2&#xd7;2 group of adjacent subpixels <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, and <b>15</b><i>d </i>of a pixel <b>15</b> (where one group or cell of subpixels making up a pixel <b>15</b> are shaded and also shown in expanded view).

This is similar to the red, green, and blue channels of a color camera, where the red channel is an image representing the amounts of light detected by the subpixels that are behind red color filters, the blue channel is an image representing the amounts of light detected by the subpixels that are behind blue color filters, and the green channel is an image representing the amounts of light detected by the subpixels that are behind green color filters.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0061">As such, changing the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> causes non-linear changes in the attenuation of the radiance of the light by the polarization system (or, equivalently, the transmission of light through the polarization system) through the differently oriented linear polarizers of a block <b>17</b> of fixed linear polarizers of the polarizer mask <b>16</b>, at least because the transmission through the sets of cross polarizers is non-linear with respect to the angle between the polarizers (e.g., is proportional to cost<sup>2 </sup>&#x3b8;, as noted above and depends on the angle of linear polarization and degree of linear polarization of the light). More concretely, as the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> changes its angle &#x3b1; to be closer in angle to the linear polarizer of a particular subpixel, the transmission of light to that subpixel increases.

Likewise, as the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> changes its angle &#x3b1; to be closer in angle to being perpendicular to the linear polarizer of a particular subpixel, then the transmission of light to that subpixel decreases. For example, as the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> decreases from 22.5&#xb0; to 0&#xb0;, the transmission through the fixed linear polarizer filters <b>17</b><i>c </i>having a filter angle at 90&#xb0; decreases, thereby causing the range of the imaging system to expand upward to regions of higher radiance (e.g., to detect light in brighter portions of the scene without overexposure or saturation of the subpixel).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0062">Likewise, adjusting the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> toward more median angles (e.g., increasing the angle &#x3b1; from 0&#xb0; toward 22.5&#xb0;) decreases or contracts the dynamic range of the imaging system, such as by reducing the differences in the degree of attenuation of light by the polarization system at the different subpixels (e.g., the differences in the degrees of attenuation represented in the different polarization channels).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0063">Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure enable the dynamic control of the dynamic range of an imaging system by setting the angle &#x3b1; of linear polarization of a rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> placed in an optical path of an imaging system with a polarization mask <b>16</b> having a mosaic of fixed polarizers at different angles of polarization.

Likewise, a pixel is overexposed when all of its subpixels are at or near a maximum of its output range (e.g., at or near 255) or, in other words, the values at that pixel are at or near the maximum across all of the polarization channels. A given pixel is not overexposed or underexposed when at least one of its subpixels (or one of its channels) is neither saturated nor below its noise floor. When at least some pixels in the image are underexposed and at least some pixels are overexposed, then the current dynamic range <b>421</b> of the imaging system <b>10</b> is smaller than the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene being imaged. In some embodiments, the controller <b>12</b> determines whether there are some overexposed and some underexposed pixels when at least some of the pixels are outside of set thresholds (e.g., a lower threshold at or near a value of 0 and an upper threshold at or near a value of 255, in the case of 8-bit values).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0067">As such, in this circumstance, in operation <b>350</b> the controller <b>12</b> increases the range of the imaging system by rotating the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> (e.g., decreasing the angle &#x3b1; from 22.5&#xb0; toward 0&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0068">The controller then returns to operation <b>310</b> to capture another image with the imaging system <b>10</b> configured to an adjusted range, as set by the new angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b>. Accordingly, some aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure relate to iteratively adjusting the angle of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> and therefore adjusting the dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> based on the dynamic range of the scene being imaged until the dynamic range of the imaging system is equal to or larger than the dynamic range of the radiance of the scene (e.g., when an image captured based on the adjusted dynamic range does not include any underexposed pixels and does not include any overexposed pixels).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0069">In some embodiments, in operation <b>350</b>, the controller <b>12</b> determines the size of the adjustment &#x394;&#x3b1; to the polarizer angle &#x3b1; in accordance with a function, such as by dividing the current angle &#x3b1; by two toward an angle of closer alignment with one of the fixed polarizer filters (e.g., the polarizer filters <b>17</b><i>a </i>at angle 0&#xb0;) of the polarizer mask <b>16</b>. For example, when starting at a smallest dynamic range with the angle s at 22.5&#xb0;, increasing the dynamic range by dividing the angle &#x3b1; by 2 to a new angle of 12.25&#xb0;, dividing the angle again by two at a later iteration to 6.125&#xb0;, and the like. As another example, in some embodiments the controller <b>12</b> controls the polarizer angle based on a function based on the number of underexposed and overexposed pixels in the current image (e.g., &#x394;&#x3b1; may be larger when there is a larger number of overexposed pixels and underexposed pixels) or may be based on fixed angle changes (e.g., a step change of 2.25&#xb0;). In some circumstances, the dynamic range of the scene may be larger than the maximum possible dynamic range of the imaging system (e.g., as constrained by the extinction ratio of the polarization system), in which case an image may be captured with some underexposed pixels and some overexposed pixels at the maximum dynamic range setting (e.g., with the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> at an angle &#x3b1; of 0&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graph showing range of a scene to a dynamic range of the imaging system after adjusting the rotatable polarizer according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, adjusting the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> expands the dynamic range <b>423</b> of the imaging system <b>10</b> such that it is sufficiently large to encompass the full dynamic range of the radiance I <b>410</b> of the scene being imaged. In particular, increasing the dynamic range <b>423</b> of the imaging system <b>10</b> increases the attenuation of light at subpixels that have larger differences in angle between their corresponding fixed polarizer filters <b>17</b> and the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b>, thereby enabling measurements without saturation of the sensor at pixels (or image locations) with high scene radiance I and also decreases the attenuation of light at subpixels that have smaller differences in angle between their corresponding fixed polarizer filters <b>17</b> and the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b>, thereby enabling measurements above the noise floor of the sensor at pixels (or image locations) with low scene radiance I.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0071">In some circumstances, expanding the dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> until there are no underexposed pixels and no overexposed pixels may result in poor exposure settings. Generally, the controller <b>12</b> of an imaging system may automatically adjust its exposure settings (e.g., aperture, shutter speed or exposure time, and sensor gain or ISO) to reduce the number of overexposed and underexposed pixels. For example, when the majority of the pixels of the image are underexposed, an automatic exposure algorithm may gradually increase the exposure settings (e.g., increase the aperture, increase the exposure time, and/or increase the sensor gain) so that most of the pixels are within the dynamic range of the camera. Likewise, when the majority of the pixels are overexposed, the automatic exposure algorithm may gradually decrease the exposure settings. In some circumstances, the automatic exposure algorithm may give different weight to different parts of the image when performing the adjustment, such as weighting pixels based on distance from the center of the image, therefore allowing some overexposed or underexposed pixels at the edges of the image in exchange for better exposure near the center of the image.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0072">Accordingly, in operation <b>370</b>, the controller <b>12</b> may adjust the exposure settings of the imaging system (e.g., controlling the imaging optics <b>20</b> and/or the gain when reading data from the image sensor <b>14</b>) based on the current image (as well as, in some embodiments, additional images captured during the exposure setting adjustment operation). (Note that changing the exposure settings such as the aperture, shutter speed, and gain of an imaging system generally causes the range to shift upward or downward to capture different parts of the total scene radiance, but generally does not cause a change in the size of the dynamic range).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0073">In operation <b>380</b>, the controller <b>12</b> determines whether the current dynamic range of the imaging system matches the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, after adjustment, the dynamic range <b>423</b> of the imaging system <b>10</b> is larger than the dynamic range <b>410</b> of the radiance k of the scene. (This overcompensation may have occurred due to the step size of the changes &#x394;&#x3b1; in the angle a of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> and/or due to ambiguities in the degree to which pixels were overexposed or underexposed, e.g., how much the radiance was above the saturation point and how much the radiance was below the floor) While such an arrangement would be capable of imaging such a scene, some details may be lost during capture due to the mismatch in the range. In particular, fine differences in the radiances of light at two different pixels may fail to be captured by the imaging system because both radiances may be mapped to the same discrete value by the camera response function f as part of the process of converting the analog signals to digital values (e.g., quantization error).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0074">As such, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the controller <b>12</b> detects a mismatch in the current dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> and the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene when the pixels of highest radiance are lower than the maximum detectable radiance of the sensor (e.g., have values below 255 by more than a threshold amount) and/or when the pixels of lowest radiance are higher than a lowest detectable radiance of the sensor (e.g., have values higher than 0 by more than a threshold amount). In such a case, in operation <b>390</b>, the controller <b>12</b> decreases the dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> by adjusting the angle of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a graph comparing the radiance range of a scene to a dynamic range of the imaging system after adjusting the rotatable polarizer and the exposure settings of the imaging system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, after adjusting the angle of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> to decrease the dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b>, the updated dynamic range <b>425</b> matches the dynamic range <b>410</b> of the radiance of the scene, thereby improving the quality of the images captured by the imaging system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0076">In the arrangement shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the initial dynamic range <b>421</b> off the imaging system <b>10</b> was illustrated as being smaller than the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene and between the minimum and maximum radiances of the scene. However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to these particular initial conditions.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0077">For example, in a circumstance where the initial dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> is smaller than the dynamic range of the radiance I <b>410</b> of the scene and the exposure settings cause the initial range of the imaging system to be at or below the lower end or at or above the above upper end of the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene, then the initial captured image may include only underexposed pixels or only overexposed pixels. In such a circumstance, in some embodiments, the controller <b>12</b> adjusts the exposure settings of the imaging system <b>10</b> such that the image includes both overexposed pixels and underexposed pixels prior to beginning adjustment of the range of the imaging system in accordance with the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0078">Similarly, in some circumstances, the initial dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> may be larger than the dynamic range of the radiance I of the scene. This may occur when the imaging system (e.g., a video camera) transitions from imaging a scene with a high dynamic range (e.g., outdoors with deeply shaded regions) to a scene with lower dynamic range (e.g., indoors with artificial lighting). In these circumstances, the controller <b>12</b> may automatically adjust the polarizer angle to decrease range in accordance with operation <b>390</b> in response to detecting a range mismatch in the captured images and the current scene, in accordance with operation <b>380</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0079">As such, after adjusting both the dynamic range of the imaging system <b>10</b> and the exposure settings of the imaging system <b>10</b> to the current dynamic range of the scene, the resulting captured image having a matched range is then output results in capturing an image with multiple polarization channels, where each channel is subject to a different level of attenuation based on the angle &#x3b1; of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b>. The multiple polarization channels can be considered as corresponding to different exposures in a comparative high dynamic range imaging technique. Accordingly, in some embodiments, such as for viewing of the captured high dynamic range image on a standard display device, techniques for combining different exposures (e.g., tone mapping) can be used to combine the different polarization channels to generate an output image having the appearance of a high dynamic range image. In some embodiments, the high dynamic range image is re-mapped into a data format that is capable of representing the full dynamic range (e.g., images having higher bit depth than the bit depth of the captured high dynamic range image). In some embodiments, the high dynamic range image is supplied as input for further processing, such as in the form of input to a computer vision or robotic vision system for controlling a robotic system to interact with (e.g., pick up, place, and/or manipulate) objects in the imaged scene.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0080">Various aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure are described above with respect to a monochrome imaging system, e.g., an imaging system that does not include a color filter such as a Bayer filter in the optical path. However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example, in some embodiments, the optical path further includes a mosaic color filter such that different subpixels may detect light in different portions of the visible spectrum (e.g., red, green, or blue light) and/or portions of the invisible spectrum (e.g., infrared light).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram depicting an imaging system including crossed polarizers and a color filter according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is substantially similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and therefore description of similar parts will not be repeated herein. While an additional color filter is shown as an addition to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto and a color filter may be used in combinations with other systems such as where the positions of the rotatable linear polarizer <b>18</b> and the imaging optics <b>20</b> along the optical axis <b>21</b> are switched. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a color filter <b>500</b> is arranged in the optical path or optical axis <b>21</b> such that each pixel <b>15</b> of four subpixels <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, and <b>15</b><i>d </i>(behind differently oriented linear polarizers <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b</i>, <b>17</b><i>c</i>, <b>17</b><i>d </i>of a cell <b>17</b> of linear polarizers of the polarizer mask <b>16</b>) are arranged behind a single color filter <b>502</b> or separate color filters configured to transmit light of the same color (e.g., green light). In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the color filter <b>500</b> has a mosaic of color filters arranged in a Bayer pattern, where a vertical shading pattern indicates green color filters, a horizontal shading pattern indicates red color filters, and a dot shading pattern indicate blue color filters). As such, in this embodiment, the subpixels of a given pixel <b>15</b> receive light of the same color, and adjacent pixels <b>15</b> (groups of 4 subpixels) detect light of different colors.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the color filter <b>500</b> is configured to have a repeating pattern or mosaic pattern where each color filter corresponds to a different subpixel (e.g., <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d</i>) of the pixels and the polarization mask <b>16</b> is configured to have a repeating pattern of polarizer filters where each polarizer filter corresponds to one pixel <b>15</b> (e.g., where all four subpixels <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d </i>of a pixel are behind a same linear polarizer of the polarization mask and behind different color filters).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">As such, aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for performing high dynamic range imaging of a scene using crossed polarizers. In some embodiments, a polarization mask includes a repeating mosaic of linear polarizers at different orientations (e.g., 0&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, and 135&#xb0;) aligned with different subpixels of an image sensor. A rotatable linear polarizer in the optical path of the imaging system is used to control controlling the angle of polarization of light reaching the polarization mask, thereby causing different relative angles &#x3b8; between the light incident on the polarization mask and the linear polarizers of the polarization mask, thereby resulting in different degrees of attenuation of the light passing through the mask approximately proportional to a cos<sup>2 </sup>&#x3b8; factor. Accordingly, controlling the angle of the rotatable linear polarizer according to some embodiments of the present disclosure controls the overall dynamic range of the imaging system, where greater differences in the degree of attenuation of light incident on different subpixels results in a larger dynamic range of the imaging system and smaller differences in the degree of attenuation of light incident on different subpixels results in a smaller dynamic range of the imaging system.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the liquid crystal polarization rotator includes a matrix of liquid crystal retarders, where individual liquid crystal retarders in the matrix are individually controllable to rotate light within a range of angles (in a manner similar to the pixels of a liquid crystal display).
