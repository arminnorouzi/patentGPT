Scaling to smaller and smaller features enables increased densities of functional units on the limited real estate of semiconductor chips. For example, shrinking transistor size allows for the incorporation of an increased number of memory or logic devices on a chip, leading to the fabrication of products with increased capacity. The pursuit of ever-increasing capacity, however, is not without issue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The scaling of contacts of transistors to improve chip density results in increased contact resistance in transistors with scaled contacts. The increased contact resistance degrades transistor performance. Because conventional approaches do not enable the scaling of contact areas of the transistors without increasing contact resistance, the capacity to scale contacts of transistors to increase density per unit area is limited.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a cross-sectional view of a transistor with planar source and drain contact interfaces and a cross-sectional view of a transistor with &#x201c;wrap around&#x201d; source and drain contact interfaces in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a graph that illustrates the relationship of contact resistance (Rc) to contact length (L) and transfer length (l).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows saturation/linear current (IDSAT/IDLIN) of transistors as a function of contact length.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> are illustrations of cross-sectional views of a process for forming wraparound contacts according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref> are illustrations of cross-sectional views of a process for forming wraparound contacts according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a computing device in accordance with one implementation of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an interposer that includes one or more embodiments of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A wrap around contact for thin film transistors to improve contact resistance is described.

As regards transistor <b>100</b>, the source and drain contacts are formed on the transistor channel, to include planar, horizontal contact interface surfaces. These horizontal contact interface surfaces present challenges related to transistor length/area scaling. For example, as transistors having the contact structure of transistor <b>100</b> are scaled, the length of the horizontal contact area must be kept as large as possible in order to control contact resistance (because of the relationship between contact size and contact resistance), even though the horizontal length of the transistor itself is made smaller. In contrast, as regards the transistor <b>150</b>, the wrap around design of the source contact <b>152</b> and the drain contact <b>154</b>, which includes vertically oriented contact parts, provides a greater contact interface surface area for a horizontal contact dimension of a given length, as compared to that provided by the planar contact interface design of the source contact <b>101</b> and the drain contact <b>105</b> of the transistor <b>100</b>. Thus, in embodiments, using a &#x201c;wrap around&#x201d; contact design, the contact interface surface length/area can be increased or maintained as the horizontal length of the transistor is made smaller.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It should be appreciated that increasing contact interface length without increasing the horizontal footprint of the contact reduces contact resistance and enables transistor scaling. Thus, in embodiments, scaling is enabled because the same contact interface length that is provided in a given horizontal contact dimension by conventional approaches can be provided in a smaller horizontal contact dimension. Consequently, in embodiments, transistors can be scaled to achieve higher chip density without increasing the contact resistance of the transistors and degrading device performance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As such, embodiments overcome the contact scaling limitations of previous approaches (such as that of transistor <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that present a barrier to increasing transistor density per unit area. As described herein, embodiments use the wraparound contact structure (which includes vertical contact areas) to maintain a large contact length (as compared to transfer length) such that continuous scaling of the horizontal source contact and drain contact dimensions can be achieved. Moreover, embodiments provide low-resistance, stable ohmic contacts that improve the performance and reliability of transistors. The wraparound contacts also reduce contact resistance and external resistance (Rext) for back gated geometries. In an embodiment, transistor types to which the described wrap around contact structure can be applied can include but are not limited to top gate, dual gate, tri-gate, gate-all-around and multilayer thin film transistor (TFT) devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In operation, when an appropriate voltage is applied across the source and the drain terminals and a voltage greater than Vth is applied to the back-gate <b>165</b>, the transistor <b>150</b> turns on and current is caused to flow through the channel <b>159</b>. The source contact <b>152</b> and the drain contact <b>154</b>, which have a wrap-around structure as discussed in detail herein, provides a contact interface of reduced resistance that enables current to readily flow in both directions from the source contact <b>152</b> and/or the drain contact <b>154</b> to the source and the drain regions. It should be appreciated that the reduced contact resistance can improve device performance in manners that can include but are not limited to power dissipation and frequency response.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a graph <b>200</b> that illustrates the relationship of Rc to L and transfer length <b>1</b>. Rc is the resistance to the flow of current across the interface of two materials. L is the length of the horizontal dimension of a contact. Transfer length <b>1</b> is the distance over which current conducts through a contact interface. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, graph <b>200</b> shows that Rc decreases to a minimum when L is far greater than 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the contact resistances of several transistors are plotted that have different channel lengths (Lsep) but the same contact length L and gate overlap length Lov. For example, the Lsep of the transistors vary from approximately 0.2 to 40 um. However, the transistors each have a contact length of 250 nm and a gate overlap length Lov of 25 um. The graph shows the ideal value of Rc as being near the Y intercept where Lsep is approximately equal to zero (no channel region separating the source and drain regions). This is the point at which the total resistance is dominated by the contact resistance (as opposed to channel resistance). Likewise, ideal 1 is found at the X intercept (with respect to X=0 where channel resistance is ideally zero), indicating a point at which there would be no resistance. Importantly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the contact length L of 250 nm is much greater than the ideal length of 1. In embodiments, the wraparound source and drain contact approach described herein takes advantage of this relationship, maximizing the L to 1 ratio through use of the wraparound contact structure to ensure that L is much greater than 1 and that Rc is minimized.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows graphs <b>300</b> and <b>350</b> that illustrate the relationship of saturation/linear current (IDSAT/IDLIN) of transistors to contact length (contact CD). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, graph <b>300</b> illustrates that IDSAT is very dependent on the source drain (SD) doping level when contact length is reduced. Likewise, graph <b>350</b> illustrates that IDLIN is very dependent on the SD doping level when contact length is reduced. In particular, the lower the doping level, the lower the IDSAT and IDLIN for that contact length.

Nonplanar transistors include FinFET transistors such as double-gate transistors and tri-gate transistors, and wrap-around or all-around gate transistors such as nanoribbon and nanowire transistors.

The high-k dielectric material may include elements such as hafnium, silicon, oxygen, titanium, tantalum, lanthanum, aluminum, zirconium, barium, strontium, yttrium, lead, scandium, niobium, and zinc. Examples of high-k materials that may be used in the gate dielectric layer include, but are not limited to, hafnium oxide, hafnium silicon oxide, lanthanum oxide, lanthanum aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, zirconium silicon oxide, tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, barium strontium titanium oxide, barium titanium oxide, strontium titanium oxide, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, lead scandium tantalum oxide, and lead zinc niobate.

An annealing process that activates the dopants and causes them to diffuse further into the substrate typically follows the ion implantation process. In the latter process, the substrate may first be etched to form recesses at the locations of the source and drain regions. An epitaxial deposition process may then be carried out to fill the recesses with material that is used to fabricate the source and drain regions. In some implementations, the source and drain regions may be fabricated using a silicon alloy such as silicon germanium or silicon carbide. In some implementations the epitaxially deposited silicon alloy may be doped in situ with dopants such as boron, arsenic, or phosphorous. In further embodiments, the source and drain regions may be formed using one or more alternate semiconductor materials such as germanium or a group III-V material or alloy.
