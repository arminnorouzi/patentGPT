Examples of such water vessels include military watercraft, commercial ships/boats, recreational yachts, as well as other types of boats and water vehicles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior to regular use, operators typically drive such water vessels at varying speeds during initial water vessel break-in periods. An example water vessel break-in period is 10 hours long. Such operation of the water vessels during the water vessel break-in periods may reduce or eliminate any unevenness and/or roughness/imperfection among various stern drive components so that such components then operate smoothly and wear evenly during regular use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, there are deficiencies to the above-described approach of driving water vessels at varying speeds during initial water vessel break-in periods. For example, such an approach consumes extensive resources such as water vessel service time, crew time, vessel preparation and docking resources, and so on. Moreover, if such a water vessel later requires a replacement stern drive, the water vessel must be removed from service while the replacement stern drive is broken in during another water vessel break-in period.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast to the above-described approach of driving water vessels at varying speeds during water vessel break-in periods, improved techniques are directed to utilizing a break-in assembly to break-in a gear box (e.g., stern drive gearing/linkage) prior to deployment of the gear box in the field. Along these lines, such a gear box may eventually form part of a stern drive of a water vessel. However, rather than perform break-in of the gear box while the gear box is on the water vessel, the gear box may be installed on the break-in assembly where a drive apparatus drives the gear box and a loading apparatus simultaneously applies load to the gear box in order to operate (or exercise) the gear box in accordance with a predefined break-in schedule. Such a break-in assembly may include a water tank within which at least a portion of the gear box operates in order to receive regular water cooling from water within the water tank. Such processing via the break-in assembly enables the gear box to be broken in prior to installation on a water vessel thus minimizing consumption of other water vessel resources (e.g., water vessel service time, crew time, etc.).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment is directed to a method of operating a gear box. The method includes installing the gear box on a break-in assembly, breaking in the gear box during a gear box break-in period while the gear box is installed on the break-in assembly and, after the gear box break-in period, removing the gear box from the break-in assembly (e.g., for subsequent installation on a water vessel).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment is directed to a break-in assembly to break-in a gear box. The break-in assembly includes a gear box support constructed and arranged to support the gear box. The break-in assembly further includes a drive apparatus coupled with the gear box support, the drive apparatus being constructed and arranged to drive the gear box while the gear box is supported by the gear box support. The break-in assembly further includes a loading apparatus disposed in a fixed position relative to the gear box support, the loading apparatus being constructed and arranged to apply loading to the gear box while the drive apparatus drives the gear box.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some arrangements, the drive apparatus includes an electric motor constructed and arranged to operate the gear box, and a controller coupled with the electric motor. The controller is constructed and arranged to direct the electric motor to operate the gear box at varying speeds during a gear box break-in period.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some arrangements, the controller includes memory, and control circuitry coupled with the memory. The memory stores a break-in schedule which causes the control circuitry to direct the electric motor to vary rotational speed of an input shaft of the gear box in accordance with a predefined engine curve during the gear box break-in period.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some arrangements, the loading apparatus includes a set of dynamometers constructed and arranged to apply the loading to the gear box while the drive apparatus drives the gear box. Such a set of dynamometers may include one or more dynamometers and/or dynamometer related componentry (e.g., ancillary hardware to connect each dynamometer to the gear box and/or support dynamometer operation).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some arrangements, the gear box includes a propeller shaft configured to spin a propeller. Additionally, the set of dynamometers includes a water brake dynamometer constructed and arranged to couple with the propeller shaft of the gear box to provide load to the propeller shaft.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some arrangements, the gear box includes a first propeller shaft, a second propeller shaft, and linkage configured to simultaneously spin the first propeller shaft and the second propeller shaft in opposite directions.

For example, each dynamometer may have an elongated axle and such axles are arranged to parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">In some arrangements, the break-in assembly further includes a water tank adjacent the gear box support. The water tank is constructed and arranged to contain water that provides cooling to the gear box while the drive apparatus drives the gear box.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">In some arrangements, the gear box support is constructed and arranged to position at least a portion of the gear box within the water tank to enable water contained within the water tank to provide cooling to the gear box while the drive apparatus drives the gear box.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In some arrangements, the loading apparatus is constructed and arranged to mechanically engage with the portion of the gear box positioned within the water tank. For example, when installing the gear box on the break-in apparatus, the portion of the gear box may be connected to the loading apparatus, and the water tank is then filled with water to submerge the portion of the gear box connected to the loading apparatus within the water.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">In some arrangements, once the gear box is installed on the break-in assembly, the assembly simultaneously drives the gear box using the drive apparatus and applies the loading to the gear box from the loading apparatus.

Such operation may be in accordance with a computerized break-in schedule.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In some arrangements, the method of operating the gear box further includes, after the gear box is removed from the break-in assembly, interconnecting the gear box between an engine and a set of propellers of a water craft, and providing drive from the engine to the set of propellers through the gear box to provide propulsion to the water craft.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">Other embodiments are directed to apparatus, devices, assemblies, and so on.

For example, such a break-in schedule <b>140</b> may dictate gradually increasing and decreasing the rotational speed of the gear box <b>110</b> between lower and upper limits of a range over a predefined time interval, followed by running the gear box <b>110</b> at different constant speeds in subsequent time intervals, and so on over an extended time period such as <b>10</b> hours, <b>15</b> hours, <b>20</b> hours, etc. The break-in schedule <b>140</b> may even require resting and/or servicing the gear box for periods of time, or starting and stopping the gear box between such resting and/or servicing time periods, and so on.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">It should be appreciated that running the gear box <b>110</b> as described above alleviates the need to then repeat a break-in process for the gear box <b>110</b> after the gear box <b>110</b> has been removed from the break-in assembly <b>100</b> and installed on a water vessel. Accordingly, utilization of the break-in assembly <b>100</b> alleviates unnecessary consumption of water vessel service time, crew time, vessel preparation and docking resources, and so on. Likewise, if a water vessel later requires a replacement stern drive, the water vessel does not need to be removed from service in order to break-in a replacement stern drive in place of an old stern drive since such the replacement stern drive may be broken in using the break-in assembly <b>100</b> prior to replacing the old stern drive.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows certain details of a portion <b>200</b> of a gear box <b>110</b> which is suitable for being broken in by the break-in assembly <b>100</b> (e.g., also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref>). The loading apparatus <b>124</b> is configured to interface with the gear box portion <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">By way of example, the gear box <b>110</b> forms at least a portion of a stern drive for a boat or similar water vessel. Nevertheless, it should be understood that various improvements disclosed herein make the break-in assembly <b>100</b> (or certain features, concepts, and/or aspects of the break-in assembly <b>100</b>) well suited for breaking in other equipment/devices/etc. such as gear boxes for submarines, unmanned watercraft, and so on. Moreover, such a break-in assembly <b>100</b> may be used to break-in other types of equipment such as gears for turning fans, propellers, and/or other objects with similar characteristics/geometries/etc., mechanical linkages for operating control surfaces, other types of equipment drive by chains/belts/etc., as well as other mechanical devices and/or componentry.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the portion <b>200</b> includes a set of propeller shafts <b>210</b> that rotate in response to rotational input. When the gear box <b>110</b> is installed on the break-in assembly <b>100</b>, the rotational input to the gear box <b>110</b> is provided by the drive apparatus <b>122</b>. When the gear box <b>110</b> is installed in the field (e.g., on a boat), the rotational input to the gear box <b>110</b> is provided by other means such as by a boat engine (e.g., in the context of a stern drive).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">When the gear box <b>110</b> is installed on the break-in assembly <b>100</b>, the drive apparatus <b>112</b> imparts rotational input to an input shaft <b>220</b> of the gear box <b>110</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). Such rotation is conveyed from the input shaft <b>220</b> through mechanical linkage of the gear box <b>110</b> (e.g., gears/etc.) to the propeller shafts <b>210</b>. It should be understood that an interfacing portion of the drive apparatus <b>112</b> that engages the input shaft <b>220</b> is illustrated in certain figures simply as a ball (e.g., to indicate that the interfacing portion may have a variety of different geometries based on how the gear box <b>110</b> receives input).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the axis of rotation <b>230</b> for the set of propeller shafts <b>210</b> extends along the Z-axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>4</b></figref>). By way of example, the set of propeller shafts <b>210</b> includes counter rotating shafts <b>210</b>(A), <b>210</b>(B). To this end, in response to rotational input from the drive apparatus <b>122</b> of the break-in assembly <b>100</b>, the shaft <b>210</b>(A) rotates in the clockwise direction <b>214</b>(A) and the shaft <b>210</b>(B) simultaneously rotates in the counterclockwise direction <b>214</b>(B) (e.g., as viewed by looking in the negative Z-direction).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">Although it is shown that shafts <b>210</b>(A), <b>210</b>(B) coaxially rotate, it should be understood that other types of gear boxes <b>110</b> are suitable for breaking in using the break-in assembly <b>100</b> such as gear boxes <b>110</b> that simply rotate a single shaft <b>210</b>, gear boxes <b>110</b> that rotate multiple shafts <b>210</b> that are not coaxial, and so on.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref>, it should be understood that the drive apparatus <b>122</b> of the break-in assembly <b>100</b> includes an electric motor and a controller coupled with the electric motor in accordance with certain embodiments. The electric motor is constructed and arranged to operate the gear box in a manner similar to that of an engine in the field (e.g., by providing drive to the input shaft <b>220</b> or another portion of the gear box <b>110</b>). Additionally, the controller is constructed and arranged to control motor speed and thus direct the electric motor to operate the gear box <b>110</b> at the varying speeds during a gear box break-in period.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">It should be understood that the controller may be separate from the control/resources <b>128</b> (e.g., the controller may receive input from the control/resources <b>128</b>, also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or formed, at least in part, by a portion of the control/resources <b>128</b> (i.e., the drive apparatus <b>122</b> and the control/resources <b>128</b> may be integrated at least in part). In such situations, the controller may include memory, and control circuitry coupled with the memory. The memory stores one or more break-in schedules <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) which cause the control circuitry to direct the electric motor to vary rotational speed of an input shaft of the gear box <b>110</b> in accordance with a predefined engine curve during the gear box break-in period (e.g., with predefined speed peaks and troughs to control initial wear of the gear box <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>4</b></figref>, the loading apparatus <b>124</b> may include a set of dynamometers <b>300</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>) (collectively, dynamometers <b>300</b>) constructed and arranged to apply loading to the gear box <b>110</b> while the drive apparatus <b>122</b> drives the gear box <b>110</b>. In accordance with certain embodiments, one or more of the dynamometers <b>300</b> is a water brake dynamometer having a set of water feeds <b>310</b> for enhanced loading control (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">Each dynamometer <b>300</b> engages a respective propeller shaft <b>210</b> of the gear box <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to provide loading while the propeller shaft <b>210</b> rotates in response to operation of the drive apparatus <b>122</b>. Along these lines, each dynamometer <b>300</b> (or extension hardware of the loading apparatus <b>124</b>) may extend in an elongated manner into the water tank <b>126</b> to mechanically engage a respective propeller shaft <b>210</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>4</b></figref>). To enable multiple dynamometers <b>300</b> to remain parallel to each other (e.g., side-by-side) and thus operate uniformly (e.g., for easier/uniform user access, to control/manage vibration, etc.), the loading apparatus <b>124</b> may further include additional linkage/hardware <b>320</b> that may reside inside and/or outside the water tank <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">In accordance with certain embodiments, the dynamometer <b>300</b>(<b>1</b>) is a first water brake dynamometer device that couples with the first propeller shaft <b>210</b>(A) of the gear box <b>110</b> to provide a first load to the first propeller shaft <b>210</b>(A). Similarly, the dynamometer <b>300</b>(<b>2</b>) is a second water brake dynamometer device that couples with the second propeller shaft <b>210</b>(B) of the gear box <b>110</b> to provide a second load to the second propeller shaft <b>210</b>(B). When the linkage within the gear box <b>110</b> spins the first propeller shaft <b>210</b>(A) and the second propeller shaft <b>210</b>(B) in opposite directions, the loading apparatus <b>124</b> properly applies loading to all of the propeller shafts <b>210</b>. It should be understood that each water brake dynamometer <b>300</b> may be independently controlled (e.g., via respective water feeds <b>310</b>) thus enabling the loading apparatus <b>124</b> to apply the same amount of loading to each propeller shaft <b>210</b> and/or different loads to different propeller shafts <b>210</b> (e.g., to better simulate normal operating loads). Such a feature provides the break-in assembly <b>100</b> with flexibility and adaptability to support break-in processes for different gear box designs/configurations.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Furthermore, it should be understood that the water tank <b>126</b> is disposed adjacent the gear box support <b>120</b>, and configured to contain water (or other fluid) within which the portion <b>200</b> of the gear box <b>110</b> operates. Along these lines, the water tank <b>126</b> is provisioned with a set of ports <b>330</b> to enable filling from a fluid source and emptying to a fluid drain. During operation, the water within the water tank <b>126</b> provides cooling to the gear box <b>110</b> while the drive apparatus <b>122</b> drives the gear box <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a procedure <b>400</b> to operate a gear box. Such a procedure <b>400</b> may be performed shortly after manufacturing the gear box and thus enabling reduction or elimination of unevenness and/or roughness/imperfection among various gear box components (e.g., to eliminate gear box &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">At <b>402</b>, the gear box is installed on a break-in assembly (e.g., also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref>). Such a break-in assembly is not the final location for the gear box, but is instead provided for the purpose of breaking in the gear box prior to deployment in the field. As mentioned earlier, such installation may involve connecting an input shaft of the gear box to a drive apparatus of the break-in assembly (e.g., an electric motor and controller to provide speed control), and a set of propeller shafts (or other rotating shafts) to a loading apparatus of the break-in assembly (e.g., a set of dynamometers). In some arrangements, a portion of the gear box sits within a water tank and the water tank is filled with water that provides cooling during gear box operation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">At <b>404</b>, the gear box is broken in during a gear box break-in period while the gear box is installed on the break-in assembly. Along these lines, the break-in assembly may operate the gear box a varying speeds for a prescribed amount of time (e.g., 10 hours, 20 hours, etc.). In some arrangements, the gear box is driven in accordance with a predefined engine curve (e.g., varying speeds based on a sequence of speed/time entries as predefined by a break-in schedule) during the gear box break-in period.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">At <b>406</b>, after the gear box break-in period, the gear box is removed from the break-in assembly. In particular, the gear box is disconnected from the various components of the break-in assembly and is now ready for regular use in the field. At this point, the gear box components are able to operate smoothly and wear evenly during regular use. Once the gear box is removed from the break-in assembly, another gear box may be installed on the break-in assembly for similar processing.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">At <b>408</b>, after the gear box is removed from the break-in assembly, the gear box is installed in the field. For example, in the context of a water craft, the gear box may be interconnected between an engine and a set of propellers of the water craft. The gear box is thus available to provide drive from the engine to the set of propellers to provide propulsion to the water craft.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example stern drive <b>500</b> within which a gear box <b>110</b> operating in accordance with the procedure <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) may be used. By way of example only, the stern drive <b>500</b> is configured to operate a set of propellers <b>510</b> (e.g., dual propellers <b>510</b>(A), <b>510</b>(B)). It should be understood that the stern drive <b>500</b> may include other components <b>520</b> such as an engine, sensors, and so on.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">During operation such as when the gear box <b>110</b> is installed with the stern drive <b>500</b> and the stern drive <b>500</b> is deployed in the field (e.g., on a water vessel), the stern drive <b>500</b> operates by driving the gear box <b>110</b> to turn the set of propellers <b>510</b> about an axis <b>230</b> (e.g., to propel the water vessel). For example, in the context of counter rotating propellers <b>510</b>, one propeller <b>510</b>(A) rotates in a first direction while the other propeller <b>510</b>(B) rotates in a second direction that is opposite the first direction.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">As described above, improved techniques are directed to utilizing a break-in assembly <b>100</b> to break-in a gear box <b>110</b> (e.g., stern drive linkage) prior to deployment of the gear box <b>110</b> in the field. Along these lines, such a gear box <b>110</b> may eventually form part of a stern drive <b>500</b> of a water vessel. However, rather than perform break-in of the gear box <b>110</b> while the gear box <b>110</b> is on the water vessel, the gear box <b>110</b> may be installed on the break-in assembly <b>100</b> where a drive apparatus <b>122</b> drives the gear box <b>110</b> and a loading apparatus <b>124</b> simultaneously applies load to the gear box <b>110</b> in order to operate (or exercise) the gear box <b>110</b> in accordance with a predefined break-in schedule <b>140</b>. Such a break-in assembly <b>100</b> may include a water tank <b>126</b> within which at least a portion of the gear box <b>110</b> operates in order to receive water cooling from water within the water tank <b>126</b>. Such processing via the break-in assembly <b>100</b> enables the gear box <b>110</b> to be broken in prior to installation on a water vessel thus minimizing consumption of other water vessel resources (e.g., water vessel service time, crew time, etc.).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">It should be appreciated that, conventionally, stern drives are broken in while in the field (e.g., on the boat that the stern drive is supposed to ultimately serve) in accordance with a break-in schedule. However, this conventional break-in approach wastes resources such as water vessel service time, crew time, vessel preparation and docking resources, and so on. Moreover, if such a water vessel subsequently requires a replacement stern drive, the water vessel must be removed from normal service while the replacement stern drive is broken in via the above-described conventional break-in approach.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">However, in accordance with certain embodiments, a stern drive break-in stand (or assembly) is used to complete the break-in period required for newly manufactured stern drive gear boxes. Such a test stand can spin the gear box at varying speeds while simultaneously loading counter rotating props to simulate normal operating conditions and achieve all break-in requirements. Such a break-in stand has the capability to load a single rotating prop as well as multiple props (e.g., dual props).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">In some arrangements, the stern drive break-in stand has a water tank that the stern drive mounts into. This allows water to be used to cool the stern drive during the break-in period. The stern drive is turned with an electric motor at varying speeds as called out in a break-in schedule. The counter rotating props shafts are each coupled to their own water brake dynamometer to load the props independently. Such a load may be applied based on the engine curve relative to the rotational speed as called out in the break-in schedule.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">While various embodiments of the present disclosure have been particularly shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">For example, in accordance with certain embodiments, the above-described break-in assembly (or break-in stand) may break-in multiple gear boxes simultaneously. In such a situation, the gear boxes may be mounted on one side of a common water tank. Drive apparatus <b>122</b> then provides drive to the gear boxes (e.g., on one side of the water tank) while sets of dynamometers apply loading (e.g., on the other side of the water tank).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">Moreover, certain parts of the break-in assembly may be shared (or used to interact with multiple gear boxes simultaneously) such as the drive apparatus <b>122</b>, the control/resources <b>128</b>, and so on.
