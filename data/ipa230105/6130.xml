Information is stored in a magnetic memory cell as the orientation of the magnetization of a free layer in the magnetic memory cell as compared to the orientation of the magnetization of a fixed or pinned layer in the same memory cell. The magnetization of the free layer may be oriented parallel or anti-parallel to the fixed layer, representing either a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a logic &#x201c;1.&#x201d; One type of memory cell utilizes a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) comprising a free layer and a fixed layer separated by a thin dielectric barrier (a tunnel barrier), which typically comprises aluminum oxide. The resistance of the memory cell depends on the direction of magnetization of the free layer relative to the direction of magnetization of the fixed layer. Thus, the state of the cell can be sensed by measuring its resistance. Current MRAM designs using MTJs to store data are non-volatile and have seemingly unlimited read and write endurance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To allow reading and writing to an MTJ, an MTJ is typically sandwiched between two metal contacts: a bottom contact and a top contact. Formation of the MTJ is frequently via blanket deposition of the layers forming the MTJ, and then patterning to form discrete devices. Patterning often includes anisotropic ion beam etching (IBE) in combination with photolithography. However, because portions of the bottom contact are frequently exposed at the end of the IBE process, some resputtering of the metal bottom contact is commonplace. Resputtered metal can coat the just-formed MTJ, causing shorts and other issues with functionality. Such resputtering can be particularly problematic when design rule constraints demand that the bottom contact be significantly wider than the MTJ, causing large regions of the bottom contacts to be exposed to etching when patterning the MTJ.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention provide methods and apparatus for decreasing detrimental resputtering of underlying features while patterning MTJs and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the invention are directed to a method of forming an integrated circuit. Both a dielectric layer and a bottom contact are formed with the bottom contact disposed at least partially in the dielectric layer. The bottom contact is subsequently recessed into the dielectric layer to cause the dielectric layer to define two sidewalls bordering regions of the bottom contact removed during recessing. Two sidewall spacers are then formed along the two sidewalls. A landing pad is formed on the recessed bottom contact and between the two sidewall spacers. Lastly, an additional feature is formed on top of the landing pad at least in part by anisotropic etching.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional aspects of the invention are directed to a semiconductor device formed using the method set forth in the previous paragraph.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Even additional aspects of the invention are directed to an integrated circuit.

For this reason, numerous modifications can be made to these embodiments and the results will still come within the scope of the invention. No limitations with respect to the specific embodiments described herein are intended or should be inferred.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional view of a film stack <b>100</b> in an integrated circuit, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. For purposes of illustration, the integrated circuit includes MRAM devices. The film stack includes an MTJ <b>105</b> in an &#x201c;MRAM Region&#x201d; (the right side of the sectional view), as well as a &#x201c;Non-MRAM Region&#x201d; (the left side of the sectional view) that is devoid of such a feature. The remainder of the sectional views provided herein each show a similar combination of both Regions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Both the Non-MRAM and MRAM Regions of the film stack <b>100</b> include a lower dielectric layer <b>110</b>, a middle dielectric layer <b>115</b>, and an upper dielectric layer <b>120</b>, which may constitute interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) in the integrated circuit. Lower interconnects <b>125</b> are disposed in the lower dielectric layer <b>110</b>. In between the lower dielectric layer <b>110</b> and the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b>, one finds a lower capping layer <b>130</b>, and in between the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> and the upper dielectric layer <b>120</b>, one finds an upper capping layer <b>135</b>. Beyond these common features, the Non-MRAM Region of the film stack includes a non-MRAM bottom contact <b>140</b> and a non-MRAM top contact <b>145</b>. The non-MRAM bottom contact <b>140</b> includes a non-MRAM bottom contact liner <b>150</b>, and the non-MRAM top contact <b>145</b> includes a non-MRAM top contact liner <b>155</b>. The MRAM Region, in turn, comprises a MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b>, the MTJ <b>105</b>, and an MRAM top contact <b>165</b>. Here, the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> includes a MRAM bottom contact liner <b>170</b>, and the MRAM top contact <b>165</b> includes a MRAM top contact liner <b>175</b>. Between the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> and the MTJ <b>105</b>, a landing pad <b>180</b> exists between two sidewall spacers <b>185</b>. The MTJ <b>105</b> directly contacts the landing pad <b>180</b> and the MRAM top contact <b>165</b>. As the adverb &#x201c;directly&#x201d; is used herein and in the appended claims, it is intended to mean without any intervening elements.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Arranged as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the landing pad <b>180</b> forms a discrete element disposed on top of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> and between the sidewall spacers <b>185</b>. Because of the volume occupied by the sidewall spacers<b>185</b>, the landing pad <b>180</b> is narrower than the top of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b>. This narrowing of the landing pad <b>180</b> provides several advantages during processing, which will be further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is noted that the Regions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> will only constitute portions of an integrated circuit. Accordingly, when reduced to practice, a functional integrated circuity would include a myriad of additional features including, for example, transistors, interconnects, and the like. At the same time, the MTJ <b>105</b>, while shown in the present figures as a homogeneous feature, will comprise a number of sublayers that are not explicitly shown herein solely for ease of presentation. These sublayers will already be familiar to one having ordinary skill in the relevant arts. Moreover, descriptions of the structure and functionality of MTJs, and MRAM devices more generally, are both readily available in the literature. An example includes U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,343 to Gallagher et al., entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Memory Array Using Magnetic Tunnel Junction Devices in the Memory Cells,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Additional description is provided in, as just one more example, B. Dieny et al., <i>Introduction to Magnetic Random&#x2014;Access Memory, </i>John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 2016, which is also hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of an illustrative method <b>200</b> for forming the film stack in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>12</b></figref> show sectional views of intermediate film stacks formed while performing the method <b>200</b>. It is emphasized that, although the method <b>200</b> and the structures formed thereby are entirely novel, many of the individual processing steps required to implement the method may utilize conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques and conventional semiconductor fabrication tooling. These techniques and tooling will already be familiar to one having ordinary skill in the relevant arts given the teachings herein. Moreover, details of the individual processing steps used to fabricate semiconductor devices described herein may be found in a number of publications including, for example, P. V. Zant, <i>Microchip Fabrication, Sixth Edition: A Practical Guide to Semiconductor Processing, </i>McGraw Hill Professional, 2013; S. Wolf and R. N. Tauber, <i>Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Volume </i>1, Lattice Press, 1986; and S. Wolf, <i>Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Vol. </i>4: <i>Deep</i>-<i>Submicron Process Technology, </i>Lattice Press, 2003, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. It is also emphasized that the descriptions provided herein are not intended to encompass all of the processing steps that may be required to successfully form a functional device. Rather, certain processing steps that are conventionally used in forming integrated circuit devices, such as, for example, wet cleaning steps, are purposefully not described herein for economy of description. However, one skilled in the art will readily recognize those processing steps omitted from this more generalized description.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In step <b>205</b>, a partially processed integrated circuit is received with the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. At this point in the processing, it is assumed that the lower dielectric layer <b>110</b>, lower interconnects <b>125</b>, and lower capping layer <b>130</b> are already formed by front-end-of-line (FEOL), middle-of-line (MOL), and/or back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing in the manner shown in the figure. The lower dielectric layer <b>110</b> may comprise, for example, silicon oxide (including doped silicon oxide), while the lower interconnects <b>125</b> may comprise, for example, tungsten, aluminum, or copper. The lower capping layer <b>130</b> may comprise silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or nitrogen-doped silicon carbide. In providing these selections of materials, however, it is emphasized that any particular material provided herein is merely by way of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention unless expressly set forth as doing so.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Next, in step <b>210</b>, the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> is formed to yield the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In one or more embodiments, the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> may comprise silicon oxide. The middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> may be deposited by, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), or physical vapor deposition (PVD).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Subsequently, in step <b>215</b>, the non-MRAM bottom contact <b>140</b> and the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> (with their respective liners <b>150</b>, <b>170</b>) are formed in the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> to produce the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Formation may be by what is frequently called a damascene process (or &#x201c;dual&#x201d; damascene process). More particularly, formation may start with a first photolithography step and first reactive ion etching (RIE) step to define round vias that will create the vertical interconnects for the bottom contacts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>. Next, a second photolithography step and a second RIE step may define the much larger trench portions that will create the horizontal metal wires for the bottom contacts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>. Both RIE steps may be designed to, at least initially, selectively etch the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> (e.g., silicon oxide) without etching, or only very slowly etching, the lower capping layer <b>130</b> (e.g., silicon nitride). In this manner, the lower capping layer <b>130</b> becomes a form of etch stop. A combination of CHF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, and Ar have been shown to selectively etch silicon oxide with a selectivity of oxide-to-nitride of about 30:1. With the etch stop exposed, the second RIE step may conclude with an etch chemistry that etches silicon nitride faster than silicon oxide so as to remove the exposed portions of the lower capping layer <b>130</b>. A combination of CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>F, O<sub>2</sub>, F, and He has been shown to achieve a nitride-to-oxide selectivity of about 19:1.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the openings for the bottom contacts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> are so defined, the non-MRAM and MRAM bottom contact liners <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> may be deposited, followed by deposition of the cores of the bottom contacts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>. In one or more embodiments, the bottom contact liners <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> may comprise, as just some examples, cobalt, ruthenium, tantalum, tantalum nitride, indium oxide, tungsten nitride, or titanium nitride, and the cores may comprise copper, cobalt, ruthenium, copper-manganese, or aluminum, with both the liners <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> and cores deposited by CVD, PVD, and/or electroplating. When using copper for the metallization, tantalum/tantalum-nitride liners both aid with adhesion and inhibit the migration of copper into other portions of the integrated circuit. Excess metal outside the vias and trenches of the bottom contacts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> may then be removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to yield the film stack in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Step <b>220</b> has the Non-MRAM Region of the integrated circuit masked off so that several of the next steps will occur solely in the MRAM Region. In the present non-limiting embodiment, the masking in step <b>220</b> is accomplished by forming a masking layer <b>600</b> overlying the Non-MRAM Region while leaving the MRAM Region exposed, providing the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. While the masking layer <b>600</b> is shown as a homogeneous layer in the figures, the masking layer <b>600</b> may comprise a plurality of sublayers including one or more photoresist, antireflective, organic planarization layer (OPL), organic dielectric layer (ODL), and hard mask sublayers. Formation of the masking layer <b>600</b> may be via CVD followed by photolithography and RIE to remove the masking layer <b>600</b> over the MRAM Region while leaving it intact over the Non-MRAM Region.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Step <b>225</b> involves recessing the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> below an upper surface <b>700</b> of the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> to yield the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Recessing may be by wet chemical etching. If the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> (with its MRAM bottom contact liner <b>170</b>) are formed of copper and tantalum/tantalum-nitride, for example, a solution comprising H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, and CDTA (i.e., 1, 2-cyclohexane diaminetetraacetic acid) in H<sub>2</sub>O may be utilized to slowly and controllably recess the copper portion. Such a process is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,537,709 to E. I. Cooper et al., entitled, &#x201c;Method for Isotropic Etching of Copper,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Subsequently, a solution comprising H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BTA, (benzotriazole), CDTA, and KOH in H<sub>2</sub>O may be utilized to recess the remaining tantalum/tantalum-nitride MRAM bottom contact liner <b>170</b>. Here, such a process is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,002,831 to B. D. Briggs et al., entitled &#x201c;Selective and Non-selective Barrier Layer Wet Removal,&#x201d; which is also hereby incorporated by reference herein. In some embodiments, the copper and tantalum/tantalum-nitride wet etches may be combined. After such recessing, the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> defines two sidewalls <b>705</b> bordering the region of the MRAM bottom contact just removed during recessing. These two sidewalls <b>705</b> are clearly evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Step <b>230</b> involves forming the sidewall spacers <b>185</b> on the two sidewalls <b>705</b> of the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b> created in step <b>225</b> to create the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The sidewall spacers <b>185</b> may comprise, for example, a dielectric material such as silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or nitrogen-doped silicon carbide. Formation of the sidewall spacers may be by blanket deposition via CVD, ALD, or PVD, followed by RIE. The RIE, being anisotropic, removes the just deposited dielectric material on the horizontal surfaces while leaving the sidewall spacers along the vertical surfaces of the two sidewalls <b>705</b> of the middle dielectric layer <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, in step <b>235</b>, the masking layer <b>600</b> is removed by, for example, wet etching. In step <b>240</b>, the landing pad <b>180</b> is then formed on top of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> and between the two sidewall spacers <b>185</b> to create the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In one or more embodiments, the landing pad <b>180</b> may comprise niobium, niobium nitride, tungsten, tungsten nitride, titanium, titanium nitride, ruthenium, molybdenum, or any other metal or metal nitride with relatively high melting points. CVD, ALD, PVD, or electroplating may be utilized to initially deposit a blanket layer of the landing pad material, and then CMP may be used to remove the excess material and leave the discrete landing pad <b>180</b> only in the recessed region of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With the landing pad <b>180</b> so formed, the method <b>200</b> then moves on to forming the MTJ <b>105</b> and the remaining structures that appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In step <b>245</b>, the MTJ <b>105</b> is formed by depositing the numerous sublayers that form the MTJ <b>105</b> by, for example, CVD, ALD, or PVD, and then utilizing photolithography and IBE to pattern the MTJ <b>105</b> into a discrete feature. The resultant film stack is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Next, in step <b>250</b>, the upper capping layer <b>135</b> is deposited to achieve the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Like the lower capping layer <b>130</b>, the upper capping layer <b>135</b> may, in one or more embodiments, comprise conformal silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or nitrogen-doped silicon carbide formed by CVD, ALD, or PVD. With the upper capping layer <b>135</b> in place, the upper dielectric layer <b>120</b> is then formed in step <b>255</b> to yield the film stack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The upper dielectric layer <b>120</b> may comprise, for example, two silicon oxide sublayers: a first silicon oxide sub-layer deposited by CVD, ALD, or PVD and planarized by CMP to a level corresponding to the top of the upper capping layer <b>135</b> overlying the MTJ <b>105</b>, and then a second silicon oxide sublayer deposited by CVD, ALD, or PVD on the planarized first silicon oxide sublayer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more embodiments, patterning of the MTJ <b>105</b> in step <b>245</b> may occur by a self-aligned double patterning (SADP) process. SADP processing will already be familiar to one having ordinary skill in the relevant arts. Briefly, in SADP processing, spacer features are used as hard masks in combination with other masks to pattern features that are smaller than those can be easily created by photolithography alone. SADP processing is described in, for example, H. Geng, <i>Semiconductor Manufacturing Handbook, Second Edition, </i>McGraw Hill Professional, 2017, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Lastly, in step <b>260</b>, both the non-MRAM top contact <b>145</b> and the MRAM top contact <b>165</b> are formed in the upper dielectric layer <b>120</b> so that they contact the non-MRAM bottom contact <b>140</b> and the top of the MTJ <b>105</b>, respectively. Formation may again be by a form of damascene processing. In the non-MRAM Region, first photolithography and RIE steps may be utilized to form the via portion of the non-MRAM top contact <b>145</b>. RIE may utilize an etch chemistry selective to silicon oxide like that described above for step <b>215</b> so as to allow the upper capping layer <b>135</b> to act as an etch stop. Next, second photolithography and RIE steps may be utilized to form the trench portions of both the non-MRAM top contact <b>145</b> and the MRAM top contact <b>165</b>. The RIE may start with a process selective to silicon oxide, but then switch over to a RIE process that effectively etches silicon nitride to remove the now-exposed portions of the upper capping layer <b>135</b> overlying the non-MRAM bottom contact <b>140</b> and the MTJ <b>105</b>. Once the vias/trenches of the top contacts <b>145</b>, <b>165</b>, are formed in this manner, the top contacts may be completed by depositing the non-MRAM and MRAM top contact liners <b>155</b>, <b>175</b> (e.g., cobalt, ruthenium, tantalum, tantalum nitride, indium, indium oxide, tungsten, and/or tungsten nitride) and the metal cores (e.g., copper, cobalt, ruthenium, copper-manganese, and/or aluminum) by CVD, ALD, PVD, and/or electroplating, again, in a manner similar to that described above for step <b>215</b>. CMP may then be utilized to remove the excess metal from any horizontal surfaces. The resultant film stack is that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">There are several process and design constraints when forming integrated circuits that include MTJs. An MTJ typically must: <b>1</b>) land on a highly conductive feature (i.e., a bottom contact); and <b>2</b>) must be patterned by some form of anisotropic etching process, most commonly IBE, which has little selectivity for different materials (i.e., essentially etches anything). At the same time, the critical dimensions (CDs) of bottom contacts are often set by patterning constraints such that the bottom contacts are quite large in comparison to MTJs. When using SADP processes to form the MTJs, for example, the lower contacts may have CDs that are several multiples of the CDs of the MTJs. Accordingly, when using conventional process flows, significant portions of the bottom contacts are exposed at the end of the MTJ etching process, and some resputtering of the bottom contacts is likely. Resputtered metal (e.g., copper) can coat the just-formed MTJs, causing shorts and other issues with functionality.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrative method set forth above, however, rather than having the top of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> be exposed to the patterning of the MTJ <b>105</b>, the top of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> is instead replaced by a substantially narrower landing pad <b>180</b> that can violate the CD constraints for the bottom contact <b>160</b>. That is, the maximum width of the landing pad<b>180</b> is smaller than the maximum width of the MRAM bottom contact <b>160</b> at the interface between the two features. As a result, most of the etching of the MTJ <b>105</b> falls on the newly introduced sidewalls spacers <b>185</b> rather than on a metallic feature. The sidewall spacers <b>185</b>, being formed of a dielectric material (e.g., silicon nitride), are less likely than a metallic feature to cause serious defects if resputtered. The above-described illustrative embodiment, and more generally, embodiments falling within the scope of the invention, thereby provide means by which to pattern MTJs while reducing detrimental resputtering of underlying features, even when forming MTJs by SADP.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The methods described above are used in the fabrication of integrated circuit chips. The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case, the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input devices, and a central processor.

The bottom contact is subsequently recessed into the dielectric layer to cause the dielectric layer to define two sidewalls (i.e., sidewalls <b>705</b>) bordering regions of the bottom contact removed during recessing. Two sidewall spacers (i.e., sidewall spacers <b>185</b>) are then formed along the two sidewalls. A landing pad (i.e., landing pad <b>180</b>) is formed on the recessed bottom contact and between the two sidewall spacers.
