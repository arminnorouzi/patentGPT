The coatings can comprise a number of ingredients to form the coating such as a wax or other hydrocarbon to form a protective barrier. A ceramic compound can be included to increase hardness and wear resistance. In some aspects, carbon compounds such as a carbon allotrope (e.g., graphene, etc.) can be included to improve performance of the coating.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The coatings can be applied to various surface such as painted surfaces, metallic surfaces, plastic surfaces, or most other surfaces subject to environmental conditions such as items placed outdoors. In some aspects, the coating can be applied to one or more surfaces associated with vehicles. For example, the coatings can be applied to various painted surfaces, plastic surfaces, or the like on a motor vehicle. Various motor vehicles can include, but are not limited to, passenger automobiles, sports utility vehicles (SUV), buses, trucks, various commercial vehicles, watercraft including a variety of boats and ships, aircraft, and the like. The coatings may also be provided as consumer products if, e.g., diluted by half, to lower volatile organic compound (VOC) levels below environmental regulatory standards.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The coating composition disclosed herein comprises an aqueous solution of various elements that allow the components to remain in solution in a stable formulation. The term &#x201c;solution&#x201d; as used herein may include a liquid colloidal solution having a uniform dispersion of colloidal particles as well as, in some instances, a suspension such as a dispersion, e.g., solid in liquid. In some aspects, the particles can have a size of about 1 to about 100 nanometers (nm). The coating composition can then be used to form one or more coatings as described herein. In some aspects, the coating composition comprises: an aqueous solution, the carbon allotrope, a ceramic compound, a wax, and a protonated compound. The resulting solution can be described as a slurry or emulsion having the components dispersed within the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The aqueous solution can form the base of the solution. In some aspects, the aqueous solution can comprise water from any suitable source such as reverse osmosis, distilled, deionized, or other form of substantially pure water. In some aspects, the water can comprise some amount of dissolved components without affecting the stability, use, or finish of the coating.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The carbon allotrope may be present in a number of forms. Generally, the carbon allotrope has some carbon atoms with less bonds than quaternary carbon atoms and a hardness on the Mohs hardness scale as determined by the Mohs hardness test of less than about 9, less than about 8, and even less than about 5. Typically, the carbon allotrope is a primary, a secondary, and/or a tertiary carbon. In some exemplary embodiments, the carbon allotrope is a tertiary carbon, such as a graphene, a graphite, and a nanotube. The graphene can be present in a number of forms. In general, the graphene forms a sheet-like layer on an atomic scale. The carbon atoms may be arranged in a honeycomb shaped lattice. The graphene can be present in the coating composition as a pure graphene (e.g., pure carbon-based graphene) and/or as a functionalized graphene. For example, the graphene can comprise a graphene oxide, a reduced graphene oxide, or the like. The use of the various forms of the graphene can contribute to the stability of the graphene in solution. The carbon allotrope, such as the graphene, may improve the durability of the final coating.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ceramic compound can also be present to improve the durability of the final coating. Any suitable ceramic component can be used in the coating composition. In some aspects, the ceramic component can be a silicon oxide, such as silicon dioxide or silicon monoxide, although in other aspects the ceramic component can comprise one or more of oxides, phosphates, fluorides, nitrides, carbides, disilicides, and zeolites with at least one metallic and nonmetallic elements, such as: silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), lithium titanium oxide (Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), zirconium dioxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), vanadium oxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), boron oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), barium titanium oxide (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>), yttrium oxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tungsten trioxide (WO<sub>3</sub>), magnesium oxide (MgO), copper oxide (CuO), zinc oxide (ZnO), aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>), aluminum fluorine (AlF), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), aluminum nitride (AlN), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten carbide (WC), silicon carbide (SiC), titanium carbide (TiC), molybdenum disilicide (MoSi<sub>2</sub>), iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), germanium dioxide (GeO<sub>2</sub>), lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O), manganese oxide (MnO), nickel oxide (NiO), zeolite, or any combination thereof. The ceramic compound may be present as particles having a size in a range of about 0.01 micron (&#x3bc;m) to about 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The coating composition can also include a wax. A wax is typically a low-melting organic mixture or compound of high molecular weight, solid at room temperature and generally similar in composition to fats and oils except that it contains no glycerides. The wax can comprise any suitable vehicular wax capable of bonding with a surface. In general, the wax can comprise a hydrocarbon of between about 20-40 carbon atoms and be in various forms such as acids, fatty alcohols, esters, straight chained or branched hydrocarbons (alkanes or paraffins, such as normal paraffins or isoparaffins). Fatty alcohols (or long-chain alcohols) are usually high-molecular-weight, straight-chain primary alcohols, but can also range from as few as 4-6 carbons to as many as 22-26, derived from natural fats and oils. Some commercially available fatty alcohols are lauryl, stearyl, and oleyl alcohols.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some aspects, the wax can include a natural wax, such as an animal wax, e.g., a lanolin or a shellac wax, or a vegetable wax. One exemplary vegetable wax is a carnauba wax, though other waxes can be used in place of carnauba wax or in combination with carnauba wax.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The coating composition can also comprise a protonated compound. In some aspects, any compound capable of being protonated to form a charged compound can be used with the coating composition. As disclosed herein, the protonated compound can comprise an organosilicone compound such as a siloxane. The organosilicone can be protonated by a reaction with one or more components such as an acid. The organosilicone compound can aid in blocking ultraviolet radiation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Any suitable acids can be used to form the protonated compound such as mineral acids, organic acids, such as hydroxyacetic acid, and the like. In some aspects, the protonated compound can comprise a siloxane such as a polydimethylsiloxane. The protonated compound can impart a positive or cationic charge to the coating composition. This positive charge aids application when applied to a negatively charged object, such as a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some aspects, the coating composition can also comprise a hydrophobic component such as a silicone quaternary compound. The hydrophobic component can help to form a hydrophobic final coating on the surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Any number of suitable additives can also be included in the coating composition. Suitable examples can include, one or more organic solvents, a mineral oil, an emulsifier, a surfactant, a thickener, a pH adjusting agent, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Any suitable amounts of the components can be used with the coating compositions. In some aspects, the various components can have the following ranges: an aqueous solution between about 50 weight percent (wt. %) and about 95 wt. % of the composition; a graphene between about 0.001 wt. % and about 3 wt. % of the composition; a ceramic compound between about 0.1 wt. % and about 3 wt. % of the composition; a wax between about 1 wt. % and about 15 wt. % of the composition; and a protonated compound between about 1 wt. % and about 20 wt. % of the composition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The resulting composition can form a stable suspension over time. More specially, the resulting composition may not experience the various components including the graphene, ceramic, wax, and protonated compound separating within the suspension such that the composition cannot be evenly applied to a surface. In other word, the composition may form a uniformly dispersed suspension or solution and be stable for several weeks, months, or even years.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various ingredients in the coating composition can interact to cause one or more components to precipitate, agglomerate, or otherwise separate from the mixture. In order to prevent these interactions, the elements are processes as separate solutions or mixtures prior to being combined. In some aspects, a method of forming a coating composition can include: combining water, an organosilicon composition, a silicone quaternary compound, and an acid to form a first solution, providing a second solution comprising graphene in an aqueous fluid, and forming a third solution comprising a wax and a ceramic compound. The first solution can then be mixed with the second solution to form a fourth solution, and the third solution can be mixed with the fourth solution to form the coating composition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, the weight ratio of the first solution to the second solution is 4:1 to 1:2, or 3:1 to 1:1. The weight ratio of the first solution to the third solution can be 8:1 to 1:1, or 8:1 to 2:1. The weight ratio of the second solution to the third solution can be 5:1 to 1:2, or 4:1 to 1:1. The weight ratio of the fourth solution to the third solution can be 15:1 to 2:1, or 10:1 to 6:1.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a result, there are three separate mixtures used within the coating composition formation process. Initially, the aqueous solution, the organosilicon composition, a silicone quaternary compound, and a protonation agent such as an acid are combined to form a first mixture. The organosilicon composition can be protonated by the acid in the resulting suspension. Because the elements are generally in an aqueous suspension, the elements can be mixed to form a uniform mixture or suspension, which can include stirring or agitating by hand or using mechanical mixing. As a result of mixing, the protonated compound can be formed within the first mixture.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a second step, graphene can be mixed with water to form a slurry or suspension. As described above, various forms of graphene can be used to form a stable graphene in water mixture.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a third step, the wax can be combined with the ceramic compound. In the third step, the wax may be supplied dry or in a water or solvent based solution. When the wax is dry, a fluid such as water, an organic solvent, or the like may be added. In order to form a stable mixture of two or more immiscible liquids in suspension by using small percentages of emulsifier to form a well-mixed emulsion, the wax may be agitated to form an emulsion prior to adding the ceramic component. Generally, agitation is provided at least about 8,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), about 9,000 RPM, or even about 10,000 RPM for at least about 30 minutes. Various forms of mechanical agitation such as ultrasonication, applying a shear stress (e.g., shearing force) such as an emulsifier, using a homogenizer, or a combination thereof. As the wax is agitated, the ceramic component can be added to form a uniform mixture of the wax and ceramic component as an emulsion.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first mixture comprising the protonated compound can then be mixed with the graphene suspension. In some aspects, the first mixture can be added into the second mixture, and in other embodiments, the second mixture can be added into the first mixture. The mixture forming the base solution can be agitated while the other mixture is added or blended. This agitation can help to form a uniform mixture. While not intending to be limited by theory, it has been found that mixing the graphene with the organosilicone and/or silicone quaternary compounds can result in the graphene and/or silicon compounds to form agglomerates such that one or more of the components may separate from the mixture. The formation of the protonated compounds prior to mixing with the graphene can allow a stable suspension to be created. The resulting mixture can then form a fourth intermediate mixture.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, the emulsion of the wax and ceramic compound can be mixed with the fourth intermediate mixture to form the coating composition as a stable suspension. The fourth mixture may be agitated by being stirred, sheared, or the like during the addition of the third mixture to ensure proper mixing of the emulsion into the final coating composition. As described herein, one or more additional compounds can be provided in the coating composition. The additional components may be combined into the first mixture as part of the overall mixing process. The result of the mixing process is the coating composition as described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In use, the coating composition can be applied to a surface to form a coating layer. Because the coating composition is an aqueous based composition, the coating composition can be applied to a surface that is wetted. The active components can then bond to the surface to form the coating, and the remaining components can be washed away with an aqueous fluid rinse to leave the resulting coating on the surface.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some aspects, a method of forming a applying a coating to a surface can comprise: wetting the surface with an aqueous solution such as water, while the surface is wetted, applying the coating composition as described herein to the surface, where the coating is formed on the surface based on applying the coating composition to the surface, and rinsing the surface with an aqueous solution after applying the coating. While any remaining water could be allowed to dry, the surface can also be dried such as by using a towel. A buffing step may help to shine the surface after the coating is formed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A number of components in the coating composition are present to form a stable formulation. When the coating composition is applied to the surface, the coating composition can be hydrophilic, which can allow the coating composition to evenly coat the wetted surface. Moreover, the coating composition may have a positive charge, which facilitates its application to a negatively charged object, such as a vehicle. During the coating process, the various components such as the silicone quaternary compounds, the organosilicone compounds, the wax, the graphene, and the ceramic component can bond to the surface to form a coating layer. The components of the coating layer are generally hydrophobic, and with the rinsing and removal of the hydrophilic compounds (such that they pass away with the rinsing water), the remaining coating layer can be hydrophobic.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The resulting coating layer can be disposed on the surface and comprise the wax, the graphene, and the ceramic compound. The silicone quaternary compounds and the organosilicone compounds can also be present.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The resulting coating can provide for a protective layer on the surface, which can in some aspects serve as a sealant. The coating can provide hydrophobicity, durability, floss, and hardness to the surface. The coating can help to provide stain resistance and removal of surface contaminants that may form on the coating, thereby protecting the surface over time. In one embodiment, the coating may provide about a 20 percent (%) greater contact angle and about a 73% less slide-off angle compared to a current coating composition. Moreover, the coating may provide a stain release improvement of at least about 50% compared to a current coating composition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Having described various coatings, compositions, and methods, certain aspects can include, but are not limited to:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a first aspects, a composition for coating a surface comprises an aqueous solution;
