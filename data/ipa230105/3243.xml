Since the speaker has a large amount of vibration, the silica gel or rubber is used for cushioning to achieve a shock-absorbing effect. One speaker cabinet at least needs three to four screws for locking and fixation, and one device usually has two speaker cabinets. Therefore, if a locking means of screw is used, in addition to a time-consuming locking process, in order to avoid mistakes of not locking tight, an additional dispensing procedure is further required, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, the screws that match the existing silica gel or rubber need to be specially made, and commonly used screws cannot be used for locking. Therefore, the cost is increased and further design is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In other words, the width W<b>140</b> of the second connection portion <b>140</b> is smaller than the maximum width of the second latch portion <b>120</b>, and the width W<b>160</b> of the second guide portion <b>160</b> is smaller than the minimum width of the second latch portion <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the width W<b>101</b> of the support portion <b>101</b> in the direction Ax perpendicular to the axial direction Az is greater than the width W<b>130</b> of the first connection portion <b>130</b> in the direction Ax, the width W<b>110</b> of the first latch portion <b>110</b>, and the width W<b>140</b> of the second connection portion <b>140</b> in the direction Ax and the width W<b>120</b> of the second latch portion <b>120</b>. In other words, the width W<b>101</b> of the support portion <b>101</b> is the widest among all of the components of the cushioning member <b>100</b>. Since the support portion <b>101</b> has elasticity, it may serve as a buffer between the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>. Namely, a force generated by the first part <b>200</b> during vibration is attenuated when being transmitted through the support portion <b>101</b>, so that an amount of vibration actually transmitted to the second part <b>300</b> is reduced, so as to avoid generating abnormal sound.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To be more specific, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> at the same time, in the embodiment, the first part <b>200</b> includes a first position-limiting channel <b>210</b>, and the second part <b>300</b> includes a second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>. Since the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> correspond to each other along the axial direction Az, the first connection portion <b>130</b> and the second connection portion <b>140</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> may respectively penetrate through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>. In this way, the support portion <b>101</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> abuts between the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>, i.e., a surface of the support portion <b>101</b> facing the first buckling portion <b>110</b> and a surface thereof facing the second buckling portion <b>120</b> respectively leans against the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>. Moreover, the first part <b>200</b> of the embodiment further includes a first accommodating cavity <b>220</b>, and the second part <b>300</b> further includes a second accommodating cavity <b>320</b>. The first accommodating cavity <b>220</b> communicates with the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> in the axial direction Az to accommodate the first latch portion <b>110</b> in the relaxed state. The second accommodating cavity <b>320</b> communicates with the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> in the axial direction Az to accommodate the second latch portion <b>120</b> in the relaxed state. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> again, the first part <b>200</b> of the embodiment further includes a first disassembly channel <b>230</b>, where the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> communicates with the first disassembly channel <b>230</b> along a direction perpendicular to the axial direction Az. In the embodiment, the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b>, for example, communicates with the first disassembly channel <b>230</b> along a direction Ay perpendicular to the axial direction Az.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> again, when the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b> are to be fixed together, a force must be first applied to the second latch portion <b>120</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> from top to bottom in the axial direction Az to compress the second latch portion <b>120</b>, so that the second latch portion <b>120</b> passes through the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> of the second part <b>300</b> in a compressed state and is restored to the relaxed state in the second accommodating cavity <b>320</b>. At this time, the support portion <b>101</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> leans against the second part <b>300</b>. Then, a force is applied to the first latch portion <b>110</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> from top to bottom in the axial direction Az to compress the first latch portion <b>110</b>, so that the first latch portion <b>110</b> passes through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> of the first part <b>200</b> in the compressed state, and is restored to the relaxed state in the first accommodating cavity <b>220</b>. In the compressed state, the width W<b>110</b> of the first latch portion <b>110</b> in the direction Ax and the width W<b>120</b> of the second latch portion <b>120</b> in the direction Ax are respectively less than or equal to a width W<b>210</b> of the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and a width W<b>310</b> of the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>. Therefore, the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> may respectively pass through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>. In other embodiments, it is also possible to first compress the first latch portion <b>110</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> from top to bottom in the axial direction Az, so that the first latch portion <b>110</b> passes through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> of the first part <b>200</b> in the compressed state, and then the second latch portion <b>120</b> is compressed from top to bottom in the axial direction Az, so that the second latch portion <b>120</b> passes through the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> of the second part <b>300</b> in the compressed state.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> respectively reach the first accommodating cavity <b>220</b> and the second accommodating cavity <b>320</b>, since they are no longer affected by a compression force, the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> return to the relaxed state, and now the first connection portion <b>130</b> and the second connection portion <b>140</b> are respectively located in the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>, and the support portion <b>101</b> is sandwiched between the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>. A cavity size of the first accommodating cavity <b>220</b> and a cavity size of the second accommodating cavity <b>320</b> may be suitable to accommodate the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> in the relaxed state. When the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> are in the relaxed state, the width W<b>110</b> of the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the width W<b>120</b> of the second latch portion <b>120</b> are respectively larger than the width W<b>210</b> of the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> in the direction Ax perpendicular to the axial direction Az and the width W<b>310</b> of the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> in the direction Ax perpendicular to the axial direction Az. Namely, in the relaxed state, the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> cannot escape along an original path via the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>, thereby achieving a buckling effect. Furthermore, even if the cushioning member <b>100</b> is pulled outwards, only the axial direction Az compression may be applied to the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b>, and the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> are unable to pass through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel. In other words, the cushioning member <b>100</b> of the embodiment may maintain the connection relationship between the second part <b>300</b> and the first part <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, after the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> pass through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>, the first connection portion <b>130</b> and the second connection portion <b>140</b> are respectively retained in the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>. Preferably, a length L<b>130</b> of the first connection portion <b>130</b> in the axial direction Az is greater than or equal to a thickness T<b>210</b> of the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> in the axial direction Az, and a length L<b>140</b> of the second connection portion <b>140</b> in the axial direction Az is equal to a thickness T<b>310</b> of the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b> in the axial direction Az. In this way, the support portion <b>101</b>, the first latch portion <b>110</b> in the first accommodating cavity <b>220</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> in the second accommodating cavity <b>320</b> are more closely attached to the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>. Namely, a gap between the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the first part <b>200</b>, a gap between the second latch portion <b>120</b> and the second part <b>300</b>, and a gap between the support portion <b>101</b> and the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b> are relatively small, which may further enhance the buckling effect.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> at the same time, the width W<b>150</b> of the first guide portion <b>150</b> and the width W<b>160</b> of the second guide portion <b>160</b> of the cushioning member <b>100</b> of the embodiment are respectively smaller than the width W<b>110</b> of the first latch portion <b>110</b> (minimum width) and the width W<b>120</b> (minimum width) of the second latch portion <b>120</b>. Therefore, when the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> are forced and compressed to pass through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>, the first guide portion <b>150</b> and the second guide portion <b>160</b> may provide an alignment effect, such that the first latch portion <b>110</b> and the second latch portion <b>120</b> may be more easily and accurately compressed to pass through the first position-limiting channel <b>210</b> and the second position-limiting channel <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> for a detachable device <b>10</b>&#x2032; of another embodiment, a second part <b>300</b>&#x2032; further includes a second disassembly channel <b>330</b>, where the first disassembly channel <b>230</b> and the second disassembly channel <b>330</b> may be used as a path for moving the cushioning member <b>100</b> out of the first part <b>200</b> and the second part <b>300</b>&#x2032;.
