For example, in a power conversion circuit of an AC-DC converter or DC-AC converter or DC-DC converter, a power semiconductor device serves an important function, and the operating state thereof directly affects the reliability of operation of the entire apparatus. During use, the power semiconductor device will consume a portion of energy and convert this to heat, with the result that the power semiconductor device heats up, and the junction temperature rises. When the junction temperature exceeds a safety threshold, the current will increase sharply, and this may even cause a transistor to burn out. Thus, heat needs to be rapidly released to the surroundings by means of a heat dissipation device, to lower the operating temperature of the electronic component.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To ensure stable operation of the heat dissipation device, good thermal contact between the heat dissipation device and the electronic component needs to be maintained.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of a pressure plate and bolts to maintain contact between the heat dissipation device and the electronic component is known in the prior art. Specifically, the pressure plate is placed above the electronic component, and connected to a heat dissipation component by means of bolts at suitable positions, such that the electronic component is pressed tightly against the heat dissipation component. The most obvious drawback of this solution is that the rigid action force of the pressure plate is applied to the electronic component directly, and this might cause damage to the electronic component, which has a rather fragile structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of an elastic clip loaded with prestress to maintain contact between the heat dissipation device and the electronic component is also known in the prior art. Specifically, one end of the elastic clip is fixed to a fixed structure such as the heat dissipation component, and the other end applies an elastic action force to the electronic component, to bias the electronic component towards the heat dissipation component. Although this solution can avoid the application of a rigid action force to the electronic component, the elastic clip might develop fatigue as time passes under the action of a thermal load, causing a reduction in the elastic action force, with the result that stable contact between the heat dissipation component and the electronic component cannot be maintained.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to at least overcome the abovementioned shortcomings in the prior art, maintaining good thermal contact between the heat dissipation device and the electronic component and reducing damage to the electronic component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present invention, a heat dissipation device for an electronic component is proposed, wherein the heat dissipation device comprises: a heat dissipating component disposed on a first side of the electronic component; at least one elastic element arranged on a second side of the electronic component opposite the first side; a pressure plate arranged such that the at least one elastic element is located between the pressure plate and the electronic component, the pressure plate being connected to a fixed structure to apply pressure to the electronic component via the at least one elastic element in the direction of the heat dissipating component.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This configuration according to the present invention can avoid the direct application of a rigid action force to the electronic component, preventing the electronic component from experiencing local concentrated strain and thereby being damaged. In addition, since the pressure plate is connected to the fixed structure, as time passes, the elastic element can still apply a sufficient elastic action force to the electronic component, thereby forming stable and reliable thermal contact between the electronic component and the heat dissipating component.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the electronic component is accommodated in a housing and electrically connected to a printed circuit board, wherein the fixed structure is a portion of the heat dissipating component or of the housing or of the printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the pressure plate is firmly attached to the fixed structure.

This is especially advantageous in the case where the electronic apparatus is an onboard electronic apparatus, such as an onboard AC-DC converter or DC-AC converter or DC-DC converter. This is because the running of a motor vehicle will be accompanied by vibration of the onboard electronic apparatus; such vibration might cause loosening of the thermal contact between the electronic component and the heat dissipating component, thereby weakening the heat dissipation effect.

Thus, the position of the elastic element <b>30</b> can be held relative to the pressure plate, and since the pressure plate is fixed relative to the housing or the heat dissipating component, the elastic element is also not easy to move relative to the heat dissipating component, and can thereby apply a stable action force to the electronic component.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Of course, those skilled in the art will also be able to envisage other positioning structures to hold the elastic element in place. For example, in the case where the elastic element is a coil spring or elastic element, a receiving seat for the coil spring or elastic element may be provided in the pressure plate, the receiving seat being matched in shape to the coil spring or elastic element.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The heat dissipation device proposed in the present invention also advantageously simplifies manufacturing and assembly process steps. In prior art in which an elastic clip is used, in order to enable the elastic clip to apply a sufficient action force to the electronic component, it is often necessary to complete a process step of elastic clip deformation with the aid of an automatic press machine, and this is time-consuming and laborious. In the present invention, all of the assembly process steps can be completed at one workstation; all that need be done is to stack the heat conducting layer, electronic component, electrical insulation sheet, elastic element and pressure plate in sequence and then fix the pressure plate. The operation is simple and convenient, and there is no need for an additional installation apparatus to be introduced.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further features of the present invention can be found in the claims, the drawings, and the description of the drawings.
