No. 17/081,911, filed Oct. 27, 2020, and entitled ASSITED CATHETER ADVANCEMENT, which claims the benefit of United Stated Provisional Patent Application No. 62/934,370, filed Nov. 12, 2019, and entitled ASSISTED CATHETER ADVANCEMENT, which are incorporated herein in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids into a patient such as saline solution, medication, total parenteral nutrition, etc. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter is an over-the-needle peripheral intravenous catheter (&#x201c;PIVC&#x201d;). Other common types of catheters include, but are not limited to, peripherally inserted central catheters (&#x201c;PICC&#x201d;), central venous catheters (&#x201c;CVC&#x201d;), etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As its name implies, the over-the-needle PIVC may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. The PIVC and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the PIVC with the bevel of the needle facing away from skin of the patient. The PIVC and the introducer needle are typically inserted at a shallow angle through the skin and into a blood vessel of the patient, such as an artery, a vein, or any other vasculature of the patient. Once the PIVC has been properly placed within the blood vessel, the introducer needle may be withdrawn and the PIVC may be secured within the blood vessel by securing a catheter adapter (coupled with the PIVC) to the skin of the patient with dressing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some PIVC's can be associated with various additional components, such as valving components, needle safety components, etc., which may provide many additional useful features to clinicians. However, these additional components may also introduce undesirable characteristics to a PIVC system. For example, these additional components may lead to: (1) an increased overall length of a PIVC system, requiring a longer introducer needle; (2) new sources of friction transmitted to the introducer needle via the additional/longer components (e.g., the introducer needle may experience higher early stage drag forces as the introducer needle is withdrawn/advanced through the additional/longer components. This may interfere with a clinician's tactile sensation and ability to properly place and maintain a catheter within a patient's vein); and (3) an increased length of the introducer needle that is unsupported by other components of the PIVC system as the introducer needle is withdrawn from the other components of the PIVC system. This longer &#x201c;unsupported portion&#x201d; of the introducer needle may result in increased flexion that can allow other parts of the PIVC system to &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; back and forth in a flimsy manner and may result in dislodgment of the catheter from the vein. Accordingly, improved catheter assemblies, systems, and methods would be desirable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure generally relates to catheter assemblies, systems, and methods.

The needle-safety shield <b>200</b> may generally include a needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> disposed at a distal end <b>202</b> of the needle-safety shield <b>200</b>, and a ramp member portion (or ramp member <b>220</b>) disposed at a proximal end <b>201</b> of the needle-safety shield <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> may include a contact surface <b>215</b> at a distal end of the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b>. The needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> may be configured to internally trap a distal end of the introducer needle <b>120</b> to protect a clinician against accidental exposure to the sharp distal end of the introducer needle <b>120</b>. The needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> (and/or the ramp member <b>220</b>) may further include one or more internal septa (not shown), which may be configured to facilitate the proper valving of fluids in a catheter system that utilizes the modified needle-safety shield <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In at least some embodiments, the ramp member <b>220</b> may be integrally formed with the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b>. For example, the ramp member <b>220</b> may be integrally formed with the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> via an injection molding process. However, it will also be understood that in other embodiments, the ramp member <b>220</b> may not be integrally formed with the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b>. For example, the ramp member <b>220</b> and the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> may be separately formed and then coupled together via an adhesive process, or not coupled together at all. Moreover, in some catheter system embodiments, the ramp member <b>220</b> may be utilized without the needle-safety shield portion <b>210</b> to form a simple intermediate member. In yet further embodiments, the ramp member <b>220</b> may be combined with any number of different components in order to form any number of different intermediate members that incorporate the ramp member <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In general, the ramp member <b>220</b> may include a first ramp surface <b>221</b>, a second ramp surface <b>222</b>, a third ramp surface <b>223</b>, a fourth ramp surface <b>224</b>, a first plateau portion <b>231</b>, a second plateau portion <b>232</b>, a first stop bump <b>241</b>, a second stop bump <b>242</b>, and a ramp projection <b>250</b> having ramp needle aperture <b>251</b> formed therethrough.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each ramp surface may be angled relative to an introducer needle <b>120</b> that may pass through the ramp needle aperture <b>251</b>. A magnitude or steepness of an angle associated with a given ramp surface will generally determine a magnitude of a distally directed force that may be generated by a driving spring pressing against the ramp surface, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, each ramp surface may also include a surface portion that includes a concave shape. For example, the first ramp surface <b>221</b> may include a first concave surface portion, the second ramp surface <b>222</b> may include a second concave surface portion, the third ramp surface <b>223</b> may include a third concave surface portion, and the fourth ramp surface <b>224</b> may include a fourth concave surface portion. Moreover, each concave surface portion may have a radius that is associated with each concave surface portion. For example, the first concave surface portion may have a first radius, the second concave surface portion may have a second radius, the third concave surface portion may have a third radius, and the fourth ramp surface may have a fourth radius. In at least one embodiment, each of the first radius, the second radius, the third radius, and the fourth radius may be substantially equal to each other. However, it will also be understood that in other embodiments the first radius, the second radius, the third radius, and/or the fourth radius may be similar and/or different from each other in any combination.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A magnitude of a radius associated with a concave ramp surface will generally determine a maximum force and a minimum force that may be generated by a driving spring pressing against the concave ramp surface (which will be discussed in more detail below). The radius of the concave ramp surface will also determine transitional force characteristics that are imparted to an introducer needle as the driving springs moves along the concave ramp surface between the top of the concave ramp surface (maximum force) toward the bottom of the concave ramp surface (minimum force). For example, a concave ramp surface may be designed with a radius that substantially normalizes early stage drag forces that are experienced by an introducer needle (e.g., when a clinician first begins withdrawing the introducer needle from a catheter system), by applying an appropriate maximum force to the introducer needle early during withdrawal. However, as the clinician continues to withdraw the introducer needle from the catheter system, the drag forces experienced by the introducer needle will typically decrease. Accordingly, the radius of the concave ramp surface also helps the introducer needle maintain a normalized drag force profile on the introducer needle as it is withdrawn from the catheter system by continuously reducing the force applied to the introducer needle as the driving spring moves along the concave ramp surface and transitions between the maximum force (e.g., when the driving spring is at the top of the concave ramp surface) toward the minimum force (e.g., when the driving spring is at the bottom of the concave ramp surface).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the first stop bump <b>241</b> may be located adjacent to and/or intermediate the first and second ramp surfaces <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and the first plateau portion <b>231</b>, and the second stop bump <b>242</b> may be located adjacent to and/or intermediate the third and fourth ramp surfaces <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> and the second plateau portion <b>232</b>. The shape of the first and second plateau portions <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and the first and second stop bumps <b>241</b>, <b>242</b> may help to bias a driving spring to keep it in place on top of the ramp member <b>220</b> (e.g., fully loaded onto the ramp member <b>220</b>) until a clinician is ready to withdraw the introducer needle from the catheter system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ramp projection <b>250</b> may also help reduce flexion and &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; in an introducer needle passing through the ramp needle aperture <b>251</b>. The ramp projection <b>250</b> may accomplish this by decreasing a length of the introducer needle that is unsupported by other components of the catheter system when the introducer needle is at least partially withdrawn from the catheter system.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate various views of a resilient member or driving spring <b>300</b>, according to some embodiments.

The second resilient portion <b>342</b> may couple the first spring arm <b>311</b> to the third spring arm <b>313</b> and the first resilient portion <b>341</b> may couple the second spring arm <b>312</b> to the fourth spring arm <b>314</b>.

In these embodiments, the first ramp surface <b>221</b> may be configured to receive the first guide surface <b>331</b> of the first cross-member <b>321</b>, the second ramp surface <b>222</b> may be configured to receive the second guide surface <b>332</b> of the first cross-member <b>321</b>, the third ramp surface <b>223</b> may be configured to receive the third guide surface <b>333</b> of the second cross-member <b>322</b>, and the fourth ramp surface <b>224</b> may be configured to receive the fourth guide surface <b>334</b> of the second cross-member <b>322</b>. In this manner, the driving spring <b>300</b> may be configured to engage the ramp member <b>220</b> (once it has been loaded onto the ramp member <b>220</b>) and impart a force on the needle-safety shield <b>200</b> to urge the needle-safety shield <b>200</b> in a distal direction relative to the needle hub <b>130</b>.

This, in turn, may urge the catheter <b>770</b> in the distal direction relative to the introducer needle <b>710</b>. In this manner, drag forces experienced by the introducer needle <b>710</b> (from other components in the catheter system <b>700</b>) may be reduced and/or normalized in order to provide a uniform drag force to the clinician to help the clinician guide the catheter <b>770</b> into a blood vessel of a patient.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>800</b> for inserting a catheter into a blood vessel of a patient, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The method <b>800</b> may be facilitated through use of a catheter assembly or catheter system comprising an introducer needle coupled to a needle hub, an intermediate member having a contact surface disposed at a distal end of the intermediate member, a resilient member coupled to one of the needle hub and the intermediate member, and a ramp member coupled to the other one of the needle hub and the intermediate member.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The method <b>800</b> may begin with a step <b>810</b> in which a distal end of the introducer needle may be inserted into a blood vessel of a patient by a clinician.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Once the clinician has inserted the distal end of the introducer needle into the blood vessel of the patient, the method <b>800</b> may proceed to a step <b>820</b> in which the clinician may advance the intermediate member proximally relative to the introducer needle.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Once the clinician has advanced the intermediate member proximally relative to the introducer needle, the method <b>800</b> may proceed to a step <b>830</b> in which the resilient member may be engaged with a ramp surface of the ramp member to impart a force on the intermediate member and urge the intermediate member in a distal direction relative to the needle hub.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Once the resilient member has been engaged with the ramp surface and a force has been imparted on the intermediate member to urge the intermediate member in the distal direction relative to the needle hub, the method <b>800</b> may proceed to a step <b>840</b> in which a contact surface of the intermediate member may be engaged with a proximal surface of a catheter adapter body to urge the catheter adapter body in the distal direction relative to the needle hub.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Once the catheter adapter body has been urged in the distal direction relative to the needle hub, the method <b>800</b> may proceed to a step <b>850</b> in which the catheter coupled to the catheter adapter body may be urged in the distal direction relative to the introducer needle. In some embodiments, the catheter coupled to the catheter adapter body may be urged in the distal direction relative to the introducer needle in order to insert a distal end of the catheter into the blood vessel or further advance the introducer needle within the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the method <b>800</b> may also proceed to any one or more of steps <b>860</b>, <b>870</b>, and/or <b>880</b>. For example, once the catheter has been urged in the distal direction relative to the introducer needle, the method <b>800</b> may proceed to the step <b>860</b> and/or the step <b>870</b> in which the needle hub and the introducer needle may be moved in a proximal direction relative to the catheter and the introducer needle may be fully, or at least partially, withdrawn from the catheter. Once the introducer needle has been at least partially withdrawn from the catheter, the method <b>800</b> may further proceed to the step <b>880</b> in which the introducer needle may be grasped between first and second cross-members of the resilient member as the introducer needle is at least partially withdrawn from the catheter, and the method <b>800</b> may end.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Any methods disclosed herein include one or more steps or actions for performing the described method. One or more of the method steps and/or actions may be omitted from any of the methods disclosed herein. Moreover, any of the method steps and/or actions may be interchanged with one another. In other words, unless a specific order of steps or actions is required for proper operation of the embodiment, the order and/or use of specific steps and/or actions may be modified.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It will be understood that any number of different driving spring configurations and/or styles may be utilized with the general concepts disclosed in the present invention to reduce early stage drag forces that are imparted on an introducer needle within a given catheter system. For example, other driving spring configurations contemplated herein may include a helical spring configuration (not shown) that may be utilized to impart a force on an intermediate member to reduce early stage drag forces that are imparted on an introducer needle within a given catheter system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, any number of ramp surfaces, configurations, and/or shapes are contemplated herein to achieve a desired force profile that will optimally reduce and/or normalize drag forces imparted on an introducer needle for a given catheter system, without departing from the spirit or scope of the present application. Thus, the number of ramp surfaces, plateaus, and stop bumps, as well as their configurations and/or shapes, can be varied in order to fine-tune any number of parameters including, but not limited to: (1) release timing for the driving spring; (2) the smoothness of the driving spring before/during release of the driving spring and/or during actuation of the driving spring along its full range of motion; (3) adjusting the maximum and/or minimum forces provided by the driving spring; (4) adjusting any transitional characteristics of the driving spring force as the driving spring transitions between a given maximum and minimum force; (5) adjusting an average force provided by the driving spring (e.g., either through adjusting an angle of a ramp and/or by adjusting a strength of the driving spring itself), etc.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will also be noted that in at least some embodiments, a maximum driving force may be chosen that will not exceed the drag forces applied to the introducer needle by a given catheter system.
