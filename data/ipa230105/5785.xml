The oxygen pressure, in turn, may be affected, for example, by the detailed properties of the vacuum chamber and the oxygen supply arrangement. To ensure accurate control of the oxygen dose, the molecular oxygen may be supplied into the vacuum chamber for an oxidation period which is at least 0.5 seconds, for example, at least about 1 second, preferably at least 10 seconds. Increasing the length of the oxidation period may enable better control of the oxygen dose.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a result of said oxygen supply with said oxidation pressure, oxidation time, and oxidation temperature of the silicon substrate, the oxygen supplied into the vacuum chamber is at least partially adsorbed onto the deposition surface and diffuses into the silicon substrate. Consequently, a crystalline silicon oxide layer with a thickness of at least two molecular layers is formed within the silicon substrate, between a crystalline silicon base layer and a crystalline silicon top layer. In other words, a SOI structure with crystalline silicon oxide SiO<sub>x </sub>layer as a dielectric layer is formed below a crystalline silicon top layer. Thereby, the method comprises forming a crystalline silicon oxide layer within an existing silicon crystal, without any need, for example, for additional deposition steps to form the crystalline silicon top layer. Then, the top layer may have basically or mostly the same diamond cubic crystal structure as the base layer. &#x201c;Basically&#x201d; and &#x201c;mostly&#x201d; refer to the fact that the crystalline silicon oxide layer may have a crystal structure deviating from the diamond cubic crystal structure, and that may have some effect on the crystal structure of the silicon top layer also, at least close to the Si/SiO<sub>x </sub>interface. On the other hand, the (2&#xd7;1)+(1&#xd7;2) reconstruction of the free surface of the crystalline silicon top layer affects the crystal structure of the top layer close to said free surface thereof.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to established understanding in the art, when oxidizing crystalline silicon using known methods, the oxygen incorporation sites in the crystal lie at the deposition surface; see e.g. Miyamoto et al., Physical Review B 43, 9287, 1991.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, the above method is based on a surprising observation that with suitably selected novel combination of the oxidation parameters, oxygen adsorbed onto the deposition surface may be made diffuse through a surface or top layer of the silicon substrate so that crystalline oxide is formed within the bulk silicon crystal clearly below the deposition surface. At the same time, silicon atoms from the bulk crystal of the silicon substrate may diffuse towards the outermost surface due to the incorporation of the oxygen atoms into the silicon substrate. Such diffused silicon atoms may form new structures on the deposition surface. The crystal structure of the crystalline oxide SiO<sub>x </sub>layer may be different from the diamond lattice of bulk silicon.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The semiconductor structure <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, comprising a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structure, may be manufactured using a method as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Appropriate adjustment of the thickness of the crystalline SiO<sub>x </sub>layer may be used, for example, to adjust the tunneling through SiO<sub>x </sub>layer in the semiconductor structure.

The sample holder was transferred into a manipulator located in a vacuum chamber of a multi-chamber vacuum system, and the Si sample was repeatedly rapidly heated up to a cleaning temperature of 1100 to 1200&#xb0; C. to remove the native oxide and carbon contaminants from the Si (<b>100</b>) deposition surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm that the oxygen and carbon contaminants were effectively removed/desorbed from the deposition surface. Furthermore, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis showed a sharp (2&#xd7;1)+(1&#xd7;2) reconstruction arising from an inherent double-domain surface structure. Scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) images captured after the surface cleaning supported the presence of the double-domain reconstruction on large two-dimensional terraces.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the cleaning phase, the Si sample with the clean Si (<b>100</b>) deposition surface was oxidized in the same vacuum system, using O<sub>2 </sub>gas introduced into the vacuum chamber via a leak valve.

Due to the inherent property of STS being most sensitive to the outermost atomic layer of the sample to be investigated, the measured tunneling gap may be assumed not representing the SiO<sub>x </sub>gap. This assumption has been confirmed by STM analysis of samples, showing no presence of any oxygen on the surface thereof Instead, it may be assumed that the oxygen incorporated within the bulk below the outermost Si surface causes bending of the valence and conductive bands, increasing the band gap between the conductive band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) at the outermost surface layers of the oxidized Si sample comprising the SOI structure.
