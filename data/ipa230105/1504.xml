In particular, the bumpers of advanced automobiles are equipped with backup warning sensors (BWS). To install these sensors on the bumper, the bumper is perforated by punching and the brackets or holders are welded thereto. According to a quality standard, ultrasonic techniques must be used in punching and welding processes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, an ultrasonic punching/welding apparatus designated for each type of bumper is used for the process. However, with punching/welding machines designated for each type of bumper as above, only one vehicle bumper model can be produced for each machine. Each bumper model has a different shape and size for each vehicle. That is, the size of hole and the punching angle vary depending on the bumper model. Therefore, each machine designated for each bumper model is available only for a limited period of time, and once a mass production is completed, the machine is not used frequently but occasionally, thus occupying much space in the factory.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and, therefore, it may contain information that does not constitute prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention include production of parts for after-service following the mass production (bumpers, as well as other parts that have to be punched and welded) or production of regular parts during mass production. By replacing various manual punching/welding machines designated for each of various types of parts with one (1) universal manual punching/welding machine, space efficiency may be increased and costs reduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a manual universal punching and welding apparatus including a body frame having at least a vertical wall; a pair of supporting arms that may be attached to the body frame and clamping a portion of the work object, wherein each supporting arm may include a plurality of joints for rotating the clamped work object in different directions, and a vertical moving part for raising and lowering the clamped work object; a punching head that may rotate clockwise and counterclockwise in a plane defined by the vertical wall of the body frame, including a work object loading part, that may support and load the work object together with one of the pair of supporting arms, and a punching part that may punch the loaded work object; and a welding part for welding the work object loaded on the work object loading part of the punching head.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, for punching and welding by supporting the work object, there is provided a manual universal punching and welding method including clamping a portion of a work object with a supporting arm that may rotate in different directions by a plurality of joints and be raised and lowered by a vertical moving part; by supporting and loading a portion different from the clamped portion of the work object with a loading part of a punching head rotating the loaded work object clockwise and counterclockwise on a vertical plane; and welding the work object loaded on the work object loading part of the punching head.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The configuration and operation of the present invention may become more apparent through specific embodiments described below together with the drawings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As for an efficiency of the present invention, a single manual punching/welding to apparatus (occupying an area of about 282 ft<sup>2</sup>) may produce all types of parts that use punching and welding. If twenty-two (22) manual punching/welding apparatuses (occupying an area of about 7,520 ft<sup>2</sup>) were designated for each type of part and used, the occupied area would increase by 96.25% compared to that of the universal machine of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, compared to the maintenance of a large number of designated machines, only one universal machine would desire maintenance, which greatly reduces the burden of overall maintenance.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the universal punching/welding apparatus and method according to the present invention, only one worker is used for operation due to its structure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention, and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an overall view of a manual universal punching/welding apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a detailed configuration diagram of the supporting arm.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b></figref> illustrate examples of various changes in positions of the supporting arm.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the punching head is vertically erected to perform a punching operation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the punching head is rotated counterclockwise to perform a punching operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a welder guide coupled to a welder of the welding part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a scene in which ultrasonic welding is performed on a bumper using the welder equipped with the welder guide.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are illustrated.

This embodiment deals with a case where the object to be punched/welded is an automobile bumper, but embodiments are not limited thereto. The punching/welding apparatus may be used for other types of automobile body parts or other parts as may be determined by one skilled in the art. Embodiments described herein may allow those skilled in the art to understand the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The manual universal punching/welding apparatus according to embodiments of the present invention includes a body frame <b>10</b>; a pair of supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>located on both sides of the body frame <b>10</b> configured to support a portion of a bumper; a punching head <b>30</b> located at substantially a central portion of the body frame <b>10</b> configured to punch at a punching position of the bumper; and a welding part <b>40</b> for ultrasonic welding to a bracket configured to mount a sensor and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a detailed configuration diagram of a supporting arm <b>20</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pair of supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are provided on both sides of the body frame <b>10</b> to support each end of the bumper to be machined.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each supporting arm <b>20</b><i>a </i>or <b>20</b><i>b </i>embodied in supporting arm <b>20</b> has three rotatable joints so that free positioning and fixing with three rotatable joints is possible. Each rotatable joint may be fixed in position by a brake system using one or more air cylinder(s). Degrees of freedom are improved by the rotation of the three joints in different directions, and these high degrees of freedom of the supporting arm makes it sufficient to fix and move the bumper with only one person (worker).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The three rotatable joints include a base rotatable part <b>210</b>, a clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b>, and a clamp rotatable part <b>230</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is configured to horizontally rotate the entire structure of the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>; the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is configured to horizontally rotate the clamp arm (described below); and the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is configured to vertically rotate the clamping assembly (described below) configured to hold the bumper.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Horizontal, vertical, and other rotation terms are relative to the parts illustrated and are not intended to limit the movement of the described parts in any particular direction. For example, if the body frame <b>10</b> is mounted on a slanted or vertical surface, the horizontal and vertical orientations will shift relative to an overall directional system, but not relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In more detail, the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is configured to be rotatably coupled to the body frame <b>10</b> and may be composed of a main column <b>212</b> connected to a baseplate <b>211</b> of the entire structure of the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The baseplate <b>211</b> is a circular member that receives the main column <b>212</b> and provides for rotation thereof. A housing <b>201</b> is mounted to the body frame <b>10</b> and has an opening to receive the baseplate <b>211</b>. The baseplate is further mounted to the body frame <b>10</b> using a shaft (not illustrated) to allow the baseplate <b>211</b> to be rotatably fixed to the body frame <b>10</b> to move within the housing <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The base rotatable part <b>210</b> allows the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>to reach a desired location and support all bumper sizes and shapes. The base rotatable part <b>210</b> may horizontally rotate about the body frame <b>10</b> in a range of up to about 150&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is coupled to back ends of two cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b>. Front ends of the cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> are pivotally coupled to a bracket <b>243</b> and are configured to extend in the transverse direction at the upper part of a main column <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Pivot axes <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>a </i>are provided for the two cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> to rotate relative to the main column <b>212</b>. The terms front end and back end are used for identification purposes, are interchangeable, and are not meant to limit the structure in any way.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A clamp arm <b>221</b> extending in the transverse direction is pivotally coupled to the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> so as to rotate horizontally in a circular motion. The clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is a second horizontal rotatable part in addition to the base rotatable part <b>210</b> and enables the worker to position a clamp assembly <b>236</b> in all positions desired to load a bumper.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At one end of the clamp arm <b>221</b>, the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is pivotally coupled to rotate the clamp assembly <b>236</b> substantially perpendicular to the rotation direction of the clamp arm <b>221</b>. The clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> rotates on a vertical plane along an axis of the clamp arm <b>221</b> so that the worker may position a bumper held by the clamp assembly <b>236</b> in a punching position which is optimally supported and fixed for each bumper type.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The clamp assembly <b>236</b> is adapted to grip a bumper using two gripping pads <b>233</b> and <b>233</b>&#x2032; included therein. A fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is disposed in a fixed in position. A movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; is configured to be variable in position so that the spacing between the gripping pads <b>233</b> and <b>233</b>&#x2032; may be widened and narrowed as desired. Although labeled fixed, the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> may also move position, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is fixed by the fixed gripping arm <b>231</b> having a substantially L-shape in combination with the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> fixed to the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> by way of the clamp arm <b>221</b>, and a connecting rod <b>232</b> connecting the gripping arm <b>231</b> and the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b>. By adjusting the length of the connecting rod <b>232</b>, the position of the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> may be slightly adjusted if desired.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; may have a variable spacing in relation to the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> by using a toggle handle <b>234</b>. To this end, the toggle handle <b>234</b>, a movable gripping arm <b>231</b>&#x2032; moved by the toggle handle <b>234</b>, and a connecting rod <b>232</b>&#x2032; connecting the movable gripping arm <b>231</b>&#x2032; and the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032;, are provided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, there is an air cylinder <b>240</b> configured to vertically move the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> at the front ends of the cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> to raise and lower the loading position of a bumper. An upper portion of the air cylinder <b>240</b> is coupled to the lower cantilever <b>241</b> at the pivot axis <b>241</b><i>a</i>. The front ends of the two cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> arranged one above the other are pivotally coupled via the bracket <b>243</b> to the upper part of the main column <b>212</b>. The air cylinder <b>240</b> is also pivotally coupled to a terminal end of the cantilever <b>241</b> beyond the pivot axis <b>241</b><i>a</i>. A coupling part <b>244</b> is used to couple the air cylinder <b>240</b> to the cantilever <b>241</b>. Using this configuration, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> at back ends of the cantilevers <b>241</b>, <b>242</b> may be lifted and lowered by the action of the air cylinder <b>240</b>. The air cylinder <b>240</b> may adjust a bumper loading weight using a weight high/low regulator. The height may be fixed using a brake mechanism.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this way, it is possible to set the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> to an optimum height for the size of a bumper by using a cylinder and a pneumatic circuit. The height of the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> has an adjustable range to accommodate all bumper sizes, shapes, required hole punching positions, etc. According to one embodiment, vertical height adjustment is possible within a range of up to 700 mm.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, each of rotatable parts, i.e., the base rotatable part <b>210</b>, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b>, and the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b>, may be regulated in rotation and fixed in position by an air cylinder (not illustrated) dedicated to each of rotatable parts. The lock and unlock of the air cylinder <b>240</b> vertically moving the air cylinders of these each of rotatable parts and the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> at the back ends of the cantilevers <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> may be controlled by a lock/unlock switch <b>250</b>. The air cylinder may be controlled by controlling the air pressure from a compressor (not illustrated) by using the lock/unlock switch <b>250</b>.

To this end, it is possible to utilize a brake mechanism used in a pneumatic system.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this way, the air cylinder is fixed to the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>so that the height and rotation position of the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>may be easily adjusted and fixed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>6</b></figref> illustrate examples of various changes in positions of the supporting arm <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is such that the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>are positioned outward, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is positioned at a medium height, the clamp arm <b>221</b> extends straight, the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is rotated vertically, and the spacing of the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; with respect to the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is narrowed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is such that the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>are positioned outward, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is positioned at a medium height, the clamp arm <b>221</b> is turned further inward as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is rotated horizontally, and the spacing of the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; with respect to the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is similar to the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is such that the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>are positioned outward similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is positioned downward from a medium height, the clamp arm <b>221</b> is turned slightly inward compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is rotated vertically, and the spacing of the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; with respect to the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is greatly widened.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the base rotatable part <b>210</b> is rotated by approximately 90&#xb0; so that the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>are positioned inward, the clamp arm rotatable part <b>220</b> is positioned downward from a medium height, the clamp arm <b>221</b> is turned outward as opposed to the cases of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the clamp rotatable part <b>230</b> is rotated vertically, and the spacing of the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; with respect to the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> is narrowed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, in the punching/welding apparatus of the present invention, the height and horizontal position of the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and the position and spacing of the clamp are freely adjustable, so that it is possible to accommodate any types of bumper models requiring punching and welding.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the structure of the supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>described above, although the conventional punching/welding machine configured to manufacture the bumper includes all types of jigs and two human forces are required to support and fix the bumper during the manufacturing process, supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>having a high degree of freedom of the present invention are designed to be freely adjustable in height and horizontal position and to accommodate all types of bumper models requiring punching. It also reduces the manpower requirements of existing manual punching machines from two to one worker.

The punching head <b>30</b> is rotatable by 90&#xb0; in the clockwise/counterclockwise direction in the plane defined by the vertical wall of the body frame <b>10</b>. Therefore, it is possible to easily perform side or corner punching in order to perforate holes for brackets configured to fix one or more sensors on the side or corner surfaces of the bent portions and both ends as well as the central flat surface of the bumper.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a situation in which the punching head <b>30</b> is vertically erected to punch at a punching position <b>51</b> on a central part of a bumper <b>50</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a situation in which the punching is performed at a punching position <b>53</b> at a bent corner portion of the bumper <b>50</b> by rotating the punching heads <b>30</b> about 20&#xb0; in the counterclockwise direction.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The punching head <b>30</b> includes a bumper loading part <b>310</b> connected to at a base part <b>312</b> and a punching part <b>320</b> at an upper portion thereof. The bumper <b>50</b> is two-point supported and loaded in a horizontal position by one of the aforementioned pair of supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the bumper loading part <b>310</b>, and the punching part <b>320</b> is lowered to the loaded bumper and punching process is performed at the punching position thereof. In other embodiments, the both supporting arms <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, as well as the bumper loading part <b>310</b> may be used for three-point support when punching or welding a bumper.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it can be noted that the punching head <b>30</b> is vertically erected in order to perform punching. The punching position <b>51</b> on the central part of the bumper <b>50</b> and the bumper <b>50</b> is supported and loaded by the left-side supporting arm <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the bumper loading part <b>310</b> of the punching head <b>30</b>. That is, a left corner fixing point <b>52</b> of the bumper <b>50</b> is gripped by the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> and the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; of the left-side supporting arm <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and the punching position <b>51</b> on the center part of the bumper <b>50</b> is supported by the bumper loading part <b>310</b>.

That is, the punching position <b>53</b> on the left corner bent portion of the bumper <b>50</b> is supported by the bumper loading part <b>310</b>, and a fixing point <b>54</b> on the right portion of the center part of the bumper <b>50</b> is gripped by the fixed gripping pad <b>233</b> and the movable gripping pad <b>233</b>&#x2032; of the right-side supporting arm <b>20</b><i>b</i>. At this time, the left-side supporting arm <b>20</b><i>a </i>rests (or puts on standby).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Because the conventional punching machines did not include any jigs, the worker had to hold the bumper during the process and so there was a safety problem. In addition, when punching a hole in a non-horizontal surface such as the side or corner portion of a bumper or a bent part, the worker may turn the bumper and hold it to the side. For this reason, depending on the size and shape of the bumper, a portion of the bumper may reach the floor and be damaged. However, by configuring the punching head <b>30</b> to rotate 90&#xb0; in both directions with respect to the body frame <b>10</b> as in the present invention, it is possible to load the bumper so that the bumper <b>50</b> does not reach the floor, and to perform punching at any position while the bumper is kept in a horizontally loaded state (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), and it is also possible to make the load/unload of the bumper simpler and easier for the worker.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The welding part <b>40</b> will be described. The welding part <b>40</b> is a component for welding (e.g., ultrasonic welding) the accessories (brackets, holders, etc.) for sensor installation to the punched bumper. The welding part <b>40</b> of the manual universal punching/welding apparatus of the present invention is the ultrasonic welding equipment. A characteristic part of the configuration of the invention ultrasonic welding equipment will be described.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Because ultrasonic welding is performed manually by a worker, human error occurs in a large amount and which is a high area for concern in the industry. According to the conventional manual welding, the worker has to position the welding tip vertically on the surface of the object to be welded, which may be difficult, and so it takes an excessive welding time, causing the problem in that the sensor holder or the bumper is easily burnt, so that the welding part after welding is uneven and that defect may occur in the bumper. These problems are also latent in the manual universal punching/welding apparatus of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The manual universal punching/welding apparatus of the present invention provides a welder guide to allow the worker to easily adjust the depth and angle of the ultrasonic welding to consistently perform good quality welding in order to respond to such worker's defects.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a welder <b>400</b> and a welder guide <b>410</b> among the components of the welding part <b>40</b>. The welder guide <b>410</b> includes a disk <b>411</b> coupled to the welder <b>400</b> and three prongs <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c </i>attached to protrude from the disk <b>411</b> axially toward the object to be welded. End caps <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b</i>, <b>414</b><i>c </i>are covered at the ends of each prong <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>. In addition, springs <b>413</b><i>a</i>, <b>413</b><i>b</i>, <b>413</b><i>c </i>are inserted in each of the prongs <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c </i>from each of the end caps <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b</i>, <b>414</b><i>c </i>to each of the medium parts of the prongs. Each spring <b>413</b><i>a</i>, <b>413</b><i>b</i>, <b>413</b><i>c </i>is independently elastic. At the center of the disk <b>411</b> there is a welding tip hole <b>415</b> to which an ultrasonic welding tip (not illustrated) is coupled.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is important to design the lengths of the prongs <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>. When a worker uses the welder <b>400</b> to perform ultrasonic welding, he/she places the welder guide <b>410</b> on the object to be welded (thereby three prongs <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c </i>are in contact around the welding position). Therefore, it should be designed with a perfect length that ensures consistent welding depth when applying force to the welder <b>400</b> and prevents welding burns or spots at the bumper welding position. In addition, the springs <b>413</b><i>a</i>, <b>413</b><i>b</i>, <b>413</b><i>c </i>absorb unevenness in the welding plane so that the ultrasonic welding may always be performed vertically.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a scene in which ultrasonic welding is performed on a bumper using the welder <b>400</b> equipped with the welder guide <b>410</b> configured as described above. The worker holds the welder <b>400</b> and contacts the end caps <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b</i>, <b>414</b><i>c </i>of the three prongs <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c </i>of the welder guide <b>410</b> to the welding surface of the bumper <b>50</b> and applies pressure to the welder <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because the welder guide <b>410</b> always has a 3-pronged attachment that ensures manual welding vertically, vertical welding is possible and thus consistent and uniform ultrasonic welding can be achieved. The welder guide <b>410</b> also constantly limits the welding depth to prevent the welding surface of the bumper from being burnt.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Until now, although the present invention has been described in detail through preferred embodiments of the present invention, those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a specific form different from the contents disclosed herein without altering the technical spirit or essential features thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As such, it should be understood that the embodiments described above are illustrative in all respects and not limiting.
