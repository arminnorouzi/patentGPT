incorporates by reference and claims priority to German patent application DE 10 2021 116 935.6 filed Jun. 30, 2021.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wing for an aircraft, comprising a main wing and a high lift assembly. Further aspects of the invention relate to a high lift assembly for such a wing, as well as to an aircraft comprising such a wing and/or comprising such a high lift assembly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The high lift assembly, which might be a leading edge high lift assembly or a trailing edge high lift assembly, comprises a high lift body, and a connection assembly for movably connecting the high lift body to the main wing, such that the high lift body can be moved relative to the main wing between a retracted position and at least one extended position. The high lift body may be formed as a slat or a droop nose in case of a leading edge high lift assembly and may be formed as a flap in case of a trailing edge high lift assembly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The connection assembly comprises a first connection element, such as a first track or a first linkage, and a second connection element, such as a second track or a second linkage. The first connection element is movably mounted to the main wing and is mounted, such as directly mounted, to the high lift body. The second connection element is movably mounted to the main wing and is mounted, such as directly mounted, to the high lift body in a position spaced apart from the first connection element in a span direction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, the connection assembly comprises a drive system that is provided at, such as fixedly mounted to, the main wing and that is connected to, such as indirectly connected to, the high lift body for driving, i.e. initiating movement, of the high lift body between the retracted position and the extended position. The drive system comprises a first drive unit and a second drive unit spaced apart from one another in the span direction. The first drive unit may be formed as a geared rotary actuator (GRA) and is drivingly coupled to the first connection element. The first drive unit may have a first input section coupled to a drive shaft, a first gear unit, and a first output section drivingly coupled to the first connection element. The second drive unit may be formed as a geared rotary actuator (GRA) and is drivingly coupled to the second connection element. The second drive unit may have a second input section coupled to the drive shaft, a second gear unit, and a second output section drivingly coupled to the second connection element. The first and second gear units may transform high rotational speed with low torque from the first and second input sections, i.e. from the drive shaft, into low rotational speed with high torque at the first and second output sections. The first output section may comprise a first drive pinion engaging the first connection element, and the second output section may comprise a second drive pinion engaging the second connection element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such wings are known in the art. For the wings known in the art, skew cases are possible, where the first and second connection elements or the first and second drive units do not move in sync and the high lift body might be skewed about a vertical axis. If one of the first and second connection elements is blocked or moves slower than the other, e.g. due to failure of the related first or second drive unit, the other one of the first and second connection elements driven by the still intact drive unit might be experiencing high loads and transferring these to the high lift body while skewed. To avoid these skew cases, it is known in the art to use skew sensors that detect skew of the high lift body. In such a way, the drive system can be disabled upon detection of a skew.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention may be embodied as a wing that does not require skew sensors and thereby reduce costs, complexity, and maintenance efforts.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention may include a connection assembly having a third connection element movably mounted to the main wing and mounted, such as directly mounted, to the high lift body. The third connection element may be arranged between the first connection element and the second connection element, such as centrally between and in parallel to the first connection element and the second connection element. The first connection element and the second connection element are mounted to the high lift body in a spanwise movable manner, i.e. in such a way that relative movement between the first or second connection element and the high lift body in the span direction is permitted at least to some extent. Additionally or alternatively, the first connection element and the second connection element are mounted to the main wing in a spanwise movable manner. The third connection element is mounted to the high lift body in a spanwise fixed manner, i.e. in such a way that relative movement between the third connection element and the high lift body in the span direction is restricted. This means, the spanwise position of the high lift body is solely defined by third connection element, which largely reduces constraint forces when the high lift body is skewed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In such a way, skew of the high lift body is not as harmful to the structure and can thus be tolerated. When skew cases can be tolerated, skew sensors can be eliminated or essentially reduced, thereby largely reducing costs, complexity and maintenance efforts in connection with the wing. This means, the present invention does not address skew cases by trying to avoid skew, but rather by making the structure tolerant to skew so that skew can be permitted to some extent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment, the first connection element and the second connection element are mounted to the high lift body in a way rotatable about a rotation axis extending in a wing-thickness direction, i.e. in such a way that relative rotation between the first or second connection element and the high lift body about a rotation axis extending in the wing-thickness direction is permitted, at least to some extent. In such a way, constraint forces between the high lift body and the first or second connection element can be further reduced when the high lift body is skewed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the third connection element may be mounted to the high lift body in a way rotatably fixed or rotatably controlled with respect to a rotation axis extending in the wing-thickness direction, i.e. in such a way that relative rotation between the third connection element and the high lift body about a rotation axis extending in the wing-thickness direction is restricted or permitted in a controlled manner, e.g. controlled by a gear or a linkage providing a defined rotation or a defined angular position speed, e.g. depending on the movement, position or speed of the third connection element relative to the main wing. In such a way, the angular position of the high lift body about the wing-thickness direction is defined by or at least depending on the third connection element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment, the first connection element and the second connection element are mounted to the high lift body in a way rotatable about a rotation axis extending in the span direction, i.e. in such a way that relative rotation between the first or second connection element and the high lift body about a rotation axis extending in the span direction is permitted, at least to some extent. The third connection element may be mounted to the high lift body in a way rotatably fixed or rotatably controlled with respect to a rotation axis extending in the span direction, i.e. in such a way that relative rotation between the third connection element and the high lift body about a rotation axis extending in the span direction is restricted or permitted in a controlled manner, e.g. controlled by a gear or a linkage providing a defined rotation or a defined angular position speed, e.g. depending on the movement, position or speed of the third connection element relative to the main wing. In such a way, the angular position of the high lift body about the span direction is solely defined by or at least depending on the third connection element. Additionally, constraint forces between the high lift body and the first or second connection element can be reduced also with respect to rotation about the span direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment, the first connection element is mounted to the high lift body via a first link plate and/or the second connection element is mounted to the high lift body via a second link plate. The first link plate is mounted to the first connection element rotatably, such as solely about a rotation axis extending in a chord direction, and is mounted to the high lift body rotatably about a rotation axis extending in a chord direction, so that by rotation of the first link plate the span distance between the mounting of the first link plate at the first connection element and the mounting of the first link plate at the high lift body, and thus the spanwise relative position of the link plate with respect to the high lift body, can be adapted. Additionally or alternatively, the second link plate is mounted to the second connection element rotatably, such as solely about a rotation axis extending in a chord direction, and is mounted to the high lift body rotatably about a rotation axis extending in a chord direction, so that by rotation of the second link plate the span distance between the mounting of the second link plate at the second connection element and the mounting of the second link plate at the high lift body, and thus the spanwise relative position of the link plate to the high lift body, can be adapted. Such link plates enable a very efficient spanwise movable mounting of the first and second connection elements to the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, the first link plate may be mounted to the first connection element by two spherical bearings spaced from one another in the chord direction to form together a rotation axis extending in the chord direction. Further, the first link plate is mounted to the high lift body by one spherical bearing to form rotation axes extending both in the chord direction and in the wing-thickness direction. Additionally or alternatively, the second link plate is mounted to the second connection element by two spherical bearings spaced from one another in the chord direction to form together a rotation axis extending in the chord direction. Further, the second link plate is mounted to the high lift body by one spherical bearing to form rotation axes extending both in the chord direction and in the wing-thickness direction. Such link plates enable a very efficient spanwise movable and rotatable mounting of the first and second connection elements to the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, the first link plate may be mounted to the high lift body by two spherical bearings spaced from one another in the chord direction to form together a rotation axis extending in the chord direction. Further, the first link plate is mounted to the first connection element by one spherical bearing to form rotation axes extending both in the chord direction and in the wing-thickness direction. Additionally or alternatively, the second link plate is mounted to the high lift body by two spherical bearings spaced from one another in the chord direction to form together a rotation axis extending in the chord direction. Further, the second link plate is mounted to the second connection element by one spherical bearing to form rotation axes extending both in the chord direction and in the wing-thickness direction. Such an orientation of the link plates also enables a very efficient spanwise movable and rotatable mounting of the first and second connection elements to the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment, the angular position of the high lift body about a rotation axis parallel to the span direction is adjustable by the third connection element, such as adjustable during the movement of the high lift body between the retracted and the extended positions. This can be realized in various way, such as by adjustment of the angle of the third connection element during movement or by a gear or kinematics between the third connection element and the high lift body. Adjusting of the angle of the high lift body during extension or retraction of the high lift body can have essential aerodynamic benefits. For example, it might be used to press a trailing edge of a slat-formed high lift body onto the surface of the main wing in order to seal a gap between the slat trailing edge and the main wing when the slat is moved between the retracted and the extended positions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment, the third connection element is not driven by the drive system, such as completely passive. This further prevents constraint forces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment, the first connection element is formed as a first track that is movably guided at the main wing and that is mounted to the high lift body. The first drive unit may have a first pinion drivingly engaging a toothed rack at the surface of the first track. Additionally or alternatively, the second connection element is formed as a second track that is movably guided at the main wing and that is mounted to the high lift body. The second drive unit may have a second pinion drivingly engaging a toothed rack at the surface of the first track. The first track and/or the second track may be in the form of an elongate support beam, such as a slat track, that is movably guided along the direction of its elongate extension along a predetermined path that can be curved or straight, such as by a roller or slide bearing. Such tracks provide efficient movable support of the high lift body and such a rack-and-pinion drive is a very compact and efficient drive of the first and second tracks.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an alternative embodiment, the first connection element is formed as a first linkage. The first linkage may comprise a first drive arm drivingly coupled to the first drive unit and at least one first link element rotatably coupled to the first drive arm and coupled to the high lift body. Additionally or alternatively, the second connection element is formed as a second linkage. The second linkage may comprise a second drive arm drivingly coupled to the second drive unit and at least one second link element rotatably coupled to the second drive arm and coupled to the high lift body. Such first and second connection elements formed as linkages can also provide efficient movable support of the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the third connection element is formed as a third track that is movably guided at the main wing and that is mounted to the high lift body. The third track may be an elongate support beam, such as a slat track, that is movably guided along the direction of its elongate extension along a predetermined path that can be curved or straight. Such a track provides efficient movable support of the high lift body. Alternatively, the third connection element might also be formed as a third linkage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the third track may extend elongated along a track longitudinal axis between a front end, an intermediate portion and a rear end. The front end is mounted to the high lift body, and the intermediate portion and/or the rear end are guided at the main wing for movement along the predetermined path. This relates to an efficient and compact track design.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The front end of the third track may be fixedly mounted to the high lift body, such that all degrees of freedom are fixed. In such a way, the third track can define the angular and spanwise position of the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The intermediate portion and/or the rear end of the third track may be guided at the main wing by a roller bearing. Additionally or alternative, the intermediate portion and/or the rear end of the third track can be guided at the main wing by a slide bearing. Such roller or slide bearings are very efficient, compact and reliable.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The roller bearing may include a rear roller unit mounted to the rear end of the third track, such as having a rotation axis in parallel to the span direction, and engaging a corresponding guide rail mounted to the main wing, such as fixedly mounted to a rib of the main wing. Such a rear roller at the third track relates to a very simple, compact, and lightweight design.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The guide rail may be formed such that the angular position of the high lift body about a rotation axis parallel to the span direction is adjusted by movement of the rear roller unit along the guide rail when the third track is moved along the predetermined path to move the high lift body between the retracted and the extended positions. The guide rail may be formed in a specifically curved manner to define the predetermined path of the third track such that the angular position of the third track and thus also the angular position of the high lift body are adjusted when the third track is moved along the predetermined path. This relates to a very simple and reliable way to adjust the angular position of the high lift body when moved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The roller bearing may comprise a pair of top-bottom rollers having a top roller unit may have a rotation axis in parallel to the span direction and engaging a surface of the third track from above, and a bottom roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the span direction and engaging a surface of the third track from below. The top roller unit and the bottom roller unit may be arranged in a position opposite one another across the third track. By such a pair of top-bottom rollers the third track can be supported in the wing-thickness direction. At the same time, the third track can be pivoted about the top or bottom roller unit, so that the position of the front end of the third track can be adjusted in the wing-thickness direction as required.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Likewise, the roller bearing may include a pair of lateral rollers having a first lateral roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the wing-thickness direction and engaging a surface of the third track from a first lateral side, and/or a second lateral roller unit having a rotation axis in parallel to the wing-thickness direction and engaging a surface of the third track from a second lateral side opposite the first side. The first lateral roller unit and the second lateral roller unit may be arranged in a position opposite one another across the third track. By such a pair of lateral rollers the third track can be supported in the span direction. At the same time, the third track can be pivoted about the first or second lateral roller unit, so that the position of the front end of the third track can be adjusted in the span direction as required.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The third track may have a profile including an upper flange portion, a lower flange portion, and a web portion connecting the upper and lower flange portions, so that a first recess is formed between the upper flange portion, the lower flange portion and the web portion at a first lateral side, and a second recess is formed between the upper flange portion, the lower flange portion and the web portion at a second lateral side opposite the first side. Further, the roller bearing comprises a pair of stud rollers having a first stud roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the span direction and reaching into the first recess at the first lateral side and engaging a surface of the upper or lower flange portion, and a second stud roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the span direction and reaching into the second recess at the second lateral side and engaging a surface of the upper or lower flange portion. This relates to a very lightweight structure and efficient support of the third track.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The third track may have a profile including a lower recess at the bottom side and/or an upper recess at the top side extending along the track longitudinal axis. The roller bearing comprises a lower stud roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the wing-thickness direction and reaching into the lower recess and engaging a surface of a first or a second inner wall of the lower recess. Additionally or alternatively, the roller bearing comprises an upper stud roller unit that may have a rotation axis in parallel to the wing-thickness direction and reaching into the upper recess and engaging a surface of a first or a second inner wall of the upper recess. This relates to a very lightweight structure and efficient support of the third track.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The third track may be connected to the main wing via a linkage. Such a linkage forms another way of guiding the third track at the main wing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular, the linkage may include a lateral link element rotatably mounted to the main wing and rotatably mounted to the third track at a lateral side, such as y in the area of the intermediate portion, wherein the rotation axes at the main wing and at the third track that may be parallel and/or extend in the wing-thickness direction. Such a lateral link element provides for a reliable guiding in the horizontal plane.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, the rear end of the third track may be connected to the main wing via the linkage. This enables an efficient guiding of the rear end of the third track, wherein the intermediate portion and/or the front end of the third track may or may not be additionally guided e.g. by the roller bearing.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, the linkage may comprise at least an A-link element, i.e. an A-shaped link element, rotatably mounted to the rear end of the third track and rotatably mounted to the main wing, such as to a rib of the main wing, that may be rotatably about a sole rotation axis in parallel to the span direction. Such an A-link relates to a very simple and reliable guiding of the rear and of the third track by a linkage and can be used to adjust the angular position of the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, the linkage may comprise an A-link element, i.e. an A-shaped link element, and an H-link element, i.e. an H-shaped link element. The A-link element is rotatably mounted to the rear end of the third track and rotatably mounted to the H-link element such as about a sole rotation axis in parallel to the span direction. The H-link element is rotatably mounted to the main wing, such as to a rib of the main wing that may be rotatable about a sole rotation axis in parallel to the span direction. Such an AH-linkage relates to another very simple and reliable guiding of the rear and of the third track by a linkage without constraint forces and allows a combination e.g. with a roller bearing engaging the third track to adjust the angular position of the high lift body.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The high lift assembly may be a leading edge high lift assembly and the high lift body is a leading edge high lift body, such as a slat or a droop nose. The skew tolerant connection assembly is particularly advantageous at the leading edge.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an alternative embodiment, the high lift assembly is a trailing edge high lift assembly and the high lift body is a trailing edge high lift body, such as a flap, which might be driven e.g. by a ball-screw actuator. The skew tolerant connection assembly is also advantageous at the trailing edge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to a further embodiment, the connection assembly comprises one or more further connection elements in the form of a track or in the form of a linkage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A further possible aspect of the present invention relates to a high lift assembly for the wing according to any of the afore-described embodiments.
