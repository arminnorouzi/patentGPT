For example, tungsten may be used as a metal fill material to form source contacts, drain contacts, metal gate fill, gate contacts, interconnects (e.g., horizontal features formed in a surface of a dielectric material layer), and vias (e.g., vertical features formed through a dielectric material layer to connect other interconnect features disposed there above and there below). Due to its relativity low resistivity, tungsten is also commonly used to form bit lines and word lines used to address individual memory cells in a memory cell array of a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As circuit densities increase and device features continue to shrink to meet the demands of the next generation of semiconductor devices, reliably producing tungsten features has become increasingly challenging. Issues such as voids and seams formed during a conventional tungsten deposition process become amplified with decreasing feature size and can detrimentally affect the performance and reliability of a device or even render a device inoperable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Shadow rings are utilized around the edge of a substrate during deposition of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tungsten (W) film in order to prevent deposition near the beveled edge of the substrate during seam suppressed tungsten film processes. However, the shadow ring has been shown to prevent effective treatment of the edges of the substrate during a nitrogen radical treatment operation performed subsequent to the CVD deposition. Preventing the effective treatment of the edges of the substrate causes a center to edge non-uniformity for the seam suppressed tungsten film due to a weak incubation delay near the edges of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, what is needed in the art are processing systems and methods that solve the problems described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The process chamber includes a chamber body, a substrate support disposed within the chamber body and having a top surface, a plurality of substrate lift pins disposed through the substrate support, and a shadow ring lift. The shadow ring lift is configured to raise and lower a shadow ring positioned around an edge of the top surface of the substrate support.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, another process chamber for substrate processing is described. The process chamber includes a chamber body, a substrate support disposed within the chamber body and having a top surface, a showerhead disposed within the chamber body and above the top surface of the substrate support, a plurality of substrate lift pins disposed through the substrate support, an annular liner disposed within the chamber body and circumscribing the substrate support, and a shadow ring spacer disposed on a portion of the annular liner. The shadow ring spacer is configured to hold a shadow ring positioned around an edge of the top surface of the substrate support at a first height from the showerhead.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In yet another embodiment, a method of processing a substrate is described. The method includes raising a shadow ring to a treatment position, wherein the shadow ring and a top surface of a substrate are separated by a treatment spacing, performing a nucleation process on the substrate within a process chamber, performing a differential inhibition process on the substrate within the process chamber, positioning the shadow ring and a plurality of substrate lift pins to a deposition position, and performing a deposition process on the substrate within the process chamber. The differential inhibition process is performed while the shadow ring is in the treatment position.

Moving the shadow ring enables the shadow ring to be positioned closer to a surface of a substrate during some process operations, but farther from the surface of the substrate during other process operations. In embodiments described herein, it is beneficial to have a shadow ring close to the surface of the substrate during deposition of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tungsten (W) film in order to prevent deposition near the beveled edge of the substrate during seam suppressed tungsten film processes. However, the close proximity of the shadow ring to the top surface of the substrate has been shown to prevent effective treatment of the edges of the substrate during a subsequent nitrogen radical treatment operation. The nitrogen radical treatment operation is performed subsequent to the CVD deposition and in the same process chamber. Preventing the effective treatment of the edges of the substrate causes a center to edge non-uniformity for the seam suppressed tungsten film due to a weak incubation delay near the edges of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As discussed herein, it has been found that changing the relative position of the shadow ring with respect to the top surface of the substrate during the radical treatment operation compared to the deposition operation improves the uniformity of treatment of the substrate near the edge. Therefore, different apparatus and methods for changing the distance between the shadow ring and the top surface of the substrate are described herein. In embodiments described herein, the shadow ring may also be described as a non-contact shadow ring.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> schematically illustrates an embodiment of a processing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>that may be used to perform bottom-up tungsten gapfill substrate processing methods described herein.

The treatment position includes having the substrate lift pins in a lowered position while the shadow ring is in a raised position with respect to the substrate <b>900</b>. The positioning of shadow ring may be adjusted to be higher or lower as desired. The shadow ring is raised prior to the activity <b>805</b>. Raising the shadow ring includes actuating a lift hoop in a vertically upward direction and using the shadow ring lift pins to raise the shadow ring. The substrate lift pins may remain in place while the shadow ring is actuated between the deposition and the treatment positions. Therefore, the substrate remains on top of and contacting the substrate support <b>122</b> during the treatment operation. During the raising of the shadow ring, the substrate support remains stationary to enable the overall distance between the shadow ring and a top surface of the substrate support to increase.

Typically, forming the differential inhibition profile includes exposing the nucleation layer <b>904</b> to the activated species of a treatment gas, e.g., the treatment radicals <b>906</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. Suitable treatment gases that may be used for the inhibition process include N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, or combinations thereof.

As described herein, it is beneficial to have a reduced distance between the substrate and the shadow ring during a deposition operation, but the close proximity of the shadow ring to the substrate causes non-uniform treatment during later process activities. The treatment may include both the nucleation operation and the differential inhibition operation or just the differential inhibition operation. In embodiments described herein, the proximity of the shadow ring to the substrate is changed between the deposition operations and the treatment operations to increase the spacing between the shadow ring and the substrate during the treatment/differential inhibition operations. In processes in which the treatment includes both the nucleation operation and the differential inhibition operation, the shadow ring may be in a raised position during both operations. In processes in which the treatment includes only the differential inhibition operation, the shadow ring may be in a lowered position during the nucleation operation, a raised position during the differential inhibition operation, and in a lowered position during the deposition operations.
