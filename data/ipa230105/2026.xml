More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and systems for manufacturing composite parts that utilize tooling positioned on one side of the part and a flexible bag positioned on the opposite side of the part.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Complex parts, such as those used in aerospace applications, are often manufactured from composite materials. Because many such parts include three-dimensional characteristics such as height, depth, curvature, contours, or features that intersect at angles up to 90 degrees, they may require extra tooling and/or handling to manufacture. Where the composite parts comprise materials such as thermoplastics, the skin may include several layers which are first laid up and consolidated prior to laying up of any substructure that may be fixed to the skin. Following consolidation, the substructure may be laid up and the combination may be placed in an oven or autoclave for application of heat and fusing of the substructure to the skin. Traditional approaches for constructing and joining components of composite parts therefore may include multiple disparate steps utilizing different tooling, resulting in additional expense and time required for manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present invention solve the above-mentioned problems and provide a distinct advance in the art of manufacturing composite parts. More particularly, embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for manufacturing composite parts from composite material which reduce the need for complex and costly components and lengthy manufacturing processes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various embodiments of the invention may provide a system for fusing composite structures including a composite part. The composite part may include a substructure having a flange and a raised segment. The flange may include a faying surface. The composite part may also include a skin having a first side and a second side opposite the first side. The second side of the skin has (A) another faying surface contacting the faying surface of the flange, and (B) an exposed portion not contacted by the substructure. The system may also include an insulation layer covering the flange opposite the faying surface of the flange and covering the exposed portion of the skin. The system may further include a tool having a shaping surface in a shape of an outer mold line. The shaping surface may receive (and may be in direct or indirect contact with) the first side of the skin. The system may further include a heating element supplying heat to the shaping surface. The system may still further include a vacuum bag covering the composite part such that the composite part is enclosed by the combination of the vacuum bag and the shaping surface of the tool.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments of the invention may also provide a method of fusing composite structures that includes laying a skin including an outer surface and an inner surface on a shaping surface of a tool configured to maintain the outer surface in a shape of an outer mold line. The inner surface of the skin may include a first faying surface. The method may also include laying a substructure on the inner surface of the skin. The substructure may include a flange and a raised segment. The flange may have a second faying surface contacting the first faying surface of the skin. The method may further include applying at least one insulation layer over the flange of the substructure and over exposed portions of the inner surface of the skin not in contact with the substructure, and applying a vacuum bag to cover the insulation, skin and the substructure such that the insulation, skin and the substructure are at least partly enclosed by the combination of the vacuum bag and the shaping surface of the tool. The method may further include applying heat to the shaping surface to fuse the substructure to the skin by melting along the first and second faying surfaces.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.

The scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A system <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with various aspects of the current invention for manufacturing complex composite parts is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The system <b>10</b> may broadly comprise a vessel <b>12</b> mostly or fully enclosing a tool <b>14</b>. The tool <b>14</b> includes a shaping surface <b>16</b> heated by heating elements <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The shaping surface <b>16</b> may be constructed to form an outer mold line&#x2014;such as the semi cylindrical outer mold line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>&#x2014;or another feature shape of a complex composite part to be manufactured. The complex composite parts manufactured with system <b>10</b> may include three-dimensional characteristics such as height, depth, curvature, contours, features that intersect at angles up to and including ninety degrees, or features that include a space between them. Such composite parts are often utilized in the manufacturing of aircraft, wherein various sections of an airplane, such as the wing, the tail, or the fuselage, may include dozens or hundreds of component pieces. An example of a composite part <b>20</b> that may be manufactured within the system <b>10</b> and using methods disclosed herein is a portion of an aircraft fuselage skin and substructure to be fused therewith, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The tool <b>14</b> generally supports a portion of the composite material used to make the composite part <b>20</b>. The tool <b>14</b> may be considered a layup tool, a welding or fusion tool, and/or a cure tool. In a preferred embodiment, the composite part <b>20</b> comprises thermoplastic polymers and the tool <b>14</b> is a welding or fusion tool for melting the thermoplastic polymers. Again, the tool <b>14</b> typically supports and is shaped to conform to the material that will define an outer mold line (OML) of the composite part <b>20</b>, which may be defined by an outer margin of the composite part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exemplary tool <b>14</b> may include a platform <b>26</b> and a base <b>28</b>. The platform <b>26</b> may comprise a facesheet or the like, and may include the shaping surface <b>16</b> upon which the composite material is placed and which has a complementary shape to the shape of the OML of the composite part <b>20</b>. The platform <b>26</b> rests upon the base <b>28</b>, which supports the weight of the platform <b>26</b>, the composite part <b>20</b> and other components of the system <b>10</b> discussed below. The platform <b>26</b>, including the shaping surface <b>16</b>, may be manufactured from material that can withstand a curing or fusing process while conducting heat to the composite part <b>20</b>, such as steel (e.g., A36 Steel), polyimide laminate, or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The base <b>28</b> may be comprised of the same or similar materials as the platform <b>26</b>, or may be comprised of different rigid material capable of supporting the platform <b>26</b>, the composite part <b>20</b> and other components of the system <b>10</b>. Preferably, the tool <b>14</b> also includes surfaces <b>30</b> peripheral to the shaping surface <b>16</b> and the composite part <b>20</b> (when assembled). The peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> may be substantially planar and/or may extend orthogonally away from adjacent portions of the shaping surface <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>. The peripheral surface <b>30</b> may be thermally isolated from the shaping surface <b>16</b> to reduce heat loss and avoid distortions associated with the different temperatures by creating a gap and thermal break filler (not shown). In another embodiment, the thermal isolation may be achieved by forming a thermal break <b>31</b> including a thinned transition region between the shaping surface <b>16</b> and peripheral surface <b>30</b> surrounded by laterally offset, opposite-facing semi cylindrical channels (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) extending along the flanges <b>42</b> to minimize heat transfer while retaining vacuum integrity. The peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> may be configured for relatively rapid cooling, for example by presenting increased surface area for heat transfer and/or comprising less insulative material (as discussed in more detail below), through contact with a cooling fluid, or otherwise without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the heating elements <b>18</b> generally provide heat sources for the platform <b>26</b> to facilitate fusing the components of the composite material together and produce a finished composite part <b>20</b>. The heating process may also&#x2014;simultaneously and/or serially&#x2014;consolidate layers or plies of components of the composite part <b>20</b> (such as skin, discussed in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The heating elements <b>18</b> may be installed below and/or integrated within the platform <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base <b>28</b> may define an internal chamber <b>32</b> immediately below the platform <b>26</b>, and the heating elements <b>18</b> may comprise heated coils <b>34</b> fixed adjacent distribution fans <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The heated coils <b>34</b> may operate to generate heated air and the distribution fans <b>36</b> may push the heated air through the internal chamber <b>32</b> for convective heating of a bottom surface of the platform <b>26</b> and conductive heating of the shaping surface <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment, evenly distributed heating of the shaping surface <b>16</b> may be improved by interposing a perforated diffuser <b>38</b> between the heating elements <b>18</b> and the bottom surface of the platform <b>26</b> within the internal chamber <b>32</b>. The perforated diffuser <b>38</b> may be shaped correspondingly to the bottom surface of the platform <b>26</b> and, in the illustrated embodiment, to the shaping surface <b>16</b> as well. The perforated diffuser <b>38</b> may comprise a sheet with regularly-spaced perforations therein for distributing the heated air more evenly over the bottom surface of the platform <b>26</b> and increasing a corresponding heat transfer coefficient of the tool <b>14</b>.

One of ordinary skill will also appreciate that alternative heating elements such as direct electric, joule heating, induction heating, oil heating, steam heating or the like may be utilized, and/or that an internal chamber may be omitted from a tool, within the scope of the present invention. Further, it is foreseen that thermocouples (not shown) may be spaced along the shaping surface <b>16</b> and/or platform <b>26</b> more generally for sensing temperature readings and reporting them back to a controller (also not shown) for increasing or decreasing output of the heating element(s) to achieve the desired temperature during fusing and/or consolidation processes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base <b>28</b> may also include insulation <b>40</b> for minimizing the loss of heat that would otherwise contribute to heating the shaping surface <b>16</b>.

The flanges <b>42</b> may, for example, be less than or equal to 6.35 mm (0.25 inches) thick or, more preferably, may be 3.175 mm (0.125 inches), and may extend substantially orthogonally from adjacent portions of the shaping surface <b>16</b>. The peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> preferably do not receive components of the composite part <b>20</b> during a fusing process. Moreover, the insulation <b>40</b> is preferably not applied over the outer portions of the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b>, nor over the opposite underside surfaces, so that heat transfer away from the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> may be increased (again, as discussed in more detail below), e.g., in instances where the tool <b>14</b> is cooled by surrounding air or other coolant fluid(s). According to embodiments of the present invention, peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> may be thermally isolated from shaping surface <b>16</b> by separation (e.g., where held in place by a thermally insulative material) or by creating a thermal break <b>31</b> between the shaping surface <b>16</b> and the peripheral surface <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and discussion above) thus minimizing the heat flow and shape distortion caused by thermal gradient(s) in combination with a non-zero thermal expansion coefficient. As noted above, the thermal break <b>31</b> may include a slip plane or a thin flexure area, which may provide relief of stresses caused by the differential expansion of the peripheral surface <b>30</b> and the shaping surface <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, the perforated diffuser <b>38</b> may curl from its otherwise constant and predominate curvature (e.g., in the shape of the OML) along opposite ends <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> adjacent the flanges <b>42</b>.

In this manner, heat transfer between the heated air of the internal chamber <b>32</b> and the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> may be reduced, thereby reducing the temperature along the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> during a fusing process while maintaining sufficient temperatures along adjacent portions of the shaping surface <b>16</b>. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that other configurations and/or structure may be utilized for cooling the peripheral surfaces within the scope of the present invention.

In contrast, portions of the insulation layer <b>86</b> overlying flanges <b>78</b> and similar portions of the substructure <b>68</b> presenting faying surfaces are preferably configured by taking into account the insulating value of the flanges <b>78</b> themselves (for example) and with a view to facilitating the above-referenced fusing and consolidation of the underlying plies of the skin <b>66</b>, as well as fusing the faying surfaces <b>80</b> to the faying surfaces <b>82</b> while maintaining the opposite surfaces <b>81</b> of the flanges <b>78</b> below melting point.

The vacuum bag <b>98</b> is generally manufactured from a flexible and resilient material such as cured silicone rubber, nylon, polyurethane and/or fiber-reinforced versions of the foregoing (or other similar materials) that allows the vacuum bag <b>98</b> to adapt to curvatures and contours of the part <b>20</b> and the platform <b>26</b>.

The flexible material of the vacuum bag <b>98</b> may be substantially or completely impermeable to the atmosphere and/or other gases that may be used as coolant fluid (see below). Preferably, the flexible material of the vacuum bag <b>98</b> is impermeable to atmosphere at a pressure differential of 103.421 kPa (15 psi). More preferably, the flexible material of the vacuum bag <b>98</b> is impermeable to atmosphere at a pressure differential of 689.476 kPa (100 psi) or greater.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should also be noted that it is preferable for the vacuum bag <b>98</b> to be smoothly distributed across and pressing squarely down upon the composite part <b>20</b> to optimize pressure supplied during consolidation processes (i.e., minimal bridging at interfaces with underlying structure). Preferably, the vacuum bag <b>98</b> makes direct contact with such underlying structure. However, the shapes of the substructure <b>68</b> may substantially restrict entry of the vacuum bag <b>98</b> into certain areas above exposed portions <b>84</b> of the skin <b>66</b>. For instance, the lower left-hand corner of the flange <b>81</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) may, in some embodiments, be curved (not shown), resulting in a pocket (not shown) beneath the curved portion of the flange <b>81</b> that a vacuum bag <b>98</b> is unlikely to fill properly. The skin <b>66</b> below such a pocket may&#x2014;in the absence of direct pressure applied by the vacuum bag <b>98</b> during a consolidation and/or heating process&#x2014;experience reduced consolidation. To reestablish direct contact with the vacuum bag <b>98</b> for proper consolidation, the pocket may be filled with a radius filler or the like, preferably comprising the same or similar material as the composite part <b>20</b>. Alternatively the heat sink <b>90</b> may be placed to engage the pocket and transfer the consolidation pressure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The vacuum bag <b>98</b> may also extend beyond the outer periphery of the composite part <b>20</b> to seal against the tool <b>14</b> and maintain compression pressure on the composite part <b>20</b> against the shaping surface <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the vacuum bag <b>98</b> may more particularly seal against the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> and other surfaces of the platform <b>26</b> immediately surrounding the periphery of the composite part <b>20</b>. As outlined above, the peripheral surfaces <b>30</b> are preferably configured (e.g., utilizing thinned flanges, increased surface area exposed to coolant fluid, lack of insulation, and/or other design factors) to be maintained at a temperature below a melting or decomposition temperature of the vacuum bag <b>98</b> during the fusing and consolidation processes.

Therefore, any system of units and/or test method known in the art may be used to compare the R-values of the relevant elements discussed herein. R-value is a measure of how well an object resists the conductive flow of heat, which is dependent on both the thermal conductivity property of the material from which the object is composed and the thickness of the object at the location where the R-value measurement is taken. It is possible to determine an object's R-value at a given location directly, in accordance with established international standards, e.g. according to the method of ASTM&#xae; C518-17 Standard Test Method for Steady-State Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Heat Flow Meter Apparatus. It is also possible to calculate an object's R-value at a given location knowing both its thickness at such location and the thermal conductivity (K-value) of the material comprising the object according to the following equation: R-value=1/(K-value/Thickness). Thermal conductivity coefficients or K-values outlined herein may also be determined using established international standards, including ASTM&#xae; C177-19 Standard Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus.

The skin may include an outer surface and an inner surface, and the shaping surface of the tool may be configured to maintain the outer surface of the skin in a shape of an outer mold line. Further, the inner surface of the skin may have a first faying surface.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The tool may include a base having a sidewall covered by a tool insulation layer.

The cooling portion may be sufficiently thin or otherwise configured so as to maintain each outer surface below a melting point of the vacuum bag during fusing of the substructure to the skin (again, see discussion below).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Laying up the skin may include layering multiple plies consecutively on top of one another. Advantageously, embodiments of the present invention may permit layering the plies without the need for intervening heating and/or rolling steps commonly associated with such layup processes. That is, typical AFP processes will heat and/or roll plies during a layup process in order to at least partly consolidate layers prior to fusing skin to substructure. Embodiments of the present invention may reduce or omit such heating and/or rolling steps, and instead perform much or all of the consolidation process concurrently with the fusing process.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In connection with step <b>702</b>, a substructure may be laid up on the inner surface of the skin. The substructure may include an outer margin which, like the skin, may be formed to the shape of the outer mold line by the support of the shaping surface of the tool. The substructure may include a flange and a raised segment fixed to and/or integral with the flange. The flange may include a second faying surface. The second faying surface of the substructure may be laid against and in contact with the first faying surface of the skin.

The method may include ensuring that no material is placed between the vacuum bag and the raised segment wherein the through-thickness R-value of such material at any location is more than one hundred (100) times the through thickness R-value of the raised segment at a corresponding adjacent location. The method may include ensuring that no material is placed between the vacuum bag and the raised segment wherein the through-thickness R-value of such material at any location is greater than ten (10) times the through thickness R-value of the raised segment at a corresponding adjacent location.

The release layer may comprise Polytetrafluoroethylene or other materials outlined above.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In connection with step <b>703</b>, at least one insulation layer may be applied over the flange of the substructure and over exposed portions of the inner surface of the skin not in contact with the substructure. The insulation layer may be sized and may consist of sufficient insulative materials so that application of heat to the shaping surface (during the fusing process described below) causes each of the plurality of composite layers of the skin to fuse with adjacent ones of the plurality of composite layers during the fusing of the substructure to the skin. In addition, the insulation layer may be sized and may consist of sufficient insulative materials so that the application of heat to the shaping surface during the fusing process causes the second faying surface and the first faying surface to melt and fuse with one another, joining the skin to the substructure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Moreover, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, discontinuous panels of the insulation layer may be consecutively laid&#x2014;e.g. beginning at a reference feature of the shaping surface and proceeding along the shaping surface&#x2014;between components of the substructure. Laying of the insulation panels may occur concurrently with laying of the substructure and/or positioning of the components of the substructure may be adjusted as the insulation panels are laid up to establish a desired separation therebetween. As noted above, the insulation panels may include stiffener angle supports for maintaining the upright position of components of the substructure during curing and/or fusing process(es).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As discussed below, one of ordinary skill will appreciate that thermosetting materials may be used with embodiments of the present invention, and the insulation may be engineered, for example, with the goal of achieving curing temperatures (rather than melting/fusing temperatures), for example for thermosetting materials and/or adhesives, without departing from the spirit of the present invention. One of ordinary skill will also appreciate that such other embodiments may include additional steps, for example injecting or infusing matrix material where prepreg reinforcement material is not used. Such other steps are known for use in constructing composite parts and are therefore not described in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In connection with step <b>704</b>, a vacuum bag may be applied to cover the skin and the substructure such that the skin and the substructure are at least partly and preferably fully enclosed by the combination of the vacuum bag and the shaping surface of the tool. The vacuum bag comprises material having a melting point above the temperature of the coolant fluid. It should be noted that nominal changes in melting point with variation in coolant fluid pressure are disregarded for purposes of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, as noted above, the vacuum bag may include a first side adjacent the composite part and a second side opposite the first side. The insulation layer may include a first side adjacent the substructure and a second (or upper) side opposite the first side. Still further, each of the raised segment and the flange may include an outer surface. A first portion of the insulation layer may cover the outer surface of the flange over the faying surfaces, and a second portion of the insulation layer may cover the exposed portion of the second side of the skin. Yet still further, the insulation layer may be sized such that, during the fusing of the substructure to the skin (discussed below), the second side of the insulation layer and a portion of the first side of the vacuum bag covering the raised segment are each maintained below the melting point of the vacuum bag.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In connection with step <b>705</b>, a coolant fluid may be continuously flowed into contact with and over the second side of the vacuum bag. The flow may be maintained throughout most or all of the fusing process outlined below. Preferably, the coolant fluid is maintained at a lower temperature than that of the composite part. Also or alternatively, the coolant fluid may be maintained at a lower temperature than that of each of the raised segments that are fixed to faying surfaces of the substructure and/or at a lower temperature than that of the skin. The coolant fluid flow may be applied against the second side of the vacuum bag at least in part by an impeller and a vane, the vane being shaped and positioned to receive the flow of coolant fluid from the impeller and redirect the flow of the coolant fluid toward the vacuum bag.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In connection with step <b>706</b>, the coolant fluid may be pressurized. The pressurization may be achieved using a vessel comprising an autoclave or the like. It is foreseen that atmospheric pressure (e.g., at sea level) may provide sufficient pressure on the vacuum bag without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The pressure of the coolant fluid may be at or above 101.3529 kPa (14.7 psia) or, more preferably, at or above 689.476 kPa (100 psia), and may be maintained at substantially the same pressure during the fusing of the substructure to the skin (discussed in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In connection with step <b>707</b>, heat may be applied to the shaping surface to fuse the substructure to the skin by melting along the first and second faying surfaces. As noted above, thermocouples may be embedded along a platform of the tool to provide temperature sensing feedback to a controller. The controller may control the output of one or more heating elements to provide uniform and steady-state heating (preferably) or differential heating to the shaping surface for fusing of the substructure to the skin and concurrent consolidation of the plies of the skin.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In connection with step <b>708</b>, the vacuum bag and fused composite part may be removed from the tool. The coolant fluid may be depressurized and the flow may be halted in connection with such removal.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the attached drawing figures, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For instance, it should be noted that composite parts are typically formed from composite material, as is known in the art, which generally includes at least two constituent components&#x2014;a reinforcement material and a matrix material. The reinforcement material generally provides mechanical strengthening properties, such as high tensile strength, to the composite material, while the matrix material acts as a binder to hold the reinforcement material together. The reinforcement material and the matrix material may possess additional properties not discussed herein. Furthermore, the composite material may include additional components not discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Examples of reinforcement materials that may be used with the current invention include, but are not limited to, fiber materials such as carbon fiber, boron fiber, fiberglass, aramid fiber, ceramic fiber, and the like without departing from the spirit of the present invention. In the case of fiber-based reinforcement materials, the fiber may exist in one of at least two forms&#x2014;either preimpregnated (prepreg), in which the fiber may be coated with a matrix material that is uncured and/or requires further heat treatment, such as uncured resin or thermoplastic polymer, or as dry fiber, with no matrix material incorporated prior to part manufacture. The matrix material may typically be in the form of thermoplastic polymers such as polycarbonates, polyamides, polyphenylene sulfide, polyetherimide, polyetheretherketone, polyetherketoneketone, and the like. The matrix material may also or alternatively be in the form of thermosetting polymer resins, such as epoxies, bismaleim ides, vinyl esters, phenolics, polyimides and the like, among others. It should be noted that thermoplastic film adhesives are preferably incorporated between parts comprising thermosetting matrix materials, and that fixing one such part to another includes curing the thermoplastic film adhesives. It should also be noted that mixtures of composite materials may be used to form a single composite part without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Having thus described various embodiments of the invention, what is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent includes the following:</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
