Field</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to imaging and therapy techniques comprising nanodroplets. More particularly, embodiments of the disclosure relate to the use of nanodroplets to inflate nanobubbles or microbubbles to provide improved imaging and/or therapeutic aspects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">B. Related Art</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various techniques have been developed to image and provide therapy to conditions that require medical treatment, including for example, cancerous tumors. Certain techniques incorporate the use of gaseous bubbles to increase the visibility of regions of interest during ultrasound imaging. Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) requires acoustic waves to decrease local pressure of liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) below its vapor pressure to trigger its phase transition from liquid to gas. Although promising, this field remained stagnant despite the introduction of novel formulations of low-boiling point (&#x3c;0&#xb0; C.) perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets (NDs) that are superheated at body temperature. This is most likely due to the larger ND dose needed compared to microbubbles (MBs), the inability to vaporize all NDs, the amount of phospholipid surfactant that is insufficient to properly stabilize newly formed MBs that are five times larger, and the spontaneous uncontrolled vaporization of ND that could lead to potential toxicity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Neat perfluorocarbon (PFC) and emulsions of PFC exhibit exceptional properties such as high thermal stability and chemical inertness owing to the unique characteristics of fluorine (F) and the carbon-fluorine (C&#x2014;F) linkage&#x2014;the strongest covalent bond in organic chemistry. PFC in its liquid state is often considered gas-like fluid as it displays low intermolecular cohesiveness due to the low polarizability of F, which results in lower Van der Waals (VdW) interactions between pairs of CF<sub>2 </sub>as opposed to VdW interactions between pairs of CH<sub>2</sub>. More importantly, PFC have additional interrelated key properties that are critical for clinical translation, including biocompatibility, high purity, low surface tensions, high fluidity as well as high vapor pressure and gas solubility compared to hydrocarbons of similar molecular mass (1). In addition, low molecular weight PFC are rapidly excreted by exhalation for PFC with no side effects.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Owing to their unique ultrasound (US) backscattered signal, single PFC gas-filled microbubbles (MBs) (2, 3) or single MB-labeled cells (4) can be detected in vivo using a clinical US system. This unique US response of PFC gas-filled MBs has prompted the development of a variety of new US contrast agents and has increased the possibility of diagnostic imaging worldwide. However, other than altering ligands on the MBshell to target specific tissues, translatable MB-based discoveries as US contrast agents have been stagnant for the past 2 decades, mostly because their micron size limits their distribution to the intravascular space where they can only interact with the endothelial surface (5, 6), circulating cells (7), or blood clots (8, 9).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nanoscale particles exhibit several advantages for molecular imaging over MBs. Because of their 100-300 nm size, PFC nanodroplets (NDs) are able to leak into the tumor extracellular space (1). In addition, their larger particle count, greater resilience to US and longer in vivo dwell time are expected to improve targeting efficiency of NDs over MBs to intravascular sites in addition to extravascular sites. However, the key impediment of NDs is their lesser echogenicity and thus lesser US contrast compared to MBs due to their limited reflectivity and compressibility (10), requiring large doses that potentially increase side-effects (11). While their backscatter is indistinguishable from tissues, NDs are able to phase change into MBs through a process known as of acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) resulting in improved detection by US. ADV was introduced almost two decades ago as a potential tool to induce vascular occlusion by locally triggering local embolization on downstream tissues using micron-size perfluoropentane (PFP) filled droplets (12). However, using micron-size PFP-filled droplets potentially leads to spontaneous droplet vaporization, particularly during injection due to shear stress and cavitation, which is a concern for clinical translation (13). In addition, occlusion was accomplished exclusively in the larger arteries, resulting in undesired non-discriminant downstream embolization and side effects (14-16) or incomplete embolization for tumors still fed from smaller arteries.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While a few groups have successfully vaporized liquid low boiling point droplets of PFP (17), or perfluorobutane (PFB) (18-20) to MBs in animals, their clinical translation and widespread use has been limited by critical efficacy and safety challenges. Firstly, the acoustic energy required to vaporize droplets, particularly NDs, in humans is expected to be higher than the current FDA limit (12) because of the high Laplace pressure inside NDs, the increased interstitial pressure in tumors and the US attenuation in deep tissues (21). Secondly, the required dose of droplets or NDs is high, which potentially leads to side-effects (11). Thirdly, the inability to vaporize all NDs due to tissue attenuation, and uncontrolled spontaneous vaporization of sub-micron droplets at body temperature (13) raises safety concerns as it could lead to unwanted microvascular occlusion. Finally, red blood cell extravasation occurs following ADV-triggered capillary rupture due to initial MB expansion or most likely to the violent MB collapse associated with inertial cavitation at insonation (22). In addition to these safety concerns, MBs formed by ADV might not be stable enough for effective gas embolotherapy as they originate from NDs that are 5 times smaller (23), and thus do not have enough phospholipid surfactants to be properly stabilized. Although the presence of MBs near NDs decreases the ADV threshold (24), the same challenges remain for the clinical translation of ADV.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to the field of medical diagnostics and therapeutics, and more specifically to the development of a new class of imaging and theranostic agents obtained by the combination of perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas filled microbubbles (MBs) and nanobubbles (NBs) with PFC liquid core nanodroplets (NDs). Particular aspects present a novel strategy for improved detection and treatment of diseased tissue. Certain aspects comprise using ultrasound contrast agents (MBs or NBs) to target intravascular and/or extravascular sites, followed by a second injection of non-targeted NDs or NDs targeted to the pre-injected MBs or NBs. In specific aspects, the PFC liquid pool of NDs may then transfer to the MBs or NBs to inflate them. Inflating MBs or NBs may increase ultrasound signal easing detection. However, inflation may be used to speed blood clot dissolution, induce tumor vascular occlusion, aid in gene delivery and transfection, and more.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventors have found that NDs act as a PFC and phospholipid reservoirs that transfer to the adjacent NBs or MBs, which triggers their growth. Interestingly, while both NBs and NDs individually exhibit very limited ultrasound signal on B-mode imaging when exposed to low acoustic power, their combination results in a rapid and dramatic increase in signal visible on standard ultrasound imaging. The inventors hypothesize that the low but non-negligible PFC solubility in water and high vapor pressure of PFC allow condensed PFC from the NDs to dissipate and diffuse away into the aqueous phase to reach the NB core and initiate expansion. This innovation is different from the use of NDs as phase change contrast agent (PCCA) because no sound waves are necessary to inflate the NBs or MBs but result from the large vapor pressure in the superheated nanodroplets. Such a driving force does not exist between two microbubbles with the same Laplace pressure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors have demonstrated rapid NB expansion when mixed with a concentrated solution of fluorescein-labeled NDs (&#x2dc;10:1 ND/NB ratio) by microscopy and ultrasound. The inventors showed evidence that the phospholipids from the ND shell were incorporated with the newly formed microbubbles (MBs) by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present disclosure also relate to the field of in vitro rare cell isolation. More specific aspects describe a new platform that may improve cell detection sensitivity and isolation using a combination of perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas filled nanobubbles (NBs) or microbubbles (MBs) targeted to any cell surface receptor of interest, and PFC liquid nanodroplets (NDs). Particular aspects include a novel strategy to better detect and isolate cells in vitro using buoyancy. Certain aspects comprise adding targeted NBs or MBs to a cell suspension, followed by the addition of NDs that could be non-targeted or targeted to the MBs or MBs. The liquid PFC from superheated PFC NDs can then transfer to the NBs or MBs to inflate them, increase buoyancy and the floatation of MB-cell construct to ease or speed their recovery using mild or no centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Briefly, the present disclosure provides a novel strategy to achieve the benefits of ADV, including improved detection and tumor microvascular embolization, without the need for ultrasound. Because liquid PFC in NDs is at a much higher partial pressure than its gaseous counterpart in microbubbles (MB), the coexistence of ND and MB leads to PFC vaporization and transfer into MB leading to their expansion. The thermodynamic driving force is the large vapor pressure for the nanodroplets, which are highly superheated. Such a driving force does not exist between two microbubbles with the same Laplace pressure. The extent of the MB expansion was quantified by counting and measuring the size of expanded microbubbles with microscopy and flow cytometry. This MB expansion process was applied to expand poorly echogenic nanobubbles (NBs) to larger MBs and resulted in a 4-fold ultrasound signal enhancement after 30 seconds of incubation at 37&#xb0; C. The inventors have demonstrated that the rate and extent of expansion were affected by the type of PFC used, MB size, length and type of lipid emulsifier that has an effect on both interfacial tension and the ability of bubbles to expand. Finally, MB inflation was demonstrated in vitro in tubing flow system and in two animal models. First, MBs and ND were both injected subcutaneously in the ear of a mouse to demonstrate MB expansion in vivo using intravital microscopy. In a second animal model, MC38 colon cancer cells were implanted in the flank of a mouse and MC38-targeting MBs and NDs were injected intravenously in sequence to demonstrate tumor targeting and MB inflation at the tumor site using microscopy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain embodiments include a method of imaging a region of interest, where the method comprises: providing bubbles to the region of interest; providing nanodroplets to the region of interest; increasing the average bubble diameter of the bubbles while the bubbles are in the region of interest; and exposing the region of interest to an ultrasound stimulus to generate an image of the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Certain embodiments include a method to safely occlude tumor microvessels non-invasively and without the need for ultrasound, where the method comprises: providing bubbles to the region of interest, diameter between 200 nm and 10 &#x3bc;m; providing nanodroplets to the region of interest; increasing the average bubble diameter of the bubbles while the bubbles are in the region of interest.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular embodiments, providing the nanodroplets to the region of interest is performed subsequent to providing the bubbles to the region of interest.

In this embodiment, step <b>110</b> comprises providing bubbles to the region of interest. In certain embodiments, the bubbles may be nanobubbles or microbubbles with an average bubble diameter between around 200-600 nm (nanobubbles) and 1-10 &#x3bc;m (microbubbles).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To circumvent the challenges of ADV for effective gas embolotherapy, the inventors took inspiration from a biological process and the second law of thermodynamics: the process by which PFC is eliminated from the body by exhalation (25). When PFC liquid emulsions or PFC gas-filled MBs traverse the alveolar capillaries, PFC transfers to the air-filled alveolar space because of the large partial pressure gradient (1). In addition, since liquid PFC in NDs is at a much higher partial pressure and interfacial pressure (assuming equal interfacial tension) than its gaseous counterpart in the MBs, the inventors hypothesized that when micron-scale or sub-micron-scale MBs are in close proximity to nanoscale liquid PFC NDs, PFC vapor transfers from the NDs to MBs and expands them (Laplace Law). Although PFC solubility in water is low, it is not negligible. The inventors speculate that PFC molecules would diffuse out of NDs, move freely between water molecules surrounding the NDs, and reach the adjacent MB core, as vaporized PFC has higher entropy than its liquid state. A schematic representation of the nanodroplet-microbubble gas exchange shown is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (where &#x3c3;=interfacial tension). This expansion phenomenon, also aided by the transfer of air from plasma due to the osmotic gradient (13), results in large MBs that can embolize vessels without US activation. There are a few examples of not fully understood phenomena in the literature that the inventors believe the inventors can partly explain with aspects of the present disclosure. Fowlkes et al. demonstrated optically vessel occlusion through ADV using intravital microscopy on the rat cremaster muscle (22). In this study, the size of lodged MBs was bigger than the predicted 5&#xd7; increase in diameter, as 2 &#x3bc;m diameter droplets vaporized into 76 &#x3bc;m mean length&#xd7;36 &#x3bc;m mean diameter or 25 &#x3bc;m mean length&#xd7;11 &#x3bc;m mean diameter, respectively when the vaporization was triggered in the capillaries (4-7 &#x3bc;m) or in a larger arteriole (&#x2dc;125 &#x3bc;m). While the authors hypothesized that MBs coalescence will happen more in capillaries where the flow velocity is smaller than in the feeder vessel, the inventors also believe that PFC transfer from unvaporized NDs contribute to MB inflation. In the clinic, the first heterogenous delayed enhancement of the liver due to the formation of larger MB after injection of contrast agents (Levovist and Echogen) has been reported by Wolf et al. with no precise causes nor mechanism (26). Interestingly, the phenomenon was described by others with different gas and shell types. Cardinale et al. hypothesized that MB slowing down in the hepatic sinusoids inflated with gas from the intestinal microcirculation by osmotic effect (27), as the effect was not observed when patients received a second dose 24 h later (26, 27) or 9 days later (27).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The inventors believe that this new US-based approach will lead to the development of new tools to better treat and detect disease. Of the many possible applications of this novel platform, which is beyond the scope of this report, the inventors believe the inventors can induce microvascular embolization as was originally intended for ADV, but at a much smaller dose and without the need for US vaporization. Starving cancer cells to death by restricting their blood supply was proposed nearly 50 years ago. Recently, systemic treatment with anti-angiogenesis therapy that is directed against immature tumor microvessels (28) has offered short term benefits with limited impact on patient survival, mostly because it has inhibited tumor growth rather than killing established ones. In addition, some major concerns remain such as tumor resistance, and side effects due to the inhibition of normal angiogenesis. Alternatively, mechanical occlusion or embolization, although less discriminant, has been used effectively to treat hepatocellular and renal cancers. This procedure is achieved by introducing plain or drug eluting embolic material through a catheter that is advanced as close as possible to the tumor feeding. While effective, this procedure is not tumor-specific, is invasive and carries the typical risks linked to angiography. In addition, because tumors can parasitize other arteries, embolization may be incomplete. As of today, there is no effective strategy to achieve total occlusion of the tumor microvasculature, particularly in a non-invasive manner. Expanding MBs using droplet vaporization to microembolize tumor vasculature without the need for acoustic activation has the potential to be translated in the clinic.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, method <b>100</b> comprises an aspect <b>110</b> of providing bubbles to the region of interest.

Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a method <b>500</b> includes an aspect <b>510</b> that comprises obtaining a blood sample that contains microbubble-cell complexes.

Method <b>500</b> further comprises aspect <b>540</b> of retrieving cells from the blood sample.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring back now to particular aspects of the present disclosure discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the inventors have found that NDs act as a PFC and phospholipid reservoirs that transfer to the adjacent NBs or MBs, which triggers their growth. Interestingly, while both NBs and NDs individually exhibit very limited ultrasound signal on B-mode imaging when exposed to low acoustic power, their combination results in a rapid and dramatic increase in signal visible on standard ultrasound imaging. The inventors hypothesize that the very poor water solubility and high vapor pressure of PFC allow condensed PFC from the NDs to dissipate and diffuse away into the aqueous phase to reach the NB core and initiate expansion. This innovation is different from the use of NDs as phase change contrast agent (PCCA) because no sound waves are necessary to inflate the NBs or MBs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The inventors have demonstrated rapid NB expansion when mixed with a concentrated solution of fluorescein-labeled NDs (&#x2dc;10:1 ND/NB ratio) by microscopy (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>). The inventors have showed evidence that the phospholipids from the ND shell were incorporated with the newly formed microbubbles (MBs) by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows representative bright field images of NDs and NBs prior and after mixing at 20&#xd7; magnification. Note that even if NDs and NBs have similar diameters, NDs cannot be distinguished as the refractive index of liquid perfluorobutane is close to the refractive index of water, and importantly, NB and ND s are not visible because of the microscope resolution. Upon mixing on the microscopy slide, 5-20 &#x3bc;m MBs were observed instantaneously (ND+NB). Scale bar is 20 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows representative bright field and fluorescence images of NDs before and after mixing with NBs at 20&#xd7; magnification. Note that post mixing (ND+NB), newly generated MBs show higher fluorescence intensity in their shell, compared to the background fluorescence from the NDs, which indicates that fluorescein labeled phospholipids (DSPC-PEG2Kfluorescein) have been incorporated in the MBs shell. Scale bar is 20 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of the one-compartment experimental setup (left). NB expansion was observed after less than 10 seconds after addition of the NDs in the NB solution. Note that the NBs alone (0 s) only exhibit a low contrast enhancement compared to MBs (10, 30 and 40 s). Mixing NBs and NDs resulted in a marked enhancement on B-mode US imaging.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of the two-compartment experimental setup (left). Briefly, two-bulb compartments were done by cutting plastic bulbs and joining them together with a dialysis membrane in between and with parafilm to seal the system. Thirty seconds after addition of NDs in the upper compartment (right on ultrasound), NBs in the lower compartment (left on ultrasound) expanded to MBs producing a high contrast-to-noise ratio on B-mode US imaging. As expected, no acoustic droplet vaporization was observed in the upper ND compartment as they were exposed to the lowest ultrasound transmit power (MI=0.05, PNP=0.13 MPa.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to aspects of the present disclosure that relate to improvements on the current cell isolation buoyancy method using targeted MBs, the inventors have demonstrated in vitro that the addition of liquid PFC NDs (300 nm) to a MB (0.5-10 &#x3bc;m) suspension dramatically expands the gas bodies by up to 6 orders of magnitude, and does so without direct contact. NDs act as a PFC and phospholipid reservoirs that transfer to the adjacent NBs or MBs to trigger their growth. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the number of attached MBs per cell required to induce buoyancy and cell recovery could decrease significantly, as only one attached MB could potentially grow to become 100 &#x3bc;m. This aspect can improve upon the buoyancy technique used to isolate cells. It can also be applied in vivo, by administering the NBs or MBs intravenously targeted to a circulating cell surface receptor of interest, and then adding the liquid PFC to an extracted blood sample to detect the targeted cells. Aspects of the present disclosure can improve upon existing technology in at least two ways: (1) Increasing buoyancy using PFC transfer from superheated PFC NDs will decrease the number of MB per cell needed to cause cells to float; and (2) targeted NBs that are more effective at locating their target both in vitro and particularly in vivo, and allow the accumulation of more NBs at the cell surface, can also induce attached cells to float when they are inflated by the liquid PFC.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The current standard for cell isolation is to target magnetic beads to the cell surface receptor of interest that can only be done in vitro and requires special equipment for isolation and then cell handling to remove the magnetic beads. The use of buoyancy to isolate cells improves upon the magnetic bead strategy by not requiring MB removal after isolation, simplifying the isolation technique, and adding the potential of administering the MBs intravenously to search for circulating cells of interest prior to isolation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Aspects of the present disclosure can provide a solution to when not enough MBs attach to the cell of interest to make it buoyant, or if NBs are used to improve cell interaction but the total gas bodies remain insufficient to cause attached cells to float. When a blood sample or any cell or particle suspension that contains the NBs or MBs attached to cells or particles that need to be isolated is spiked with liquid PFC, preferably as an emulsion of superheated PFC ND such as PFB ND that may be targeted or non-targeted to the attached NBs or MBs, the gas bodies will inflate because of their lower PFC pressure, increasing buoyancy and causing the attached cells/particles to float. This new strategy should improve the detection limits of cells or particles in any suspension.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">With typical existing techniques, the buoyancy of cells or particles to be detected or isolated depends on the number and size of MBs attached to their surface to overcome the gravitational force exerted on the attached cell or particle. This can be a limitation that severely impacts detection sensitivity when using buoyancy for isolation. Aspects of the present disclosure addresses this problem and improves the sensitivity of isolation by simply adding liquid PFC, preferably as emulsion of superheated PFC ND such as PFB ND, to inflate the attached MBs or NBs, increasing the force to overcome the gravitational force increasing buoyancy and improving cell isolation.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Unlike magnetic bead isolation, aspects of the present disclosure can be used in vivo to search for the rare circulating cells, and do not require cell manipulation to remove the beads after they are isolated. Unlike current buoyancy techniques, aspects of the present disclosure will allow the use of NBs that are more efficient at targeting, and can overcome the gravitational force for large cell or particle masses, by inflating the gas bodies attached to the cell or particle surface. For therapy, there are several schemes that this technology offers that could be exploited. These are merely some potential scenarios out of several. One potential method is the ease by which a large payload can be placed either within or attached on the shell of the droplets as compared to microbubbles. These droplets either passively or actively targeted or by merely passing through the site of interest carried by blood can be induced into phase-transition by the variety of techniques mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further description and explanation of the operating principles can also be found in the discussion of the example and results that follow.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">V.

However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The important number of diseases diagnosed at a late stage because of absence of symptoms is objective evidence that there is a need to extend the toolbox of imaging agents to improve early detection of disease. This work demonstrates for the first time that the addition of liquid PFC NDs to a suspension containing MBs or nanobubble (NBs) leads to the dramatic expansion of the gas bodies by at least 2 and up to 6 orders of magnitudes and does so without requiring direct contact between NDs and MBs or NBs. Additional advantages of our method compared to ADV is that smaller droplets not only exhibit greater stability as they are subject to higher Laplace Pressure but will also ease inflation as the difference in interfacial pressure between bubbles and droplets will be higher. Conversely, it has been reported that ADV requires more acoustic power to trigger the vaporization of smaller the NDs. Targeted NBs have been proposed to improve tumor detection, since they share some of the advantages of NDs. However, their limited reflectivity at clinical frequencies remains an issue. By chasing targeted NBs or small MBs with NDs, bubbles will expand, thus enhancing their ultrasound signal and improving the detection of the targeted diseased tissue. The inventors validated this first milestone in vivo, using 1 &#x3bc;m rhodamine-labeled MBs that target MC38 cancer cells in a tumor-bearing mouse.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Nanobubbles Inflate When in Contact With Nanodroplets</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a proof of concept, the inventors first used perfluorobutane (PFB) nanobubbles (NBs) instead of regular microbubbles (&#x3e;1 &#x3bc;m) to explore the effect of the addition of PFB NDs on the signal intensity by ultrasound imaging. NBs constitute a good model because of their limited US signal on B-mode imaging when exposed to low acoustic power. Both NBs and NDs were prepared with a phospholipid mixture composed of 1,2-Distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPC) and Distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine conjugated with polyethylene glycol <b>2000</b> (DSPE-PEG 2K) in a 90:10 molar ratio. Their hydrodynamic sizes were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Figure S1A) and were on average 488.1&#xb1;4.6 nm and 285.2&#xb1;0.9 nm with polydispersity indexes (PdI) of 0.20&#xb1;0.004 and 0.17&#xb1;0.003 for NBs and NDs respectively. Tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) was used to measure their size and concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b> and <b>30</b></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows (A) Representative ND and sub-micron MBsize distribution measured by DLS.

The plastic bulb was then immersed in a water bath at 37&#xb0; C. and imaged using B-mode imaging. US imaging at low mechanical index (MI=0.05) produced only a weak signal despite high concentration of NBs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). Once the temperature of the NB suspension reached 37&#xb0; C., a suspension of NDs in PBS 1&#xd7; (10<sup>9 </sup>NDs/mL) was added in the plastic bulb. After a few seconds, the ultrasound signal increased along with the appearance of numerous echogenic and buoyant MBs that started to rise to the surface. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn and the ultrasound video signal intensity in the plastic bulb was measured and resulted in a 4-fold enhancement after only 30 s post-ND addition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>). Interestingly, the portion of the bulb located in the far field is not visible after 45 s, due to the acoustic shadowing that resulted from the high number of MBs formed by this inflation process. As expected (29), NDs alone did not produce any US signal when observed at low MI for 5 minutes (FIG. S4) and vaporized only when subjected to a MI=0.5. NB inflation was also observed optically by microscopy using the same samples used in the ultrasound experiment. Briefly, a small volume (10 &#x3bc;L) of NBs in PBS 1&#xd7; (1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>NBs/mL) was first placed on a microscopy slide and covered with a coverslip and a small volume of NDs (10 &#x3bc;L) in PBS 1&#xd7; (1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>NBs/mL) was then added between the slide and the coverslip to mix NBs and NDs together. The mixture was observed using bright filed microscopy at a 20&#xd7; magnification.

In a first experiment, two soft plastic bulbs halves were attached to each other, their inner compartments separated with a semi-permeable dialysis membrane (3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff, 60 &#x3bc;m thickness). The lower compartment was filled with a suspension of PFB NBs in PBS 1&#xd7;, while the upper compartment was first filled with PBS 1&#xd7;.

A suspension of PFB NDs was then added in the upper compartment. The semi-permeable membrane allows small molecules such as PFB or phospholipids to freely diffuse while preventing NDs and NBs from diffusing from one compartment to the other. Using on B-mode imaging at 8 MHz, no signal was visible in the lower compartment containing NBs. Interestingly, less than 1 min after the addition of NDs in the upper compartment, a significant ultrasound signal was observed in the lower compartment, characteristic of echogenic microbubbles being inflated.

ROIs P3 and P4 were drawn on the scatter-plots to identify NDs and MBs respectively.

While MBs were initially Fl&#x2212;/Cy5.5+ in the lower right quadrant (99.8% in Q4-LR), the addition of Fl-NDs caused a shift of the MB signal to the Fl+/Cy5.5+upper right quadrant within a minute (97.7% in Q4-UR), which indicates that Fl-labeled phospholipids from NDs were incorporated into the MB phospholipid shell, thus demonstrating membrane fusion. Finally, a P4-gated histogram representing the particle count in function of forward scatter (FSC) demonstrated MB expansion as 81.3% of the inflated MBs were bigger than the largest MBs prior to ND addition.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As MBs kept inflating overtime (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>), larger MBs started to accumulate to the surface over time to form a foamy upper layer. In addition, as these expanded MBs are saturated in PFC and the sample is in equilibrium with ambient pressure, expanded MBs most likely pulled air from the surface to expand even more. Because of their extreme buoyancy, the number of inflated MBs is underestimated by flow cytometry, as a large population of inflated MBs is not injected in the flow cytometer since its inlet is located at the bottom of the sample tube. In addition, MBs&#x3e;40 &#x3bc;m are not detected as they are above the detection limit of the instrument. Because of these limitations, the quantitative analysis of the expansion of MB with ND was not possible using flow cytometry. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows representative pictures of the ND-MB mixtures.

Addition of DiO-labeled NDs in a suspension of DiD-labeled MBs lead to the formation of inflated MBs exhibiting both DiO and DiD fluorescence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), providing further evidence of a membrane fusion phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">To provide further insight in the inflation mechanism, an experimental setup identical to that described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> was employed but using Cy5.5-MBs and Fl-NDs at similar concentrations.

Albumin-based MBs are formulated by tip sonication of albumin in the presence of PFB. The heat generated by sonication denatures and crosslinks albumin via disulfide bonds to form a stiff shell around the PFC core. The inventors hypothesized that a polymer-based or crosslinked proteins shell may physically limit bubbles' growth, as lipid surfactants provided by NDs should not contribute and promote further inflation. To observe MB inflation in real time, the inventors place a suspension of albumin-MBs in a hemocytometer plate and added a suspension of PFB-NDs. Interestingly, albumin-MBs inflated at a fast rate, exhibiting MBs&#x3e;10 &#x3bc;m immediately after addition of PFB phospholipid NDs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, B).

PFB MBs were prepared with the same phospholipid compositions so they all share the same interfacial tension. All ND samples were characterized by DLS and their hydrodynamic diameters were on average 221&#xb1;4 nm (PFB), 295&#xb1;1 nm (PFP), and 268&#xb1;5 nm (PFH) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>).

Both DLS and TRPS data confirmed that the ND size was not affected by the nature of the encapsulated PFC, which was expected as microfluidization using high shear fluid processors is an efficient technique to reduce and achieve uniform emulsion size. PFB NDs yielded the largest amount of inflated MBs and exhibited the highest inflation rate. PFP ND yielded some inflation after 10 min and inflated MBs to a lesser extent with no MB&#x3e;40 &#x3bc;m. Finally, PFH NDs did not yield any MB inflation. This result validated our hypothesis that lower molecular weight PFC are transferred more efficiently into MBs, most likely as a result of their lower intermolecular cohesiveness, higher PFC vapor pressure (PFB: 330.0 kPa, PFP: 84.0 kPa, PFH: 31.0 kPa) and volatility (30). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows the effect of ND PFC core on PFB MBs inflation.

For these reasons, the inventors tested the inflation rate of bubbles with different mean sizes (3 &#x3bc;m, 2 &#x3bc;m, and 0.3 &#x3bc;m) when combined with NDs at a ND/MB ratio of 100:1. Both droplets and bubbles were formulated with the same phospholipid shell composition (DSPC:DSPE-PEG2K at a 90:10 molar ratio). When mixed with NDs, the larger 3 &#x3bc;m MBs started to expand immediately after ND addition, while 2 &#x3bc;m MBs and 0.3 &#x3bc;m NBs started to inflate 5 and 10 min after ND addition respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). Assuming equal surface tension, 3-&#x3bc;m MBs are under lower interfacial tension than 2-&#x3bc;m MBs and 0.3-&#x3bc;m NBs. According to Laplace law, the inventors hypothesize that as liquid PFC in NDs exhibit a much higher interfacial pressure difference with big MBs, PFC transfer will happen faster with 3-&#x3bc;m compared to 3-&#x3bc;m and 0.3-&#x3bc;m MBs. In addition, the inventors assume that, at similar NDs to MBs ratio, the opportunity for the NDs to interact with NBs and transfer its PFC and phospholipids is lower due to a decreased probability to be close to each other. Interestingly, both NBs and MBs continued to inflate over 30 min reaching nearly similar size. This is in agreement with the inventors' theory that the large vapor pressure in the NDs is the main driving force, as the concentration gradient is expected to be the same whatever the bubble size. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows the effect of bubble size on their inflation.

This causes MBs formulated using phospholipids with longer acyl chains to have more cohesive shells. This increase in shell cohesiveness should delay the transfer of PFC gas across the MB membrane due to the increase in attractive hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions between the adjacent phospholipids' hydrophobic tails. For these reasons, the inventors performed a series of experiments to explore the impact of the intermolecular forces between phospholipids in MB and ND shell on MB inflation. Specifically, the inventors compared the rate and extent of inflation using MBs and NDs made from DSPC (18 carbons in each acyl chain and 0 insaturation, 18:0) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC, 16:0). All MB/ND combinations were tested at a 100:1 ND/MB ratio. The inventors selected these two phospholipids because while they are both common MB constituents, they are in two different lipid physical state at 37&#xb0; C., either in their ordered gel phase (lipid chains extended and closely packed) or fluid phase (lipid chains randomly organized) for 18:0 and 16:0 respectively. As expected, MBs made with 16:0 phospholipids underwent a faster and more important inflation than their analogues with 18:0 phospholipids, and so with NDs composed of either 18:0 or 16:0 phospholipids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>). This result is most likely due to the easier gas penetration through the monolayer composed of phospholipids with shorter acyl chains (32).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">While less lipid intermolecular cohesion forces in NDs made of 16:0 vs. 18:0 phospholipids are known to result in lower activation energy needed to acoustically trigger ND vaporization (33), our results showed 18:0 MBs inflated to a greater extent with 18:0 NDs as opposed to 16:0 NDs. While the inventors do not have an indisputable explanation, the inventors hypothesize that the fact that 18:0 NDs were smaller than their 16:0 counterpart compensated their lower interfacial tension resulting in similar or close Laplace overpressure. This result may also be explained by the presence or absence of surface microstructures that have been reported in MBs composed of DSPC and DPPC respectively (34). The inventors hypothesize that similarly to MBs, 18:0 NDs have surface microstructures whereas 16:0 NDs do not, which explain their more favorable phospholipids and gas transfer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows the effect on phospholipid acyl chain length on MB inflation.

The inventors expect that targeting NDs to MBs will bring them into close proximity to ease PFC transfer, increase lipid fusion, and maximize inflation while minimizing dose. The inventors used dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as our strained alkyne, because it is commercially available already attached to a PEGylated phospholipid and has been shown to trigger artificial membrane fusion with azide-labeled phospholipids.(38) To demonstrate the advantage of targeting NDs to MBs, the inventors tested a series of ND:MB concentration ratios (1:1 to 100:1) while keeping the MB count and volume constant. MB inflation was assessed by flow cytometry as described above, using Cy5.5-MBs and FI-NDs (Non targeted) as well as Cy5.5-DBCO-MBs and FI-Azide-NDs. Below 100:1 ND: MB ratio, the inventors did not observe any MB inflation with or without targeting at the concentrations tested. However, at a 100:1 ND:MB ratio, while only 12.1&#xb1;2.1% MBs inflated in the non-targeted samples, 40.2&#xb1;16.4% DBCO- MBs inflated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>). The inventors hypothesized that non-targeted ND most likely did not interact with non-targeted MBs as much as they targeted analogues which resulted in a lower inflated MB count. Even if the previous experiment described above were in agreement with an effect of targeting on MB inflation, the inventors believe that this effect is underestimated due to the flow cytometry limitation mentioned earlier. To provide further evidence of the enhanced MB inflation when MB and ND are targeted to each other's, the inventors evaluated by microscopy MB inflation in the presence of NDs using disposable hemocytometers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>).

Since flow conditions will render interactions between ND and MB more challenging, the inventors assessed the effect of flow on MBs/NBs inflation in order to validate their formulations and inflation conditions prior to in vivo experiments. To mimic blood vessels and cell receptors, the inventors used a medical polyimide tubing (200 &#x3bc;m I.D.) coated with fluorescein. This coating was done by filling the tube with ethylenediamine and then conjugating the free amines with NHS-FITC using EDC as a coupling agent as previously reported (39). For the experiment in PBS1&#xd7;, MBs were composed of DSPC, DSPE-PEG and DSPE-PEG-maleimide at a 90:8:2 molar ratio. NDs were composed of DSPC, DSPE-PEG, DSPE-PEG-Mal and DSPE-PEG-FITC with a 90:6:2:2 molar ratio. For the experiment in blood, lipid compositions were identical for both MBs and NDs but MBs. In order to mimic receptor targeting, MBs were conjugated with an anti-FITC antibody. Briefly, anti-FITC antibody was first thiolated using 2-iminothiolane, purified through a desalting column, and reacted with MBs via a thiol-ene coupling reaction. Targeted MBs (10<sup>7</sup>/mL), in PBS 1&#xd7; or in blood, were infused through the tube at a flow rate mimicking capillarity velocity (0.01 cm/s, 0.19 &#x3bc;L/min for 5 min) and then washed with PBS 1&#xd7; or blood to remove unbound MBs (manual infusion). Bound MBs were easily visible after the wash in PBS but not in blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>-top in PBS, data not shown in blood) by microscopy. Fluorescein-labeled NDs (Fl-NDs) were infused at the same flow rate. MB inflation and tube occlusion occurred within seconds after NDs infusion (10<sup>10</sup>/mL) in PBS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>-bottom), with MB fusion observed in real time upon contact. In blood, the inventors observed a few MB inflated below a minute, however no coalescence was observed between inflated MBs until 15 min of ND infusion. Partial blood flow occlusion was observed after 15 min (red blood cell accumulation observed upstream from the occlusion site via darkening of the tube) and blood flow cessation was observed after 30 min (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>). Note that after 30 min, a blood clot formed in the tube because of lack of flow. Blood flow was recovered by increasing the syringe pump volume dramatically (10 &#x3bc;L/min, &#x3e;5.2 mm/s). This delayed onset of both inflation and fusion observed in blood was expected because of the higher blood viscosity that likely slightly decrease PFC gas kinetics transfer and stabilize inflated MBs towards coalescence. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a vessel occlusion using an in vitro flow system in PBS 1&#xd7; and in blood.

B) Representative bright field of MBs during NDs infusion in blood.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In Vivo Validations of Microbubble Expansion.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The inventors first injected 10<sup>6 </sup>MBs diluted in 10 uL PBS into the subcutaneous space of a mouse skin flap to assess if MB inflation would occur in vivo. 5 min post MB injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>), 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>NDs diluted in 10 uL PBS were injected along the same tract into the subcutaneous space. While observing the injection area, the 1 &#x3bc;m MBs visualized in bright-field started to expand after 30 s post ND injection. The inventors were also able to observe both an increase in the number of expanded MBs, as well as continued expansion of already expanded MBs up to &#x2dc;50 &#x3bc;m. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a demonstration of MB inflation in vivo after subcutaneous NDs infusion. Scale bar is 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The inventors then injected 2&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>targeted MBs diluted in 100 uL PBS into the right retro-orbital sinus of a MC38-bearing nude mice to assess whether MB inflation would occur in vivo and in blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Targeted MBS were composed of DSPC, DSPE-PEG, DSPE-PEG-maleimide and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (DPPE-Liss Rhod) at an 89.5:5:5:0.5 molar ratio. In order to mimic receptor targeting, MBs were conjugated with an anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) antibodies. Antibodies targeting PS are one of the most selective strategies to target tumor blood vessels and have been validated in numerous animal models of cancer. After 15 min, the inventors proceeded to create a dorsal skin flap, as done previously with the tumor in the center of the viewing window (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Due to their small size (&#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m) and most likely deep location within the attenuative tissue, MBs were not easily localized using bright field. However, the inventors were initially able to appreciate only a few some small, immobilized spots of rhodamine signal in the vessels in or immediately adjacent to the tumor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B-C</figref>). The high background in the Rhodamine channel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>) is the result of the high exposure time needed (300 ms) to capture a signal. At 30 minutes after the initial MB injection (in order to allow MB clearance from the circulation by the lungs), the inventors then introduced 4&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>NDs composed of DSPC, DSPE-PEG, DSPE-PEG-maleimide in a 90:8:2 molar ratio into the left retro-orbital sinus. NDs were conjugated with an anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) antibodies. While only a sparse number of MBs were observed pre-ND infusion in the rhodamine channel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>), more MB signal was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>D</figref>) and immediately adjacent to the tumor, around 10 min post ND injection. The lower background is possibly due to reduction of the exposure time (250 ms). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a demonstration of MB targeting and inflation in vivo after intravenous NDs infusion.
