provide devices, preparations and methods for delivering therapeutic agents (TAs) such as clotting factors (CFs, e.g., Factor 8) within the GI tract. Many embodiments provide a swallowable device e.g., a capsule for delivering TAs into the intestinal wall (IW). Embodiments also provide TA preparations configured to be contained within the capsule, advanced from the capsule into the IW and/or surrounding tissue (ST) and degrade to release the TA into the bloodstream to produce a therapeutic effect (e.g., improved clotting). The preparation can be operably coupled to delivery means having a first configuration where the preparation is contained in the capsule and a second configuration where the preparation is advanced out of the capsule into the IW or ST (e.g., the peritoneal cavity). Embodiments are particularly useful for delivery of CFs for treatment of clotting disorders (e.g., hemophilia) where such CFs are poorly absorbed and/or degraded within the GI tract.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="82.13mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230000765A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

Embodiments of the invention relate to orally deliverable drug and other therapeutic agent formulations and swallowable drug delivery devices for delivery of those formulations to the small intestine. More specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to orally deliverable drug formulations for the treatment of coagulation disorders. Still more specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to orally deliverable solid drug formulations for the treatment of hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease including coagulation proteins as clotting factors VII, VIII, IX and X.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the last ten years, there has been an increasing development of new drugs for the treatment of a variety of diseases including, for example, various clotting disorders. Unfortunately, many have limited application because they cannot be given orally. This is due to a number of reasons including: poor oral toleration with complications including gastric irritation and bleeding; breakdown/degradation of the drug compounds in the stomach; and poor, slow or erratic absorption of the drug. Conventional alternative drug delivery methods such as intravenous and intramuscular delivery have a number of drawbacks including pain and risk of infection from a needle stick, requirements for the use of sterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of maintaining an IV line in a patient for an extended period of time. While other drug delivery approaches have been employed such as implantable drug delivery pumps, these approaches require the semi-permanent implantation of a device and can still have many of the limitations of IV delivery. Thus, there is a need for improved and/or alternate methods for the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several inherited bleeding disorders in the human population which can be fatal if left untreated. These include Hemophilia A and B which are the most common and are caused by decreased levels of clotting factors in the patient's peripheral blood. They also include Factor VII deficiency and Factor X deficiency also called Stuart-Prower factor deficiency and Von Willebrand's disease caused by deficiency in von Willebrand Factor which binds Factor VIII. Hemophilia A, the most common form of hemophilia, is caused by deficiency in Factor VIII (FVIII). Hemophilia B is caused by decreased synthesis of Factor IX (FIX) or synthesis of defective Factor IX having reduced activity. Current forms of Hemophilia treatment involve replacing the missing or defective clotting factor with recombinant or plasma-derived clotting factors such as FVIII or FIX. Typically these factors are injected, usually intravenously.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are a number of issues and shortcomings with the current forms of hemophilia treatments. In particular, a number of patients develop antibodies to the replacement clotting factors diminishing their effectiveness and potentially resulting in serious complications as is discussed below. Other issues include the requirements to come into the doctor's office/clinic to have the injection done and the requirement that the injection be done very slowly into a vein, Also as the clotting factors are usually administered via peripheral intravenous injection, people with small veins or children can have a difficult time receiving the injections in that veins are hard to find and can easily collapse. This issue can be especially problematic in the case of children who require more frequent injections. Also, the injection itself can cause bleeding.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many patients develop antibodies (known as &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d; or &#x201c;inhibitory antibodies&#x201d;) in response to receiving various clotting factors which inhibit or otherwise impede the action of the clotting factor. The development of inhibitor antibodies to Factor VIII is a serious complication in the management of patients with hemophilia A. Inhibitory antibodies develop in approximately 20% of patients with hemophilia A in response to therapeutic infusions of Factor VIII. This is due to the higher doses of Factor VIII or other clotting factor administered. In previously untreated patients with hemophilia A who develop inhibitors, the inhibitors usually develop within one year of treatment. Additionally, autoantibodies that inactivate factor VIII occasionally develop in individuals with previously normal factor VIII levels. If the inhibitors titer is low enough, patients can be managed by increasing the dose of factor VIII though there are potential complications. However, it is often the case that the inhibitors titer is so high that it cannot be overwhelmed by Factor VIII. While therapies are available to eliminate or reduce the titer of these antibodies, they are costly (e.g., on the order of a $1 million per patient per year), time consuming and involve regular intravenous administration of coagulation factors. Also, these treatments work in only about three-quarters of patients.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">While other administration routes for factor VIII replacement therapies have been investigated in the past, they have not had much success. Sub-cutaneous (SC) administration is limited by the amount of active principle that can be administered at once, which cannot reach therapeutic levels for these factors. It is also limited by the susceptibility of these factors to protease mediated degradation. Another concern is the increased immunogenicity of the SC route compared to IV which may result in the increased or more rapid production of inhibitory antibodies compared to the IV injection route. What is needed therefore, are compositions and methods for delivering clotting factors such as factors VII, VIII, IX and X without the need for injection and to do so in a manner which does not cause the development of inhibitor antibodies or other immunogenic reaction against the clotting factor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention provide devices, systems, kits and methods for delivering drugs and other therapeutic agents to various locations in the body. Many embodiments provide a swallowable device for delivering drugs such as coagulation proteins and other therapeutic agents within the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract and surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal cavity. Particular embodiments of the invention provide a swallowable device such as a capsule for delivering coagulating proteins and other therapeutic agents into the wall of the small intestine and/or surrounding tissue (e.g., the peritoneal wall or cavity). Such coagulating proteins (CP) can include various coagulating factors (AKA clotting factors) including one or more of factors VII, VIII, IX, X and von Willebrand Factor. Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for the oral delivery of coagulating proteins and other therapeutic agents, which are poorly absorbed, poorly tolerated and/or degraded within the GI tract so that their biological activity is lost or diminished. Also, embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for the oral delivery of clotting factors and other coagulating proteins for the treatment of Hemophilia and other coagulation disorders which were previously only capable of being delivered by injection. Further, embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for delivering clotting factors such as Factor VIII, with minimal or no production of inhibitory antibodies which destroy or reduces the efficacy of the clotting factor. Further still, embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for delivering clotting factor and other coagulating proteins into the intestinal wall and peritoneal cavity for rapid uptake into the blood stream.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect, the invention provides a therapeutic agent preparation for delivery into the wall of the small intestine and/or surrounding tissue (e.g., the peritoneal cavity) or other location in the intestinal tract, comprising a therapeutically effective dose of at least one clotting factor (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, IX, X, von Willebrand factor, etc.) along with their respective analogues and derivatives. The preparation may have a shape and material consistency to be contained in an embodiment of the swallowable capsule (or like device) and delivered from the capsule into the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue (e.g., the peritoneal wall and/or peritoneal cavity) to release the dose of Clotting Factor (CF) from within the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal cavity. Such shapes may correspond to various tissue penetrating structures including those having a pointed end such as various dart-like, or needle like shapes or structures. For embodiments ofthe preparation delivered into the peritoneal cavity, the needle or other pointed end desirably has a straight or symmetrical vertical point or dart shape so as to be able to penetrate through the intestinal wall and into the peritoneal cavity without being deflected by any asymmetries in the needle shape. The preparation may be in solid, liquid, or powder form. Preferably, the preparation including the CF is in solid form allowing the preparation to be stored for extended periods oftime, as well as to be shaped (e.g., into a tissue penetrating shape such as a needle shape) and have a mechanical force or other force exerted against the preparation to insert it into intestinal wall and/or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal cavity and/or peritoneal wall. According to various embodiments, the coagulation factor may be selected from clotting factors including one or more ofFactor VII, VIII, IX, X and Von Willebrand Factor and/or their functional variants (e.g., analogues and derivatives) thereof known in the art, with such variants retaining the characteristic property ofthe clotting factors.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating hemophilia or other clotting disorders comprising orally administering to a patient a preparation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a clotting factor Factor VIII) using one or more embodiments ofthe swallowable capsule described herein, thereby treating the clotting disorder. In particular embodiments, the invention provides methods for the oral delivery of one or more ofi) a therapeutic amount ofFactor VII for the treatment of one or more ofFactor VII deficiency, congenital hemophilia with inhibitors, acquired hemophilia or Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia ; ii) a therapeutic amount ofFactor VIII for the treatment ofHemophilia A; iii) a therapeutic amount ofFactor IX for the treatment ofHemophilia B; iv) a therapeutic amount ofFactor X for the treatment ofFactor X deficiency; and v) a therapeutic amount of von Willebrand Factor for the treatment of Von Willebrand's disease. Also, in particular embodiments, described in more detail below, the swallowable capsule, can be configured to deliver the clotting factor preparation to a section ofthe small intestine without Peyer's Patches, Such targeted delivery to a desired section ofthe small intestine results in a suppressed immune response to the clotting factor including suppressed or minimized production of general antibodies such as IgG and specific inhibitor antibodies to the clotting factor. In use, embodiments of this approach provides the benefit of improved long term tolerance to and efficacy of the delivered clotting factor and in turn better long term control ofthe patients clotting disorder without the need for expensive treatments to eliminate the inhibitor antibodies.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also provides methods for treating a clotting disorder comprising selecting a patient having hemophilia or other clotting disorder and administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a clotting factor or other coagulation protein using one or more embodiments of the swallowable capsule described herein. Clotting time (e.g., prothrombin times) can then be measured and monitored using methods knows in the art to determine the efficacy of treatments and then adjustments can be made in the dosage (e.g., increase or decrease) and/or dose frequency of the administered clotting factor. In alternative or additional embodiments, solid forms of the clotting factors described herein may be delivered by other swallowable devices as well.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other aspects, the invention provides a method for delivering therapeutic agents into the wall of the small intestine and/or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal wall and peritoneal cavity comprising swallowing a drug delivery device comprising a capsule, an actuator and an embodiment of the therapeutic agent preparation such as a CF or CP preparation (e.g., a preparation comprising one or more clotting factors). The actuator is responsive to a condition in the small intestine such as pH so as to actuate delivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of the small intestine and/or surrounding tissue such as the wall of the peritoneum. In specific embodiments, the actuator can comprise a release element or coating on the capsule which is degraded by a selected pH in the small intestine. Once degraded, the element or coating initiates delivery of the therapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means such as the by expansion of one or more balloons that are operably coupled to one or more tissue penetrating members that contain the therapeutic agent preparation and are configured to penetrate and be advanced into the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue upon expansion of the balloon. In particular embodiments, the balloon or other advancement means is configured to advance the tissue penetrating member(s) through intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity where it is retained. Once the tissue penetrating members are positioned the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal cavity, they degrade to release the therapeutic agent into the bloodstream. In particular embodiments where tissue penetrating members are positioned and retained in the peritoneal cavity, the tissue penetrating member(s) including the therapeutic agent preparation are configured to be degraded by tissue fluids within the peritoneal cavity. Because the therapeutic agent preparation is delivered directly into the wall of the small intestine or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal wall or cavity, the time period (described herein as tllm) for achieving the maximum concentration of the CF or other therapeutic agent in the bloodstream or other location in the body is shorter than a corresponding time period for achieving such a maximum concentration when the therapeutic agent is non-vascularly injected into the body such as by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. In various embodiments, the time period for achieving C<sub>max </sub>by insertion of the therapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or more embodiments of the invention (such as an embodiment of the swallowable device) can be about 80%, 50%, 30%, 20 or even 10% of the time period for achieving a C<sub>max </sub>through the use of a non-vascular injection of the therapeutic agent. As used herein the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; generally refers to within 5% of the stated value of a number, but in some cases may be larger or smaller. In other embodiments, the C<sub>max </sub>achieved by insertion of the therapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or more embodiments of the invention, such as an embodiment of the swallowable device, can be greater than a C<sub>max </sub>achieved by taking a conventional oral form of the therapeutic agent (e.g,., a pill) where the therapeutic agent is not inserted into the intestinal wall, In various embodiments, the C<sub>max </sub>achieved by insertion of the therapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or more embodiments of the invention (such as an embodiment of the swallowable device) can be 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or even a 100 times greater than when the therapeutic agent is delivered in a pill or other oral form, In other related embodiments, the composition can be configured to produce a long-term release of therapeutic agent with a selectable t1/2, (that is the time period required for the concentration of the therapeutic agent in the bloodstream or other location in the body to reach half its original C<sub>max </sub>value after having reached Cmax). For example, the selectable t1/2 may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15 or 18, or 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the invention provides a swallowable device for delivering a drug or other therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of the small or large intestine, peritoneum or other organ of the gastro-intestinal tract, The device comprises a capsule sized to be swallowed and pass through the gastro-intestinal tract, a deployable aligner positioned within the capsule for aligning a longitudinal axis of the capsule with a longitudinal axis of the small intestine, a delivery mechanism for delivering the therapeutic agent into the intestinal wall and a deployment member for deploying at least one of the aligner or the delivery mechanism. The capsule wall is degradable by contact with liquids in the GI tract but also may include an outer coating or layer which only degrades in the higher pH found in the small intestine, and serves to protect the underlying capsule wall from degradation within the stomach before the capsule reaches the small intestine at which point the drug delivery is initiated by degradation of the coating. In use, such materials allow for the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a selected portion of the intestinal tract such as the small intestine. Suitable outer coatings can include various enteric coatings such as various co-polymers of acrylic acid (a particular example including EUDRAGIT available from EVONIK industries), Methacrylic Acid and Ethyl Acrylate. In particular embodiments, the outer coating can be configured to degrade in the pH found in the upper portion of the small intestine (e.g., the duodenum) or mid portions (jejunum) such that therapeutic agent preparation is delivered into that respective portion and avoids the lower portion of the small intestine (the ileum) containing the Peyer's patches which are aggregated lymphoid nodules which produce macrophages, and other immune related cells. An example of such a coating which degrades in the pH of the duodenum or jejunum can include EUDRAGIT. By delivering the therapeutic agent to a location in the small intestine without Peyer's patches, the subsequent immune response including the generation of various antibodies to the particular therapeutic agent such as inhibitor antibodies to Factor VIII, is suppressed or otherwise minimized. Thus in use, such controlled placement or delivery of the therapeutic agent into the upper, mid or other select portions of the small intestines, can suppress the immune response of the patient to a particular therapeutic agent (e.g., Factor VIII or other clotting factor) resulting in increased efficacy and tolerance to a dose of a given therapeutic agent delivered orally vs that delivered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the capsule includes at least one guide tube, one or more tissue penetrating members positioned in at least one guide tube, a delivery member and an actuating mechanism, The tissue penetrating member will typically comprise a hollow needle or other like structure and will have a lumen and a tissue penetrating end for penetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the device can include a second and a third tissue penetrating member with additional numbers contemplated. Each tissue penetrating member can include the same or a different drug. In preferred embodiments having multiple tissue penetrating members, the tissue penetrating members can be symmetrically distributed around the perimeter of the capsule so as to anchor the capsule onto the intestinal wall during delivery of drug. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the tissue penetrating member (e.g., the tissue penetrating end) can be fabricated from the drug preparation itself. In these and related embodiments, the drug preparation can have a needle, dart-like or other elongated structure with a pointed end (with or without barbs) configured to penetrate and be retained in the intestinal wall.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The tissue penetrating member can be fabricated from various biodegradable materials so as to degrade within the small intestine and thus provide a fail-safe mechanism for detaching the tissue penetrating member from the intestinal wall should this component become retained in the intestinal wall. Such biodegradable materials may correspond to one or more of, PGLA, maltose or other sugar, polyethylene, polyethylene oxide or other biodegradable polymer known in the art. Additionally, in these and related embodiments, selectable portions of the capsule can be fabricated from such biodegradable materials so as to allow the entire device to controllably degrade into smaller pieces. Such embodiments facilitate passage and excretion of the devices through the GI tract. In particular embodiments, the capsule can include seams of biodegradable material which controllably degrade to produce capsule pieces of a selectable size and shape to facilitate passage through the GI tract. The seams can be pre-stressed, perforated or otherwise treated to accelerate degradation. The concept of using biodegradable seams to produce controlled degradation of a swallowable device in the GI tract can also be applied to other swallowable devices such as swallowable cameras to facilitate passage through the GI tract and reduce the likelihood of a device becoming stuck in the GI tract.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The delivery member is configured to advance the drug from the capsule through the tissue penetrating member lumen and into the intestinal wall. Typically, at least a portion of the delivery member is advanceable within the tissue penetrating member lumen. The delivery member can have a piston or like structure sized to fit within the delivery member lumen. The distal end of the delivery member (the end which is advanced into tissue) can have a plunger element which advances the drug within tissue penetrating member lumen and also forms a seal with the lumen. The plunger element can be integral or attached to the delivery member. Preferably, the delivery member is configured to travel a fixed distance within the needle lumen so as to deliver a fixed or metered dose of drug into the intestinal wall. This can be achieved by one or more of the selection of the diameter of the delivery member (e.g., the diameter can be distally tapered), the diameter of the tissue penetrating member (which can be narrowed at its distal end), use of a stop and/or the actuating mechanism. For embodiments of the device having a tissue penetrating member fabricated from drug (e.g., a drug dart), the delivery member is adapted to advance the dart out of the capsule and into tissue.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The delivery member and tissue penetrating member can be configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid forms of drug or all three. Solid forms of drug can include both powder and pellet. Semi liquid can include a slurry or paste. The drug can be contained within a cavity of the capsule, or in the case of the liquid or semi-liquid, within an enclosed reservoir. In some embodiments, the capsule can include a first, second, or a third drug (or more). Such drugs can be contained within the tissue penetrating member lumen (in the case of solids or powder) or in separate reservoirs within the capsule body.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The actuating mechanism can be coupled to at least one of the tissue penetrating member or the delivery member. The actuating mechanism is configured to advance the tissue penetrating member a selectable distance into the intestinal wall as well as advance the delivery member to deliver the drug and then withdraw the tissue penetrating member from the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the actuating mechanism can comprise a preloaded spring mechanism which is configured to be released by the release element. Suitable springs can include both coil (including conical shaped springs) and leaf springs with other spring structures also contemplated. In particular embodiments, the spring can be cone shaped to reduce the length of the spring in the compressed state even to the point where the compressed length of the spring is about the thickness of several coils (e.g., two or three) or only one coil.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular embodiments, the actuating mechanism comprises a spring, a first motion converter, and a second motion converter and a track member. The release element is coupled to the spring to retain the spring in a compressed state such that degradation of the release element releases the spring. The first motion converter is configured to convert motion of the spring to advance and withdraw the tissue penetrating element in and out of tissue. The second motion converter is configured to convert motion of the spring to advance the delivery member into the tissue penetrating member lumen. The motion converters are pushed by the spring and ride along a rod or other track member which serves to guide the path of the converters. They engage the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery member (directly or indirectly) to produce the desired motion. They are desirably configured to convert motion of the spring along its longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion of the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery member though conversion in other directions is also contemplated. The motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or curved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In particular embodiments, the first motion converter can have a trapezoidal shape and include a slot which engages a pin on the tissue penetrating member that rides in the slot. The slot can have a trapezoidal shape that mirrors or otherwise corresponds to the overall shape of the converter and serves to push the tissue penetrating member during the upslope portion of the trapezoid and then pull it back during the down slope portion. In one variation, one or both of the motion converters can comprise a cam or cam like device which is turned by the spring and engages the tissue penetrating and/or delivery member.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other variations, the actuating mechanism can also comprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism such as a solenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, the piezoelectric device can comprise a shaped piezoelectric element which has a non-deployed and deployed state. This element can be configured to go into the deployed state upon the application of a voltage and then return to the non-deployed state upon the removal of the voltage. This and related embodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the actuating mechanism so as to both advance the tissue penetrating member and then withdraw it.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The release element is coupled to at least one of the actuating mechanism or a spring coupled to the actuating mechanism. In particular embodiments, the release element is coupled to a spring positioned within the capsule so as to retain the spring in a compressed state. Degradation of the release element releases the spring to actuate the actuation mechanism. In many embodiments, the release element comprises a material configured to degrade upon exposure to chemical conditions in the small or large intestine such as pH. Typically, the release element is configured to degrade upon exposure to a selected pH in the small intestine, e.g., about 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 or greater. However, it can also be configured to degrade in response to other conditions in the small intestine e.g., osmolality, fluid content of the small intestine contents, viscosity of contents, flora, compressive forces, presence and/or concentration of various bile salts and the like. In particular embodiments, the release element can be configured to degrade in response to particular chemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such as those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal high in fats or proteins).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Biodegradation of the release element from one or more conditions (e.g., pH, osmolality, presence of bile salts, etc.) in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract) can be achieved by selection of the materials for the release element, the amount of cross linking of those materials as well as the thickness and other dimensions of the release elements. Lesser amounts of cross linking and or thinner dimensions can increase the rate of degradation and vice versa. Suitable materials for the release element can comprise biodegradable materials such as various enteric materials which are configured to degrade upon exposure to the higher pH or other condition in the small intestine. The enteric materials can be copolymerized or otherwise mixed with one or more polymers to obtain a number of particular material properties in addition to biodegradation. Such properties can include without limitation stiffness, strength, flexibility and hardness.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In particular embodiments, the release element can comprise a film or plug that fits over or otherwise blocks the guide tube and retains the tissue penetrating member inside the guide tube. In these and related embodiments, the tissue penetrating member is coupled to a spring loaded actuating mechanism such that when the release element is degraded sufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating member which then springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into the intestinal wall. In other embodiments, the release element can be shaped to function as a latch which holds the tissue penetrating element in place. In these and related embodiments, the release element can be located on the exterior or the interior of the capsule. In the interior embodiments, the capsule and guide tubes are configured to allow for the ingress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to allow for the degradation of the release element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the actuating mechanism can be actuated by means of a sensor, such as a pH or other chemical sensor which detects the presence of the capsule in the small intestine and sends a signal to the actuating mechanism (or to an electronic controller coupled to the actuating mechanism to actuate the mechanism). Embodiments of a pH sensor can comprise an electrode-based sensor or a mechanical-based sensor such as a polymer which shrinks or expands upon exposure to the pH or other chemical conditions in the small intestine. In related embodiments, an expandable/contractible sensor can also comprise the actuating mechanism itself by using the mechanical motion from the expansion or contraction of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another embodiment for detecting that the device is in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract), the sensor can comprise a strain gauge or other pressure/force sensor for detecting the number of peristaltic contractions that the capsule is being subject to within a particular location in the intestinal tract. In these embodiments, the capsule is desirably sized to be gripped by the small intestine during a peristaltic contraction). Different locations within the GI tract have different number of peristaltic contractions. The small intestine has between 12 to 9 contractions per minute with the frequency decreasing down the length of the intestine. Thus, according to one or more embodiments detection of the number of peristaltic contractions can be used to not only determine if the capsule is in the small intestine but the relative location within the intestine as well.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an alternative or supplement to internally activated drug delivery, in some embodiments, the user may externally activate the actuating mechanism to deliver drug by means of RF (radio frequency), magnetic or other wireless signaling means known in the art. In these and related embodiments, the user can use a handheld device (e.g., a hand held RF device) which not only includes signaling means, but also means for informing the user when the device is in the small intestine or other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can be implemented by including an RF transmitter on the swallowable device to signal to the user when the device is in the small intestine or other location (e.g., by signaling an input from the sensor). The same handheld device can also be configured to alert the user when the actuating mechanism has been activated and the selected drug(s) delivered. In this way, the user is provided confirmation that the drug has been delivered. In another approach an external acoustical sensor can be used to detect when the actuating mechanism has been activated by detecting sounds unique to the actuating mechanism be activated, for example, by detecting one or more eigen frequency sounds which can occur for embodiments using a chamber including a piston and cylinder mechanism operably coupled to the tissue penetrating member. One or more of the preceding approaches allow the user to take other appropriate drugs/therapeutic agents as well as make other related decisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and what foods should be eaten). The handheld device can also be configured to send a signal to the swallowable device to over-ride the actuating mechanism and so prevent, delay or accelerate the delivery of drug. In use, such embodiments allow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or accelerate the delivery of drug based upon other symptoms and/or patient actions (e.g., eating a meal, deciding to go to sleep, taking other medication, exercise etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The user may also externally activate the actuating mechanism at a selected time period after swallowing the capsule. The time period can be correlated to a typical transit time or range of transit times for food moving through the user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract such as the small intestine. External activation can be done by any number of means including radio control means (e.g., using an RF communication device), magnetic means (e.g., by use of miniature magnetic switch or release built into the swallowable device that the user activates with an external magnetic) or acoustic means (e.g., via an ultrasonic transmission device and an acoustical receive and/or switch built into the swallowable device).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another aspect of the invention provides therapeutic agent preparations such as various clotting factors for delivery into the wall of the small intestine (including surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal wall or peritoneal cavity) or other wall in the intestinal tract using embodiments of the swallowable device described herein. The preparation comprises a therapeutically effective dose of at least one therapeutic agent such as a clotting factor or other coagulation protein. Also, it may comprise a solid, liquid or combination of both and can include one or more pharmaceutical excipients. The preparation has a shape and material consistency to be contained in embodiments of the swallowable capsule, delivered from the capsule into the intestinal wall, peritoneum, peritoneal cavity wall or other surrounding tissue and degrade within the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneum or peritoneal cavity and release the dose of therapeutic agent. In particular embodiments, the preparation is configured to degrade within the fluids of the peritoneum or peritoneal cavity such that the clotting factor or other therapeutic agent is dispersed along the serous membranes of the visceral and/or parietal peritoneum. The preparation may also have a selectable surface area to volume ratio so as enhance or otherwise control the rate of degradation of the preparation in the wall of the small intestine or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneum (e.g., the visceral peritoneum) and peritoneal cavity or other body lumen. In various embodiments, the preparation can be configured to be coupled to an actuator such as a release element or actuation mechanism which has a first configuration in which the preparation is contained in the capsule and a second configuration in which the preparation is advanced out of the capsule and into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneum. The dose of the drug or other therapeutic agent in the preparation can be titrated downward from that which would be required for conventional oral delivery methods so that potential side effects from the drug can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typically, though not necessarily, the preparation will be shaped and otherwise confitzured to be contained in the lumen of a tissue penetrating member, such as a hollow needle, which is configured to be advanced out of the capsule and into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneum (e.g., the visceral peritoneum) or peritoneal cavity. The preparation itself may comprise a tissue penetrating member configured to be advanced into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall, or other lumen in the intestinal tract. Such configurations of the tissue penetrating member may include various shapes having a pointed tip including for example, needles, darts, and other like shapes. In particular embodiments the tissue penetrating member comprises various elongated shapes having a pointed end. It may also comprise various isometric shapes having a pointed end, such as a triangle, square with pointed end, conical with a pointed end, or hemispherical with a pointed end.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another aspect of the invention provides methods for the delivery of drugs and the therapeutic agents into the walls of the GI tract using embodiments of the swallowable drug delivery devices. Such methods can be used for the delivery of therapeutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and other therapeutic agents. These include a number of large molecule peptides and proteins which would otherwise require injection due to chemical breakdown in the stomach e.g., clotting factors, antibodies, growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, insulin, interferons and other like compounds. Suitable drugs and other therapeutic agents which can be delivered by embodiments of invention include various clotting factors (e.g., Factor VIII) antibodies (TNF inhibiting class of antibodies, chemotherapeutic agents, (es., interferon), antibiotics, antivirals, insulin and related compounds, glucagon like peptides (e.g., GLP-1, Exenatide), parathyroid hormones, growth hormones (e.g., IFG and other growth factors), anti-seizure agents, immune suppressant agents and anti-parasitic agents such as various anti-malarial agents. The dosage of the particular drug can be titrated for the patient's weight, age, condition or other parameter.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various method embodiments of the invention, embodiments of the drug swallowable drug delivery device can be used to deliver a plurality of drugs for the treatment of multiple conditions or for the treatment of a particular condition (e.g., a mixture of protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV/AIDS). In use, such embodiments allow a patient to forgo the necessity of having to take multiple medications for a particular condition or conditions. Also, such embodiments provide a means for ensuring that a regimen of two or more drugs is delivered and absorbed into the small intestine and thus, the blood stream at about the same time. Due to differences in chemical makeup, molecular weight, etc., drugs can be absorbed from the intestine through the intestinal wall at different rates, resulting in different pharmacokinetic distribution curves. Embodiments of the invention address this issue by injecting the desired drug mixtures directly into the intestinal wall at about the same time. This in turn improves (e.g., by substantially synchronizing e.g., within 5% in time) the pharmacokinetic parameters for the mixture of the selected drugs (e.g., by achieving similar t<sub>1/2</sub>'s for different drugs) and thus, the efficacy of the selected mixture of drugs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another aspect, various embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising solid shaped masses comprising a drug such as a clotting factor or antibody having a biological in the body of a mammal wherein at least a portion of the biological activity of the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) is maintained after formation of the shaped mass from a precursor material such as powder. For the case of clotting factors, the biological activity may correspond to promotion or acceleration of the clotting process including promoting the activation of one or more clotting factors (e.g., promotion of Factor X activation as is the case for Factor VIII). For the case of an antibody, the biological activity may correspond to binding affinity to an antigen. The biological activity may be correlated to the structural integrity of the clotting factor (e.g., not having cleavage of any functional groups) or other coagulation protein or other drug post formation (e.g., by correlating bioactivity assays to chemical assays), such that on a compositional level, a selected percentage of the clotting factor or other coagulation protein (e.g., on a weight basis) is maintained post formation relative to that in the precursor material. Typically, the shape will be formed by a compression process (e.g., compression molding), though other processes are also contemplated such as non-compressive molding or 3-D printing. The drug may correspond to a peptide, clotting factor or other coagulation protein, immunoglobulin or other protein wherein the biological activity of the drug in the shaped mass is at least 70% to that prior to compression and more preferably, at least 90% to that prior to compression and still more preferably, at least 95%. These numbers may also correspond to a weight percentage of the drug remaining in the shaped mass relative to that in the precursor material (e.g., by correlating biological activity assays to chemical assays for weight composition as described above). In these and related embodiments, the shaped mass can have a density in a range of about 1.00 and 1.15 mg/mm<sup>3 </sup>and in more preferred embodiments, 1.02 and 1.06 mg/mm<sup>3</sup>. The shape will typically comprise a pellet shape but may also have a tablet, conical, cylindrical, cube, sphere or other like shape. Typically the pellet or other form of the shaped mass will then be inserted into an embodiment of the tissue penetrating member described herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the invention also provide methods for forming solid shaped masses comprising immunoglobulins, clotting factors, or other clotting proteins where the shaped masses are formed by the shaping of a precursor material and where at least a portion of the biological activity (e.g., antigen binding affinity, specificity, etc.) of the peptide, clotting factor or other coagulation protein in the shaped mass is preserved after formation. In many embodiments, the shaping is done by compression of the precursor material where the compressive forces are selected to minimize degradation of the biological activity of the protein or polypeptide. Other shaping methods are also contemplated such as non-compression molding and 3-D printing. Typically, the precursor material will comprise a powder mixture comprising the drug and one or more excipients. The precursor material may also comprise a liquid, slurry or paste. The excipients may include one more of a lubricant, a binder, bulking agent, etc. The shaped mass may be in the form of a tablet, micro-tablet, pill or slug shape. According to one or more embodiments, the shaped masses produced using embodiments of the formation process can have another property such as density or particle grain size (of the powder used to formulate the shaped mass) which is correlated to minimum level of bioactivity of the protein or peptide. Also, that correlated property may be consistently maintained within a selected range within a given lot of shaped masses as well as from lot to lot. Embodiments of the solid masses described herein can be configured to be used in combination with any suitable drug delivery system to be administered via any appropriate route of administration for the condition to be treated. Such routes of administration can include without limitation, oral, sublingual, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, intra-ventricular, intra-cardiac, or intracranial. For example, according to one embodiment, clotting factor containing micro-tablets (e.g., a microtablet containing Factor VII , VIII, etc) can be taken orally and delivered into the small intestine where the clotting factor is delivered into the wall of the small intestine and subsequently into the peritoneum and peritoneal cavity where the tablet(s) dissolves to release the clotting factor. In another embodiment, micro tablets can be injected or otherwise placed subcutaneously (e.g., intramuscularly) where they dissolve to release clotting factor or other coagulation protein into the bloodstream.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further details of these and other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described more fully below, with reference to the attached drawing figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a swallowable drug delivery device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a system including a swallowable drug delivery device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a kit including a swallowable drug delivery device and a set of instructions for use.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d </i></figref>is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a swallowable drug delivery device including a drug reservoir.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded actuation mechanism for advancing tissue penetrating members into tissue.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded actuation mechanism having a first motion converter.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded actuation mechanism having first and a second motion converter.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating engagement of the first and second motion converters with the tissue penetrating member and delivery members.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device having a single tissue penetrating member and an actuating mechanism for advancing the tissue penetrating member.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>is a cross sectional view illustrating an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device having multiple tissue penetrating members and an actuating mechanism for advancing the tissue penetrating members.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>is a cross sectional view illustrating deployment of the tissue penetrating members of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>to deliver medication to a delivery site and anchor the device in the intestinal wall during delivery.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b></figref><i>c </i>are side views illustrating positioning of the drug delivery device in the small intestine and deployment of the tissue penetrating members to deliver drug;

Collectively, one or more of delivery member <b>50</b> and mechanism <b>60</b> may comprise a means for delivery of medication <b>100</b> into a wall of the intestinal tract. Other delivery means contemplated herein include one or more expandable balloons (e.g., delivery balloon <b>172</b>) or other expandable device/member described herein.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Device <b>10</b> can be configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid forms of medication <b>100</b> or all three. Solid forms of medication/preparation <b>100</b> can include both powder and pellet. Semi liquid forms can include a slurry or paste. Whatever the form, preparation <b>100</b> desirably has a shape and material consistency allowing the medication to be advanced out of the device, into the intestinal wall (or other luminal wall in the GI tract) and then degrade in the intestinal wall to release the drug or other therapeutic agent <b>101</b> which in various embodiments may correspond to one or more clotting factors for the treatment of Hemophilia or other clotting disorders as described herein. For example Factor VIII, for the treatment of Hemophilia A and Factor IX for the treatment of Hemophilia B. The material consistency of the preparation can include one or more of the hardness, porosity and solubility of the preparation (in body fluids) as well its shape, having a tissue penetrating end for penetrating through the intestinal wall and into the peritoneal cavity. The material consistency can be achieved by one or more of the following: i) the compaction force used to make the preparation; ii) the use of one or more pharmaceutical disintegrants known in the art; iii) use of other pharmaceutical excipients; iv) the particle size and distribution of the preparation (e.g., micronized particles); and v) use of micronizing and other particle formation methods known in the art. Suitable shapes for preparation <b>100</b> can include cylindrical, cubical, rectangular, conical, spherical, hemispherical and combinations thereof. Also, the shape can be selected so as to define a particular surface area and volume of preparation <b>100</b> and thus, the ratio between the two. The ratio of surface area to volume can in turn, be used to achieve a selected rate of degradation within the intestinal or other lumen wall within the GI tract. Larger ratios (e.g., larger amounts of surface area per unit volume) can be used to achieve faster rates of degradation and vice versa. In particular embodiments, the surface area to volume ratio can be in the range of about 1:1 to 100:1, with specific embodiments of 211, 5:1, 20:1, 25:1, 50:1 and 75:1 (about being within 5%). Preparation/medication <b>100</b> will typically be pre-packed within a lumen 44 of tissue penetrating members <b>40</b>, but can also be contained at another location within an interior <b>24</b> of capsule <b>20</b>, or in the case of a liquid or semi-liquid, within an enclosed reservoir <b>27</b>. The medication can be pre-shaped to fit into the lumen or packed for example, in a powder form. Typically, the device <b>10</b> will be configured to deliver a single drug <b>101</b> as part of medication <b>100</b>. However in some embodiments, the device <b>10</b> can be configured for delivery of multiple drugs <b>101</b> including a first second, or a third drug which can be compounded into a single or multiple medications <b>100</b>. For embodiments having multiple medications/drugs, the medications can be contained in separate tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> or within separate compartments or reservoirs <b>27</b> within capsule <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, a first dose <b>102</b> of medication <b>100</b> containing a first drug <b>101</b> can be packed into the penetrating member(s) <b>40</b> and a second dose <b>103</b> of medication <b>100</b> (containing the same or a different drug <b>101</b>) can be coated onto the surface <b>25</b> of capsule as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b. </i>The drugs <b>101</b> in the two doses of medication <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can be the same or different. In this way, a bimodal pharmacokinetic release of the same or different drugs can be achieved. The second dose <b>103</b> of medication <b>100</b> can have an enteric coating <b>104</b> to ensure that it is released in the small intestine and achieve a time release of the medication <b>100</b> as well.

The size can also be adjusted depending upon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the patient's weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Capsule <b>20</b> includes an interior volume <b>24</b> and an outer surface <b>25</b> having one or more apertures <b>26</b> sized for guide tubes <b>30</b>. In addition to the other components of device <b>10</b>, (e.g., the actuation mechanism etc.) the interior volume can include one or more compartments or reservoirs <b>27</b>. One or more portions of capsule <b>20</b> can be fabricated from various biocompatible polymers known in the art, including various biodegradable polymers which in a preferred embodiment can comprise PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic acid). Other suitable biodegradable materials include various enteric materials described herein as well as lactide, glycolide, lactic acid, glycolic acid, para-dioxanone, caprolactone, trimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copolymers thereof. As is described in further detail herein, in various embodiments, capsule <b>20</b> can include seams <b>22</b> of bio-degradable material so as to controllably degrade into smaller pieces <b>23</b> which are more easily passed through the intestinal tract. Additionally, in various embodiments, the capsule can include various radio-opaque or echogenic materials for location of the device using fluoroscopy, ultrasound or other medical imaging modality. In specific embodiments, all or a portion of the capsule can include radio-opaque/echogenic markers <b>20</b><i>m </i>as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i>In use, such materials not only allow for the location of device <b>10</b> in the GI tract, but also allow for the determination of transit times of the device through the GI tract.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In preferred embodiments, tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> are positioned within guide tubes <b>30</b> which serve to guide and support the advancement of members <b>40</b> into tissue such as the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall or other portion of the GI tract. The tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> will typically comprise a hollow needle or other like structure and will have a lumen <b>44</b> and a tissue penetrating end <b>45</b> for penetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall IW. Member <b>40</b> may also include a pin <b>41</b> for engagement with a motion converter <b>90</b> described herein. The depth of penetration can be controlled by the length of member <b>40</b>, the configuration of motion converter <b>90</b> described herein as well as the placement of a stop or flange <b>40</b><i>s </i>on member <b>40</b> which can, in an embodiment, correspond to pin <b>41</b> described herein. Medication <b>100</b> will typically be delivered into tissue through lumen <b>44</b>. In many embodiments, lumen <b>44</b> is pre-packed with the desired medication <b>100</b> which is advanced out of the lumen using delivery member <b>50</b> or other advancement means (e.g., by means of force applied to a collapsible embodiment of member <b>40</b>). As an alternative, medication <b>100</b> can be advanced into lumen <b>44</b> from another location/compartment in capsule <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> can be fabricated from medication <b>100</b> itself (e.g., clotting factors such as Factors VII, VIII, IX or X or other coagulation protein). In these and related embodiments, the medication can have a needle or dart-like structure (with or without barbs) or other elongated structure with a pointed end configured to penetrate and be retained in the intestinal wall (e.g., the wall of the small intestine) or surrounding tissue such as the peritoneal wall or peritoneal cavity) after insertion. The dart can be sized and shaped depending upon the medication, dose and desired depth of penetration into the intestinal wall. Medication <b>100</b> can be formed into darts, pellets or other shapes using various compression molding methods known in the pharmaceutical arts.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In various embodiments, device <b>10</b> can include a second <b>42</b> and a third <b>43</b> tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> as is shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>, with additional numbers contemplated. Each tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> can be used to deliver the same or a different medication <b>100</b>. In preferred embodiments, the tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> can be substantially symmetrically distributed around the perimeter <b>21</b> of capsule <b>20</b> so as to anchor the capsule onto the intestinal wall IW during delivery of medications <b>100</b>. Anchoring capsule <b>20</b> in such a way reduces the likelihood that the capsule will be displaced or moved by peristaltic contractions occurring during delivery of the medication. In specific embodiments, the amount of anchoring force can be adjusted to the typical forces applied during peristaltic contraction of the small intestine. Anchoring can be further facilitated by configured some or all of tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> to have a curved or arcuate shape.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Delivery member <b>50</b> is configured to advance medication <b>100</b> through the tissue penetrating member lumen <b>44</b> and into the intestinal wall IW. Accordingly, at least a portion of the delivery member <b>50</b> is advanceable within the tissue penetrating member lumen <b>44</b> and thus member <b>50</b> has a size and shape (e.g., a piston like shape) configured to fit within the delivery member lumen <b>44</b>,</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the distal end <b>50</b>d of the delivery member (the end which is advanced into tissue) can have a plunger element <b>51</b> which advances the medication within the tissue penetrating member lumen <b>44</b> and also forms a seal with the lumen. Plunger element <b>51</b> can be integral or attached to delivery member <b>50</b>. Preferably, delivery member <b>50</b> is configured to travel a fixed distance within the needle lumen <b>44</b> so as to deliver a fixed or metered dose of drug into the intestinal wall IW. This can be achieved by one or more of the selection of the diameter of the delivery member (e.g., the diameter can be distally tapered), the diameter of the tissue penetrating member (which can be narrowed at its distal end), use of a stop, and/or the actuating mechanism. However in some embodiments, the stroke or travel distance of member <b>50</b> can be adjusted in situ responsive to various factors such as one or more sensed conditions in the GI tract. In situ adjustment can be achieved through use of logic resource <b>29</b> (including controller <b>29</b><i>c</i>) coupled to an electro-mechanical embodiment of actuating mechanism <b>60</b>. This allows for a variable dose of medication and/or variation of the distance the medication is injected into the intestinal wall.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Actuating mechanism <b>60</b> can be coupled to at least one of the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> or delivery member <b>50</b>. The actuating mechanism is configured to advance tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> a selectable distance into the intestinal wall IW as well as advance the delivery member to deliver medication <b>100</b> and then withdraw the tissue penetrating member from the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, actuating mechanism <b>60</b> can comprise a spring loaded mechanism which is configured to be released by release element <b>70</b>. Suitable springs <b>80</b> can include both coil (including conical shaped springs) and leaf springs with other spring structures also contemplated. In particular embodiments, spring <b>80</b> can be substantially cone-shaped to reduce the length of the spring in the compressed state even to the point where the compressed length of the spring is about the thickness of several coils (e.g., two or three) or only one coil.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In particular embodiments actuating mechanism <b>60</b> can comprise a spring <b>80</b>, a first motion converter <b>90</b>, and a second motion converter <b>94</b> and a track member <b>98</b> as is shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b></figref><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>c. </i>The release element <b>70</b> is coupled to spring <b>80</b> to retain the spring in a compressed state such that degradation of the release element releases the spring. Spring <b>80</b> may be coupled to release element <b>70</b> by a latch or other connecting element <b>81</b>. First motion converter <b>90</b> is configured to convert motion of spring <b>80</b> to advance and withdraw the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> in and out of the intestinal wall or other tissue. The second motion converter <b>94</b> is configured to convert motion of the spring <b>80</b> to advance the delivery member <b>50</b> into the tissue penetrating member lumen <b>44</b>. Motion converters <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> are pushed by the spring and ride along a rod or other track member <b>98</b> which fits into a track member lumen <b>99</b> of converter <b>90</b>. The track member <b>98</b> serves to guide the path of the converters <b>90</b>. Converters <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> engage the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> and/or delivery member <b>50</b> (directly or indirectly) to produce the desired motion. They have a shape and other characteristics configured to convert motion of the spring <b>80</b> along its longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion of the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> and/or delivery member <b>50</b> though conversion in other directions is also contemplated. The motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or curved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In particular embodiments, the first motion converter <b>90</b> can have a trapezoidal shape <b>90</b><i>t </i>and include a slot <b>93</b> which engages a pin <b>41</b> on the tissue penetrating member that rides in the slot as is shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. Slot <b>93</b> can also have a trapezoidal shape <b>93</b><i>t </i>that mirrors or otherwise corresponds to the overall shape of converter <b>90</b>. Slot <b>93</b> serves to push the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> during the upslope portion <b>91</b> of the trapezoid and then pull it back during the down slope portion <b>92</b>. In one variation, one or both of the motion converters <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> can comprise a cam or cam like device (not shown). The cam can be turned by spring <b>80</b> so as to engage the tissue penetrating and/or delivery members <b>40</b> and <b>50</b>. One or more components of mechanism <b>60</b> (as well as other components of device <b>10</b>) including motion converters <b>90</b> and <b>94</b> can be fabricated using various MEMS-based methods known in the art so as to allow for selected amounts of miniaturization to fit within capsule <b>10</b>. Also as is described herein, they can be formed from various biodegradable materials known in the art.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other variations, the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> can also comprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism such as a solenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, a piezoelectric device used in mechanism <b>60</b> can comprise a shaped piezoelectric element which has a non-deployed and deployed state. This element can be configured to go into the deployed state upon the application of a voltage and then return to the non-deployed state upon the removal of the voltage or other change in the voltage. This and related embodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> so as to both advance the tissue penetrating member and then withdraw it. The voltage for the piezoelectric element can be obtained generated using a battery or a piezoelectric based energy converter which generates voltage by mechanical deformation such as that which occurs from compression of the capsule <b>20</b> by a peristaltic contraction of the small intestine around the capsule. Further description of piezoelectric based energy converters is found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/556,524 which is fully incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. In one embodiment, deployment of tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> can in fact be triggered from a peristaltic contraction of the small intestine which provides the mechanical energy for generating voltage for the piezoelectric element.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Release element <b>70</b> will typically be coupled to the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> and/or a spring coupled to the actuating mechanism; however, other configurations are also contemplated. In preferred embodiments, release element <b>70</b> is coupled to a spring <b>80</b> positioned within capsule <b>20</b> so as to retain the spring in a compressed state <b>85</b> as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Degradation of the release element <b>70</b> releases spring <b>80</b> to actuate actuation mechanism <b>60</b>. Accordingly, release element <b>70</b> can thus function as an actuator <b>70</b><i>a </i>(actuator <b>70</b> may also include spring <b>80</b> and other elements of mechanism <b>60</b>). As is explained further below, release element <b>70</b> and actuator <b>70</b><i>a </i>have a first configuration where the therapeutic agent preparation <b>100</b> is contained within capsule <b>20</b> and a second configuration where the therapeutic agent preparation is advanced from the capsule into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall or cavity or other luminal wall in the intestinal tract.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In many embodiments, release element <b>70</b> comprises a material configured to degrade upon exposure to chemical conditions in the small or large intestine such as pH. Typically, release element <b>70</b> is configured to degrade upon exposure to a selected pH in the small intestine, e.g., 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3. 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 8.0 or greater. The release element can also be configured to degrade within a particular range of pH such as, e.g., 7.0 to 7.5. In particular embodiments, the pH at which release element <b>70</b> degrades (defined herein as the degradation pH) can be selected for the particular drug to be delivered so as to release the drug at a location in small intestine which corresponds to the selected pH. Further, for embodiments of device <b>10</b> having multiple medications <b>100</b>, the device can include a first release element <b>70</b> (coupled to an actuating mechanism for delivering a first drug) configured to degrade at first pH and a second release element <b>70</b> (coupled to an actuating mechanism for delivering a second drug) configured to degrade at a second pH (with additional numbers of release elements contemplated for varying number of drugs).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Release element <b>70</b> can also be configured to degrade in response to other conditions in the small intestine (or other GI location). In particular embodiments, the release element <b>70</b> can be configured to degrade in response to particular chemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such as those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal containing fats, starches or proteins). In this way, the release of medication <b>100</b> can be substantially synchronized or otherwise timed with the digestion of a meal.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Various approaches are contemplated for biodegradation of release element <b>70</b>. In particular embodiments, biodegradation of release element <b>70</b> from one or more conditions in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract) can be achieved by one or more of the following approaches: i) selection of the materials for the release element, ii) the amount of cross linking of those materials; and iii) the thickness and other dimensions of the release element. Lesser amounts of cross linking and or thinner dimensions can increase the rate of degradation and vice versa. Suitable materials for the release element can comprise biodegradable materials such as various enteric materials which are configured to degrade upon exposure to the higher pH in the intestines. Suitable enteric materials include, but are not limited to, the following: cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, co-polymerized methacrylic acid/methacrylic acid methyl esters as well as other enteric materials known in the art. The selected enteric materials can be copolymerized or otherwise combined with one or more other polymers to obtain a number of other particular material properties in addition to biodegradation. Such properties can include without limitation stiffness, strength, flexibility and hardness.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In alternative embodiments, the release element <b>70</b> can comprise a film or plug <b>70</b><i>p </i>that fits over or otherwise blocks guide tubes <b>30</b> and retains the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> inside the guide tube. In these and related embodiments, tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> is coupled to a spring loaded actuating mechanism such that when the release element is degraded sufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating member which then springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into the intestinal wall. In still other embodiments, release element <b>70</b> can be shaped to function as a latch which holds the tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> in place. In these and related embodiments, the release element can be located on the exterior or the interior of capsule <b>20</b>. In the latter case, capsule <b>20</b> and/or guide tubes <b>30</b> can be configured to allow for the ingress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to allow for the degradation of the release element.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, actuating mechanism <b>60</b> can be actuated by means of a sensor <b>67</b>, such as a pH sensor <b>68</b> or other chemical sensor which detects the presence of the capsule in the small intestine. Sensor <b>67</b> can then send a signal to actuating mechanism <b>60</b> or to an electronic controller <b>29</b><i>c </i>coupled to actuating mechanism <b>60</b> to actuate the mechanism. Embodiments of a pH sensor <b>68</b> can comprise an electrode-based sensor or it can be a mechanically-based sensor such as a polymer which shrinks or expands upon exposure to a selected pH or other chemical conditions in the small intestine. In related embodiments, an expandable/contractible sensor <b>67</b> can also comprise the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> itself by using the mechanical motion from the expansion or contraction of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to another embodiment for detecting that the device in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract), sensor <b>67</b> can comprise pressure/force sensor such as strain gauge for detecting the number of peristaltic contractions that capsule <b>20</b> is being subject to within a particular location in the intestinal tract. In such embodiments capsule <b>20</b> is desirably sized to be gripped by the small intestine during a peristaltic contraction. Different locations within the GI tract have different number of peristaltic contractions. The small intestine has between 12 to 9 contractions per minute with the frequency decreasing down the length of the intestine. Thus, according to one or more embodiments, detection of the number of peristaltic contractions can be used to not only determine if capsule <b>20</b> is in the small intestine, but the relative location within the intestine as well. In use, these and related embodiments allow for release of medication <b>100</b> at a particular location in the small intestine.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As an alternative or supplement to internally activated drug delivery (e.g., using a release element and/or sensor), in some embodiments, the user may externally activate the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> to deliver medication <b>100</b> by means of RF, magnetic or other wireless signaling means known in the art. In these and related embodiments, the user can use a handheld communication device <b>13</b> (e.g., a hand held RF device such as a cell phone) as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b, </i>to send a receive signals <b>17</b> from device <b>10</b>. In such embodiments, swallowable device may include a transmitter <b>28</b> such as an RF transceiver chip or other like communication device/circuitry. Handheld device <b>13</b> may not only includes signaling means, but also means for informing the user when device <b>10</b> is in the small intestine or other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can be implemented through the use of logic resources <b>29</b> (e.g., a processor <b>29</b>) coupled to transmitter <b>28</b> to signal to detect and singe to the user when the device is in the small intestine or other location (e.g., by signaling an input from the sensor). Logic resources <b>29</b> may include a controller <b>29</b><i>c </i>(either in hardware or software) to control one or more aspects of the process. The same handheld device can also be configured to alert the user when actuating mechanism <b>60</b> has been activated and the selected medication <b>100</b> delivered (e.g., using processor <b>29</b> and transmitter <b>28</b>). In this way, the user is provided confirmation that medication <b>100</b> has been delivered. This allows the user to take other appropriate drugs/therapeutic agents as well as make other related decisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and what foods should be eaten). The handheld device can also be configured to send a signal to swallowable device <b>10</b> to over-ride actuating mechanism <b>60</b> and so prevent delay or accelerate the delivery of medication <b>100</b>. In use, such embodiments allow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or accelerate the delivery of medication, based upon other symptoms and/or patient actions (e.g., eating a meal, deciding to go to sleep, exercise etc.). The user may also externally activate actuating mechanism <b>60</b> at a selected time period after swallowing the capsule. The time period can be correlated to a typical transit time or range of transit times for food moving through the user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract such as the small intestine.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In particular embodiments, the capsule <b>20</b> can include seams <b>22</b> of biodegradable material which controllably degrade to produce capsule pieces <b>23</b> of a selectable size and shape to facilitate passage through the GI tract as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i></figref>. Seams <b>22</b> can also include pores or other openings <b>22</b><i>p </i>for ingress of fluids into the seam to accelerate biodegradation as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Other means for accelerating biodegradation of seams <b>22</b> can include pre-stressing the seam and/or including perforations <b>22</b><i>f </i>in the seam as is also shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In still other embodiments, seam <b>22</b> can be constructed of materials and/or have a structure which is readily degraded by absorption of ultrasound energy, e.g., high frequency ultrasound (HIFU), allowing the capsule to be degraded into smaller pieces using externally or endoscopically (or other minimally invasive method) administered ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Suitable materials for seams <b>22</b> can include one or more biodegradable materials described herein such as PGLA, glycolic acid etc. Seams <b>22</b> can be attached to capsule body <b>20</b> using various joining methods known in the polymer arts such as molding, hot melt junctions, etc. Additionally for embodiments of capsule <b>20</b> which are also fabricated from biodegradable materials, faster biodegradation of seam <b>22</b> can be achieved by one or more of the following: i) fabricating the seam from a faster biodegrading material, ii) pre-stressing the seam, or iii) perforating the seam. The concept of using biodegradable seams <b>22</b> to produce controlled degradation of a swallowable device in the GI tract can also be applied to other swallowable devices such as swallowable cameras (or other swallowable imaging device) to facilitate passage through the GI tract and reduce the likelihood of such a device becoming stuck in the GI tract. Accordingly, embodiments of biodegradable seam <b>22</b> can be adapted for swallowable imaging and other swallowable devices.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another aspect of the invention provides methods for the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents (in the form of medication <b>100</b>) into the walls of the GI tract using one or more embodiments of swallowable drug delivery device <b>10</b>. An exemplary embodiment of such a method will now be described. The described embodiment of drug delivery occurs in the small intestine SI. However, it should be appreciated that this is exemplary and that embodiments of the invention can be used for delivering drug in a number of locations in the GI tract including the stomach and the large intestine. For ease of discussion, the swallowable drug delivery device <b>10</b> will sometimes be referred to herein as a capsule. As described above, in various embodiments device <b>10</b> may be packaged as a kit <b>11</b> within sealed packaging <b>12</b> that includes device <b>10</b> and a set of instructions for use <b>15</b>. If the patient is using a handheld device <b>13</b>, the patient may be instructed to enter data into device <b>13</b> either manually or via a bar code <b>18</b> (or other identifying indicia <b>18</b>) located on the instructions <b>15</b> or packaging <b>12</b>, If a bar code is used, the patient would scan the bar code using a bar code reader <b>19</b> on device <b>13</b>. After opening packaging <b>12</b>, reading the instructions <b>15</b> and entering any required data, the patient swallows an embodiment of the swallowable drug delivery device <b>10</b>. Depending upon the drug, the patient may take the device <b>10</b> in conjunction with a meal (before, during or after) or a physiological measurement. Capsule <b>20</b> is sized to pass through the GI tract and travels through the patient's stomach S and into the small intestine SI through peristaltic action as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Once in the small intestine, the release element <b>70</b> is degraded by the basic pH in the small intestine (or other chemical or physical condition unique to the small intestine) so as to actuate the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> and deliver medication <b>100</b> into the wall of the small intestine SI according to one or more embodiments of the invention. For embodiments including a hollow needle or other hollow tissue penetrating member <b>40</b>, medication delivery is effectuated by using the actuating mechanism <b>60</b> to advance the member <b>40</b> a selected distance into the mucosa of the intestinal wall IW, and then the medication is injected through the needle lumen <b>44</b> by advancement of the delivery member <b>50</b>. The delivery member <b>50</b> is withdrawn and the member <b>40</b> is then withdrawn back within the body of the capsule (e.g., by recoil of the spring) detaching from the intestinal wall. For embodiments of device <b>10</b> having multiple needles, a second or third needle <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> can also be used to deliver additional doses of the same drug or separate drugs <b>101</b>. Needle or other tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> advancement can be done substantially simultaneously or in sequence. In preferred embodiments that use multiple needles, needle advancement can be done substantially simultaneously so as to anchor device <b>10</b> in the small intestine during drug delivery. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, in many embodiments, including those where drug <b>101</b> comprises a clotting factor CF, device <b>10</b>, including actuating mechanism <b>50</b> are configured to advance needle or other tissue penetrating member <b>40</b> through the intestinal wall IW and the peritoneal wall or peritoneum P, e.g., the visceral peritoneum PV and into the peritoneal cavity PC. Once there the needle is degraded by the serosal and other fluids in the peritoneal cavity PC to release the clotting factor CF into the serosal and other peritoneal cavity fluids and, in turn, into the blood stream by diffusion of the clotting factor CF or other drug <b>101</b> into the vasculature of the peritoneum including that of the visceral and parietal peritoneum. In these and related embodiments, positioning of tissue penetrating member <b>140</b> into the peritoneal cavity PC can be facilitated by configuring the member <b>140</b> to have a symmetric pointed tip <b>145</b> as well as increasing the amount of reactants to as to generating increased pressure for propelling member <b>140</b> completing through the intestinal wall IW and visceral peritoneum PV and then into peritoneal cavity PC. They may also be facilitated by increasing the amount of reactants <b>165</b> in balloon <b>160</b> so to generate an increased amount of gas <b>169</b> and in turn for gas pressure for propelling member <b>140</b> into the peritoneal cavity. In various embodiments of device <b>10</b> configured for delivery of tissue penetrating member <b>140</b> into the peritoneal cavity PC the amount of reactants <b>165</b> by weight (e.g., potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, etc.,) can be increased in the rantze of 10 to 30% over those for positioning member <b>140</b> only into the intestinal wall IW.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">After medication delivery, device <b>10</b> then passes through the intestinal tract including the large intestine LI and is ultimately excreted. For embodiments of the capsule <b>20</b> having biodegradable seams <b>22</b> or other biodegradable portions, the capsule is degraded in the intestinal tract into smaller pieces to facilitate passage through and excretion from the intestinal tract as is shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>. In particular embodiments having biodegradable tissue penetrating needles/members <b>40</b>, should the needle get stuck in the intestinal wall, the needle biodegrades releasing the capsule <b>20</b> from the wall.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">For embodiments of device <b>10</b> including a sensor <b>67</b>, actuation of mechanism <b>60</b> can be effectuated by the sensor sending a signal to actuating mechanism <b>60</b> and/or a processor <b>29</b> or controller <b>29</b><i>c </i>coupled to the actuating mechanism. For embodiments of device <b>10</b> including external actuation capability, the user may externally activate actuating mechanism <b>60</b> at a selected time period after swallowing the capsule. The time period can be correlated to a typical transit time or range of transit times for food moving through the user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract such as the small intestine.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">One or more embodiments of the above methods can be used for the delivery of preparations <b>100</b> containing therapeutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and other therapeutic agents <b>101</b> to treat a variety of diseases and conditions. These include a number of large molecule peptides and proteins which would otherwise require injection due to chemical breakdown in the stomach including, for example, various clotting factors described herein. The dosage of the particular drug can be titrated for the patient's weight, age or other parameter. Also the dose of drug <b>101</b> to achieve a desired or therapeutic effect (e.g., insulin for blood glucose regulation) when delivered by one or more embodiments of the invention can be less than the amount required should the drug have been delivered by conventional oral delivery (e.g., a swallowable pill that is digested in the stomach and absorbed through the wall of the small intestine). This is due to the fact that there is no degradation of the drug by acid and other digestive fluids in the stomach and the fact that all, as opposed to only a portion of the drug is delivered into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall (or other lumen in the intestinal tract, e.g., large intestine, stomach, etc.). Depending upon the drug <b>101</b>, the dose <b>102</b> delivered in preparation <b>100</b> can be in the range from 100 to 5% of a dose delivered by conventional oral delivery (e.g., a pill) to achieve a desired therapeutic effect (e.g., blood glucose regulation, seizure regulation, etc.) with even lower amounts contemplated. The particular dose reduction can be titrated based upon the particular drug, the amount of degradation occurring in the GI tract for conventional oral methods, the frequency of dosing vs dosing using embodiments of the swallowable capsule described herein, the condition to be treated, and the patient's weight, age and condition. For some drugs (with known levels of degradation in the intestinal tract) a standard dose reduction can be employed (e.g., 10 to 20%). Larger amounts of dose reduction can be used for drugs which are more prone to degradation and poor absorption. In this way, the potential toxicity and other side effects (e.g., gastric cramping, irritable bowel, hemorrhage, etc.) of a particular drug or drugs delivered by device <b>10</b> can be reduced because the ingested dose is lowered. This in turn, improves patient compliance because the patient has reduction both in the severity and incidence of side effects. Additional benefits of embodiments employing dose reduction of drug <b>101</b> include a reduced likelihood for the patient to develop a tolerance to the drug (requiring higher doses) and, in the case of antibiotics, for the patient to develop resistant strains of bacteria. Also, other levels of dose reduction can be achieved for patients undergoing gastric bypass operations and other procedures in which sections of the small intestine have been removed or its working (e.g., digestive) length effectively shortened.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition to delivery of a single drug, embodiments of swallowable drug delivery device <b>10</b> and methods of their use can be used to deliver a plurality of drugs for the treatment of multiple conditions or for the treatment of a particular condition (e.g., protease inhibitors for treatment of HIV/AIDS). In use, such embodiments allow a patient to forgo the necessity of having to take multiple medications for a particular condition or conditions. Also, they provide a means for facilitating that a regimen of two or more drugs is delivered and absorbed into the small intestine and thus, the blood stream, at about the same time. Due to difference in chemical makeup, molecular weight, etc., drugs can be absorbed through the intestinal wall at different rates, resulting in different pharmacokinetic distribution curves. Embodiments of the invention address this issue by injecting the desired drug mixtures at substantially the same time. This in turn, improves the pharmacokinetics and thus the efficacy of the selected mixture of drugs. Additionally, eliminating the need to take multiple drugs is particularly beneficial to patients who have one or more long term chronic conditions including those who have impaired cognitive or physical abilities.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In various applications, embodiments of the above methods can be used to deliver preparations <b>100</b> including drugs and therapeutic agents <b>101</b> to provide treatment for a number of medical conditions and diseases. The medical conditions and diseases which can be treated with embodiments of the invention can include without limitati on: cancer, hormonal conditions (e.g., hypo/hyper thyroid, growth hormone conditions), osteoporosis, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and triglyceride, diabetes and other glucose regulation disorders, infection (local or systemic, e.g., septicemia), epilepsy and other seizure disorders, osteoporosis, coronary arrhythmia's (both atrial and ventricular), coronary i schemia anemia or other like condition. Still other conditions and diseases are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In many embodiments, the treatment of the particular disease or condition can be performed without the need for injecting the clotting factor or other coagulation protein or other therapeutic agent (or other non-oral form of delivery such as suppositories) but instead, relying solely on the therapeutic agent(s) that is delivered into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall or other portion of the GI tract. Similarly, the patient need not take conventional oral forms of a drug or other therapeutic agent, but again can rely solely on delivery into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall using embodiments of the swallowable capsule. In other embodiments, the therapeutic agent(s) delivered into the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall can be delivered in conjunction with an injected dose of the agent(s). For example, the patient may take a daily dose of therapeutic agent using the embodiments of the swallowable capsule, but only need take an injected dose every several days or when the patient's condition requires it (e.g., hyperglycemia). The same is true for therapeutic agents that are traditionally delivered in oral form (e.g., the patient can take the swallowable capsule and take the conventional oral form of the agent as needed). The dosages delivered in such embodiments (e.g., the swallowed and injected dose) can be titrated as needed (e.g., using standard dose response curve and other pharmacokinetic methods can be used to determine the appropriate dosages). Also, for embodiments using therapeutic agents that can be delivered by conventional oral means, the dose delivered using embodiments of the swallowable capsule can be titrated below the dosage normally given for oral delivery of the agent since there is little or no degradation of the agent within the stomach or other portion of the intestinal tract (herein again standard dose response curve and other pharmacokinetic methods can be applied).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Various embodiments of preparation <b>100</b> containing one or more drugs or other therapeutic agents <b>101</b> for the treatment of various diseases and conditions will now be described with references to dosages. It should be appreciated that these embodiments, including the particular therapeutic agents and the respective dosages are exemplary and the preparation <b>100</b> can comprise a number of other therapeutic agents described herein (as well as those known in the art) that are configured for delivery into a luminal wall in the intestinal tract (e.g., the small intestinal wall) using various embodiments of device <b>10</b>. The dosages can be larger or smaller than those described and can be adjusted using one or more methods described herein or known in the art.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a group of embodiments, therapeutic agent preparation <b>100</b> can comprise a therapeutically effective dose of growth hormone for the treatment of one or more growth disorders, as well as wound healing. In one embodiment, preparation <b>100</b> can contain a therapeutically effective amount of growth hormone in the range of about 0.1-4mg, with particular ranges of 0.1-1, 1-4, 1-2. and 2-4 mg, with still larger ranges contemplated. The particular dose can be titrated based on one or more of the following factors: i) the particular condition to be treated and its severity (e.g., level and particular type of hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia); ii) the patient's weight; iii) the patient's age; and iv) the frequency of dosage (e.g., daily vs. twice daily).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Drug delivery compositions and components of known drug delivery systems may be employed and/or modified for use in some embodiments of the inventions described herein. For example, micro-needles and other microstructures used for delivery of drugs through the skin surface with drug patches may be modified and included within the capsules described herein and used to instead deliver a drug preparation into a lumen wall of the gastrointestinal tract such as the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneal wall. Suitable polymer micro-needle structures may be commercially available from Corium of California, such as the MicroCor&#x2122; micro delivery system technology. Other components of the MicroCor&#x2122; patch delivery systems, including drug formulations or components, may also be incorporated into the capsules described herein. Alternatively, a variety of providers are commercially available to formulate combinations of polymers or other drug-delivery matrices with selected drugs and other drug preparation components so as to produce desired shapes (such as the releasable tissue-penetrating shapes described herein) having desirable drug release characteristics. Such providers may, for example, include Corium, SurIVIodics of Minnesota, BioSensors International of Singapore, or the like.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">One advantage and feature of various embodiments of the therapeutic compositions described herein is that by being enclosed or otherwise contained in the swallowable capsule or other swallowable device, a clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) or other biologic (e.g., a peptide or protein) drug payload is protected from degradation and/or hydrolysis by the action of peptidases and proteases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These enzymes are ubiquitous throughout living systems. The GI tract is especially rich in proteases whose function is to break down the complex proteins and peptides in one's diet into smaller segments and release amino acids which are then absorbed from the intestine. The devices and compositions described herein are designed to protect the therapeutic peptide, clotting factor or other protein from the actions of these GI proteases and to deliver the peptide or protein payload directly into the wall of the intestine. There are two features in various embodiments of the compositions described herein which serve to protect the protein or peptide payload from the actions of GI proteases. First, in certain embodiments, the capsule shell, which contains the deployment engine and machinery, does not dissolve until it reaches the duodenal and sub-duodenal intestinal segments, owing to the pH-sensitive coating on the outer surface of the capsule which prevents its dissolution in the low pH of the stomach. Second, in certain embodiments, hollow polymer micro-spears (e.g., polyethylene, polyethylene oxide, maltose, silicone etc.) contain the actual therapeutic peptide or protein; the polymer micro-spears are designed to penetrate the intestine muscle as soon as the outer capsule shell dissolves; and the micro-spears themselves slowly dissolve in the intestinal muscle wall to release the drug payload. Thus, the peptide, clotting factor other protein payload is not exposed to the actions of the GI proteases and therefore does not undergo degradation via proteolysis in the GI tract. This in turn, contributes to the high bioavailability of the therapeutic peptide or protein versus what would be expected if one or both of the above approaches were not used and the peptide or protein were exposed to the GI proteases. In particular for embodiments of the compositions comprising compounds which bind to specific receptors or other target region on a molecule, such approaches preserve the binding affinity and specificity of the compound allowing it to bind to the desired receptor.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Clotting factors or other coagulation proteins provided by embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for treating various coagulating disorders. Specific coagulation disorders which may be treated include Hemophilia A and B and von Willebrand's disease. Such embodiments result in the delivery of clotting factors and other coagulation proteins with particular pharmacokinetic properties which are advantageous as compared to intravenous, sub-dermal or intramuscular injection, They also allow for the usage of dosages which provide one or more of the following benefits including: higher therapeutic ratio, reduced incidence of allergic reaction (including e.g., anaphylactic shock; myalgia and neurocognitive and ophthalmologic events) and reduced immunogenicity and/or immunogenic reaction (compared to subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection). In one embodiment, the reduced incidence of allergic reaction can be determined by comparison of such incidences for patient populations who are administered clotting factor or other coagulation protein by standard injection (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous etc.) vs the oral delivery for traditional compounds and then use that reduction to model a predicted reduction for known incidences of allergic reaction in patient populations for one or more of the clotting factors (e.g., Factor VIII) or other coagulation proteins. Dosage</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to one or more embodiments, the dosage of clotting factor or other coagulation protein administered using one or more embodiments of the swallowable capsule is usually, though not necessarily, a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; means a dose of clotting factor (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, IX, X) or other coatzulation protein that results in: i) a detectable improvement in one or more clinical measurements (e.g., clotting time such as prothrombin time) of coagulation of a given coagulation disorder; or ii) a dose of clotting factor or other coagulation protein that inhibits, prevents, lessens, or delays the symptoms of a clotting disorder such as hemophilia (A or B) or von Willebrand's disease. According to various embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of clotting factor (e.g,, Factor VII, VIII, IX and X) delivered by embodiments of the invention can be in a range from about 1000 to 10,000 IU, with specific embodiments of 1400, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 50000, 6000, 7000, 7500, 8000, 9000, 9100 and 9500 IUs. For embodiments where the dosage of drug is determined by weight, a therapeutically effective amount of clotting factor can be in the range of about 0.1 to 10 mg, with specific embodiments of about 1.5 to 10 mg, 1 to 5 mg, 1 to 3 mg, about 0.03 to 1.73 mg, about 0.02 to 1.15 mg and about 0.34 to about lmg with other ranges also contemplated. The specific dose can be selected and depending upon one or more of the specific clotting factor to be delivered (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, etc.), the condition to be treated, clinical setting (e, g., prophylaxis vs acute hemorrhage), patient weight, age and sex, Table 1 lists exemplary dosages in IU per kg patient weight for treatment of hemophilia A and B with Factors VIII and IX respectively in various clinical settings. Other dosages for these and other coagulation disorders and other conditions (e.g. cerebral hemorrhage) are described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="315pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Exemplary doses of Factor VIII (F8) and Factor IX (F9) for the treatment</entry></row><row><entry>and/or prevention of bleeding in Hemophilia A and B patients.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Hemophilia A F8 dose</entry><entry>Hemophilia B F9 dose</entry></row><row><entry>Clinical setting</entry><entry>(IU/kg patient weight)</entry><entry>(IU/kg)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Mild/moderate hemarthroses or</entry><entry>20-30&#x2002;</entry><entry>20-40&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry>hematomas</entry></row><row><entry>Severe hemarthroses or hematomas</entry><entry>30-50&#x2002;</entry><entry>40-60&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry>External bleeding with anemias</entry></row><row><entry>Moderate post-traumatic bleeding</entry></row><row><entry>Cranial trauma</entry><entry>50-100</entry><entry>50-100</entry></row><row><entry>Cerebral hemorrhage</entry></row><row><entry>Surgery prophylaxis</entry><entry>50-100</entry><entry>50-100</entry></row><row><entry>Primary prophylaxis</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2002;&#x2009;25-30 (3 &#xd7; per week)</entry><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2002;&#x2009;30-40 (2 &#xd7; per week)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">According to various embodiments, the dosage of a specific clotting factor (such as those described in Table 1) can be titrated (i.e., adjusted) based on a clotting time measurement such as prothrombin time. So for example, for longer clotting times, the dose of clotting factor can be increased and for shorter clotting times, the dose can be decreased. In this way, the dosage of clotting factor delivered by embodiments of the invention can be optimized for a given patient over their course of treatment and account for conditions such as growth, diet and other medications which may affect the coagulation/clotting properties of their blood including clotting time. In particular embodiments, the patient may be provided with an inventory of swallowable capsules having different doses of a particular clotting factor (e.g. Factor VIII) and then select the dose to use from the inventory based on the clotting time measurement. In particular embodiments, the patient may be provided with a table or other information for selecting a particular dose of clotting factor based on the clotting time or related measurement. According to some embodiments, the table or other information may be electronically stored in memory or logic resources of one or more of cell phone, tablet or other computational device as well as in the Cloud.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">In related or additional embodiments, prothrombin time or other clotting time measurement can be used to select an optimal source of clotting factor for a given patient and coagulation disorder. For example for Factor VIII, prothrombin time can be used to select a plasma derived Factor VIII vs a genetically modified Factor VIII molecule described herein based on which one yields and maintains clotting time in a normal physiologic range, e.g., 25 to 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0000">Benefits of Delivery of Clotting Factors and other Coagulation Proteins into the Intestinal Wall or Other Location in the Intestinal Tract</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">In use, embodiments of the invention providing for delivery of a clotting factor or other coagulation-protein into the wall of the intestine and/or peritoneal wall and adjoining tissue (e,g., the peritoneal wall or cavity) or other target site in the intestinal tract e.g., the larger intestine) for treatment of one or more of the above or conditions provide a number of benefits over injected forms of clotting factors (e.g., Factors VII, VIII, IX and X). Such benefits can include without limitation: i) a higher therapeutic ratio; ii) reduced incidence and severity of the adverse reactions including one or more of: anaphylactic shock or other allergic reaction (including at the injection site), bruising and bleeding at the injection site, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, back pain myalgia, neurocognitive events, and ophthalmologic events; and decreased immunogenicity and /or immunogenic reaction including the development of inhibitory antibodies described herein. These benefits are due to one or more of the following: i) the much smaller doses that are delivered by embodiments of the invention; ii) doses are delivered daily vs weekly or monthly; and iii) the fact that doses are delivered orally vs intravascularly.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">In many embodiments, the therapeutic ratio of dosages of a clotting factor or other coagulation protein delivered orally by embodiments of the invention can be increased significantly over that of clotting factors such as Factor VIII delivered by injection (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously, etc. on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis). In various embodiments, the term &#x201c;significantly&#x201d; corresponds to an increase in the therapeutic ratio in an amount of two times or greater, e.g., seven to thirty times greater or more. For clotting factors such as Factors VII, VIII, IX or X that are typically delivered every two to three days weekly doses when injected (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously, etc.), the therapeutic ratio (e.g., Toxic Dose/Effective Dose) can be increased by a factor in the range of three to seven when delivered in daily oral doses using the swallowable devices provided by the invention, while in the case of monthly injected doses of clotting factors the therapeutic ratio can be increased by a factor of 30 when delivered in daily oral doses by embodiments of the invention. Further, increases can be obtained when the oral dose of clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) is given multiple times over a day. Similar improvements (e.g., by a factor of 2, 3, 30 or even more) can be seen in the incidence in one or more of immunogenicity/immune response (vs intramuscular and/or subcutaneous injection), allergic reaction, and other adverse reactions. Immunogenicity/immune response, being the production by the body of antibodies (e.g., inhibitory antibodies) to the administered coagulation protein/clotting factors which neutralize or otherwise diminish the clinical efficacy of the clotting factor or other coagulation protein. The reduction in the incidence and severity of allergic reaction by a factor of two up to 30 is due to the fact that the antibodies are given in daily doses vs by-weekly or even less frequent periods which tends to desensitize the immune system (the degree of allergic reaction can be determined using methods known in the art and may be correlated to one or more in vitro tests known in the art). Similarly, the degree of reduced immunogenicity including the production of inhibitory antibodies to one or more clotting factors such as Factor VIII can be reduced by a factor of two to as much as thirty or more. This is due to three factors: 1) the doses are not delivered subcutaneously and/or intramuscularly (which tend to exacerbate such responses); 2) the doses are delivered in much smaller amounts, e.g., by a factor of 7 to as much as 30 depending on whether the injected dose is delivered weekly, biweekly, monthly etc.,; and 3) as discussed above the dose of clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) is delivered to the upper portions of the small intestine avoiding the Peyer's patches and subsequent production of immune cells and other immune response. The amount of immune response to a given clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII, etc.,) can be quantified using one more immunologic analytical methods known in the art to measure, for example, the production of generated antibodies (e.g., inhibitor antibodies) to the delivered clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) or other coagulation protein) and/or the percentage of the administered clotting factor that is neutralized by the patient's own antibodies (e.g., inhibitor antibodies). In these and related embodiments, the dosage and dose regiment of the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) can configured to yield a minimal immune response in the patient, wherein minimal means less than 10% of the delivered clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) is neutralized by the patient's own antibodies and more preferably less than 5%.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">In other embodiments, the immune response and/or allergic response to the administered clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) can be quantified by measuring differences in the serum titer of antibodies to a given clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) when administered in daily oral doses vs every two or three days, biweekly or monthly intravenous doses. In these and related embodiments, the dosage and dose regiment of the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) can be configured to yield a minimal immune response in the patient, wherein minimal means less than a 10% increase in the serum concentration of the patient's own antibodies (e.g., inhibitor antibodies) against the administered clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) and more preferably less than a 5% increase.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">In related approaches, the serum titer of cytokines (e.g., interleukins, such as interleukin 7) and/or white blood cells can be measured for the dose and administration of a given clotting factor. In these and related embodiments, the dosage and dose regimen of the clotting factor or other coagulation protein can configured to yield a minimal immune response in the patient, wherein minimal means less than a 10% increase in the serum concentration of one or more of the patients white blood cells and/or a particular cytokine (e.g., interleukin 7) and more preferably less than a 5% increase. In related embodiments, immune response can be quantified by using changes in white blood cell differentials (e.g., increase in the % of Eosinophils or Basophils which occur in allergic reactions). In these and related embodiments, the dosage and dose regiment of the clotting factor or other coagulation protein can be configured to yield a minimal immune response in the patient, wherein minimal means less than a 10% change in the percentage of a particular type of white blood cell (e.g., Eosinophils) in the patient's total white blood cell count.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">Another benefit achieved by delivering doses of various clotting factors or other coagulation protein in daily doses versus longer intervals between dose (e.g., every two or three days, biweekly or monthly doses) by conventional injection means (e.g., by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection) is a reduction in the fluctuation of the patients plasma concentration profile for the particular clotting factor or other coagulation protein which in turn results in a much smoother plasma concentration with time. Using a pharmacokinetic model explained in more detail in Appendix 1, plasma concentration curves were generated for the delivery of Alirocumab (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i></figref>) in biweekly delivery periods verses daily doses (which were titrated down from biweekly dose). As can be seen from the figures, the amount of daily fluctuation in the curves is much less for Alirocumab delivered orally by embodiments of the invention. Also a value known as &#x201c;% steady state fluctuation&#x201d; was calculated for each of these antibodies using an equation shown and described in detail in Appendix 2. The value reflects the amount of daily fluctuation in the plasma concentration of a given drug. As shown in Table <b>2</b> below, the calculated amount of steady state fluctuation in plasma concentration of the particular antibody was reduced significantly when the antibody is delivered by embodiments of the invention in daily doses vs subcutaneous injection (66.3% to 0.39%). With the result being about a 170 times reduction in steady state fluctuation for Alirocumab. The model has also been used to show reductions in steady plasma fluctuations for two anti-interleukin antibodies: Secukinumab and Brodalumab (as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/150,379 which is fully incorporated by reference herein for all purposes) with results shown in Table 3. In these cases, the reductions in steady fluctuation were from 171 to 216x. Thus, the model consistently shows reductions of 170 to 216% in the steady plasma concentrations of a given drug (e.g., clotting factor) when the drug is given in daily doses using embodiments of the invention vs biweekly or monthly using subcutaneous injections. Using such a model, similar absolute values (e.g., 0.12 to 0.39%) and reductions are expected for various clotting factors described herein in % steady state fluctuation. The benefits of such reductions include one or more of the following: reduced risk of adverse event, reduced allergic reaction and immunogenicity (e.g., reduced incidence and amount of inhibitory antibodies to a particular clotting factor such as Factor VIII); as well longer period of time when the patient is kept in the therapeutic range for a given clotting factor allowing the clotting factor to better and more consistently treat the intended clotting disorder e.g., hemophilia. The reduced steady state fluctuation may also be used to quantify a reduction in the patient's immune response to a particular clotting factor such as a reduction in the number of inhibitor antibodies. Such a reduction may be proportional (e.g., directly proportional, fractionally proportion, etc.) or in the form of first order or second order proportionality.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>% Steady State Fluctuation in Plasma/Serum Concentration</entry></row><row><entry>of Alirocumab using conventional subcutaneous dosing of</entry></row><row><entry>the drug vs daily dosing by embodiments of the invention.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Alirocumab</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Conventional</entry><entry>66.33%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Subcutaneous Dosing</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Daily Oral Dosing Using</entry><entry>0.39%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Embodiments of the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Invention</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Decrease in Steady</entry><entry>170x</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Fluctuation</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0115" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>% Steady State Fluctuation in Plasma/Serum Concentration</entry></row><row><entry>of Secukinumab and Brodalumab using conventional</entry></row><row><entry>subcutaneous dosing of the drug vs daily dosing</entry></row><row><entry>by embodiments of the invention.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Secukinumab</entry><entry>Brodalumab</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Conventional Subcutaneous dosing</entry><entry>56.15%</entry><entry>20.48%</entry></row><row><entry>Daily dosing using embodiments of the</entry><entry>0.26%</entry><entry>0.12%</entry></row><row><entry>invention</entry></row><row><entry>Decrease in Steady Fluctuation</entry><entry>216x</entry><entry>171x</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiments of Therapeutic Compositions Comprising Factor VIII</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0111">As discussed above, various embodiments of the invention provide therapeutic compositions comprising clotting factors such as Factor VIII for the treatment of clotting disorders such as Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0112">A brief explanation will now be presented on Factor VIII compounds. Factor VIII (also referred to herein as FVIII or F<b>8</b>) is a glycoprotein that amplifies the coagulation signaling cascade allowing timely clotting upon injury. The gene encoding for FVIII is located on the long arm of the X chromosome Xq28 {Thompson, 2003 # 37} and is constituted of 26 exons, these are intercalated by introns of varying sizes. FVIII is synthesized as a 19 amino acid long signal peptide and a 2332 amino acids sequence. It is produced mainly by the liver. The kidneys, spleen and lymphocytes produce smaller quantities of FVIII. No cultured human cell line can express FVIII which is currently produced using Chinese hamster ovarian cells, baby hamster kidney cells or human embryonic kidney cells genetically modified with the human FVIII cDNA.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0113">The FVIII molecule is composed of three different types of domains: A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b> domains that are homologous to each other and essential for catalytic activity; a B domain that is highly variable across species and heavily glycosylated but not essential for the pro-coagulation activity of the protein {Kaufman, 1997 #36} and C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> domains that are involved in binding with other coagulation factors (FIX and FX) and phospholipids.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0114">FVIII is produced from its mRNA on ribosomes inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the signal peptide is then cleaved in the ER lumen and the protein glycosylated on the B-domain with oligosaccharides rich in mannose residues. Attachment to ER chaperones including Bip (immunoglobulin binding protein), calnexin and calreticulin also occurs in the lumen and Bip transports FVIII aggregates to the cytosol for degradation. Deletion of the B-domain increases secretion of FVIII probably because its binding to Bip is inhibited. Another chaperone, ERGC-53 is responsible for FVIII translocation to the Golgi after Bip dissociates from the protein. ERGC-53 binds to the mannose residues on the B-domain. In the Golgi, FVIII undergoes further glycosylation, disulfide bond foi illation and folding. Since two peptidic bonds are cleaved within the B-domain, the resulting secreted protein is a heterodimer formed by a heavy and a light chain. Some missense mutation in hemophiliac patients cause reduced secretion of FVIII because of increased transport of the protein to the cytosol for degradation from the ER and because of increased Golgi degradation.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0115">Circulating FVIII is stabilized by its binding with Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) that occurs on the B-domain. The half-life of circulating FVIII is approximately 18 hours in normal subjects. The half-life of recombinant FVIII in hemophilic subjects ranges from 10 to 20 hours depending on the blood type and VWF levels. Maximum activity of FVIII is detectable after 1-2 hours of intravenous administration. FVIII is removed from the circulation via binding to a low-density lipoprotein related receptor protein (LRP) that is a liver multi-ligand endocytic receptor {Saenko, 1999 # 39}.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0116">The Factor VIII used in embodiments of the invention, including for preparations <b>100</b>, will typically comprise human Factor VIII and may be a naturally occurring form or a recombinant form. The former includes Factor VIII derived from human plasma. The latter include variants of wild type Factor VII which have the same or higher biological activity compared to the activity of the wild form, but differing from the wild type Factor VIII by insertion, deletion or substitution of one or more amino acids.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Types of Factor VIII Delivered by Embodiments of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0117">Various embodiments of the invention contemplate delivery of a number of different types of available Factor VIII replacement therapies.

Second is recombinant human Factor VIII produced in mammalian cell lines from recombinant DNA technology resulting in the full length human Factor VIII protein (e.g., HELIXATE, KOGENATE, RECOMBINATE and ADVATE). Third is recombinant human factor VIII that has been modified from the wild type version, the most common modification being B-domain deletions (e.g., REFACTO, AFSTYLA and NOVOEIGHT).

Unfortunately, Factor VIIA has a short half-life of 2-4 hours necessitating frequent IV injection. While subcutaneous injection is being investigated as an alternative to intravenous injection to extend the half-life of Factor VIIA, the bioavailability of Factor VII through subcutaneous injection is only 21-30%.

Accordingly, a brief explanation will now be presented on Factor IX compounds. Coagulation Factor IX (FIX) is a critical component in the coagulation cascade and is a causative agent for hemostatic response to injury. It is synthesized in the liver as a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 57,000. Deficiency of FIX leads to hemophilia B. FIX is activated by activated Factor IX (FIXa) in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. FIXa in combination with Factor VIIIc, promulgates the coagulation cascade by activating Factor X (FX) to Xa, thus resulting in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. The activation of FIX comprises of two (2) steps, first the internal peptide bond is cleaved resulting in the formation of a two chain intermediate bridged by a disulphide bond(s). Then, a second specific peptide bond in the amino terminal region of the heavy chain is cleaved, forming the activated factor IX (FIXa). FIX therapy has been shown to temporarily restore hemostasis for patients suffering with hemophilia. There are several FIX replacement product and therapies currently available in the market. They include the following: Alphanine SD, Alprolin, Bebulin, Bebulin Benefix, Idelvion, Ixinity, Immunine, Mononine, Profilnine SD, Proplex and Rixubis.

The dosage of FIX in Mononine depends upon the weight of the patient and desired FIX (IU/dL). A 1 ml formulation of Mononine consists of 100 IU (each IU represents one active FIX) of FIX, mannitol, polysorbate <b>80</b>, histidine, sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0142">There were two clinical studies (patients, n=81) conducted by Behring on the use Mononine for the treatment of hemophilia B which are reported in the prescribing information for Mononine (see http://labeling.cslbehring.com/pi/us/mononine/en/mononine-prescribing-informatim.pdf.). The studies evaluated both safety and efficacy evaluation of Mononine. Infusion of FIX complex concentrates that contained varying but significant amounts of the other liver-dependent blood coagulation proteins (e.g., Factors II,VII and X) into Hemophilia B patients, resulted in FIX recoveries ranging from approximately 0.57-1.1 IU/dL rise per IU/kg body weight infused with plasma half-lives for Factor IX ranging from approximately 23 hours to 31 hours. Five (5) patients (6%) reported adverse reactions. The doses administered ranged between 71 to 161 IU/kg. to 36 subjects. Mean recovery tended to decrease as the dose of Mononine increased: 1.09&#xb1;0.52 K at doses &#x3e;75-95 IU/kg (n=38), 0.98&#xb1;0.45 K at doses &#x3e;95-115 IU/kg (n=21), 0.70&#xb1;0.38 K at doses &#x3e;115-135 IU/kg (n=2), 0.67 K at doses &#x3e;135-155 IU/kg (n=1), and 0.73&#xb1;0.34 K at doses &#x3e;155 IU/kg (n=5).

Accordingly, a brief explanation will now be presented on Factor X compounds. Factor X (EC 3.4.21.6) is a serine protease that is involved in the coagulation cascade. It is a vitamin K dependent protein synthesized in the liver. The FX gene (F<b>10</b>) is 22 kb long and is located at 13q34-ter, 2.8 kb downstream of the F7 gene. The coding sequence is homologous to the other vitamin K-dependent proteins and is divided into eight exons, each of which encodes a specific domain within the protein: exon 1 encodes the signal peptide, exon 2 encodes the propeptide and Gla domain, exon <b>3</b> encodes the aromatic amino acid stack domain, exons 4 and 5 each code for the epidermal growth factor-like regions, exon 6 encodes the activation domain, and exons 7 and 8 encode the catalytic domain. The mature 2-chain form of FX consists of a light chain of 139 amino acids and heavy chain linked by a disulphide bond. The light chain contains the GLA domain and two epidermal growth factor domains; the heavy chain contains the catalytic serine protease domain. The complete 59-kDa 2-chain protein circulates in the plasma at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g ml.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0152">The active form of Factor X, (known asFXa) is a catalytic serine protease that is produced when the zymogen is cleaved in the heavy chain, releasing the 52-residue activation peptide that contains the His236, Asp228 and Ser379 catalytic site. Activation occurs through the extrinsic pathway via tissue Factor:F VIIa complex with calcium ions on a phospholipid surface. Intrinsic pathway activation occurs through the serine protease FIXa and its cofactor FVIIIa in the presence of calcium ions on a phospholipid surface. Factor Xa is the most important activator of prothrombin, cleaving prothrombin to tzenerate thrombin in complex with FVa, Ca++ and phospholipids. FXa can also activate FV and FVIII (Brown DL 2008). FXa is inhibited by forming a complex with antithrombin, the complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0153">Factor X deficiencies are autosomal recessive and affect 1 in 500000 to 1 in 1000000 people in the general worldwide population. There are two classified types of deficiency: type I in which both the levels and the activity of the FX protein are decreased and type II in which the levels of the protein are unaffected but the activity is reduced. The symptoms fall within a wide range of severity that goes from mild to moderate and severe depending on the functional FX circulating levels.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">The current therapy for FX deficiency is a replacement therapy with extracted complexes from human plasma. Commerically availabe products that contain FX complexed with other coagulation factors in varying amounts include Factor X P (CSL Behring) and Coadex (BDI Pharma). A description of each of these compounds along with dosing regimens and rationale will now be described.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">Coagadex</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0155">Coagadex is manufactured by BDI Pharma. Coagadex contains approximately 100 IU/mL of coagulation Factor X and the following inactive ingredients: chloride, phosphate, citrate, sucrose and sodium. The specific activity of Coagadex is typically 80-137 IU per mg protein. The dose and duration of the treatment depend on the severity of the Factor X deficiency, location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient's clinical condition. The dose to achieve a desired in vivo peak increase in Factor X level may be calculated using the following formula: Dose (IU)=Body Weight (kg)&#xd7;Desired Factor X Rise (IU/dL)&#xd7;0.7. Therefore, for a <b>70</b> kg patient, the Factor X dosage to be administered has been determined to be 1960 IU, where the desired Factor X rise has been estimated to be at &#x2dc;40%. Plasma levels of Factor X between 10 to 40% A have been described as hemostatically effective. Based on the half-life of 24 to 40 hours, the administration of Factor X every 24 hours should generally be sufficient if continued treatment is needed.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0156">Based upon the above estimates, the amount of Factor X protein in 1960 IU has been determined to be 14.3 mg, where the specific activity of the coagulation factor X has been considered to be 137 IU factor X/mg protein.

The specific activity of factor X varies between 4-60 IU factor X/mg protein and 3-38 IU factor /mg protein. The dose and duration of the treatment depend on the severity of the Factor X deficiency, location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient's clinical condition. The calculation of the required dose of Factor Xis based on the empirical finding that one unit FX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor X activity by approximately 1.5% of normal activity. The required dosage is determined using the following formula: Dose (IU)=body weight [kg] &#xd7;desired factor X rise [% or IU/dl]&#xd7;0.7. Therefore, for a <b>70</b> kg patient the Factor X dosage to be administered has been determined to be 1960 IU, where the desired Factor X rise has been estimated to be at &#x2dc;40%. Plasma levels of Factor X of between 10 to 40% have been described as hemostatically effective. Based on the half-life of Factor X of a between 24 to 40 hours, the administration of FX every 24 hours should generally be enough if continued treatment is needed. Based upon the above estimates, the amount of factor X protein in 1960 IU has been determined to be 32.6 mg, where the specific activity of the coagulation factor X has been considered to be 60 IU factor X/mg protein. Considering the bioavailability of intra-peritoneal delivery to be about 50% vs IV administration, the required dosage for a 70 kg patient translates to about 65.2 mg of drug every 24-40 hours. For embodiments of device <b>10</b>/capsule <b>20</b> having between about 5 to 9mg of drug per capsule, this works out to about 7 capsules every 24-40 hours.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Embodiments of Bio equivalents of Clotting Factors or other Coagulation Proteins Described Herein</heading><p id="p-0163" num="0158">Various embodiments of the invention also contemplate the compositions and use of proteins which encompass proteins having amino acid sequences that vary from the clotting factors described herein (e.g., including Factors VII, VIIa VIII, IX and X) and their analogues and derivatives. Suitable analogues to Factors VII and VIIa, and methods for making them include those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/354,509 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Suitable analogues to Factor VIII and methods for making them include those described in U.S. Pat.

Such variant analogue clotting factors may include one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids (e.g., leucine vs lysine, etc.) when compared to the amino-acid sequence of a parent coagulating protein (e.g., Factor VIII) but still exhibit biological activity (e.g., coagulation function) that is essentially equivalent to that of the described coagulating proteins in terms of the ability of the variant to function in the coagulation cascade. In particular embodiments, the variants can include deletions in the B-domain of the Factor VIII molecules. The variants may also include modifications of the Factor VIII molecule via Fc fusion or Pegylation, such variations being selected to increase the circulatory half-life of a selected Factor VIII molecule.

Pharmacokinetic metrics of note in this regard include without limitation, C<sub>max</sub>, the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration; tmax, the time to reach C<sub>max</sub>; and t<sub>1/2</sub>, the time required for the plasma concentration of the drug to reach half its C<sub>max </sub>value after having reached C<sub>max</sub>. These metrics can be measured using standard pharmacokinetic measurement techniques known in the art. For example, one approach plasma samples may be taken at set time intervals (e.g., one minute, five minutes, &#xbd; hour, 1 hour, etc.) beginning and then after administration of the clotting factor or other coagulation protein or other therapeutic agent either by use of a swallowable device or by non-vascular injection. The concentration of the drug in plasma can then be measured using one or more appropriate analytical methods such as GC-Mass Spec, LC-Mass Spec. HPLC or various ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) which can be adapted for the particular drug. A concentration vs. time curve (also herein referred to as a concentration profile) can then be developed using the measurements from the plasma samples. The peak of the concentration curve corresponds to C<sub>max </sub>and the time at which this occurs corresponds to t<sub>max</sub>. The time in the curve where the concentration reaches half its maximum value (i.e., C<sub>max</sub>) after having reached C<sub>max </sub>corresponds to t<sub>1/2 </sub>this value is also known as the elimination half-life of the drug. The start time for determination of C<sub>max </sub>can be based on the time at which the injection is made for the case on non-vascular injection and the point in time at which embodiments of the swallowable device advances one or more tissue penetrating members (containing the drug) into the small intestine or other location in the GI tract (e.g., the large intestine). In the latter case, this time can be determined using one or more means including a remote controlled embodiment of the swallowable device which deploys the tissue penetrating members into the intestine wall in response to an external control signal (e.g., an RF signal) or for an embodiment of the swallowable device which sends an RF or other signal detectable outside the body when the tissue penetrating members have been deployed. Other means for detection of tissue penetrating member deployment into the small intestine are contemplated such as one or more medical imaging modalities including, for example, ultrasound or fluoroscopy. In any one of these studies, appropriate animal models can be used, for example, dog, pig, rat etc. in order to model the human pharmacokinetic response.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">Thus, various embodiments provide a therapeutic composition <b>100</b> (also referred to herein as a preparation) comprising a clotting factor (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, IX or X) or other coagulation protein or other therapeutic atzent. The composition is adapted for insertion into an intestinal wall after oral ingestion, wherein upon insertion, the composition releases clotting factor or other coagulation protein into the bloodstream from the intestinal wall to achieve a C<sub>max </sub>faster than an extravascularly injected dose of clotting factor or other coagulation protein, that is to say, achieving a C<sub>max </sub>for the inserted form of clotting factor or other coagulation protein in a shorter time period (e.g., a smaller t<sub>max</sub>) than that for a dose of clotting factor or other coagulation protein that is injected extravascularly. Note, that the dose of clotting factor or other coagulation protein in the composition delivered into the intestinal wall and the dose delivered by extravascular injection, may, but need not, be comparable to achieve these results. In various embodiments, the composition is configured to achieve a tmax for clotting factor or other coagulation protein (e.g., by release of clotting factor into the bloodstream from the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue (e.g., peritoneal tissue) which is about 80%, or 50%, or 30%, or 20%, or 10% of a t<sub>max</sub>, for an extravascularly injected dose of clotting factor. Such an extravascularly injected dose of clotting factor can be, for example, a subcutaneous injection or an intramuscular injection. In certain embodiments, the C<sub>max </sub>attained by delivering clotting factor or other coagulation protein by insertion into the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue is substantially greater, such as 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or even a 100 times greater, than the C<sub>max </sub>attained when the clotting factor or other coagulation protein is delivered orally without insertion into the intestinal wall for example, by a pill or other convention oral form of clotting factor or other coagulation protein. In some embodiments, the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) composition is configured to produce along-term release of clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) which can include periods in the range of about 1 to 60 days, with particular embodiments of 6 to 12 hours, 6 to 24 hours, 12 to 24 hours, 12 to 36 hours/to 2 days, 1 to three days, 1 to 5 days, 1 to 10 days, 1 to 20 days, two days, three days, five days, seven days, ten days, 15 days, 20 days, 30 days, 40 days, 45 days 50 days and 60 days. Also, the composition can be configured to produce a long-term release of clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) with a selectable N. For example, the selectable t<sub>1/2 </sub>may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15 or 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">Any appropriate dose of clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) for a particular patient may be used, depending on factors such as weight, age, condition, other drugs being taken etc. For example, the dose of clotting factor (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, IX or X) or other coagulation protein administered may range from about 1 to 10 mg, with particular ranges of 1-5, 1-4, 2-4, 2-5 and 2-3 mg and individual doses of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 mg. When administered subcutaneously, clotting factor typically has a t<sub>max </sub>in the bloodstream of about 130 hours. Therefore, when administered in a therapeutic clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) composition as described herein, the t<sub>max </sub>of the clotting factor will be shortened, e.g., to about 80%, or 50%, or 30%, or 20%, or 10% of the t<sub>max </sub>for clotting factor when it is subcutaneously injected.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0162">Various embodiments also provide a clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) composition adapted for insertion into an intestinal and/or peritoneal wall after oral ingestion, wherein upon insertion, the composition releases a clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) into the blood stream from the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue (e.g., peritoneal tissue) to achieve a t<sub>1/2 </sub>that is greater than a t<sub>1/2 </sub>for an orally ingested dose of a clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) that is not inserted into the intestinal wall. For example, the t<sub>1/2 </sub>of the dose inserted into the intestinal wall may be 100 or 50 or 10 or 5 times greater than the dose that is not inserted into the intestinal wall.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0163">According to one or more embodiments, the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) may be in solid form, such as a solid form composition configured to degrade in the intestinal wall such as the wall of the small intestine or the peritoneal wall. Also, the solid form composition may have, for example, a tissue penetrating feature such as a pointed tip. In one or more embodiments, the solid form clotting factor (e.g., Factor VIII) composition may be in the form of a shaft with a pointed tip, such as needle or dart, allowing the composition to be penetrate and be inserted into the intestinal wall or peritoneal wall. The clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) composition may comprise at least one biodegradable material and/or may comprise at least one pharmaceutical excipient, including a biodegradable polymer such as PGLA or a sugar such as maltose. In other embodiments, the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) may in a semi-solid or liquid form encased or otherwise fabricated into embodiments of the tissue penetrating member.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0164">Various embodiments of the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein)) composition described herein may be adapted to be orally delivered in a swallowable capsule. In certain embodiments such a swallowable capsule may be adapted to be operably coupled to a mechanism having a first configuration and a second configuration, the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) composition being contained within the capsule in the first configuration and advanced out of the capsule and into the intestinal wall and/or surrounding tissue (e.g., peritoneal tissue) in the second configuration. Such an operably coupled mechanism may comprise at least one of an expandable member, an expandable balloon, a valve, a tissue penetrating member, a valve coupled to an expandable balloon, or a tissue penetrating member coupled to an expandable balloon.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0165">In some embodiments, the clotting factor (e.g., Factor VII, VIII, IX or X) or other coagulation protein may be configured to be delivered within a lumen of a tissue penetrating member and/or the clotting factor (or other coagulation protein) composition may be shaped as a tissue penetrating member advanceable into the intestinal wall. The tissue penetrating member may be sized to be completely contained within the intestinal wall, and/or it may include a tissue penetrating feature for penetrating the intestinal wall, and/or it may include a retaining feature for retaining the tissue penetrating member within the intestinal wall. The retaining feature may comprise, for example, a barb. In some embodiments, the tissue penetrating member is configured to be advanced into the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue (e.g., peritoneal tissue) by the application of a force (e.g., a mechanical force) to a surface of the tissue penetrating member. Desirably, the tissue penetrating member has sufficient stiffness and/or column strength to be advanced completely into the intestinal wall and/or the surface of the penetrating member by the application of the mechanical or other force (e.g., electromagnetic). In various embodiments, the column strength/stiffness of the tissue penetrating member can range from about 1 to 20 lbs., 7 to 20 lbs. or 8 to 12 lbs., with individual embodiments of 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 lbs. The column strength can be achieved by selection of one or more of the material selection and diameter of the tissue penetrating member. In many embodiments, the tissue penetrating member is configured to be operatively coupled to an expandable balloon or other expandable member which applies the force upon expansion. In some embodiments, the tissue penetrating member is configured to be directly coupled to a structure applying the force (e.g., a spring, a shaft and the like or even an expandable device). In these and related embodiments, the tissue penetrating member is configured to detach from a structure applying the force when a direction of the force changes.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0166">Various aspects of the invention also provide other embodiments of a swallowable delivery device for the delivery of medications <b>100</b> in addition to those described above. According to one or more such embodiments, the swallowable delivery device can include one or more expandable balloons or other expandable devices for use in delivering one or more tissue penetrating members including medication <b>100</b> into the wall of an intestine, such as the small intestine. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, another embodiment of a device <b>110</b> for the delivery of medication <b>100</b> to a delivery site DS in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, can comprise a capsule <b>120</b> sized to be swallowed and pass through the intestinal tract, a deployment member <b>130</b>, one or more tissue penetrating members <b>140</b> containing medication <b>100</b>, a deployable aligner <b>160</b> and a delivery mechanism <b>170</b>. In some embodiments, medication <b>100</b> (also referred to herein as preparation <b>100</b>) may itself comprise tissue penetrating member <b>140</b>. The deployable aligner <b>160</b> is positioned within the capsule and configured to align the capsule with the intestine such as the small intestine. Typically, this will entail aligning a longitudinal axis of the capsule with a longitudinal axis of the intestine; however, other alignments are also contemplated. The delivery mechanism <b>170</b> is configured for delivering medication <b>100</b> into the intestinal wall and will typically include a delivery member <b>172</b> such as an expandable member. The deployment member <b>130</b> is configured for deploying at least one of the aligner <b>160</b> or the delivery mechanism <b>170</b>. As will be described further herein, all or a portion of the capsule wall is degradable by contact with liquids in the GI tract so as to allow those liquids to trigger the delivery of medication <b>100</b> by device <b>110</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;GI tract&#x201d; refers to the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and anus, while &#x201c;Intestinal tract&#x201d; refers to the small and large intestine.

The material consistency of medication <b>100</b> can include one or more of the hardness, porosity and solubility of the preparation (in body fluids such as those found in the wall of the small intestine or the peritoneal cavity, e.g., the serosal fluids). The material consistency of medication <b>100</b> can be achieved by selection and use of one or more of the following: i) the compaction force used to make the preparation; ii) the use of one or more pharmaceutical disintegrants known in the art; iii) use of other pharmaceutical excipients; iv) the particle size and distribution of the preparation (e.g., micronized particles); and v) use of micronizing and other particle formation methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0168">Capsule <b>120</b> is sized to be swallowed and pass through the intestinal tract. The size can also be adjusted depending upon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the patient's weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Typically, the capsule will have a tubular shape with curved ends similar to a vitamin. In these and related embodiments, capsule lengths <b>120</b>L can be in the range of 0.5 to 2 inches and diameters <b>120</b>D in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 inches with other dimensions contemplated. The capsule <b>120</b> includes a capsule wall <b>121</b><i>w, </i>having an exterior surface <b>125</b> and an interior surface <b>124</b> defining an interior space or volume <b>124</b><i>v. </i>In some embodiments, the capsule wall <b>121</b><i>w </i>can include one or more apertures <b>126</b> sized for the outward advancement of tissue penetrating members <b>140</b>. In addition to the other components of device <b>110</b>, (e.g., the expandable member etc.) the interior volume can include one or more compartments or reservoirs <b>127</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0169">The capsule can be fabricated from various biodegradable gelatin materials known in the pharmaceutical arts, but can also include various enteric coatings <b>120</b>c, configured to protect the cap from degradation in the stomach (due to acids etc.), and then subsequently degrade in the higher pH's found in the small intestine or other area of the intestinal tract. In various embodiments, the capsule <b>120</b> can be formed from multiple portions one or more of which may be biodegradable. In many embodiments, capsule <b>120</b> can be formed from two portions <b>120</b><i>p </i>such as a body portion <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2033; (herein body <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2033;) and a cap portion <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2032; (herein cap <b>120</b><i>p</i>), where the cap fits onto the body, e.g., by sliding over or under the body (with other arrangements also contemplated). One portion, such as the cap <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2032;, can include a first coating <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;configured to degrade above a first pH (e.g., pH 5.5) and the second portion such as the body <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2033; can include a second coating <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2033; configured to degrade above a second higher pH (e.g.6.5). Both the interior <b>124</b> and exterior <b>125</b> surfaces of capsule <b>120</b> are coated with coatings <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; and <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2033; so that either portion of the capsule will be substantially preserved until it contacts fluid having the selected pH. For the case of body <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2033; this allows the structural integrity of the body <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2033; to be maintained so as to keep balloon <b>172</b> inside the body portion and not deployed until balloon <b>130</b> has expanded. Coatings <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; and <b>120</b><i>c</i>&#x2033; can include various methacrylate and ethyl acrylate based coatings such as those manufactured by Evonik Industries under the trade name EUDRAGIT. These and other dual coating configurations of the capsule <b>120</b> allows for mechanisms in one portion of capsule <b>120</b> to be actuated before those in the other portion of the capsule. This is due to the fact that intestinal fluids will first enter those portions where the lower pH coating has degraded thus actuating triggers which are responsive to such fluids (e.g., degradable valves). In use, such dual coating embodiments for capsule <b>120</b> provide for targeted drug delivery to a particular location in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract), as well as improved reliability in the delivery process. This is due to the fact that deployment of a particular component, such as aligner <b>160</b>, can be configured to begin in the upper area of the small intestine (e.g., the duodenum) allowing the capsule to be aligned within the intestine for optimal delivery of the drug (e.g., into the intestinal wall) as well as providing sufficient time for deployment/actuation of other components to achieve drug delivery into the intestinal wall while the capsule is still in the small intestine or other selected location.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0170">As is discussed above, one or more portions of capsule <b>120</b> can be fabricated from various biocompatible polymers known in the art, including various biodegradable polymers which in a preferred embodiment can comprise cellulose, gelatin materials and PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic acid). Other suitable biodegradable materials include various enteric materials described herein as well as lactide, glycolide, lactic acid, glycolic acid, para-dioxanone, caprolactone, trimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copolymers thereof.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0171">In various embodiments, the wall <b>120</b><i>w </i>of the capsule is configured to be degradable by contact with liquids in the GI tract, for example liquids, in the small intestine. In preferred embodiments, the capsule wall is configured to remain intact during passage through the stomach, but then to be degraded in the small intestine. In one or more embodiments, this can be achieved by the use of an outer coating or layer <b>120</b><i>c </i>on the capsule wall <b>120</b><i>w, </i>which only degrades in the higher pH's found in the small intestine and serves to protect the underlying capsule wall from degradation within the stomach before the capsule reaches the small intestine (at which point the drug delivery process is initiated by degradation of the coating as is described herein). In use, such coatings allow for the tartzeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a selected portion of the intestinal tract such as the small intestine including for example, into the wall of the small intestine.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0172">Similar to capsule <b>20</b>, in various embodiments, capsule <b>120</b> can include various radio-opaque, echogenic or other materials for location of the device using one or more medical imaging modalities known in the art such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound, MRI, etc. Such materials can be arranged in distinct bands or other shapes on the capsule so as to readily provide visual indicators of the capsule in the intestinal tract using the one or more medical imaging modalities. They may also be configured to allow the physician to discern if the capsule has or has not deployed. For example, according to one embodiment the markers can be placed around the center area of the capsule such when the balloon or other expandable member expands the marker is torn apart and is no longer discernable under imaging and/or has a different shape when imaged.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0173">As is discussed further herein, in many embodiments, one or more of the deployment member <b>130</b>, delivery member <b>172</b> or deployable aligner <b>160</b>, may correspond to an expandable balloon that is shaped and sized to fit within capsule <b>120</b>. Accordingly, for ease of discussion, deployment member <b>130</b>, delivery member <b>172</b> and deployable aligner <b>160</b> will now be referred to as balloon <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b>; however, it should be appreciated that other devices including various expandable devices are also contemplated for these elements and may include for example, various shape memory devices (e.g., an expandable basket made from shape memory biodegradable polymer spires), expandable piezo electric devices, and/or chemically expandable devices having an expanded shape and size corresponding to the interior volume <b>124</b><i>v </i>of the capsule <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0174">One or more of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> can comprise various polymers known in the medical device arts. In preferred embodiments such polymers can comprise one or more types of polyethylene (PE) which may correspond to low density PE(LDPE), linear low density PE (LLDPE), medium density PE (HDPE) and high density PE (HDPE) and other forms of polyethylene known in the art. In one more embodiments using polyethylene, the material may be cross-linked using polymer irradiation methods known in the art so. In particular embodiments radiation-based cross-linking may be used as to control the inflated diameter and shape of the balloon by decreasing the compliance of the balloon material. The amount of radiation may be selected to achieve a particular amount of cross linking to in turn produce a particular amount of compliance for a given balloon, e.g., increased irradiation can be used to produce stiffer less compliant balloon material. Other suitable polymers can include PET (polyethylene teraphalate), silicone and polyurethane. In various embodiments balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> may also include various radio-opaque materials known in the art such as barium sulfate to allow the physician to ascertain the position and physical state of the balloon (e.g., un-inflated, inflated or punctures. Balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> can be fabricated using various balloon blowing methods known in the balloon catheters arts (e.g., mold blowing, free blowing, etc.) to have a shape and size which corresponds approximately to the interior volume <b>124</b><i>v </i>of capsule <b>120</b>. In various embodiments one or more of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> and various connecting features (e.g., connecting tubes) can have a unitary construction being formed from a single mold. Embodiments employing such unitary construction provide the benefit of improved manufacturability and reliability since fewer joints must be made between one or more components of device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0175">Suitable shapes for balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> include various cylindrical shapes having tapered or curved end portions (an example of such a shape including a hot dog). In some embodiments, the inflated size (e.g., diameter) of one or more of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b>, can be larger than capsule <b>120</b> so as to cause the capsule to come apart from the force of inflation, (e.g., due to hoop stress). In other related embodiments, the inflated size of one or more of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> can be such that when inflated: i) the capsule <b>120</b> has sufficient contact with the walls of the small intestine so as to elicit a peristaltic contraction causing contraction of the small intestine around the capsule, and/or ii) the folds of the small intestine are effaced to allow. Both of these results allow for improved contact between the capsule/balloon surface and the intestinal wall so as deliver tissue penetrating members <b>40</b> over a selected area of the capsule and/or delivery balloon <b>172</b>. Desirably, the walls of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> will be thin and can have a wall thickness in the range of 0.005 to 0.0001&#x2033; more preferably, in the range of 0.005 to 0.0001, with specific embodiments of 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0005).

Balloon <b>160</b> can be fabricated using materials and methods described above. It has an unexpanded and expanded state (also referred to as a deployed state). In its expanded or deployed state, balloon <b>160</b> extends the length of capsule <b>120</b> such that forces exerted by the peristaltic contractions of the small intestine SI on capsule <b>120</b> serve to align the longitudinal axis <b>120</b>LA of the capsule <b>120</b> in a parallel fashion with the longitudinal axis LAI of the small intestine SI. This in turn serves to align the shafts of tissue penetrating members <b>140</b> in a perpendicular fashion with the surface of the intestinal wail IW to enhance and optimize the penetration of tissue penetrating, members <b>140</b> into the intestinal wall IW. In addition to serving to align capsule <b>120</b> in the small intestine, aligner <b>160</b> is also configured to push delivery mechanism <b>170</b> out of capsule <b>120</b> prior to inflation of delivery balloon <b>172</b> so that the delivery balloon and/or mechanism is not encumbered by the capsule. In use, this push out function of aligner <b>160</b> improves the reliability for delivery of the therapeutic agent since it is not necessary to wait for particular portions of the capsule (e.g., those overlying the delivery mechanism) to be degraded before drug delivery can occur.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0177">Balloon <b>160</b> may be fluidically coupled to one or more components of device <b>110</b> including balloons <b>130</b> and <b>172</b> by means of polymer tube or other fluidic couplings <b>162</b> which may include a tube <b>163</b> for coupling balloons <b>160</b> and <b>130</b> and a tube <b>164</b> for coupling balloon <b>160</b> and balloon <b>172</b>.

Tube <b>164</b> connects balloon <b>160</b> to <b>172</b> so as to allow for the inflation of balloon <b>172</b> by balloon <b>160</b>. In many embodiments, tube <b>164</b> includes or is coupled to a control valve <b>155</b> which is configured to open at a selected pressure so as to control the inflation of balloon <b>172</b> by balloon <b>160</b>. Tube <b>164</b> may thus comprise a proximal portion <b>164</b><i>p </i>connecting to the valve and a distal portion <b>164</b><i>d </i>leading from the valve. Typically, proximal and distal portions <b>164</b><i>p </i>and <b>164</b><i>d </i>will be connected to a valve housing <b>158</b> as is described below.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0178">Valve <b>155</b> may comprise a triangular or other shaped section <b>156</b> of a material <b>157</b> which is placed within a chamber <b>158</b><i>c </i>of a valve housing <b>158</b> (alternately, it may be placed directly within tubing <b>164</b>). Section <b>157</b> is configured to mechanically degrade (e.g., tears, shears, delaminates, etc.) at a selected pressure so as to allow the passage of gas through tube <b>164</b> and/or valve chamber <b>158</b><i>c. </i>Suitable materials <b>157</b> for valve <b>155</b> can include bees wax or other form of wax and various adhesives known in the medical arts which have a selectable sealing force/burst pressure. Valve fitting <b>158</b> will typically comprise a thin cylindrical compartment (made from biodegradable materials) in which section <b>156</b> of material <b>157</b> is placed (as is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b</i></figref>) so as to seal the walls of chamber <b>158</b><i>c </i>together or otherwise obstruct passage of fluid through the chamber. The release pressure of valve <b>155</b> can be controlled through selection of one or more of the size and shape of section <b>156</b> as well as the selection of material <b>157</b> (e.g., for properties such as adhesive strength, shear strength etc.). In use, control valve <b>155</b> allows for a sequenced inflation of balloon <b>160</b> and <b>172</b> such that balloon <b>160</b> is fully or otherwise substantially inflated before balloon <b>172</b> is inflated. This, in turn, allows balloon <b>160</b> to push balloon <b>172</b> along with the rest of delivery mechanism <b>170</b> out of capsule <b>120</b> (typically from body portion <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2032;) before balloon <b>172</b> inflates so that deployment of tissue penetrating members <b>140</b> is not obstructed by capsule <b>120</b>. In use, such an approach improves the reliability of the penetration of tissue penetrating members <b>140</b> into intestinal wall IW both in terms of achieving a desired penetration depth and delivering greater numbers of the penetrating members <b>140</b> contained in capsule <b>120</b> since the advancement of the members into intestinal wall <b>1</b>W is not obstructed by capsule wall <b>120</b><i>w. </i></p><p id="p-0184" num="0179">As is describe above, the inflated length <b>1601</b> of the aligner balloon <b>160</b> is sufficient to have the capsule <b>120</b> become aligned with the lateral axis of the small intestine from peristaltic contractions of the intestine.

Suitable shapes for aligner balloon <b>160</b> can include various elongated shapes such as a hotdog like shape. In specific embodiments, balloon <b>160</b> can include a first section <b>160</b>&#x2032; and a second section <b>160</b>&#x2033;, where expansion of first section <b>160</b>&#x2032; is configured to advance delivery mechanism <b>170</b> out of capsule <b>120</b> (typically out of and second section <b>160</b>&#x2033; is used to inflate delivery balloon <b>172</b>. in these and related embodiments, first and second sections <b>160</b>&#x2032; and <b>160</b>&#x2033; can be configured to have a telescope-style inflation where first section <b>160</b>&#x2032; inflates first to push mechanism <b>170</b> out of the capsule (typically from body portion <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2032;) and second section <b>160</b>&#x2033; inflates to inflate delivery member <b>172</b>. This can be achieve by configuring first section <b>160</b>&#x2032; to have smaller diameter and volume than second section <b>160</b>&#x2033; such that first section <b>160</b>&#x2032; inflates first (because of its smaller volume) and with second section <b>160</b>&#x2033; not inflating until first section <b>60</b>&#x2032; has substantially inflated. In one embodiment, this can be facilitated by use of a control valve <b>155</b> (described above) connecting sections <b>160</b>&#x2032; and <b>160</b>&#x2033; which does not allow passage of gas into section <b>160</b>&#x2033; until a minimum pressure has been reached in section <b>160</b>&#x2032;. In some embodiments, the aligner balloon can contain the chemical reactants which react upon mixture with water or other liquid from the deploying balloon.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0180">In many embodiments, the deployment member <b>130</b> will comprise an expandable balloon, known as the deployment balloon <b>130</b>. In various embodiments, deployment balloon <b>130</b> is configured to facilitate deployment/expansion of aligner balloon <b>160</b> by use of a gas, for example, generation of a gas <b>169</b> from a chemical. The gas may be generated by the reaction of solid chemical reactants <b>165</b>, such as an acid <b>166</b> (e.g., citric acid) and a base <b>166</b> (e.g., potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like) which are then mixed with water or other aqueous liquid <b>168</b>. The amount of reactants can be chosen using stoichiometric methods to produce a selected pressure in one or more of balloons <b>130</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>72</b>. The reactants <b>165</b> and liquids can be stored separately in balloon <b>130</b> and <b>160</b> and then brought together in response to a trigger event, such as the pH conditions in the small intestine. The reactants <b>165</b> and liquids <b>168</b> can be stored in either balloon, however in preferred embodiments, liquid <b>168</b> is stored in balloon <b>130</b> and reactants <b>165</b> in balloon <b>160</b>. To allow for passage of the liquid <b>168</b> to start the reaction and/or the resulting gas <b>169</b>, balloon <b>130</b> may be coupled to aligner balloon <b>160</b> by means of a connector tube <b>163</b> which also typically includes a separation means <b>150</b> such as a degradable valve <b>150</b> described below.

Also when balloon <b>130</b> contains the liquid, one or both of balloon <b>130</b> and tube <b>163</b> are configured to allow for the passage of liquid to balloon <b>160</b> by one or more of the following: i) the compressive forced applied to balloon <b>130</b> by peristaltic contractions of the small intestine on the exposed balloon <b>130</b>; and ii) wicking of liquid through tube <b>163</b> by capillary action.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0181">Tube <b>163</b> will typically include a degradable separation valve or other separation means <b>150</b> which separates the contents of balloon <b>130</b>, (e.g., water <b>158</b>) from those of balloon <b>160</b> (e.g., reactants <b>165</b>) until the valve degrades. Valve <b>150</b> can be fabricated from a material such as maltose, which is degradable by liquid water so that the valve opens upon exposure to water along with the various liquids in the digestive tract. It may also be made from materials that are degradable responsive to the higher pH found in the intestinal fluids such as methacrylate based coatings. The valve is desirably positioned at location on tube <b>163</b> which protrudes above balloon <b>130</b> and/or is otherwise sufficient exposed such that when cap <b>120</b><i>p</i>&#x2032; degrades the valve <b>150</b> is exposed to the intestinal liquids which enter the capsule.

Once placed in the intestinal wall or surrounding tissue (e.g., the peritoneal wall or peritoneal cavity, the penetrating member <b>140</b> is degraded by the interstitial fluids within the wall tissue and/or serosal fluids within the pectineal cavity so that the drug or other therapeutic agent <b>101</b> dissolves in those fluids and is absorbed into the blood stream. For embodiments, where the tissue penetrating member is positioned in the peritoneal cavity, the tissue penetrating member is configured to be degraded by fluids within the cavity including the serosal fluids within the cavity where the clotting factor or other therapeutic agents is then transported across the visceral and parietal peritoneal walls and into the blood stream. One or more of the size, shape and chemical composition of tissue penetrating member <b>140</b> can be selected to allow for dissolution and absorption of drug <b>101</b> in a matter of seconds, minutes or even hours. Rates of dissolution can be controlled through a variety of means including through the use of various disintegrants known in the pharmaceutical arts. Examples of disintegrants include, but are not limited to, various starches such as sodium starch glycolate and various cross linked polymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose. The choice of di sintegrants can be specifically adjusted for the fluids and environment within the wall of the small intestine and/or peritoneum or the peritoneal cavity.

It is desirable to minimize steady state fluctuation for multiple reasons. Firstly, drug concentrations that are higher than necessary for pharmacologic activity are more likely to result in adverse events. For the cause of Factor VIII or other clotting factor, such adverse event include the development of anti-drug antibody production which inhibit or otherwise lessen biochemical effect of the clotting fact. A patient who develops anti-drug antibodies to a drug will no longer respond to that drug and must be placed on a different regimen. On the other hand, drug concentrations that are lower than necessary for pharmacologic activity are also not desired. There is a greater chance of no pharmacologic activity during these periods, and thus lower drug efficacy. It is ideal to maintain a constant, steady level of pharmacologic activity in order to effectively treat the targeted disorder.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>% Steady State Fluctuation for Alirocumab</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Alirocumab</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Current SC dosing</entry><entry>66.33%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Rani dosing</entry><entry>0.39%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0225" num="0218">Calculations were made for % Steady State Fluctuation for the antibodies shown in Table 2.
