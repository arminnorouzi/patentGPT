Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Apparatuses and methods consistent with exemplary embodiments relate to a blade for a turbo machine including a gas turbine and a steam turbine, a blade assembly, and a turbine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a turbo machine such as a steam turbine or a gas turbine, a plurality of blades are coupled to a rotor disk. The blades are exposed to and cooperate with a working fluid (e.g., air or steam). The working fluid flows between the blades, exerting work on the blades in a turbine section of the turbo machine or receiving work from the blades in a compressor section of the turbo machine. Therefore, the blades have to withstand high mechanical loads.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To limit vibrational stresses, the blades are provided with snubber structures. The snubber structures include snubber elements protruding from a suction side and a pressure side of each blade at the same radial position. Thereby, when the blades are rotated with the disk, adjacent ends of the snubber elements come into contact and form a cooperative structure between the blades to reduce vibrational stress.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 8,540,488 B2 discloses a rotor for a turbo machine comprising a plurality of blades and a damping structure extending between adjacent blades. The damping structure includes a snubber element protruding from a suction side of a first blade towards a second blade, wherein an end of the snubber element is positioned adjacent to a cooperating surface provided on a small protrusion on a pressure side of the second blade.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 8,523,525 B2 discloses a turbine blade comprising a snubber assembly that includes first and second snubber elements protruding from opposite suction and pressure side surfaces of the blade, wherein each snubber element abuts a filet integrally formed with respective suction and pressure side surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although snubber structures help to reduce vibrational stress in the blades, aerodynamic losses may occur because the snubber structures protrude from the aerodynamic surfaces of the blades that define the pressure side and the suction side.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of one or more exemplary embodiments provide improved solutions for snubber structures of a blade for a turbo machine, in particular, snubber structures which cause less aerodynamic losses.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will become apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a blade for a turbo machine including: an airfoil body extending in a radial direction and including a suction side surface and a pressure side surface opposite to the suction side surface with respect to a circumferential direction extending across the radial direction; and a snubber structure including a first snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the suction side surface of the airfoil body and a second snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the pressure side surface of the airfoil body. The first snubber element may be connected to the suction side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved first transition portion having a first radius, and the second snubber element may be connected to the pressure side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved second transition portion having a second radius, the first radius being smaller than the second radius.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first snubber element may protrude from the suction side surface by a first length, and the second snubber element may protrude from the pressure side surface by a second length, and the first length may be smaller than the second length.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first snubber element may include a first contact surface that faces away from the suction side surface and extends along an axial direction, the axial direction running transverse to the radial direction and the circumferential direction. The second snubber element may include a second contact surface that faces away from the pressure side surface and extends along the axial direction. The first length and the second length may be measured along a connection line that connects a center position of the first contact surface with respect to the axial direction and a center position of the second contact surface with respect to the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the first and second contact surfaces may extend at least partially inclined with respect to the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A ratio of the first length to the second length may be in a range between 0.7 and 0.9.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A ratio of the first radius to the second radius may be in a range between 0.2 and 0.8.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The snubber structure and the airfoil body may be integrally formed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a blade assembly including: a plurality of blades; and a rotor disk to which the plurality of blades are coupled, wherein each of the plurality of blades may include: an airfoil body extending in a radial direction and including a suction side surface and a pressure side surface opposite to the suction side surface with respect to a circumferential direction extending across the radial direction; and a snubber structure including a first snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the suction side surface of the airfoil body and a second snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the pressure side surface of the airfoil body, wherein the first snubber element is connected to the suction side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved first transition portion having a first radius, and the second snubber element is connected to the pressure side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved second transition portion having a second radius, the first radius being smaller than the second radius, wherein the first snubber element includes a first contact surface facing away from the suction side surface, and the second snubber element includes a second contact surface facing away from the pressure side surface, and wherein the first contact surface faces the second contact surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a turbine including: a blade assembly including a plurality of blades and a rotor disk to which the plurality of blades are coupled, wherein each of the plurality of blades may include: an airfoil body extending in a radial direction and including a suction side surface and a pressure side surface opposite to the suction side surface with respect to a circumferential direction extending across the radial direction; and a snubber structure including a first snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the suction side surface of the airfoil body and a second snubber element protruding in the circumferential direction from the pressure side surface of the airfoil body, wherein the first snubber element is connected to the suction side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved first transition portion having a first radius, and the second snubber element is connected to the pressure side surface of the airfoil body by a concave curved second transition portion having a second radius, the first radius being smaller than the second radius, wherein the first snubber element includes a first contact surface facing away from the suction side surface, and the second snubber element includes a second contact surface facing away from the pressure side surface, and wherein the first contact surface faces the second contact surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, the pressure side surface and the suction side surface define a cross-section of the airfoil body and define an aerodynamic profile configured to generate a lift force directed from the pressure side surface towards the suction side surface, when a fluid flows along the pressure side and suction side surfaces from a leading edge towards a trailing edge of the airfoil body.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The snubber elements may be realized as fins protruding from the respective suction side and pressure side surfaces along a circumferential direction extending across the radial and the axial direction. Further, the snubber elements may have a certain width along the axial direction, wherein the width along the axial direction is less than a width of the airfoil body between the front and the aft end. The snubber elements extend along the circumferential direction and, thus, extend substantially perpendicular to the radial direction. To avoid a sharp edge or corner between the pressure and suction side surfaces and the snubber element, a smooth, concave curved transition portion is provided that connects each pressure or suction side surface and the corresponding snubber element and defines a predefined radius.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one or more exemplary embodiments, the snubber elements on the suction side surface and the pressure side surface of the airfoil body of the blade are implemented with different dimensions. For example, a transition from the suction side surface to the first snubber element is realized with a smaller radius or a sharper edge than a transition from the pressure side surface to the second snubber element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one or more exemplary embodiments, aerodynamic losses are reduced because the first radius of the first transition portion that connects the suction side surface and the first snubber element is smaller than the second radius of the second transition portion that connects the pressure side surface and the second snubber element. If a plurality of blades are arranged adjacent along the circumferential direction, first and second snubber elements of adjacent blades are arranged adjacent to each other. Due to the decreased radius of the first transition portion, a loss mechanism to which separated flow travels along the snubber elements from the pressure side of one blade to the suction side of an adjacent blade and generates vortices with shear layers at the first transition portion or region between the suction side surface and each first snubber element is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one or more exemplary embodiments, the first snubber element protrudes from the suction side surface by a first length, and the second snubber element protrudes from the pressure side surface by a second length, the first length being smaller than the second length. Thus, the first and the second snubber elements are asymmetric with regard to the circumferential direction. This further helps to reduce the impact of the loss mechanism described above. Further, the mechanical stress levels can be more uniformly distributed by reducing the length of the first or suction side snubber element in addition to making the first radius smaller than the second radius.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one or more exemplary embodiments, each of the first and second contact surfaces extends at least partially inclined with respect to the axial direction. This definitely facilitates the assembly of the blades. For example, each of the contact surfaces may have a section extending inclined with respect to the axial direction. Optionally, the contact surface may further have at least one portion extending along or parallel to the axial direction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above and other aspects will become more apparent from the following description of the exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a gas turbine according to an exemplary embodiment;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a blade assembly according to an exemplary embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of a blade for a turbo machine according to an exemplary embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a result of a flow simulation in a top view to a blade assembly of a comparative example; and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a result of a flow simulation in a top view to a blade assembly according to an exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various changes and various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings so that those skilled in the art can easily carry out the disclosure.
