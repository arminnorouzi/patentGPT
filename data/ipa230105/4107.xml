However, the other end of the heater is free without being abutted on the heater holder so as not to restrain the expansion and contraction of the heater in the longitudinal direction due to a temperature change. Accordingly, the heater may rattle in the longitudinal direction in the recess and hamper the heater from being positioned relative to the heater holder with high accuracy.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In light of the above-described situation, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a heating device that includes a heater, a holder, a device frame, a primary positioner, a secondary positioner, and a tertiary positioner. The heater includes a heat generator. The holder holds the heater. The device frame is configured to support the holder. The primary positioner is configured to position the heater and the holder in a longitudinal direction of the heater. The secondary positioner is configured to position the holder and the device frame in the longitudinal direction of the heater. The tertiary positioner is configured to position the device frame and a body of an image forming apparatus in the longitudinal direction of the heater.

With such a configuration, even if the heater, a holder, and a device frame thermally expand, the heater, the holder, and the device frame expand and shrink from the identical side, on which positioning is performed, as a reference. Thus, relative positional shift on the identical side used as the reference can be reduced. Accordingly, the relative positional accuracy of the heating member, the holding member, and the device frame can be improved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

In the drawings for explaining the embodiments of the present disclosure, identical reference numerals are assigned to elements such as members and parts that have an identical function or an identical shape as long as differentiation is possible and a description of those elements is omitted once the description is provided.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is a printer. Alternatively, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> may be a copier, a facsimile machine, a multifunction peripheral (MFP) having at least two of printing, copying, facsimile, scanning, and plotter functions, or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> includes four image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk serving as image forming devices, respectively. The image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk are removably installed in a body <b>103</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. The image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk have a similar construction except that the image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk contain developers in different colors, that is, yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively, which correspond to color separation components for a color image. For example, each of the image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk includes a photoconductor <b>2</b>, a charger <b>3</b>, a developing device <b>4</b>, and a cleaner <b>5</b>. The photoconductor <b>2</b> is drum-shaped and serves as an image bearer. The charger <b>3</b> charges a surface of the photoconductor <b>2</b>. The developing device <b>4</b> supplies toner as a developer to the surface of the photoconductor <b>2</b> to form a toner image. The cleaner <b>5</b> cleans the surface of the photoconductor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> further includes an exposure device <b>6</b>, a sheet feeding device <b>7</b>, a transfer device <b>8</b>, a fixing device <b>9</b>, and a sheet ejection device <b>10</b>. The exposure device <b>6</b> exposes the surface of each of the photoconductors <b>2</b> and forms an electrostatic latent image thereon. The sheet feeding device <b>7</b> supplies a sheet P serving as a recording medium to the transfer device <b>8</b>. The transfer device <b>8</b> transfers the toner image formed on each of the photoconductors <b>2</b> onto the sheet P. The fixing device <b>9</b> fixes the toner image transferred onto the sheet P thereon. The sheet ejection device <b>10</b> ejects the sheet P onto an outside of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The transfer device <b>8</b> includes an intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>, four primary transfer rollers <b>12</b>, and a secondary transfer roller <b>13</b>. The intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> is an endless belt serving as an intermediate transferor stretched taut across a plurality of rollers. The four primary transfer rollers <b>12</b> serve as primary transferors that transfer yellow, magenta, cyan, and black toner images formed on the photoconductors <b>2</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>, respectively, thus forming a full color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>13</b> serves as a secondary transferor that transfers the full color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> onto the sheet P. The plurality of primary transfer rollers <b>12</b> is pressed against the photoconductors <b>2</b>, respectively, via the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>. Thus, the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> contacts each of the photoconductors <b>2</b>, forming a primary transfer nip therebetween. On the other hand, the secondary transfer roller <b>13</b> is pressed against one of the rollers across which the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> is stretched taut via the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>. Thus, a secondary transfer nip is formed between the secondary transfer roller <b>13</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> accommodates a sheet conveyance path <b>14</b> through which the sheet P fed from the sheet feeding device <b>7</b> is conveyed. A timing roller pair <b>15</b> is disposed in the sheet conveyance path <b>14</b> at a position between the sheet feeding device <b>7</b> and the secondary transfer nip defined by the secondary transfer roller <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a description is provided of printing processes performed by the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> having the construction described above.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> receives an instruction to start printing, a driver drives and rotates the photoconductor <b>2</b> clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in each of the image forming units <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>Bk. The charger <b>3</b> charges the surface of the photoconductor <b>2</b> uniformly at a high electric potential. Subsequently, the exposure device <b>6</b> exposes the surface of each of the photoconductors <b>2</b> based on image data created by an original scanner that reads an image on an original or print data instructed by a terminal, thus decreasing the electric potential of an exposed portion on the photoconductor <b>2</b> and forming an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor <b>2</b>. The developing device <b>4</b> supplies toner to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photoconductor <b>2</b>, forming a toner image thereon.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the toner images formed on the photoconductors <b>2</b> reach the primary transfer nips defined by the primary transfer rollers <b>12</b> in accordance with rotation of the photoconductors <b>2</b>, the toner images formed on the photoconductors <b>2</b> are transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> driven and rotated counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> successively such that the toner images are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>, forming a full color toner image thereon. Thereafter, the full color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> is conveyed to the secondary transfer nip defined by the secondary transfer roller <b>13</b> in accordance with rotation of the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> and is transferred onto a sheet P conveyed to the secondary transfer nip. The sheet P is supplied from the sheet feeding device <b>7</b>. The timing roller pair <b>15</b> temporarily halts the sheet P supplied from the sheet feeding device <b>7</b>. Thereafter, the timing roller pair <b>15</b> conveys the sheet P to the secondary transfer nip at a time when the full color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b> reaches the secondary transfer nip. Accordingly, the full color toner image is transferred onto and borne on the sheet P. After the toner image is transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>11</b>, the cleaner <b>5</b> removes residual toner remained on the photoconductor <b>2</b> therefrom.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sheet P transferred with the full color toner image is conveyed to the fixing device <b>9</b> that fixes the full color toner image on the sheet P. Thereafter, the sheet ejection device <b>10</b> ejects the sheet P onto the outside of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, thus finishing a series of printing processes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A description is provided of a construction of the fixing device <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fixing device <b>9</b> according to this embodiment includes a fixing belt <b>20</b>, a pressure roller <b>21</b>, and a heating device <b>19</b>. The fixing belt <b>20</b> is an endless belt serving as a fixing rotator or a fixing member. The pressure roller <b>21</b> serves as an opposed rotator or an opposed member that contacts an outer circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b> to form a fixing nip N between the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b>. The heating device <b>19</b> heats the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The heating device <b>19</b> includes a heater <b>22</b>, a heater holder <b>23</b>, and a stay <b>24</b>. The heater <b>22</b> is a planar or laminated heater and serves as a heater or a heating member. The heater holder <b>23</b> serves as a holder that holds or supports the heater <b>22</b>. The stay <b>24</b> serves as a reinforcement that reinforces the heater holder <b>23</b> throughout an entire width of the heater holder <b>23</b> in a longitudinal direction thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The fixing belt <b>20</b> includes a tubular base that is made of polyimide (PI) and has an outer diameter of 25 mm and a thickness in a range of from <b>40</b> micrometers to 120 micrometers, for example. The fixing belt <b>20</b> further includes a release layer serving as an outermost surface layer. The release layer is made of fluororesin, such as tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer (PFA) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and has a thickness in a range of from 5 micrometers to 50 micrometers to enhance durability of the fixing belt <b>20</b> and facilitate separation of the sheet P and a foreign substance from the fixing belt <b>20</b>. Optionally, an elastic layer that is made of rubber or the like and has a thickness in a range of from 50 micrometers to 500 micrometers may be interposed between the base and the release layer. The base of the fixing belt <b>20</b> may be made of heat resistant resin such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or metal such as nickel (Ni) and SUS stainless steel, instead of polyimide. An inner circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b> may be coated with polyimide, PTFE, or the like to produce a slide layer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A detailed description is now given of a construction of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. The pressure roller <b>21</b> has an outer diameter of 25 mm, for example. The pressure roller <b>21</b> includes a cored bar <b>21</b><i>a, </i>an elastic layer <b>21</b><i>b, </i>and a release layer <b>21</b><i>c. </i>The cored bar <b>21</b><i>a </i>is solid and made of metal such as iron. The elastic layer <b>21</b><i>b </i>coats the cored bar <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The release layer <b>21</b><i>c </i>coats an outer surface of the elastic layer <b>21</b><i>b. </i>The elastic layer <b>21</b><i>b </i>is made of silicone rubber and has a thickness of 3.5 mm, for example. In order to facilitate separation of the sheet P and the foreign substance from the pressure roller <b>21</b>, the release layer <b>21</b><i>c </i>that is made of fluororesin and has a thickness of about 40 micrometers, for example, is preferably disposed on the outer surface of the elastic layer <b>21</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A detailed description is now given of a construction of the heater <b>22</b>. The heater <b>22</b> extends in a longitudinal direction thereof throughout an entire width of the fixing belt <b>20</b> in a width direction, that is, an axial direction, of the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The heater <b>22</b> contacts the inner circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The heater <b>22</b> may not contact the fixing belt <b>20</b> or may be disposed opposite the fixing belt <b>20</b> indirectly via a low friction sheet or the like. However, the heater <b>22</b> that contacts the fixing belt <b>20</b> directly enhances conduction of heat from the heater <b>22</b> to the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The heater <b>22</b> may contact the outer circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b>. However, if the outer circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b> is brought into contact with the heater <b>22</b> and damaged, the fixing belt <b>20</b> may degrade quality of fixing the toner image on the sheet P. Hence, the heater <b>22</b> contacts the inner circumferential surface of the fixing belt <b>20</b> advantageously. The heater <b>22</b> includes a base layer <b>50</b>, a first insulating layer <b>51</b>, a conductor layer <b>52</b>, a second insulating layer <b>53</b>, and a third insulating layer <b>54</b>. The first insulating layer <b>51</b>, the conductor layer <b>52</b>, and the second insulating layer <b>53</b> are layered on the base layer <b>50</b> in this order and sandwiched between the base layer <b>50</b> and the fixing nip N. The conductor layer <b>52</b> includes a heat generator <b>60</b>. The third insulating layer <b>54</b> is layered on the base layer <b>50</b> and is disposed opposite the fixing nip N via the base layer <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A detailed description is now given of a construction of the heater holder <b>23</b> and the stay <b>24</b>. The heater holder <b>23</b> and the stay <b>24</b> are disposed inside a loop formed by the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The stay <b>24</b> includes a channel made of metal. Both lateral ends of the stay <b>24</b> in a longitudinal direction thereof are supported by side walls of the fixing device <b>9</b>, respectively. The stay <b>24</b> supports a stay side face of the heater holder <b>23</b>, that faces the stay <b>24</b> and is opposite a heater side face of the heater holder <b>23</b>, that faces the heater <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the stay <b>24</b> retains the heater <b>22</b> and the heater holder <b>23</b> to be immune from being bent substantially by pressure from the pressure roller <b>21</b>, forming the fixing nip N between the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the heater holder <b>23</b> is subject to temperature increase by heat from the heater <b>22</b>, the heater holder <b>23</b> is preferably made of a heat resistant material. For example, if the heater holder <b>23</b> is made of heat resistant resin having a decreased thermal conductivity, such as liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and PEEK, the heater holder <b>23</b> suppresses conduction of heat thereto from the heater <b>22</b>, facilitating heating of the fixing belt <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A spring serving as a biasing member causes the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b> to press against each other. Thus, the fixing nip N is formed between the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b>. As a driving force is transmitted to the pressure roller <b>21</b> from a driver disposed in the body <b>103</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, the pressure roller <b>21</b> serves as a driving roller that drives and rotates the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The fixing belt <b>20</b> is driven and rotated by the pressure roller <b>21</b> as the pressure roller <b>21</b> rotates. While the fixing belt <b>20</b> rotates, the fixing belt <b>20</b> slides over the heater <b>22</b>. In order to facilitate sliding of the fixing belt <b>20</b>, a lubricant such as oil and grease may be interposed between the heater <b>22</b> and the fixing belt <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When printing starts, the driver drives and rotates the pressure roller <b>21</b> and the fixing belt <b>20</b> starts rotation in accordance with rotation of the pressure roller <b>21</b>. Additionally, as power is supplied to the heater <b>22</b>, the heater <b>22</b> heats the fixing belt <b>20</b>. In a state in which the temperature of the fixing belt <b>20</b> reaches a predetermined target temperature (e.g., a fixing temperature), as the sheet P bearing the unfixed toner image is conveyed through the fixing nip N formed between the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>21</b> fix the unfixed toner image on the sheet P under heat and pressure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the fixing device <b>9</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the fixing device <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the fixing device <b>9</b> includes a device frame <b>40</b> that includes a first device frame <b>25</b> and a second device frame <b>26</b>. The first device frame <b>25</b> includes a pair of side walls <b>28</b> and a front wall <b>27</b>. The second device frame <b>26</b> includes a rear wall <b>29</b>. The side walls <b>28</b> are disposed at one lateral end and another lateral end of the fixing belt <b>20</b>, respectively, in the width direction of the fixing belt <b>20</b>. The side walls <b>28</b> support both lateral ends of each of the pressure roller <b>21</b> and the heating device <b>19</b>, respectively. Each of the side walls <b>28</b> includes a plurality of engaging projections <b>28</b><i>a. </i>As the engaging projections <b>28</b><i>a </i>engage engaging holes <b>29</b><i>a </i>penetrating through the rear wall <b>29</b>, respectively, the first device frame <b>25</b> is coupled to the second device frame <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each of the side walls <b>28</b> includes an insertion recess <b>28</b><i>b </i>through which a rotation shaft and the like of the pressure roller <b>21</b> are inserted. The insertion recess <b>28</b><i>b </i>is open at an opening that faces the rear wall <b>29</b> and closed at a bottom that is opposite the opening and serves as a contact portion. A bearing <b>30</b> that supports the rotation shaft of the pressure roller <b>21</b> is disposed at an end of the insertion recess <b>28</b><i>b, </i>that serves as the contact portion. As both lateral ends of the rotation shaft of the pressure roller <b>21</b> are attached to the bearings <b>30</b>, respectively, the side walls <b>28</b> rotatably support the pressure roller <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A driving force transmission gear <b>31</b> serving as a driving force transmitter is disposed at one lateral end of the rotation shaft of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in an axial direction thereof. In a state in which the side walls <b>28</b> support the pressure roller <b>21</b>, the driving force transmission gear <b>31</b> is exposed outside the side wall <b>28</b>. Accordingly, when the fixing device <b>9</b> is installed in the body <b>103</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, the driving force transmission gear <b>31</b> is coupled to a gear disposed inside the body <b>103</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> so that the driving force transmission gear <b>31</b> transmits the driving force from the driver.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A pair of supports <b>32</b> that supports the fixing belt <b>20</b> and the like is disposed at both lateral ends of the heating device <b>19</b> in a longitudinal direction thereof, respectively.

According to this embodiment, the heat generators <b>60</b> are parallel to each other and extended in a longitudinal direction of the base layer <b>50</b>.

The PTC property defines a property in which the resistance value increases as the temperature increases, for example, a heater output decreases under a given voltage. The heat generators <b>60</b> having the PTC property start quickly with an increased output at low temperatures and suppress overheating with a decreased output at high temperatures. For example, if a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the PTC property is in a range of from about 300 ppm/&#xb0; C. to about 4,000 ppm/&#xb0; C., the heater <b>22</b> is manufactured at reduced costs while retaining a resistance value needed for the heater <b>22</b>. The TCR is preferably in a range of from about 500 ppm/&#xb0; C. to about 2,000 ppm/&#xb0; C. The TCR is calculated by measuring the resistance value at 25 degrees Celsius and 125 degrees Celsius. For example, if the temperature increases by 100 degrees Celsius and the resistance value increases by 10%, the TCR is 1,000 ppm/&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to the embodiments, a length of the heat generator <b>60</b> (e.g., a width in the longitudinal direction of the heat generator <b>60</b>) is greater than a width of the sheet P.

Conversely, if the length of the heat generator <b>60</b> is excessively great, the fixing belt <b>20</b> may suffer from overheating in a non-conveyance span where the sheets P are not conveyed when the plurality of sheets P is conveyed continuously. To address this circumstance, the length of the heat generator <b>60</b> is determined properly. For example, according to the embodiments, the length of the heat generator <b>60</b> is preferably greater than a width of 216 mm of a sheet P of a letter size by a range of from 0.5 mm to 7.0 mm at one lateral end of the heat generator <b>60</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof.

The letter size is a maximum sheet size (e.g., a maximum conveyance span of a recording medium) of sheets P that are conveyed through the fixing device <b>9</b>.

For example, the accommodating recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>is greater than the heater <b>22</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof to ensure a gap S depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> in the longitudinal direction of the heater holder <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">However, if the gap S is provided between the heater <b>22</b> and the accommodating recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction of the heater <b>22</b>, when the heater <b>22</b> does not expand thermally, the heater <b>22</b> may tremble inside the accommodating recess <b>23</b><i>a. </i>As a result, a contact position where the electrode <b>61</b> contacts the contact terminal <b>72</b> of the connector <b>70</b> may shift, causing abrasion and faulty contact.

If the base layer <b>50</b> is made of metal available at reduced costs compared to ceramic to facilitate processing and reduce manufacturing costs and the like, the heater <b>22</b> is subject to expansion and shrinkage in the longitudinal direction thereof in a greater amount as the temperature of the heater <b>22</b> changes. To address this circumstance, the gap S between the heater <b>22</b> and the accommodating recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction of the heater holder <b>23</b> is requested to be greater.

If the heat generator <b>60</b> has the PTC property, when the temperature of the heat generator <b>60</b> increases in the non-conveyance span, the resistance value of the heat generator <b>60</b> in the non-conveyance span increases. A heat generation amount of the heat generator <b>60</b> in the non-conveyance span is greater than a heat generation amount of the heat generator <b>60</b> in a conveyance span where the sheet P is conveyed, accelerating thermal expansion of the heater <b>22</b> in the non-conveyance span.

To address this circumstance, a gap is provided between the heater <b>22</b> and the accommodating recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>also in the short direction of the heater <b>22</b>.

To address this circumstance, in order to prevent the positioners disposed in the heater <b>22</b> and the heater holder <b>23</b>, respectively, from causing the heater <b>22</b> and the heater holder <b>23</b> to interfere with the driving force transmission gear <b>31</b>, the positioner disposed in the heater <b>22</b> is not limited to a depression (e.g., the positioning depression <b>22</b><i>a</i>), a projection (e.g., the positioning projection <b>22</b><i>b</i>), and a through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>22</b><i>a</i>W). Alternatively, a driving force transmitter disposed at one lateral end of the pressure roller <b>21</b> in the axial direction thereof may be pulleys over which a driving force transmission belt is stretched taut, a coupler, and the like instead of the driving force transmission gear <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">A description is provided of a construction installed in the heater <b>22</b>, that suppresses conduction of heat to the electrodes <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The above describes the construction in which the positioning depression <b>22</b><i>a </i>is disposed in the heater <b>22</b> to position the heater <b>22</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof. The positioning depression <b>22</b><i>a </i>is situated between a heat generating portion of the heater <b>22</b> where the heat generators <b>60</b> are situated and an electrode portion of the heater <b>22</b> where the electrodes <b>61</b> are situated in the longitudinal direction of the heater <b>22</b>, thus serving as a thermal conduction restrictor that restricts conduction of heat from the heat generators <b>60</b> to the electrodes <b>61</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a positioner portion of the heater <b>22</b> where the positioning depression <b>22</b><i>a </i>is situated defines a decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>that is smaller in cross-sectional area than the heat generating portion where the heat generators <b>60</b> are situated. The decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>suppresses conduction of heat from the heat generators <b>60</b> to the electrodes <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Accordingly, temperature increase of the connector <b>70</b> in contact with the electrodes <b>61</b> is suppressed, preventing decrease in pressure with which the connector <b>70</b> contacts the electrodes <b>61</b> due to temperature increase of the connector <b>70</b>. Thus, according to this embodiment, even when the heat generators <b>60</b> generate heat, the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>suppresses temperature increase of the electrodes <b>61</b> and the connector <b>70</b>, retaining proper pressure with which the connector <b>70</b> contacts the electrodes <b>61</b> and therefore enhancing reliability. For example, like the embodiments, if the length of the heat generators <b>60</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof is greater than a width of a maximum size sheet P available in the fixing device <b>9</b> or if the heat generators <b>60</b> have the PTC property and the electric current flows in the longitudinal direction of the heater <b>22</b> through at least a part of the heat generators <b>60</b>, the heat generators <b>60</b> generate an increased amount of heat in the non-conveyance span where the sheet P is not conveyed, increasing advantages of the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z. </i></p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to this embodiment, the positioning depression <b>22</b><i>a </i>also serves as a thermal conduction restrictor that restricts conduction of heat from the heat generators <b>60</b> to the electrodes <b>61</b>, thus defining the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z. </i>Hence, the thermal conduction restrictor is not provided separately from the positioner, downsizing the heater <b>22</b>. The decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>disposed in the heater <b>22</b> achieves suppressed conduction of heat from the heat generators <b>60</b> to the electrodes <b>61</b> without adding an extra element such as a heat radiator to the heater <b>22</b>, downsizing the heater <b>22</b> advantageously.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>may have an arbitrary shape as long as a cross-sectional area of the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>is smaller than a cross-sectional area of the heat generating portion of the heater <b>22</b> where the heat generators <b>60</b> are disposed.

Thus, a counterpart that engages the positioner (e.g., the recess <b>22</b><i>c</i>) of the heater <b>22</b>Z to position the heater <b>22</b>Z may be the side wall <b>28</b> or the stay <b>24</b> other than the heater holder <b>23</b> described above. In this case, heat is conducted quickly from the heater <b>22</b>Z to the side wall <b>28</b> and the stay <b>24</b> that contact the heater <b>22</b>Z directly, suppressing temperature increase of the heater <b>22</b>Z. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b> and <b>27</b></figref>, the side wall <b>28</b> and the stay <b>24</b> directly contact the heater <b>22</b>Z at a position between the heat generators <b>60</b> and the electrodes <b>61</b> in the longitudinal direction of the heater <b>22</b>Z, suppressing conduction of heat from the heat generators <b>60</b> to the electrodes <b>61</b> further. The side wall <b>28</b> and the stay <b>24</b> are made of a material that has a thermal conductivity greater than a thermal conductivity of the heater holder <b>23</b>, preferably, a material that has a thermal conductivity greater than a thermal conductivity of the base layer <b>50</b> of the heater <b>22</b>Z, suppressing temperature increase of the heater <b>22</b>Z effectively.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">However, if heat generated by the heater <b>22</b>Z is conducted quickly from one lateral end of the heater <b>22</b>Z in the longitudinal direction thereof to the side wall <b>28</b> and the stay <b>24</b>, a difference in an amount of heat radiation may increase between one lateral end and another lateral end of the heater <b>22</b>Z in the longitudinal direction thereof, causing the temperature of the heater <b>22</b>Z to be uneven between one lateral end and another lateral end of the heater <b>22</b>Z in the longitudinal direction thereof. To address this circumstance, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, an enhanced thermal conductor <b>74</b> having a thermal conductivity greater than a thermal conductivity of the base layer <b>50</b> is disposed at another lateral end of the heater <b>22</b>Z in the longitudinal direction thereof, that is opposite one lateral end of the heater <b>22</b>Z where the recess <b>22</b><i>c </i>disposed in the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>is situated.

In order to decrease uneven temperature effectively, a distance E<b>1</b> from the center M of the heat generators <b>60</b> to the recess <b>22</b><i>c </i>disposed in the decreased cross section portion <b>22</b><i>z </i>and a distance E<b>2</b> from the center M of the heat generators <b>60</b> to the enhanced thermal conductor <b>74</b> in the longitudinal direction of the heater <b>22</b>Z are different by 2 mm or smaller or, preferably, are equivalent such that the distance E<b>1</b> is symmetrical with the distance E<b>2</b>. The enhanced thermal conductor <b>74</b> may be a flat spring or the like and may also serve as a sandwiching member that sandwiches and holds the heater <b>22</b>Z and the heater holder <b>23</b> together.
