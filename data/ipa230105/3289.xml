The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of an axle assembly <b>10</b> is shown. The axle assembly <b>10</b> may be provided with a vehicle of any suitable type, such as a truck, bus, farm equipment, military transport or weaponry vehicle, or cargo loading equipment for land, air, or marine vessels.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The axle assembly <b>10</b> may be part of a vehicle drivetrain that may include multiple axle assemblies that may be connected in series. For instance, the axle assembly <b>10</b> may be part of a tandem axle drivetrain configuration that may include two axle assemblies connected in series. The axle assembly <b>10</b> that is operatively connected to at least one torque source, such as an electric motor or an internal combustion engine, or that is disposed closest to a torque source may be referred to as a first axle assembly. The axle assembly that receives propulsion torque from the torque source through or by way of the first axle assembly may be referred to as a second axle assembly. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the axle assembly <b>10</b> is depicted as being a first axle assembly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The axle assembly <b>10</b> may provide torque to its associated wheel assemblies and may provide torque to the second axle assembly. In at least one configuration and as is best shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the axle assembly <b>10</b> may include a housing <b>20</b>, an input yoke <b>22</b>, an input shaft <b>24</b>, an interaxle differential unit <b>26</b>, a clutch collar <b>28</b>, a driven gear <b>30</b>, a drive pinion <b>32</b>, a differential assembly <b>34</b>, at least one axle shaft <b>36</b>, an output shaft <b>40</b>, an output yoke <b>42</b>, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the housing <b>20</b> may receive various components of the axle assembly <b>10</b>. In addition, the housing <b>20</b> may facilitate mounting of the axle assembly <b>10</b> to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The input yoke <b>22</b>, if provided, may facilitate coupling of the axle assembly <b>10</b> to a torque source. The input yoke <b>22</b> may have any suitable configuration. For instance, the input yoke <b>22</b> may have a disc configuration as shown or may have a similar configuration as the output yoke <b>42</b>. It is contemplated that the input yoke <b>22</b> may be omitted, such as when a torque source like an electric motor is integrated with the axle assembly <b>10</b>. If provided, the input yoke <b>22</b> may be operatively connected to the input shaft <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, an example of an input shaft <b>24</b> is shown. The input shaft <b>24</b> may extend along and may be rotatable about an axis <b>50</b>. For example, the input shaft <b>24</b> may be rotatably supported by one or more bearings <b>52</b> that may be disposed on the housing <b>20</b>. The input shaft <b>24</b> may be operatively connected to the driven gear <b>30</b> and the output shaft <b>40</b> via the interaxle differential unit <b>26</b>.

A spline may have teeth that may be arranged around the axis <b>50</b>, may extend away from the axis <b>50</b>, may be disposed substantially parallel to the axis <b>50</b>, or combinations thereof. The term &#x201c;substantially parallel&#x201d; as used herein means the same as or very close to parallel and includes features or axes that are within &#xb1;2&#xb0; of being parallel each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first spline <b>60</b> may engage the clutch collar <b>28</b> such that the clutch collar <b>28</b> may be rotatable about the axis <b>50</b> with the input shaft <b>24</b>.

The interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> may accommodate or compensate for rotational speed differences between different drive axle assemblies, such as speed differences between the axle assembly <b>10</b> and a second axle assembly that is connected in series with the axle assembly <b>10</b>. As an example, the interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> may operatively connect the input shaft <b>24</b> and the output shaft <b>40</b> and may allow the input shaft <b>24</b> and output shaft <b>40</b> to rotate at different speeds with respect to each other under various operating conditions. The interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> may be provided in various locations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> is disposed inside the housing <b>20</b> on the input shaft <b>24</b>; however, it is contemplated that the interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> may be provided in other locations, such as closer to the output yoke <b>42</b> or with the second axle assembly. It is also contemplated that interaxle differential unit <b>26</b> may be disposed on another shaft.

Optionally one or more bearings B<b>1</b> may be received in the center bore and may rotatably support the first side gear <b>70</b> on the input shaft <b>24</b>. The first side gear <b>70</b> may be rotatable with respect to the case <b>80</b>. In addition, the first side gear <b>70</b> may be selectively couplable to the input shaft <b>24</b>.

For example, the second side gear <b>72</b> may extend along the axis <b>50</b> and may have a center bore that may receive or encircle an end of the output shaft <b>40</b> and optionally an end of the input shaft <b>24</b>. Optionally one or more bearings B<b>2</b> may be received in the center bore and may rotatably support the second side gear <b>72</b> on the input shaft <b>24</b>. The center bore may also include a spline or splined portion that may be spaced apart from the input shaft <b>24</b> and that may mate with a corresponding spline of another shaft, such as the output shaft <b>40</b>. As such, the second side gear <b>72</b> may be inhibited from rotating about the axis <b>50</b> with respect to the output shaft <b>40</b>.

The output shaft <b>40</b> may be operatively connected to the interaxle differential unit <b>26</b>. For example, the output shaft <b>40</b> may be coupled to the second side gear <b>72</b> and may be rotatable about the axis <b>50</b> with the second side gear <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the output yoke <b>42</b> may facilitate coupling of the axle assembly <b>10</b> to another axle assembly. For instance, the output yoke <b>42</b> may be fixedly coupled to the output shaft <b>40</b> in any suitable manner, such as with mating splines and a fastener like a nut. The output yoke <b>42</b> may be operatively connected to a second axle assembly in any suitable manner, such as via a prop shaft. The output yoke <b>42</b> may have any suitable configuration. For instance, the output yoke <b>42</b> may have a configuration similar to that shown or may have a disc configuration similar to that depicted for the input yoke <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An axle assembly as described above allows an interaxle differential unit to be provided without a spider, such as a spider that has a central ring that encircles an axis of rotation and has one or more shafts or pins that may be integrally formed with the central ring, extend away from the axis of rotation, and about which a pinion gear may rotate. Eliminating a spider with integrally-formed pins may prevent a pin from fracturing and/or separating from the central ring, the case of the interaxle differential unit, or both, which in turn may improve the durability of the interaxle differential unit. In addition, such a configuration may allow an interaxle differential unit to be provided with fewer parts than interaxle differential unit designs that have a spider, which may help reduce assembly time of the interaxle differential unit.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">While exemplary embodiments are described above, it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the invention.
