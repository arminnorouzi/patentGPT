The rotor of the low-pressure compressor is driven by the rotor of the low-pressure turbine, and the rotor of the high-pressure compressor is driven by the rotor of the high-pressure turbine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">From an engine performance and fuel consumption point of view, it is advantageous to maximize the rotational speed of the low-pressure turbine as this allows to obtain a better efficiency of the turbine. However, increasing the rotational speed of the turbine implies increasing the centrifugal forces it undergoes, and therefore greatly complicates its design.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One suggestion for increasing the efficiency of a turbine without increasing its rotational speed consists in using a counter-rotating turbine. The low-pressure turbine is then replaced by a two-rotor turbine a first rotor of which is configured to rotate in a first rotational direction and is connected to a first turbine shaft, and a second rotor is configured to rotate in an opposite direction of rotation and is connected to a second turbine shaft. The first rotor comprises turbine wheels interposed between turbine wheels of the second rotor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A low-pressure turbine can have a rotational speed at take-off of about 4,000 rpm in a conventional architecture where the turbine drives the fan directly or a rotational speed at take-off of about 10,000 rpm (in an architecture where the turbine drives the fan by means of a reduction gear). Its replacement by a counter-rotating turbine whose rotors turn respectively at speeds at take-off of the order of 3,000 and 7,000 revolutions per minute allows to have a relative speed of 10,000 revolutions per minute (3000+7000) while having an absolute speed in a low range of the aforementioned speed interval.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This counter-rotating turbine comprises a slow rotor and a fast rotor, the slow rotor driving the fan and the fast rotor meshing with a mechanical reduction gear with an epicyclic gear train of the planetary type whose input and output are counter-rotating (rotating ring gear, stationary planet carrier, rotating sun gear).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The reduction gear couples the fast rotor and the slow rotor, allowing thus a power transfer from the fast rotor to the slow rotor. The higher efficiencies of a high-speed turbine are achieved by transferring a large portion of the power from the turbine towards the fan, not through a reduction gear but through a shaft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This architecture is complex because of its mechanical integration: the mechanical reduction gear is located downstream of the turbomachine, radially inside a stator casing referred to as exhaust casing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This positioning of the reduction gear involves placing numerous bearings and oil collection enclosures inside the exhaust casing. Furthermore, the reduction gear is located in a relatively hot area, which requires a thermal solution. The space inside the exhaust casing is therefore particularly constrained, which implies that the integration of the reduction gear must be worked on as much as possible and its implementation radius reduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To optimize the operation and the service life of the reduction gear, it is important to take up the torque to which its planet carrier is subjected during operation. Furthermore, the conveying of lubricating oil to the reduction gear is essential for its operation and is complex to implement in this restricted environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention proposes an improvement to the technology described above, which represents a simple, effective and economical solution to at least some of the above problems.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention proposes a turbomachine with counter-rotating turbine for an aircraft,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the turbomachine comprising a counter-rotating turbine a first rotor of which is configured to rotate in a first direction of rotation and is connected to a first turbine shaft, and a second rotor is configured to rotate in an opposite direction of rotation and is connected to a second turbine shaft, the first rotor comprising turbine wheels interposed between turbine wheels of the second rotor,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the turbomachine further comprising a mechanical reduction gear with an epicyclic gear train of planetary type which comprises a sun gear driven in rotation by said second shaft, a ring gear driven in rotation by said first shaft, and a planet carrier attached to a stator casing of the turbomachine located upstream of the counter-rotating turbine with respect to a direction of flow of the gases in the turbomachine,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">characterised in that the planet carrier is attached to the stator casing by means of an annular part with an elongated shape extending inside said second shaft, this part comprising an upstream end attached to the intermediate casing and a downstream end coupled to the planet carrier, and in that this part comprises an integrated circuit for conveying lubricating oil from its upstream end to the planet carrier.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The part for connecting the stator casing to the planet carrier has a double function. It is coupled to the planet carrier and has a first function by this coupling of taking up the torque forces transmitted to the planet carrier during operation.

The pipelines <b>82</b> are evenly distributed around the axis of revolution of the part <b>50</b>. They are also integrated in the part <b>50</b> and are formed in longitudinal extra thicknesses located on the external surface of the section <b>76</b>. The pipelines <b>82</b> have their upstream ends that open into the cavity <b>78</b> and their downstream ends that open radially onto an external cylindrical surface <b>84</b> of the second section <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0071">This surface <b>84</b> extends between two annular bosses comprising annular grooves <b>86</b> for receiving annular seals.

An annular oil-receiving space <b>88</b> is defined between the surface <b>84</b> and a portion of the planet carrier <b>46</b> and allows oil to circulate from the integrated circuit in the part <b>50</b> to the integrated oil circuit in the planet carrier <b>46</b>. Thus, the planet carrier <b>46</b> comprises orifices <b>90</b> opening radially inward into the space <b>88</b> and communicating with oil pipelines <b>92</b> integrated into the planet carrier <b>46</b>, for conveying oil to the axles <b>94</b> of the planet gears <b>41</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> allow to show that the pipelines <b>82</b> are advantageously elliptical in cross-section with the smallest diameter in the radial direction to limit the radial overall dimension of the part while maximizing the pipeline cross-sections.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0073">The number of pipelines <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> and their passage cross-sections are determined in order to be able to pass the quantity of oil necessary for lubrication and cooling of the reduction gear. Several pipeline shapes are possible, from circular to elliptical. Nevertheless, since the part <b>50</b> is subject to torsional stress, elliptical-shaped pipelines are preferred, allowing to considerably limit the concentration of constraints at the level of the part, and thus to obtain a design which is optimal in terms of mass and overall dimension.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0074">Moreover, such a one-piece part can only be easily manufactured by additive manufacturing. However, the mechanical properties of the additive manufacturing are generally inferior to those of a forged material. The significant forces transiting through the part do not allow the splines <b>72</b> to be made downstream from a material manufactured by additive manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0075">In order to overcome this problem, the part <b>50</b> is preferably manufactured in two portions: the upstream portion by additive manufacturing with the pipelines <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> integrated. The upstream portion comprises the upstream end for attachment to the stator casing and at least partly the integrated lubricating oil conveying circuit, in particular the integrated pipelines <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. The upstream portion thus advantageously comprises the frustoconical section <b>74</b> and the cylindrical section <b>76</b>. Then the downstream portion of the part is produced by forging, the downstream portion comprising the downstream end of coupling to the planet carrier. In particular, the downstream portion with the splines <b>72</b> is produced of forged material with better mechanical characteristics. The two portions would be connected together by welding, with the welding performed between the splines <b>72</b> and the surface <b>84</b>. The reference <b>96</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>7</b></figref> designates the annular weld bead of these two portions.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0076">The use of splines <b>72</b> to transmit the torque also allows for ensuring an easier disassembling of the reduction gear and reduces the overall dimension of the upstream oil enclosure. A flange would have been much bulkier and therefore would have limited the possibility of integrating the shaft <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0077">The oil passage is made upstream of the splines <b>72</b> via a transition area defined by the space <b>88</b> between the planet carrier <b>46</b> and the part <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The seals carried by part <b>50</b> ensure the sealing of this area and the good transfer of oil at the junction between the two elements.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0078">The cavity <b>78</b> allows the oil arriving through the pipelines <b>80</b> to distribute itself in the pipelines <b>82</b>, here <b>12</b> in number. The use of a larger number of pipelines <b>82</b> allows to minimize their radial overall dimension and thus optimizes the integration of the part <b>50</b> into the turbine.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0079">The present invention thus provides several advantages:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0080">it allows to lubricate the reduction gear by means of the planet carrier <b>46</b>,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0081">the pipelines <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> with an elliptical cross-section allow oil to be conveyed through a part that is stressed during operation because it is subjected to a transmission of forces by the reduction gear,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0082">the part <b>50</b>, although complex, is easily made, at least partly, by additive manufacturing,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0083">the splines <b>72</b>, which are the seat of high constraint concentrations, are produced by forging so that they have good mechanical properties.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
