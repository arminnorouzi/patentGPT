Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2020-091794 discloses an image forming system that includes a receiving unit, an identification unit, and a deletion unit and controls execution of jobs in multiple image forming apparatuses. The receiving unit receives a deletion instruction to delete a job. The identification unit identifies a job as a deletion instruction target. The deletion unit deletes the identified job. The image forming system further includes a duration estimation unit, a job information acquisition unit, a cost calculation unit, and a reduction unit. The duration estimation unit identifies the job as the deletion instruction target and estimates a duration taken until the job is deleted. In response to receiving the deletion instruction regarding the job, the job information acquisition unit acquires job information for calculating the execution cost of jobs under execution from the multiple image forming apparatuses. In response to acquiring job information from two or more of the multiple image forming apparatuses, the cost calculation unit calculates a possible execution cost in the duration by using the job information for each job. The reduction unit reduces the speed at which one or more jobs having calculated execution costs higher than the other execution costs are executed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Suppose that a printing instruction given in response to speech input and a printing instruction given in response to input other than the speech input are available.

The server <b>20</b> then acquires a document D describing the recipe for pork and cabbage sauteed with spicy miso from the document storage <b>50</b> (step S<b>102</b>) and requests the page analyzer <b>60</b> to analyze the pages of the document D (step S<b>103</b>). In response to this, the page analyzer <b>60</b> generates a page analysis result R from the document D, and the server <b>20</b> then acquires the page analysis result R (step S<b>104</b>) and transmits a printing instruction regarding the document D to the printer <b>40</b> on the basis of the page analysis result R (step S<b>105</b>).

The server <b>20</b> thereafter transmits a printing result response to the smart speaker <b>10</b> (step S<b>106</b>), and the smart speaker <b>10</b> gives a speech V<b>02</b> &#x201c;Printed the page for ingredients for the recipe for pork and cabbage sauteed with spicy miso&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Suppose that the user makes the printing request to the smart speaker <b>10</b> vocally and thereafter makes a cancellation request regarding the printing request vocally. If there are printing requests in this case, vocal communication is required to identify the printing request associated with the cancellation request. For example, the following communication method is conceivable. The smart speaker <b>10</b> inquires of the printer <b>40</b> about list information regarding printing instructions via the server <b>20</b>, the printer <b>40</b> transmits the list information, the smart speaker <b>10</b> gives a speech corresponding to the printing instructions, and the user vocally designates one of the printing instructions to be canceled. However, this method takes some time. It is conceivable that printing is performed on occasions before processing involved with the cancellation request is performed because the processing is late. If the printing system uses a pay-for-use system, the user is charged for unnecessary printing.
