One type of turbine is a so called radial turbine. A rotor for a radial turbine has a base and a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly of the base. A high pressure working fluid is delivered into a central area of the turbine from a volute, flows through a stator or nozzles, and expands as it contacts the turbine blades, driving the rotor to rotate. Downstream of the rotor the working fluid leaves a housing for the turbine through an outlet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The efficiency of the turbomachinery depends on turbine inlet temperature and pressure. As the turbine inlet temperature increases, cooling of the turbine has been proposed.

A volute <b>22</b> houses a turbine rotor <b>24</b> along with a housing <b>37</b>. The turbine rotor <b>24</b> has a base <b>30</b> with sections <b>31</b> intermediate a plurality of turbine blades <b>28</b>. A nose cone <b>26</b> is formed at a center of the turbine rotor <b>24</b>. High pressure fluid is delivered into an inlet <b>34</b> and passes out of opening <b>135</b>, and impacts the blades <b>28</b>, causing the rotor <b>24</b> to rotate. Downstream of the rotor the fluid exits through an outlet <b>32</b>. The high pressure fluid drives the blades <b>28</b> such that the rotor <b>24</b> rotates about a central axis X along with shaft <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows details of the rotor <b>24</b>. The base <b>30</b> and the sections <b>31</b> intermediate the blades <b>28</b> have radially outer sections <b>10</b> which curve into radially inner sections <b>16</b>, with an intermediate section <b>12</b>. The surfaces <b>31</b> extend in a direction that changes from section <b>10</b> to section <b>16</b>. At section <b>10</b> the surface extends with a greater component in a radial direction than in an axial direction. In section <b>12</b> the two components get closer to each other. By section <b>16</b> the direction has a greater axial component than a radial component. A similar change occurs on the blades <b>28</b>. As shown, a radially outer portion <b>17</b> of the blade curves through a central portion <b>19</b>, and to an inner portion <b>21</b>. Section <b>17</b> extends with a greater component in a radial direction than in an axial direction. Section <b>19</b> has the two components being closer to being equal. Section <b>21</b> extends with a greater component in an axial direction than in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The nose cone <b>26</b> as illustrated may be conical. Alternatively, it may be half spherical, half elliptic or other smooth bodies of revolution</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Applicant has recognized that there is a limit on the turbine inlet temperature that can be utilized with existing turbines. As an example, existing turbines may have a temperature limit of say approximately 800&#xb0; C. The turbine inlet temperature has generally been limited by metal temperature capabilities from the metal forming the turbine rotor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Active cooling of the turbine rotor has been proposed in the past. However, as can be appreciate, the turbine rotor <b>24</b> has a very complex shape. To adequately cool within the complex shape, including the curving sections <b>31</b> and blades <b>28</b>, would be difficult with standard manufacturing techniques. As such, Applicant proposes to utilize additive manufacturing to form the turbine rotor <b>24</b>, including embedded cooling channels. In addition, a thermal barrier coating may be used to further enhance turbine capability, e.g., turbine inlet temperature 1400&#xb0; C. or above.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a rear surface <b>115</b> of the rotor <b>24</b>. Cooling flow inlets <b>38</b> are shown in the rear surface <b>115</b>. Shaft <b>111</b> rotates with the rotor. Cooling flow enters the housing <b>37</b> into chamber <b>119</b>. The cooling flow may be obtained from a compressor or other appropriate source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> shows details of the cooling fluid flow from the chamber <b>119</b> through impingement holes <b>301</b>. As will be understood there are a plurality of such holes <b>301</b>. The cooling fluid flows outwardly through a gap <b>305</b> between the rear side <b>115</b> and the housing <b>37</b> to form purge flow, which will not only prevent high temperature working fluid going inside but also form film cooling to cool the turbine. This cooling fluid also flows between the shaft <b>111</b> and to seal <b>304</b> as shown at <b>303</b>. This provides cooling to the seal <b>304</b>, and bearings, etc. associated with the shaft <b>111</b>. The cooling flow also enters the plurality of inlets <b>38</b> in the rear surface <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The seal can be a labyrinth seal, a dry gas seal or other seal. There can be another cooling inlet immediately upstream of the seal to lower the temperature of the cooling flow through the seal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a cooling arrangement <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are &#x201c;reverse views,&#x201d; showing the space occupied by the cooling fluid or coolant that are within a body of the turbine rotor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. They are shown as coolant solid to simplify the illustration, and better illustrate the nature and shape of the cooling channels. Cooling flow is normally supplied from a compressor exit. Coolant temperature can be varied by a cooler or a heater if needed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A feeder section <b>36</b> communicates with an inlet <b>38</b>, and curves from an outer end <b>39</b> through a central portion <b>137</b> to an inner portion <b>35</b>. The sections <b>39</b>/<b>137</b>/<b>35</b> change their direction similar to the way the blades and section <b>31</b> change, with the radially outer portion <b>39</b> extending with a greater component in a radial direction than in an axial direction. Section <b>137</b> extends with the two components being closer to equal. Section <b>35</b> extends with a greater component in an axial direction than in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an inner portion <b>42</b> is provided to cool the nose cone using backside impingement cooling. Section <b>35</b> feeds cooling flow to chamber <b>58</b> having a relatively large volume to provide relatively uniform feed pressure to impingement holes <b>56</b>. The angle of the impingement holes <b>56</b> can be perpendicular or other angle to chamber <b>54</b>. The spent cooling flow is then flowing through <b>55</b> to feed cooling passage <b>40</b></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Cooling channel section <b>40</b> is generally provided to cool the sections <b>31</b> intermediate the blades <b>28</b>. Here again, there is a radially outer section <b>11</b> curving into a central portion <b>101</b>, and having a radially inner portion <b>27</b>. These sections curve with a direction similar to the sections <b>31</b>. That is, section <b>11</b> extends with a greater component in a radial direction than an axial direction. Section <b>15</b> has the two components being closer to being equal. Section <b>27</b> extends with a greater component in an axial than in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows details of the section <b>40</b>. Here an inlet in a leg <b>55</b> receives cooling flow from <b>42</b>. Cooling flow is received at leg <b>55</b>, as will be disclosed, and the cooling flow extends radially outward to passage <b>53</b>, and then back radially inward and then outward through other legs to leg <b>52</b>. This radially inward and radially outward serpentine channel arrangement continues on until an end leg <b>44</b>. At the end leg <b>44</b>, there is potentially a flow dead zone, therefore, connection <b>45</b> is used to introduce cooling flow to purge the dead zone. Leg <b>44</b> is connected to section <b>41</b> through port <b>156</b>, so that cooling flow can go from leg <b>44</b> to section <b>41</b> to cool the blades <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Section <b>41</b> is provided to cool the blades <b>28</b>. It also has a radially outer section <b>13</b>, a central section <b>15</b>, and an inner section <b>103</b>. These sections all curve in a manner similar to the blades. The outer section <b>13</b> extends with a greater component in a radial direction than in an axial direction. Central portion <b>15</b> extends with two components being closer to equal. Section <b>10</b> extends with a greater component in an axial direction than in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> shows the blade cooling portion <b>41</b>. As shown, an inlet <b>156</b> provides cooling flow from the leg <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E and <b>3</b>A</figref>). The cooling flow first cools the leading edge using impingement jets, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>. The jets can target the center of leading edge, or the suction side of the lead edge. That cooling flow then extends in a serpentine path through repeated serpentine legs <b>158</b>. As can be appreciated, the distance between the side legs <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> of the serpentine passages increases in axial height from the radially outer end through radially central portions <b>160</b> and <b>161</b>, and two inner serpentine legs <b>260</b> and <b>261</b>. The cooling flow then moves through holes <b>66</b> into a chamber <b>64</b> with pins, which cools the radially outer end of the blades <b>28</b>. Finally, the cooling flow exits at the trailing edge of the turbine blades.
