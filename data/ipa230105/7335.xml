More specifically, techniques are disclosed for modifying display of segments of a primary content to highlight objects within the primary content to indicate availability of supplemental content (e.g., advertising content, purchasing information, etc.) related to the highlighted object.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Businesses often advertise goods and services to consumers using advertisements presented to consumers via scheduled advertisement-breaks while consumers are watching media assets such as a movie or a serialized program. In-video stream advertising such as the presentation of short video advertisements before displaying the primary content (e.g., a movie), during, and after the end of the primary content have been used by many streaming platforms. However, such advertisements may not be of interest to the consumers and therefore lessen their effectiveness. In one approach, modern media distribution systems often present personalized advertisement content identified based on a profile of the consumers (e.g., based on age, geographic location, etc.) viewing these advertisements to in order to engage the consumers and increase the effectiveness of the advertising content. However, consumers viewing media assets such as a movie or a serialized program often use scheduled advertisement-breaks as opportunity to step away from the programming (e.g., to get snacks or to run other errands). Therefore, advertisement content which may be of interest to the consumers go unwatched, therefore reducing their effectiveness. Additionally, there may be products featured within the primary program being watched by the consumers that they may be interested in. For example, a character wearing a particular article of clothing (e.g., a jacket or a pair of shoes) or driving a vehicle may pique the interest of the consumers. However, the consumers have to manually search for advertisement content that match the products featured within the primary program, which wastes time, computing resources, and bandwidth due to a lack of available information available for the primary programs. For example, requests for needless advertising content as the consumers are searching for other products unnecessarily consume limited available bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome these problems, systems and methods are provided herein for highlighting objects with a primary content that are likely to be of interest to a user viewing the primary content. More particularly, when the system receives a segment of primary content to be displayed on a user equipment device for consumption, the system analyzes the received segment to identify an object within the received segment. For example, the system may employ an object recognition algorithm to identify one or more objects (e.g., an article of clothing, etc.) present within the received segment. The system then checks a database storing supplemental content (e.g., advertising content) to determine whether supplemental content associated with the identified object is available. When supplemental content associated with the identified object is available within the database, the system modifies the display of the received segment of the primary content to highlight the identified object. In some aspects, the system may add a highlight in an overlay around a border of the identified object. In another aspect, the identified object can be highlighted by visually distinguishing the identified object from other objects within the received segment (e.g., by adding an icon adjacent to the identified object, by providing a shaded overlay over the identified object, etc.). Finally, the system displays the segment of the primary content with the highlighted object on the user equipment device for consumption. Accordingly, methods and systems disclosed herein allow businesses to present supplemental content (e.g., advertising content) to users while they are engaged with the primary content. Moreover, users viewing the primary content can easily view supplemental content associated with objects within the segment of the primary content that the users may be interested in.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some aspects, the system can identify a plurality of objects within the received segment of the primary content. In such an aspect, highlighting every identified object within the received segment of the primary content would overwhelm the user viewing the primary content and distract from enjoying the primary content. Accordingly, the system may prioritize one or two of the identified objects to be highlighted based on user preferences. For example, the system may retrieve a web browsing history associated with the user consuming the primary content to identify products that the user may wish to purchase. Upon determining a match between an identified object from the received segment of the primary content and a product identified from the retrieved web browsing history associated with the user, the system prioritizes the matching identified object. The system then modifies the received segment of the primary content to highlight the highest priority objects and displays the modified segment on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, modifying the received segment of the primary content includes providing a user selectable link. For example, the user can use an input device such as a remote-control device to select a highlighted object within the displayed segment of the primary content. In another embodiment, the user can provide a voice command using, for example, a microphone, to select a highlighted object within the displayed segment of the primary content. The system, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlight objects within the displayed segment of the primary content (for instance, by receiving data indicative of a selection of the user selectable link), displays the supplemental content associated with the identified object selected by the user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the system, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlight objects within the displayed segment of the primary content, prevents an audio component associated with the primary content from being output. For example, the system may mute the audio of the primary content while simultaneously displaying the supplemental content along with closed-captioning data associated with the primary content. This ensures that the user can view the supplemental content including the audio component of the supplemental content while simultaneously following the primary content. In another embodiment, the supplemental content is displayed during a segment of the primary content where there is no dialogue between characters. For example, the system may delay the presentation of supplemental content until a segment of the primary content that does not include an audio component is displayed. This allows the user to engage with the supplemental content without missing the primary content.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, the supplemental content is displayed on the user equipment device simultaneously with the primary content. For example, the primary content is displayed on a primary window of the user equipment device with the supplemental content being displayed on a secondary window as an overlay over the primary window. In another such aspect, the playback of the primary content is paused while the supplemental content is displayed on the primary window.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiments, the system, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlighted objects within the displayed segment of the primary content, displays a user selectable option for interacting with the supplemental content. In one aspect, the user selectable option is an option to interrupt playback of the primary content to display the supplemental content. For instance, playback of the primary content is paused while the supplemental content is displayed on the primary window of the user equipment device. In another aspect, the user selectable option is an option to simultaneously display the primary content and the supplemental content, wherein the supplemental content is displayed in a picture-in-picture mode. In still another aspect, the user selectable option is an option to display the supplemental content for display on a second user equipment device. For example, the system may transmit the supplemental content to a mobile device of the user so that the user can view the supplemental content without interrupting the playback of the primary content.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the user selectable option in an option to view a purchase offer related to the identified object. For example, the system may present a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to direct the user to a web resource where the user can purchase the identified object. In another embodiment, the system can display product reviews of the highlighted object selected by the user. In an embodiment, the system displays one or more of the user selectable options to be displayed on the user equipment device in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlighted objects within the displayed segment of the primary content.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with some aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, the primary content may have scheduled interruptions where advertising content is conventionally displayed. In one aspect of the present disclosure, the system determines which of the presented user selectable options was selected by the user. The system then adjusts a frequency of the scheduled interruptions based on the determined selection of the presented user selectable options. For example, when the user selects the option to pause the primary content and view the supplemental content on the primary window of the user equipment device, the system removes one or more of the scheduled interruptions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the disclosure herein, the frequency of the scheduled interruptions is adjusted based on a duration of the user interaction with the displayed supplemental content. For example, when the user merely interacts with the supplemental content for a minimal period of time (e.g., less than 5-10 seconds), the system may decide not to adjust the frequency of the scheduled interruption. In another embodiment, when the user interacts with the supplemental content for a threshold period of time (e.g., more than 30 seconds), the system may remove one or more of the scheduled interruptions. In another embodiment, the system may reduce the amount of time scheduled for the interruption to the primary content. Accordingly, the user is incentivized to interact with the supplemental content.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the supplemental content displayed on the user equipment device is personalized based on the user viewing the supplemental content. For instance, the system can retrieve a purchase history of the user to identify specific patterns favored by the user (e.g., specific colors for articles of clothing preferred by the user). The system then displays supplemental content such as an advertisement which features the product in the specific color preferred by the user. In another embodiment, the system displays supplemental content which feature the identified object (e.g., a specific pair of shoes worn by a character in the primary content). In this way, businesses are more likely to engage the consumers and increase effectiveness of their advertisements. Moreover, the users are more likely to identify products they are interested in and easily view supplemental content related to those products.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above and other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative system for modifying display of segments of a primary content to highlight identified objects of interest, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative user interface showing user selectable options for interacting with supplemental content associated with a selected highlighted object, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device used to begin a live media stream, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an illustrative media system, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process for modifying display of segments of a primary content to highlight identified objects of interest, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process for providing user selectable options for interacting with supplemental content, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process <b>800</b> for adjusting a frequency of scheduled interruptions in the playback of the primary content based on a type of interaction with the supplemental content, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process <b>800</b> for adjusting a frequency of scheduled interruptions in the playback of the primary content based on a duration of interaction with the supplemental content, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process for generating personalized supplemental content, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary system <b>100</b> for modifying display of segments of a primary content to highlight identified objects that are likely to be of interest to a user viewing the primary content. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b> receives segment <b>104</b> of primary content to be displayed on user equipment device <b>108</b> for consumption. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> receives a segment of the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d;. In an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b>, in response to receiving a selection of a primary content (e.g., the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d;), displays a user interface including a selectable option for providing interactive supplemental content during playback of the selected primary content. For example, the user is offered a first option to request highlighted objects of interest during playback of the primary content and a second option to consume the primary content without highlighting objects of interest. In an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> performs the following processes in response to the user selecting the first option to request highlighting of objects of interest during playback of the primary content.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> analyzes the received segment to identify an object within the received segment. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> employs an object recognition algorithm (e.g., a known object recognition algorithm such as Microsoft Azure Computer Vision) to identify one or more objects <b>112</b> present within the received segment. In an embodiment, a voice recognition interface (such as the one described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can monitor utterances of the user during playback of the primary content to identify objects that are of interest to the user. For example, the voice recognition interface can determine that the user uttered the phrase, &#x201c;that car looks nice!&#x201d;. In response, control circuitry <b>102</b> can use the object recognition algorithm discussed above to determine the presence of a vehicle within the received segment of the primary content. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b> analyzes the received segment of the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d; in the manner discussed above to identify objects such as a vehicle <b>112</b>-A (e.g., Mercedes sedan), a pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B (e.g., Nike Ebernon) worn by a character, and a tire <b>112</b>-C of a second vehicle (e.g., Bridgestone).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Control circuitry <b>102</b> then checks database <b>106</b> storing supplemental content related to a plurality of objects to determine whether supplemental content associated with the identified object is available. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> checks database <b>106</b> to determine whether supplemental content related to the identified vehicle, tires, or pair of shoes are available. When supplemental content associated with the identified object is available within database <b>106</b>, control circuitry <b>102</b> modifies the received segment <b>104</b> of the primary content. Specifically, content circuitry <b>102</b> modifies the received segment <b>104</b> of the primary content to highlight the identified objects <b>112</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in one example, control circuitry <b>102</b> adds a highlight around a border of the identified objects <b>112</b> in the modified segment <b>110</b>. In various other embodiments, control circuitry <b>102</b> can highlight identified objects <b>112</b> by adding an icon next to the identified objects within the modified segment of the primary content. In still other embodiments, control circuitry <b>102</b> can highlight identified objects <b>112</b> in any suitable manner by visually distinguishing the identified objects <b>112</b> from other objects within the received segment (e.g., by shading an area of a frame where the identified objects <b>112</b> are located).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Control circuitry <b>102</b> then displays the modified segment <b>110</b> of the primary content on user equipment device <b>108</b> for consumption. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, modified segment <b>114</b> displayed on user television equipment <b>108</b> includes highlighted objects <b>112</b>-A (a vehicle), <b>112</b>-B (a pair of shoes), and <b>112</b>-C (tires of a vehicle).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Control circuitry <b>102</b> can identify a plurality of objects within received segment <b>104</b> of the primary content. In such an aspect, highlighting every identified object within received segment <b>104</b> of the primary content would overwhelm the user viewing the primary content and distract from enjoying the primary content. Accordingly, control circuitry <b>102</b> prioritizes one or two of the identified objects to be highlighted based on user preferences. Specifically, control circuitry <b>102</b> retrieves a web browsing history associated with the user consuming the primary content to identify products that the user may wish to purchase. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> can determine that the user has recently searched extensively for new shoes and tires to purchase. In one embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> can retrieve social media activity of the user viewing the primary content to identify other interests of the user. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> may determine, based on the retrieved social media activity, that the user has recently liked pictures and advertisements related to Mercedes sedans.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon determining a match between an identified object from the received segment of the primary content and the product identified from the retrieved user preferences, control circuitry <b>102</b> prioritizes the matching identified object. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the Mercedes sedan <b>112</b>-A, the pair of Nike Ebernon <b>112</b>-B, and the Bridgestone tires <b>112</b>-C are prioritized. Similarly, objects within the received segment <b>104</b> that do not match the retrieved user preferences are deprioritized. For example, objects such as a yacht shown in the background of the received segment <b>104</b> are deprioritized. Control circuitry <b>102</b> then modifies the received segment <b>104</b> of the primary content to highlight the highest priority objects (<b>112</b>-A, <b>112</b>-B, and <b>112</b>-C) and displays modified segment <b>110</b> on user equipment device <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, modifying the received segment of the primary content includes providing a user selectable link. For example, the user can use an input device such as a remote-control device to select a highlighted object within the displayed modified segment <b>110</b> of the primary content. In another embodiment, the user can provide a voice command using, for example, a microphone, to select a highlighted object within the displayed segment of the primary content. In an embodiment, a voice recognition interface (such as the one described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can automatically monitor voice interactions of the user during playback of the primary content to detect an utterance corresponding to an object.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the user selects the identified pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B from the displayed modified segment <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Control circuitry <b>102</b>, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlight objects <b>112</b> within the displayed modified segment <b>110</b> of the primary content (for instance, by receiving data indicative of a selection of the user selectable link), displays supplemental content <b>116</b> associated with the identified object <b>112</b> selected by the user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b>, in response to the user selecting the pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B, displays an advertisement (i.e., supplemental content <b>116</b>) on user equipment device <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>102</b>, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlight objects <b>112</b> within the displayed segment <b>110</b> of the primary content, prevents an audio component associated with the primary content from being output. For example, the system may mute the audio of the primary content while simultaneously displaying the supplemental content along with closed-captioning data associated with the primary content. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, closed-captioning data <b>118</b> associated with the show &#x201c;Billion&#x201d; is displayed while simultaneously displaying the advertisement (i.e., supplemental content <b>116</b>) associated with the selected pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B. This ensures that the user can view the supplemental content including the audio component of the supplemental content while simultaneously following the primary content. In another embodiment, the supplemental content is displayed during a segment of the primary content where there is no dialogue between characters. For example, the system may delay the presentation of supplemental content until a segment of the primary content that does not include an audio component is displayed. This allows the user to engage with the supplemental content without missing the primary content.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supplemental content <b>116</b> is displayed on user equipment device <b>108</b> simultaneously with the primary content.

In another such aspect, the playback of the primary content is paused while supplemental content <b>116</b> is displayed on primary window <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b>, in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlighted objects within the displayed segment of the primary content, displays a user selectable option for interacting with the supplemental content. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative user interface <b>200</b> showing user selectable options <b>220</b> for interacting with supplemental content associated with a selected highlighted object, in accordance with some embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one aspect shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, user selectable option <b>220</b> is an option to interrupt playback of the primary content to display the supplemental content. For instance, playback of the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d; (i.e., primary content) is paused while the advertisement (i.e., supplemental content) for the pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B is displayed on primary window <b>120</b> of user equipment device <b>108</b>. In an embodiment where segments of the primary content are being received from a broadcast source, control circuitry <b>102</b> buffers the primary content while displaying the supplemental content.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another aspect, user selectable option <b>220</b> is an option to simultaneously display the primary content and the supplemental content, where the supplemental content is displayed in a picture-in-picture mode on a secondary window overlaid over a primary window. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d; (i.e., primary content) is displayed on primary window <b>120</b> while the advertisement (i.e., supplemental content) for the pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B is displayed on secondary window <b>122</b> of user equipment device <b>108</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> may generate a zoomed-in image of the identified object in the secondary window. In still another embodiment, the secondary window displays textual description associated with the identified object instead of or in addition to the zoomed-in image of the identified object.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In still another aspect, user selectable option <b>220</b> is an option to display the supplemental content for display on a second user equipment device. For example, control circuitry <b>102</b> displays an advertisement (i.e., the supplemental content) for the pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B to a mobile device of the user so that the user can view the advertisement without interrupting the playback of the show &#x201c;Billions&#x201d; (i.e., the primary content). In another aspect, user selectable option <b>220</b> is an option to view a purchase offer related to the identified object. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b> presents a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to direct the user to a web resource where the user can purchase the identified pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B. In another embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> can display product reviews of the highlighted object selected by the user. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b> displays one or more of user selectable options <b>220</b> to be displayed on user equipment device <b>108</b> in response to detecting that the user has selected one of the highlighted objects <b>112</b> within the displayed segment <b>114</b> of the primary content. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, control circuitry <b>102</b> allows a user to scroll through user selectable options <b>220</b> and select option <b>222</b> to purchase the pair of shoes <b>112</b>-B.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with some aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, the primary content may have scheduled interruptions during which advertising content is conventionally displayed. In one aspect of the present disclosure, control circuitry <b>102</b> determines which of the presented user selectable options <b>220</b> was selected by the user. Control circuitry <b>102</b> then adjusts a frequency of the scheduled interruptions based on the determined selection <b>222</b> of the presented user selectable options <b>220</b>. For example, when the user selects the option to pause the primary content and view the supplemental content on the primary window of the user equipment device, control circuitry <b>102</b> removes one or more of the scheduled interruptions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another aspect of the disclosure herein, the frequency of the scheduled interruptions is adjusted based on a duration of the user interaction with the displayed supplemental content. For example, when the user merely interacts with the supplemental content for a minimal period of time (e.g., less than 5-10 seconds), control circuitry <b>102</b> determines not to adjust the frequency of the scheduled interruption. In another embodiment, when the user interacts with the supplemental content for a threshold period of time (e.g., more than 30 seconds), control circuitry <b>102</b> removes one or more of the scheduled interruptions. In another embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> reduces the amount of time scheduled for the interruption to the primary content. Accordingly, the user is incentivized to interact with the supplemental content.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the supplemental content displayed on user equipment device <b>108</b> is personalized based on the user viewing the supplemental content. For instance, control circuitry <b>102</b> retrieves a purchase history of the user to identify specific patterns favored by the user (e.g., specific colors for articles of clothing preferred by the user). Control circuitry <b>102</b> then displays supplemental content such as an advertisement which features the product in the specific color preferred by the user. In another embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> displays supplemental content which feature the identified object (e.g., a specific pair of shoes worn by a character in the primary content). In this way, businesses are more likely to engage the consumers and increase effectiveness of their advertisements. Moreover, the users are more likely to identify products they are interested in and easily view supplemental content related to those products.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with an embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> may be part of user television equipment <b>108</b>. In such an embodiment, a processor (control circuitry <b>102</b>) at the user television equipment <b>108</b> receives segments of the primary content from a server along with a manifest file associated with the primary content. The control circuitry <b>102</b> at the user television equipment <b>108</b> parses the manifest file to determine scheduled advertisement breaks. Moreover, control circuitry <b>102</b> at the user television equipment <b>108</b> also retrieves supplemental content (e.g., supplemental content <b>116</b> discussed above) from a remote database (e.g., database <b>106</b> discussed above) and stitches together the primary content along with the supplemental content. Control circuitry <b>102</b> at the user television equipment then modifies the display based on user selection of one or more of the highlighted objects and/or user-selectable options. Although the above embodiment described control circuitry <b>102</b> stitching together the primary content along with the supplemental content, it is not necessary to do so. In an embodiment, the supplemental content is displayed as an overlay over the primary content. Moreover, as described below, the manifest file received at user television equipment <b>108</b> may, in one embodiment, not include the supplemental content (e.g., advertising content). Instead, a plurality of URLs are received from an advertising server corresponding to the identified objects separate from the manifest file as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, control circuitry <b>102</b> may be part of a media content server remote from user television equipment <b>108</b>. In such an embodiment, the media content server receives segments of the primary content from a media content owner server (e.g., Showtime server providing segments of the program &#x201c;Billions&#x201d;). The media content server also receives advertising content from an advertisement server to be displayed during the display of the primary content. The media content server then stitches together the advertising content with the primary content and generates a manifest file for the combined content. The combined content along with the manifest file is then transmitted to, for instance, the user television equipment <b>108</b>. Additional detail about the structure and operation of control circuitry <b>102</b> will be described in greater detail below in connection with the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment, media content server does not stitch together the advertising content with the primary content. Instead, media content server generates an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file or a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. More particularly, media content server generates an XML file or JSON file which includes URLs corresponding to the supplemental content (e.g., advertising content) corresponding to various objects within the received segment of the primary content. In addition, media content server can include, within the XML file or JSON file, information indicative of location of an object of interest within each frame of the segment of the primary content (e.g., pixel location information where the identified object is to be displayed). Moreover, media content server can further include, within the XML file or JSON file, information indicative of location where and how the highlight is to be generated for display. For example, media content server can provide information instructing user television equipment <b>108</b> to generate for display a yellow colored rectangular box at a location corresponding to an object of interest within the segment of the primary content. In such an embodiment, user television equipment <b>108</b>, in response to receiving the manifest file and the XML or JSON file, can merely generate for display the primary content and the highlighting based on display signals received from the media content server. In response to receiving a user selection of a highlighted object, user television equipment can retrieve supplemental content using URL information stored in the received XML or JSON file. In another embodiment, in response to receiving a user selection of a highlighted object, user television equipment can transmit a request to the media content server for supplemental content. In such an embodiment, media content server can provide the supplemental content to user television equipment <b>108</b> along with information indicating where and how the supplemental content is to be displayed in an XML or JSON file accompanying the supplemental content data.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a generalized embodiment of an illustrative device (e.g., user equipment device <b>204</b> or user equipment device <b>220</b>) that is used to modify the received segments of the primary content.
