For example, a camera mounted on a vehicle may be coupled to an image processing device that processes images to detect objects in the vicinity of the vehicle. Proper operation of a camera in the presence of some amount of obstruction is an important aspect of the camera. The camera should not be interrupted from its normal function under the presence of obstructions. Some of these obstructions may include debris, mud, rain, bugs, or other obstructions that may hinder the normal operation of the camera. These obstructions may alter the image quality of the camera after getting deposited on the camera lens. Thus, there is a need to enhance the testing and validation of a camera to ensure that obstructions do not cause inconsistent or unreliable image quality that undermines the camera's normal operation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary vehicle equipped with multiple cameras, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative schematic diagram for camera cleaning validation, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts an illustrative schematic diagram for camera cleaning validation, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative schematic diagram for camera cleaning validation, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts an illustrative schematic diagram for camera cleaning validation, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an illustrative process for a camera cleaning validation system, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a computing device or computer system upon which any of one or more techniques (e.g., methods) may be performed, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain implementations will now be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various implementations and/or aspects are shown.

A device (e.g., a camera) should not be interrupted from its normal function. For example, if an obstruction is deposited on the lens of a camera, a camera cleaning system should be applied in order to attempt to return the camera to its normal function by clearing the obstruction off of the camera lens to a certain degree.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may combine a scale-invariant target with a target-independent camera metric, which allows a wide variety of errors in camera performance to be detected from an expected baseline without an application-specific behavior being required. An application-specific behavior may be tied to the type of tests being performed, such as sharpness test, blurred lines test, resolution test, modulation transfer function (MTF), chromatic aberration test, white balance, color response, color error, and any other specific tests.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate a validation test for a camera under test. A camera cleaning validation system may provide a mechanism to allow a pass or fail criteria to be judged on the camera under test in real-time during the testing and provides a target framework and a backend processing framework together in real-time application. A camera cleaning validation system may allow for a testing and validation environment that does not necessarily require tuning the camera for ideal lightning conditions, setup, distance, etc., which are typically required by camera tests. That is, it is not necessary to determine pixel sizes or determine a specific color palette, which is typically used to perform image quality tests. A controlled environment not required, but rather a camera cleaning validation system may reduce the noise level from the environment. In fact, the camera cleaning validation system may allow more variation in the test setup to achieve a higher level of repeatability and reproducibility, which in turn allows higher resolution to differentiate between &#x2018;pass&#x2019; and &#x2018;fail&#x2019; conditions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate an application-independent methodology by using a metric associated with the validation of a camera system. That is, the ability to measure the camera's sensitivity to the obstruction that is applied (regardless of actual cleaning performance). In this case, multiple obstructed states may be compared to the baseline &#x2018;normal&#x2019; state. The metric may be described in the notion of a normal state and the notion of interrupted or fail state based on the presence of an obstruction on the lens of a camera. For example, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate that a quality of a captured optical signal is independent of the camera's resolution, field-of-view, orientation, lightning, or specific knowledge of the application of the camera's data. The camera cleaning validation system may facilitate a generalized pass or fail criteria independent of the metric, under a degraded event, yet still be relevant to a broad set of applications (e.g., recognizing faces, cars, etc.). The signal received from a degraded event using a particular image (e.g., spilled coins image) is independent of the camera's application but still represent correctness to a wide variety of camera applications.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, a camera cleaning validation system would lend itself to a before and after judgment and a notion of using a particular index that will allow a before and after score to whether a camera system is performing to a predetermined level. The score may be tied to image quality by using a particular index. In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate a structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) to be used as the particular index. The SSIM may be a perceptual metric that quantifies image quality degradation caused by processing an image. SSIM may provide a measure of the perceptual difference between two images. SSIM allows for a more generalized set of scores that apply more broadly to a large set of image applications. For example, traditional image quality metrics such as slanted edges, color charts, or other metrics require an analysis of different metrics to get the full picture, whereas SSIM provides a simpler way to capture failure modes independent of the application. SSIM provides an index associated with a large amount of information while using one score. A benefit to the SSIM metric is that it can capture image degradation continuously across the whole image, whereas the slanted edge and sharpness targets can only measure localized changes. Measuring uniform changes across the image is important because 1) a localized obstruction may not land precisely on the slant edge or sharpness marker region and 2) it provides a broader picture of the uniformity of the obstruction. As long as a known good environment is established, there is no need to calibrate a color chart or other metrics before capturing an SSIM score. In this case, SSIM would provide a pass or fail score which is a simple way to capture failure conditions. SSIM helps measure a target's noise structure, luminance, and other factors to understand the general image quality degradation between a dirty sensor and a clean sensor. SSIM also gives a general score for the entire target or a cropped region of the target.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may use a particular pattern associated with the application-independent methodology used to validate a camera system under test where an obstruction may have been deposited on a lens of a camera. The particular pattern may be used in conjunction with an SSIM scale in the before and after judgment. The particular pattern may comprise a variety of textures and frequency of content that allows it to be applied to a different camera field of use, different camera distances, and becomes agnostic of the camera system set up compared to other approaches in performing optical tests. The particular pattern may be a spilled coins image, which is typically used to measure a texture sharpness. A spilled coins image is an image processing pattern that allows the evaluation of sharpness. It has a frequency of content pattern which allows it to judge that had a variety of extra detail levels. Other types of sharpness targets do not capture that as well.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate a novel linkage of applying a metric (e.g., SSIM) to a camera system under the introduction of an obstruction to the lens of a camera. The camera may be related to one of wide-field view cameras, stereo cameras, automotive cameras, backup cameras, color or monochrome cameras, autonomous vehicle cameras, or anything that utilizes an optical path.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate judging whether a processing circuitry of a vehicle would perceive an image captured by a camera of the vehicle to be what it is supposed to be when the camera is subjected to the obstruction. The testing and validation may be performed quickly and effortlessly independently from the judgment criteria that would have to be derived from some image quality standard metric or some image quality specification, for example, a sharpness test.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate the processing of an SSIM score over a plurality of samples to determine regions of worst SSIM performance of the camera system before and after applying a camera cleaning system to attempt to return the camera to its normal function by clearing the obstruction off of the camera lens. For example, regions with worst SSIM (e.g., worst performance) based on a comparison to a validation threshold are boxed such that it may be determined that one area of the camera lens is performing better than the boxed regions. A global SSIM may be determined based on capturing an image, down-sampling the image, taking SSIM scores of the down-sampled image, and repeating this process multiple times. The global SSIM may be measured by looking at the average of the changes in each individual pixel. The global SSIM enables the SSIM to be evaluated in a localized region of the image. This is effective at detecting small localized regions of obstructions (e.g., droplets, splats, or globs of material) that are very significant but would be removed from the global SSIM calculation. Downsampling can be achieved by taking a reference and distorted image signals as input, the system iteratively applies a low-pass filter and downsamples the filtered image by a factor of 2. This may be performed at the clean state, the dirty state, and the post-cleaning state. A captured image is down-sampled to remove noise resulting from factors such as distance, lighting, resolution, field-of-view, orientation, etc. After down-sampling, SSIM scores are taken of the various regions of the down-sampled image. This process may be repeated multiple times to minimize the effect of noise (e.g., obstruction). The global SSIM score may be determined based on averaging the SSIM scores associated with each down-sampled image. This global SSIM score has the benefit of being independent of setup, quality of the lighting, distance, resolution, field-of-view, orientation, or other camera dependent conditions. The down-sampling may be performed using software.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may impose a threshold to create the boxed regions associated with the worst SSIM scores. For example, any localized SSIM score that is greater than the threshold is associated with a lighter color on the a visual representation of the localized SSIM scores and any SSIM score that is lower than the threshold may be associated with a darker color on a visual representation of the localized SSIM score. Further, regions of darker colors that are connected may be represented by a box drawn around those regions when the connected regions are larger than a given size, for example, 10&#xd7;10 pixels. Taking 10&#xd7;10 pixels as an example, regions that are connected together but are smaller than 10&#xd7;10 pixels may be considered as insignificant imperfection. It should be understood that darker regions on the global SSIM score have worse SSIM scores than lighter regions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate that the system administrator may analyze the global SSIM score to determine regions that are boxed and are below the threshold to conclude that the corresponding region of the camera lens has not properly been cleaned using the camera cleaning system. This may also indicate that the cleaning system may need to be adjusted to address those regions in an attempt to restore the camera lens to its original operating state. This analysis may also indicate whether the camera cleaning system does not pass the operating threshold and may be considered to be defective. However, if the camera cleaning system was capable of addressing the boxed region by clearing the obstruction from those regions having a low SSIM score, then the camera cleaning system may be considered to pass the operating threshold and is adequate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The threshold above descriptions are for purposes of illustration and are not meant to be limiting. Numerous other examples, configurations, processes, etc., may exist, some of which are described in greater detail below. Example embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary vehicle <b>100</b> equipped with multiple cameras.

The vehicle <b>100</b> can use information obtained from the image processing to navigate around obstacles.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The driver-side mirror camera <b>120</b> may be used for capturing images of vehicles in an adjacent lane on the driver side of the vehicle <b>100</b> and the passenger-side mirror camera <b>125</b> may be used for capturing images of vehicles in adjacent lanes on the passenger side of the vehicle <b>100</b>. In an exemplary application, various images captured by the driver-side mirror camera <b>120</b>, the passenger-side mirror camera <b>125</b>, and the rear-facing camera <b>135</b> may be combined by the vehicle computer <b>105</b> and/or by the auxiliary operations computer <b>110</b> to produce a computer-generated image that provides a 360-degree field-of-coverage around the vehicle <b>100</b>. The computer-generated image may be displayed upon a display screen of the infotainment system <b>111</b> to assist the driver drive the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The various cameras provided in the vehicle <b>100</b> can be any of various types of cameras and can incorporate various types of technologies. For example, a night-vision camera having infra-red lighting and sensors may be used for capturing images in low light conditions. The low light conditions may be present, for example, when the vehicle <b>100</b> is parked at a spot during the night. The images captured by the night-vision camera may be used for security purposes such as for preventing vandalism or theft. A stereo camera may be used to capture images that provide depth information that may be useful for determining separation distance between the vehicle <b>100</b> and other vehicles when the vehicle <b>100</b> is in motion. In another application where minimal processing latency is desired, a pair of cameras may be configured for generating a high frame-rate video feed. The high frame-rate video feed may be generated by interlacing the video feeds of the two cameras. In yet another application, a camera system configured for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) applications may be used. LIDAR applications can include long-distance imaging and/or short distance imaging. Some camera systems may include power-saving features that may be useful for operations in certain environments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate the setup of a camera (e.g., cameras <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, or <b>135</b>) in a test environment which may be constrained in both its required setup as well as the environment it is in. Cameras (e.g., cameras <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, and <b>135</b>) may be subjected to obstructions before being introduced in real-world scenarios where the cameras need to operate at an optimal level to ensure quality images are being captured and processed with minimal errors. A camera (e.g., cameras <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, or <b>135</b>) may be interrupted from its normal function under the presence of an obstruction, which would alter the image quality captured by the camera. For example, obstructions may include debris, mud, rain, bugs, or other obstructions that hinder the normal operation of the camera. These obstructions may cause interference and alteration of the image quality of a camera. It is important to note that an obstruction can reduce the image quality in any combination of a uniform obstruction or a single or series of localized obstructions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may provide a mechanism to allow a pass or fail criteria to be judged on a camera (e.g., cameras <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, or <b>135</b>) under test in real-time during the testing and provides a target framework and a backend processing framework together because of the real-time application. A camera cleaning validation system may allow for a testing and validation environment that does not require having to tune the camera (e.g., cameras <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>130</b>, or <b>135</b>) for ideal lightning conditions, setup, distance, etc., which are typically required by camera tests. That is, there is no need to determine pixel sizes, determine a specific color palette, which is typically used to perform tests.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may facilitate a structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) to be used as the particular index. It should be noted that other options may also be used as the particular index based on the camera application. Other metrics or targets could be used instead of SSIM. For example, a sharpness or texture or signal-to-noise metric may be used instead of SSIM. An important aspect of the camera cleaning validation system is that it facilitates 1) comparing the clean (baseline) and post-clean (sample) images and 2) evaluating both global and localized performances. The SSIM may be a perceptual metric that quantifies image quality degradation caused by processing an image. SSIM may provide a measure of the perceptual difference between two images.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may use a particular pattern associated with the application-independent methodology used to validate a camera system under test where an obstruction may have been deposited on a lens of a camera. The particular pattern may be used in conjunction with an SSIM scale in the before and after judgment. The particular pattern may comprise a variety of textures and frequency of content that allows it to be applied to a different camera field of use, different camera distances, and becomes agnostic of the camera system set up compared to other approaches in performing optical tests. The particular pattern may be a spilled coins image, which is typically used to measure a texture sharpness. A spilled coins image is an image processing pattern that allows the evaluation of sharpness. It has a frequency of content pattern which allows it to judge that had a variety of extra detail levels. Other types of sharpness targets do not capture that as well.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is understood that the above descriptions are for purposes of illustration and are not meant to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative schematic diagram for testing and validation, in accordance with one or more example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a camera cleaning validation system <b>200</b> for verifying the status of a camera <b>202</b>.

Camera <b>202</b> or any other cameras discussed in the following figures may be any of the cameras depicted and discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The camera may include a variety of cameras such as wide-field view cameras, stereo cameras, backup cameras, color or monochrome cameras, autonomous vehicle cameras, or any camera that utilizes an optical path. The camera cleaning validation system <b>200</b> comprises the camera <b>202</b>, a power source <b>204</b>, and object <b>206</b>, a camera cleaning system <b>207</b>, and an obstruction source <b>208</b>. The camera <b>202</b> may be positioned in front of the object <b>206</b> to capture one or more images of the object <b>206</b> under normal conditions and other conditions. A normal condition may be considered a condition where noise, interference, or other image degrading conditions are not introduced to the camera <b>202</b>. Under its normal condition, the camera <b>202</b> captures an optical image as input data from the object. The captured input data may be raw data that is sent to a processing unit associated with the camera device to convert the optical image into processed signals. The camera <b>202</b> may be connected to a scoring module <b>210</b> that provides camera verification by making a judgment about the raw data to determine if the camera passes a validation threshold. The scoring module <b>210</b> may utilize a structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) as a scoring index. The SSIM scoring index may be a perceptual metric that quantifies image quality degradation caused by processing an image. SSIM may provide a measure of the perceptual difference between a before and after images. The camera <b>202</b> may capture a plurality of images of object <b>206</b> and uses the scoring module <b>210</b> to validate each image quality using SSIM. The scoring module <b>210</b> may record the values registered based on SSIM. In one or more embodiments, the object <b>206</b> may be a spilled coins image, which is typically used to measure a texture sharpness.

Based on that comparison the scoring module <b>210</b> may make a judgment to whether the normal function of the camera <b>202</b> has been disrupted based on the SSIM scores resulting from the camera <b>202</b> capturing images while being subjected to the obstruction introduced by the obstruction source <b>208</b>. For example, an image may be first captured by camera <b>202</b> under normal conditions (e.g., without influence from the obstruction source <b>208</b>), which may be referred to as a clean state. This image may be scored by the scoring module <b>210</b> using the SSIM scoring index to determine a baseline of SSIM scores in the clean state.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may capture an image using the camera <b>202</b> after an obstruction is applied to the camera lens using the obstruction source <b>208</b>. This state may be considered as a dirty state. The image may be associated with an obstruction level that has been introduced to the camera <b>202</b> using the obstruction source <b>208</b>. It may be important to capture the SSIM scores associated with the dirty lens before applying the camera cleaning system <b>207</b> in order to ensure consistency between tests. That is, having a consistent obstruction level introduced on the lens of camera <b>202</b> ensures the validation of a camera cleaning system <b>207</b> is consistent over a plurality of tests.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The camera cleaning system <b>207</b> may be applied after the camera cleaning validation system captures the image under the dirty state.

This normal condition, where a minimal to no amount of obstruction may be present, may represent a baseline to be used when comparing images captured of the spilled coins image <b>304</b> when camera <b>302</b> is subjected to an obstruction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the spilled coins image <b>304</b> may comprise a plurality of regions (e.g., regions <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, <b>305</b>, etc.), where each of these regions contains content that varies from another region. For example, images of region <b>301</b>, region <b>303</b>, and region <b>305</b> may result in respective baselines for each of those regions. After an image is captured with the camera <b>302</b>, a comparison between the baseline image and the captured image may result in a variety of SSIM scores associated with those regions. That is, region <b>301</b> may have a different SSIM score than region <b>303</b> and region <b>305</b>. In some embodiments, each of these SSIM scores may be compared to a validation threshold to determine a status of the camera <b>302</b>. For example, the scoring module <b>306</b> may generate SSIM scores for each of the regions <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>305</b> and then compare each of the respective SSIM scores to a validation threshold to determine whether any of these regions are below the validation threshold, which would indicate that the camera <b>302</b> may be judged to be in a failed state. For example, if a single region SSIM score is below the validation threshold (e.g., <b>0</b>.<b>9</b>), then it may be determined that the camera is in a failed state because there is no obstruction applied to the camera, yet it is showing SSIM scores lower than the validation threshold. In some other examples, it may be determined that a certain number of regions SSIM scores have to be below the validation threshold before determining that the camera has failed. Considering that FIG. <b>3</b>A represents the normal condition under which camera <b>302</b> is operating, the SSIM scores associated with the various regions of the spilled coins image <b>304</b> may be expected to be above the validation threshold. SSIM is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric. In other words, the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial image or distortion-free image as a reference. SSIM scores may be generated between the normal condition (clean state) of camera images and images taken after the camera <b>302</b> is subjected to an obstruction (e.g., a dirty state).

A global SSIM may be determined based on capturing an image, down-sampling the image, taking SSIM scores of the down-sampled image, and repeating this process multiple times. A captured image is down-sampled to remove noise resulting from factors such as distance, lighting, resolution, field-of-view, orientation, etc. After down-sampling, SSIM scores are taken of the various regions of the down-sampled image. This process may be repeated multiple times to minimize the effect of noise. The global SSIM score may be determined based on averaging the SSIM scores associated with each down-sampled image. This global SSIM score has the benefit of being independent of setup, quality of the lighting, distance, resolution, field-of-view, orientation, or other camera dependent conditions. Therefore, image <b>310</b> shows a resulting image taken of a spilled coins image after the lens of the camera has been subjected to an obstruction. Also, the resulting image is a result of the plurality of image down-sampling and capturing the SSIM scores at each iteration, which are then averaged to generate global SSIM scores of the various regions of the image <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one or more embodiments, a camera cleaning validation system may impose a threshold to create the boxed regions associated with the worst SSIM scores.

Taking 10&#xd7;10 pixels as an example, regions that are connected together but are smaller than 10&#xd7;10 pixels may be considered as insignificant imperfection.
