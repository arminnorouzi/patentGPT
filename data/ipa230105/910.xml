When it functions as it should, the blood is maintained in a fluid state in the vasculature, yet rapidly clots when the need to seal an injury arrives. In the 1960s, two groups proposed a model for clot formation that envisaged a sequential series of steps in which activation of one clotting (coagulation) factor led to the activation of another, finally leading to a clot formation. When these coagulation factors by sequential activation cause formation of the clot, the counterpart system, called fibrinolytic system, is further activated to become a cause of dissolution (lysis) of the clot. This fibrinolytic system comprises of anti-clotting proteins (plasminogen activator, plasminogen and plasmin), which following sequential activation leads to lysis of the clot (Selighson U et al.).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0015">The failure of hemostatic function due to coagulation factors deficiency causes impairment (or lack) in clot formation. Likewise, the result of an excessive fibrinolytic activity results in rapid and unwarranted dissolution of the formed clot. On the other hand, over stimulation of the coagulation cascade or inhibition of the fibrinolytic system would cause the formation of pathological clots. Thus, the outcome of the failure of each one of the above systems could be bleeding or increased coagulation tendency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0016">Replacement therapy is effective in treating bleeding disorders, however this treatment may not be sufficient. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) is frequently transfused to bleeding patients or patients with prolongation of coagulation tests under the assumption that it will improve hemostasis and will correct and/or prevent bleeding. The effect of FFP on coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) was examined in a prospective audit performed at Massachusetts General Hospital (Abdel-Wahab O I et al.). The data showed that transfusion of FFP in this setting failed to correct the PT in 99% of patients and in only 15% of patients was INR corrected by at least halfway to normal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0017">Similarly, Holland et al. reported that FFP failed to change INR over time. They hypothesized that failure of FFP to correct INR results from the dilution of the coagulation factors present in the infused FFP by recipient plasma.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0018">FFP contains all components (proteins) of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, thus being in theory suitable for the treatment of bleeding in patients with hereditary or acquired coagulation factor deficiencies. In addition, this product is supposed to prevent bleeding in subjects with coagulopathy before, during and after surgical procedures. However, since these plasma derived products contain in addition to coagulation factors fibrinolytic proteins, they have a potential to induce undesired lysis (dissolution) of the hemostatic clot formed during and following the replacement of coagulation factors of the product.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0019">U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,946 discloses methods for treating blood plasma or related products with fumed colloidal silica to remove fibrinogen without polymerization to fibrin, plasminogen and plasmin and other compounds but retain coagulation factor II. As being devoid of fibrinogen, the resulting product cannot support clot formation and as such, cannot be used for the treatment of bleeding and hemostatic disorders.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0020">U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,569, and its corresponding applications and patents disclose specific methods using a very particular resin for removal of only plasmin(ogen) from protein mixture/s. The resulting products were produced for the purpose of preparing plasmin(ogen) free fibrinogen for use as a biological glue. However, the resulting mixtures still contain tPA and as such, clearly exhibit fibrinolytic activity. More specifically, the tPA present in the product activated the plasminogen in the treated area, thereby leading to cleavage of the newly formed fibrin net. Plasminogen is normally present at high concentrations in the blood (about 2 &#x3bc;M), therefore, any blood leakage during any surgical intervention increases the plasminogen concentration in the extra vascular area. Furthermore, in case such glue is applied on the injured blood vessels during surgical intervention, the tPA present in the biological glue may contact the plasminogen present in the blood and by that, may activate the fibrinolytic cascade. Thus, the plasminogen-free products disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,569 may be used only for topical applications as a biological glue and are irrelevant for systemic use in transfusion or for treating bleeding associated with fibrinolytic or thrombolytic therapy. Thus, a long-felt need exists, specifically for product/s containing coagulation factors but at the same time missing fibrinolytic proteins that are suitable for transfusion and systemic use. This need, identified by the inventor, for a safe and efficient hemostatic product led the inventors to develop novel different products with a decreased fibrinolytic activity that are applicable for systemic as well as for topical uses.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0021">In a first aspect, the invention relates to a blood and/or blood-derived product that has a reduced fibrinolytic activity.

Thrombin activates factor XI that in turn activates other factors to generate more thrombin. Thrombin then further cleaves fibrinogen to form the preliminary fibrin clot, which is then stabilized into firm hemostatic clot by the cross-linked action of factor XIII. In response to vascular injury, the coagulation system is activated as above leading to, cross-linked fibrin deposition in tissues and blood vessels, thus compromising the flow of blood. Therefore, a further system is required that can appropriately dissolve the fibrin clot, thereby preventing further growth of the clot beyond the physiological need, and initiate clot lysis when the clot is not needed any more. This system is composed of the fibrinolytic proteins, which are then activated, converting fibrin to its soluble degradation products through the action of the serine protease, plasmin. Under physiologic conditions, fibrinolysis is precisely regulated by the measured participation of activators, inhibitors and cofactors.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">Plasminogen, the main component of the fibrinolytic system, is synthesized primarily in the liver. Cleavage (activation) of plasminogen at a single Arg-Val peptide bond at position 560-561, gives rise to the active serine protease, plasmin, which in turn dissolves fibrin clot. The cleavage of plasminogen is mediated by plasminogen activators.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">The main endogenous plasminogen activator is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Functionally, t-PA is itself a poor activator of plasminogen. However, in the presence of fibrin, the catalytic efficiency of tPA-dependent plasminogen activation increases by 500-fold. Surpassed plasmin activity also cleaves the coagulation factors and by that would prevent the formation of new clots.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">The second endogenous plasminogen activator is a single chain u-PA or prourokinase. u-PA has much lower affinity for fibrin than tPA. Although uPA is an effective plasminogen activator in the presence or the absence of fibrin, its plasminogen activation activity is significantly stimulated by fibrin. u-PA is expressed by several cells including activated endothelial cells, macrophages, renal epithelial cells, and some tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The fibrinolytic system is quite balanced by the action of activators (as detailed above) and inhibitors of fibrinolytic proteins. The main inhibitor of plasmin is &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>antiplasmin&#x2014;a single chain glycoprotein that is synthesized primarily in the liver and circulates in plasma at relatively high concentrations (2 &#x3bc;M). Plasmin released into flowing blood or in the vicinity of a clot is immediately neutralized upon forming an irreversible 1:1 stoichiometric complex with &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>antiplasmin.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">Among the inhibitors of plasminogen activators, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the most ubiquitous. It is released by endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, adipocytes, and platelets. PAI-1 is the most important and rapidly acting physiologic inhibitor of both tPA and u-PA.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI 2) is synthesized by human placenta. Significant levels of PAI 2 are found in human plasma primarily during pregnancy.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">Finally, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a plasma carboxypeptidase with specificity for carboxy-terminal arginine and lysine residues that acts as a potent inhibitor of fibrinolysis.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">Treatment of patients with various coagulation abnormalities is essential during spontaneous bleeding episodes, trauma and throughout surgical procedures. In most such situations blood/plasma-derived products (for example regular plasma or fresh frozen plasma&#x2014;FFP) are used. These products contain coagulation factors and fibrinolytic proteins, and therefore, supposed to stop bleeding and to correct the missing or impaired coagulation abnormality by inducing formation of a hemostatic clot. In general, a lack or abnormality of any coagulation factor may end up with bleeding tendency because of an insufficient ability to make a stable hemostatic clot. Without being bound by any theory, the inventors assumed that the presence of fibrinolytic proteins is responsible for lysis of the hemostatic clot may result in dissolution of the clot and aggravation of bleeding phenomena.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">Thus, once a hemostatic clot has been formed following the replacement of missing coagulation factor by blood/plasma-derived product/s available, the clot dissolution, if required, is accomplished by the fibrinolytic system. However, if dissolution of the clot is not desired and quite an opposite activity is needed, for example, to keep the hemostatic clot in situations of bleeding or to generate more blood clots, then a treatment with blood/plasma-derived products that consist the coagulation factors but are depleted in fibrinolytic factors is a desirable solution.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">This need for coagulation factors-containing but fibrinolytic factor-free products for the treatment or prevention of bleeding in congenital or acquired bleeding tendencies including coagulopathies, has been hypothesized for the first time by the inventors and stimulated them to develop blood and blood-derived product that may be tPA-deficient and/or devoid of plasminogen or plasmin activity, specifically, t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient products, in particular t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient blood, t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen deficient fresh plasma, t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient-FFP and t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient cryoprecipitate to fulfill a long-felt need for hemostatic fibrinolytic protein-free products. Specifically, the inventors hypothesize that the clot formation by the transfused coagulation factors also activates the fibrinolytic system and accelerates lysis of newly formed clots. Based on this, the current invention discloses that extracting t-PA and depleting or deactivating plasminogen from blood and plasma products prevents untoward fibrinolysis and enhances the efficacy of the products, as well as minimizes the amount given to a patient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">Thus, a blood and blood-derived product that may be tPA-deficient and/or devoid of plasminogen or plasmin activity, specifically, a t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient blood, and plasma product, that lack fibrinolytic activity are generated and in addition, these products are enriched in the endogenous plasmin inhibitor, &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>-anti-plasmin. These products will be suitable for treatment of active bleeding or for prevention of anticipated bleeding in patients with coagulopathies.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">The use of t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-free blood or plasma products decrease the activity of the endogenous fibrinolytic system, improve hemostasis in a bleeding patient, while the presence of &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin in the products and increase further the endogenous anti-fibrinolytic activity needed to stop or prevent the resolution of any hemostatic clots and by that prevent any life-threatening bleeding.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071">The new therapeutic strategies undertaken by the inventors may lead to the development of new products, which exhibit pro-coagulant and antifibrinolytic properties at the same time (as shown in Examples). These products of the invention are highly valuable and may substantiate new therapeutic strategy in situations associated with bleeding in which a formation of a clot resistant to fibrinolysis is desirable. As shown by the Examples, application of lysine or lysine analogs coated beads to the blood and blood derived products aiming to deplete t-PA and plasminogen, resulted in inhibition of fibrinolysis by these products as determined by clot lysis assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>) or by thromboelastography (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>). Specifically, the inhibition of fibrinolysis was observed with t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-depleted plasma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), t-PA and plasminogen-depleted cryoprecipitate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and t-PA and plasminogen depleted whole blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In addition, depletion of t-PA and plasminogen from whole blood resulted in a combined pro-coagulant quality of the product: an increased coagulation on one hand and a decreased fibrinolysis on the other hand, as demonstrated by TEG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>). Moreover, the product of the invention (t-PA and plasminogen-depleted plasma) significantly reduced the amount of bleeding in the murine tail-tip model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>). Finally, the product of the invention was compared to a commercially available plasminogen-deficient product i.e. EVICEL&#xae; and provides significant therapeutic advantages. The product of the invention was clearly shown as displaying increased stability of the clots even upon addition of plasminogen in the presence of thrombin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). This enhanced stability is attributed to the depletion of tPA from the blood product of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the commercial plasminogen removable gels used for the preparation of the EVICEL&#xae; product, could not bind tPA and thereby lack the ability of depleting tPA from blood or blood products. The resulting mixtures (EVICEL&#xae; product) still contain tPA and as such, can activate any plasminogen present in the treated area thereby exhibiting fibrinolytic activity. Thus, the plasminogen-free products disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,569 may be used only for topical applications as a biological glue and are irrelevant for systemic use in transfusion or for treating bleeding associated with fibrinolytic or thrombolytic therapy.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">Further comparative in vivo assay presented in Example 6, performed using a rat model for internal bleeding, revealed the clear advantage of the product/s of the invention over the commercial EVICEL&#xae; product, in significantly reducing the bleeding time, even in topical applications.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073">Thus, the first aspect of the present invention relates to a blood and blood-derived product that may be tPA-deficient and/or devoid of plasminogen or plasmin activity. It should be noted that the products of the invention comprise at least one coagulation factor and has decreased fibrinolytic activity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0074">As indicated herein, in some embodiments, the product of the invention is devoid of plasminogen and/or plasmin activity. Plasminogen, when activated to form the active plasmin enzyme, display proteolytic activity, specifically, cleavage or breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino acids. In this connection, the product of the invention is devoid of plasminogen or plasmin proteolytic activity. In some specific embodiments, the proteolytic activity of plasmin and plasminogen involves the cleavage of fibrin, thereby dissolving fibrin clots. It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;devoid of plasmin and plasminogen activity&#x201d; is meant that the product of the invention lacks or displays &#x201c;reduced&#x201d;, &#x201c;decreased&#x201d; &#x201c;moderated&#x201d;. &#x201c;inhibited&#x201d; or &#x201c;attenuation&#x201d; proteolytic activity of plasmin and plasminogen by any one of about 1% to 99.9%, specifically, about 1% to about 5%, about 5% to 10%, about 10% to 15%, about 15% to 20%, about 20% to 25%, about 25% to 30%, about 30% to 35%, about 35% to 40%, about 40% to 45%, about 45% to 50%, about 50% to 55%, about 55% to 60%, about 60% to 65%, about 65% to 70%, about 75% to 80%, about 80% to 85% about 85% to 90%, about 90% to 95%, about 95% to 99%, or about 99% to 99.9% or 100%, as compared to the proteolytic activity of active plasmin or plasminogen in a blood or blood product, specifically, untreated blood or blood product.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075">In some specific embodiments, the product of the invention may be a t-PA-deficient blood or blood-derived product.

In yet some specific embodiments, the product of the invention may be a t-PA-deficient and devoid of plasminogen and/or plasmin activity. In yet some further embodiments, the product of the invention may be a t-PA-deficient blood or blood-derived product. In some other specific embodiments, the product of the invention may be a plasminogen-deficient blood or blood-derived product. In yet some specific embodiments, the products provided by the invention may be t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient blood and blood-derived product/s that comprise at least one coagulation factor and display decreased fibrinolytic activity.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0076">As noted above, the product of the invention may be a tPA-deficient product. It should be appreciated that the term tPA used herein for the tissue plasminogen activator (also known as PLAT; enzyme entry EC 3.4.21.68) relates to a secreted serine protease that converts and activates the proenzyme plasminogen to a potent fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin. tPA is synthesized in vascular endothelial cells as a single polypeptide chain that undergoes proteolytic cleavage by plasmin or trypsin at a centrally located arginine-isoleucine bond, resulting in a 2-chain disulfide-linked form composed of the N-terminally derived heavy chain and the C-terminal light chain. The tPA gene (DNA acc. NT_167187.1 mapped to chr. 8p 11.21) contains 14 exons encoding the heavy chain domain including two kringle regions (K1 and K2) and regions homologous to growth factors and the light chain domain comprising the serine protease catalytic site. Alternative splicing of the tPA gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms taking part in multiple biological processes, apart from fibrinolysis, such as cell migration and tissue remodeling. Increased tPA activity causes hyperfibrinolysis manifested as excessive bleeding; decreased tPA activity leads to hypofibrinolysis which can result in thrombosis or embolism. tPA linked phenotypes include familial hyperfibrinolysis (due to increased tPA release) and familial thrombophilia (due to decreased tPA release (OMIM num. 612348).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0077">A &#x201c;tPA-deficient product&#x201d; or &#x201c;tPA-free product&#x201d; as used herein is meant that the products of the invention (that according to some embodiments, have been prepared by treating blood or blood products with a tPA- and/or plasminogen-binding agents), display a reduced, decreased, attenuated, amount of tPA normally present in about 100% to 50%, as compared to untreated blood or blood product. More specifically, at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%, of tPA is removed from the products of the invention, specifically when compared to untreated blood or blood products, or in some embodiments, as compared to the commercially available EVICEL&#xae; product (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In other words, the product of the invention may comprise tPA in an amount of about 0.01% to about 50% of the amount of tPA in other products or in untreated blood or blood products. Specifically, about 0.01% or less, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%. 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% or less, even 60% or 70% of the amount of tPA as compared to untreated blood or blood products.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">In yet some further embodiments, the product of the invention may be also plasminogen-deficient. Plasminogen, (also known as PLG, Enzyme entry EC:3.4.21.7), as used herein, is the main component of the fibrinolytic system and is synthesized primarily in the liver. Two major glycoforms of plasminogen are present in humans&#x2014;type I plasminogen that contains two glycosylation moieties (N-linked to N289 and O-linked to T346), whereas type II plasminogen contains only a single O-linked sugar (O-linked to T346). Type II plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type I glycoform. Conversely, type I plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots. In circulation, plasminogen adopts a closed, activation resistant conformation. Upon binding to clots, or to the cell surface, plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active plasmin by a variety of enzymes, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). More specifically, the cleavage (activation) of plasminogen at a single Arg-Val peptide bond at position 560-561, gives rise to the active serine protease, plasmin, which in turn dissolves fibrin clot.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">Full length plasminogen comprises seven domains. In addition to a C-terminal chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain, plasminogen contains an N-terminal Pan Apple domain (PAp) together with five Kringle domains (KR1-5). The Pan-Apple domain contains important determinants for maintaining plasminogen in the closed form, and the kringle domains are responsible for binding to lysine residues present in receptors and substrates.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">In some embodiments, the plasminogen referred to by the invention may be the human plasminogen. In such embodiments, the plasminogen gene (GenBank: AY192161.1 mapped to chr6q26) spans about 52.5 kb of DNA and contains 19 exons (OMIM num173350).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">A &#x201c;plasminogen-deficient product&#x201d; or &#x201c;plasminogen-free product&#x201d; as used herein is meant that the products of the invention (that according to some embodiments, have been prepared by treating blood or blood products with tPA- and/or plasminogen-binding agents), display a reduced, decreased, attenuated, amount of plasminogen in about 100% to 50%, as compared to untreated blood or blood product. More specifically, at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%, of plasminogen normally present in blood or blood products is removed from the products of the invention, specifically when compared to untreated blood or blood products.

Fibrinolytic activity, as used herein refers to the ability of some proteolytic enzymes in the blood and blood-derived products to dissolve the fibrin and blood clots. The major proteolytic enzyme cleaving fibrin is plasmin. When plasmin breaks down fibrin, fibrin degradation products (FDPs) are formed. FDPs compete with thrombin, and thus slow down clot formation by preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083">As indicated above, the blood products of the invention display reduced, or decreased fibrinolytic activity.

Cryoprecipitate is rich in Factor VIII, factor XIII, von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. Thus, this component is suitable for treatment or prevention of bleeding in hereditary or acquired conditions associated with lack or impairment of the above mentioned coagulation proteins. The data of the inventors as shown in Example 2, indicate that the conventional cryoprecipitate contains plasminogen that can be activated by plasminogen activators and thereby contribute to clot lysis exerting deleterious effect in the recipient.

Aphaeresis is done using a pheresis apparatus/machine, which is a semi-automated blood-separator instrument. In this procedure if plasma is planned to be used for a donation, the donor's anticoagulated whole blood is passed through an apparatus in which the blood is separated into red cells, plasma, and a leukocyte/platelet fractions, which are then returned to the subject. Only the separated plasma is not returned to the subject but is further used for donation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">Several semi-automated blood-cell-separator instruments are available for collection of platelets, granulocytes, blood stem cells, mononuclear cells, and plasma. All of these instruments use centrifugation to separate the blood components.

In more specific embodiments, the product/s of the invention may be further supplemented with exogenous fibrinogen.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0094">Fibrinogen (coagulation factor I) is the last protein of the coagulation cascade. It is cleaved by thrombin (factor IIa) to yield a primary unstable fibrin clot, which is further stabilized into firm and stable clot. Fibrinogen is a constant constituent of every blood derived product, and therefore in situations where a replacement therapy with fibrinogen is required these blood derived products are administered to provide fibrinogen. More specifically. Fibrinogen (factor I), as used herein, is a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 340 kDa and circulates in plasma as a precursor of fibrin. The native molecule is a homo-dimer, in which both subunits consist of three different polypeptide chains (A&#x3b1;, B&#x3b2;, and &#x3b3;). All three polypeptide chains of the subunits as well as the dimer are linked with disulfide bonds. The three pairs of polypeptide chains named A&#x3b1;, B&#x3b2;, and &#x3b3; are composed of 610, 461, and 411 amino acids, respectively. Fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver by the hepatocytes. The concentration of fibrinogen in the blood plasma is 200-400 mg/dL (normally measured using the Clauss method). Variety of Fibrinogen concentrates and products are currently commercially available, to name but a few, Haemocomplettan (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany), FIBRINOGENE T1 and Clottagen (LFB, Les Ulis, France), Fibrinogen HT (Benesis, Osaka, Japan) and FibroRAAS (Shangai RAAS, Shangai, China).

This product mimics the last step of the coagulation cascade through the cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin, leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. The fibrin clot consolidating and adhering to the application site acts as a fluid tightness agent able to hold tissues or materials in a required configuration and preventing leaks of components (tissue components, that may include parts of organs and the like) and blood, while evidencing hemostatic and healing properties.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0127">Usual components of commercial fibrin sealant products include coagulation factors such as: fibrinogen, factor XIII, thrombin, as well as fibrinolytic protein plasminogen. Interaction of the content of the biological glue with surrounding tissues that secrete plasminogen activators will then cleave plasminogen within the glue to plasmin, which in turn will degrade fibrin clot, thus favoring bleeding. Thus, the biological glue of the invention that may comprise tPA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient, specifically, t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient blood and blood-derived product/s exhibits reduced fibrinolytic activity, thereby acting as an effective glue/sealant.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0128">In yet some further embodiments, the biological glue of the invention may further comprise at least one inhibitor of at least one of plasmin, plasminogen and plasminogen activator. More specifically, the inhibitors may be inhibitors of fibrinolysis, such as &#x3b1;2-anti-plasmin, tPA-mutant, PAI-1, aprotinin and lysine analogs like tranexamic acid. In some particular embodiments, in addition to &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>-anti-plasmin, the biological glue of the invention may further comprise an effective amount of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (for example, 1.5-3.5 gram/liter). Alpha-1 Antitrypsin inhibits a wide range of proteases and by that protects tissues from degradation. Therefore, the tPA and plasminogen free blood, blood products, plasma or plasma products used by the biological glue of the invention may be further enriched with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0129">Alpha-1 Antitrypsin or &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily. It is generally known as serum trypsin inhibitor. Alpha 1-antitrypsin is also referred to as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) because it inhibits a wide variety of proteases. It protects tissues from enzymes of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil elastase, and has a reference range in blood of 1.5-3.5 gram/liter, but the concentration can rise many fold upon acute inflammation. In its absence (such as in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency), neutrophil elastase is free to break down elastin, which contributes to the elasticity of the lungs, resulting in respiratory complications such as emphysema, or such as emphysema, or such as emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults and cirrhosis in adults or children. Disorders of this protein include alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, an autosomal codominant hereditary disorder in which a deficiency of alpha 1-antitrypsin leads to a chronic uninhibited tissue breakdown. This causes the degradation especially of lung tissue, and eventually leads to characteristic manifestations of pulmonary emphysema. Evidence has shown that cigarette smoke can lead to oxidation of methionine 358 of &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (382 in the pre-processed form containing the 24 amino acid signal peptide), a residue essential for binding elastase; this is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms by which cigarette smoking (or second-hand smoke) can lead to emphysema. Because A1AT is expressed in the liver, certain mutations in the gene encoding the protein can cause misfolding and impaired secretion, which can lead to liver cirrhosis.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0130">Therefore, the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin in the plasminogen deficient plasma or biological glue should inhibit the proteases that could cleave biological glue. The presence of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin will be of particular relevance in areas of inflammation where proteases such as neutrophil elastase are released. Furthermore, in surgical interventions in the gastrointestinal tract (GI), the presence of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin in the biological glue or any other products of the invention may inhibit the proteases of the GI tract and by this may stabilize the biological glue and prevent the formation of post-operative GI fistulas. In addition, the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin together with a2-antiplasmin in the t-PA-free and plasminogen free plasma will make possible the treatment of recent and old GI and urinary tract fistulas.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0131">In contrast to other commercial preparations, the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-depleted plasma-derived fibrin sealant/glue of the invention has a significant advantage, because the removal of t-PA and plasminogen from the glue product prevents clot lysis, as disclosed in the present invention in Examples 1, 2 and 5 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.

Thus, in some embodiments, the biological glue of the invention may further comprise thrombin.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0135">Reptilase, an enzyme found in the venom of Bothrops snakes, has activity similar to thrombin. Reptilase differs from thrombin by releasing fibrinopeptide A, but not fibrinopeptide B, in its cleavage of fibrinogen. Thus, final product of reptilase cleavage is also a primary fibrin clot. In yet some further embodiments, the biological glue of the invention may further comprise reptilase.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0136">As have been already described herein, the outcome of the interaction of thrombin or any other fibrinogen cleaving enzyme with fibrinogen is an instant cleavage of fibrinogen and formation of primary fibrin clot.

Such patches comprising the biological glue of the invention constitute a delivery system for transdermal delivery of the composition of the invention contained within them.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0146">By a patch or adhesive patch herein is meant material adapted for adhesion to a subject's skin or mucosal tissue. Typically patches herein have a substantial degree of rigidity and, in use, comprise a backing layer exposed to the environment and a biological sealant/glue of the invention beneath the backing layer. However, the patches of the invention may also be of a non-rigid nature.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0147">As noted above, biological adhesives require a further contribution of exogenous thrombin enzyme. Additional components may be required to perform coagulation including the calcium ion, but also antibiotics or growth factors.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0148">Commercially available biological adhesives comprise most of the components cited above in dry form. However, the proteins activated by thrombin, such as fibrinogen and factor XIII must be isolated from thrombin because their association generates fibrin in a few seconds after reconstitution in liquid mixture.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0149">Consequently, biological glue kits may comprise at least two components, firstly, a lot based on the proteins activated by thrombin and on the other hand, a lot based on thrombin.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0150">Suitable devices for delivery of the biological glue may therefore enable reconstitution and mixing of the two lots, for example specific double syringes and needles or spray for direct application.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0151">For example, a suitable double-syringe may be composed by a mixer nosecone, topped by a blunt applicator needle, attached to the nozzle to facilitate mixing of the two syringe components. When the common plunger is depressed, the fibrin sealer solution and the thrombin solution are combined in the nosecone, in equal volumes, to form the resulting fibrin sealant that is directly applied to the designated tissues. It should be noted that for topical application of the biological glue/sealant of the invention any suitable applicator may be used, for example, the applicator described herein above or any modifications thereof.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0152">A further aspect of the invention relates to a method for the treatment, prophylaxis, amelioration, inhibition or delaying the onset of bleeding, hemostatic disorders and any bleeding or pathologic condition associated therewith.

Acquired bleeding disorders are disorders where bleeding is induced by an external (acquired) cause such as trauma, surgery or fibrinolytic treatment, as will be discussed herein after.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0163">Bleeding disorders caused by inherited deficiencies of one or more coagulation factors are rare disorders distributed worldwide. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for the mutant genes responsible for these defects exhibit bleeding manifestations that are of variable severity and usually related to the extent of the decreased activity of the particular coagulation factor.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0164">In yet further embodiments the methods of the invention are applicable for the treatment, prophylaxis, amelioration, inhibition or delaying the bleeding associated with hereditary hemostatic disorder and undefined bleeding tendency.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0165">&#x201c;Hereditary hemostatic disorder&#x201d; as used herein relates to a hereditary deficiency in at least one coagulation factor. More specifically, numerous mutations have been identified in genes encoding coagulation factors I, II, V, VII, X and XI, that lead to deficiency of at least one of said factors or to impaired activity thereof. Homozygotes for these mutations exhibit bleeding tendency either spontaneously or following trauma/surgery. Heterozygotes for the various deficiencies rarely display a bleeding tendency.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0166">Undefined tendency to bleed, as used herein, relates to a condition of bleeding tendency while a precise diagnosis of this condition cannot be established.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0167">Some patients referred for an evaluation of mild bleeding symptoms have an undiagnosed bleeding tendency that may not have been recognized until challenging event that induce bleeding such as surgery or childbirth occur. Clinical variability with regard to bleeding manifestations is common among such individuals, suggesting that environmental and other genetic factors may ameliorate bleeding risks. Although mild bleeding problems may not become evident until exposure to significant hemostatic challenges (such as surgery, dental extractions, major trauma, menarche or childbirth), the predictive risk of bleeding following surgery has not been established for these individuals. Gender has an influence on the manifestations of bleeding. Females are more commonly referred for evaluation because of troublesome bleeding with menses and/or childbirth. In addition, bleeding that persists or becomes problematic 24 hours or longer after dental extractions raises the possibility of a bleeding disorder. Failure to establish a diagnosis in a patient with mild mucocutaneous bleeding is a common problem in practice.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0168">Normal laboratory tests are a hallmark for diagnosis of the undefined bleeding tendency. Failure to establish the diagnosis can be problematic for patient who needs to undergo surgery or childbirth.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0169">For mild bleeding symptoms of patients with undefined bleeding disorders, fibrinolytic inhibitor therapy with &#x3f5;-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid may be used for dental and oral surgeries and it may reduce bleeding with other operative procedures. However, in case severe bleeding develops for example during surgery or childbirth, blood or blood-derived components are required.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0170">Thus, it should be appreciated that the method of treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding with the antifibrinolytic t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-depleted products of the invention may be particularly suitable for this group of patients.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0171">It should be appreciated that the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen deficient blood and blood-derived products and compositions of the invention, and methods described by the invention, may be applicable for any form of bleeding that accompanies hereditary hemostatic disorders caused by a deficiency in at least one of factor XI, factor X, factor V, factor VII, factor II (prothrombin) and factor I (fibrinogen) as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0172">In yet some further embodiments, the methods of the invention may be applicable for treating disorders characterized by hereditary deficiencies of the coagulation factors I, II, V, VII, X and XI that include at least one of or any bleeding tendency associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0173">Hereditary deficiencies of the coagulation factors I, II, V, VII, X and XI are autosomal recessive bleeding disorders that have been described in most populations. Their relative frequency varies among populations partly as a result of high frequencies of specific mutant genes in inbred populations. Several population surveys indicate that common among these bleeding disorders are factors XI and VII deficiency, less common disorders are factors V and X deficiency and afibrinogenemia, and the rarest disorders are factor II (prothrombin) and factor XIII deficiency. The severity of bleeding manifestations in affected patients who are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for a mutant gene is variable and usually related to the extent of the deficiency. Some patients have only mild bruising or display excessive bleeding only following trauma. Other patients, usually with less than 1 percent of normal factor VII, XIII, or X activity, can exhibit intracranial hemorrhages and hemarthroses similar to patients with severe hemophilias.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0174">In some specific embodiments, the method of the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating or inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary factor XI deficiency, or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from factor IX deficiency.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0175">Hereditary factor XI deficiency is transmitted as autosomal recessive trait. The disorder is exhibited in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes as a mild to moderate bleeding tendency that is mainly injury related. Affected subjects have been described in most populations but in Jews, particularly of Ashkenazi origin, the disorder is common.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0176">Factor XI deficiency as a result of a dysfunctional protein is rare and the majority of the patients have a decreased factor XI protein level. Altogether, above 150 mutations have been reported in non-Jewish and Jewish patients of various origins most of them being missense mutations.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0177">Most bleeding manifestations in homozygotes and compound heterozygotes are injury related. Excessive bleeding can occur at the time of injury or begin several hours or days following trauma. The bleeding tendency varies depending upon the hemostatic challenge and the variable sites of injury. Surgical procedures involving tissues with high fibrinolytic activity (urinary tract, tonsils, nose, tooth sockets) frequently are associated with excessive bleeding in patients with severe factor XI deficiency, irrespective of the genotype. Site-related bleeding tendency now can be understood in light of the demonstrated function of factor XI in preventing clot lysis. Factor XI deficiency by itself is associated with increased fibrinolysis, therefore, the additional bleeding risk of surgery at sites rich in fibrinolysis in these patients may increase the bleeding tendency even further.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0178">The treatment of bleeding patients with factor XI deficiency is by FFP. Patients with severe factor XI deficiency who must undergo a surgical procedure should be carefully evaluated and meticulously prepared for the operation. Use of an anti-fibrinolytic agent should be considered in patients undergoing operation at a site with high local fibrinolytic activity. Therefore, in some embodiments, the tPA and plasminogen-deficient FFP provided by the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with Factor XI deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0179">In other embodiments, the method of the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating, inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary factor VII deficiency, or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from factor VII deficiency.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0180">Hereditary deficiency of factor VII is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that has been observed in most populations. A presumptive diagnosis can be easily made because factor VII deficiency is the only coagulation disorder that produces a prolonged clotting time test prothrombin time (PT). Most mutations causing factor VII deficiency have been missense mutations.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0181">Bleeding manifestations occur in homozygotes and in compound heterozygotes for factor VII deficiency. Patients who have factor VII activity less than 1 percent of normal, frequently present a severe bleeding manifestation such as hemarthroses leading to severe arthropathy and life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0182">Patients with slightly higher levels of factor VII (factor VII activity of 5 percent of normal or more) have a much milder disease, characterized by epistaxis, gingival bleeding, menorrhagia, and easy bruising. Some surgical procedures such as dental extractions, tonsillectomy, and procedures involving the urogenital tracts frequently are accompanied by bleeding when no prior therapy is instituted prior to the procedure. In contrast, surgical procedures such as laparotomy, herniorrhaphy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy have been uneventful. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by different extents of local fibrinolysis exhibited by the respective traumatized tissues.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0183">Replacement therapy by FFP is essential in patients who present with severe hemorrhage, such as hemarthrosis or intracerebral bleeding. When surgery is required, the site of surgery should be considered, as dental extractions, tonsillectomy, nose surgery, and urologic interventions are likely to be associated with bleeding because of local fibrinolysis. Therefore, in some embodiments, the tPA and plasminogen-deficient FFP provided by the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with Factor VII deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0184">In yet further embodiments, the method of the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating, inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary factor X deficiency, or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from factor X deficiency.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0185">Hereditary factor X deficiency, a moderate to severe bleeding tendency, is an autosomal recessive disorder. The currently described 95 mutations that cause factor X deficiency include large deletions, small frameshift deletions, nonsense mutation, and missense mutations. The clinical manifestations of factor X deficiency are related to the functional levels of factor X. Individuals with severe factor X deficiency and functional factor X levels less than 1 percent of normal bleed spontaneously and following trauma. Bleeding occurs primarily into joints and soft tissues, however, bleeding from mucous membranes such as Menorrhagia may be especially problematic in women. More unusual bleedings are intracerebral hemorrhage, intramural intestinal bleeding (which can produce symptoms like those of an acute abdomen), urinary tract bleeding, and soft tissue bleeding with development of hemorrhagic pseudocysts or pseudotumors. In individuals with mild deficiencies of factor X bleeding is less common usually occurring only after trauma or during or after surgery. Fresh-frozen plasma is used to treat patients with factor X deficiency. Therefore, in some embodiments, the tPA and plasminogen-deficient FFP provided by the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with Factor X deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0186">In yet another embodiment, the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating, and inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary factor V deficiency, or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from factor V deficiency.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0187">Hereditary factor V deficiency is among the less common inherited bleeding disorders and manifests in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes as a moderate bleeding tendency. Factor V deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Heterozygotes, whose plasma factor V activity ranges between 25 and 60 percent of normal, usually are asymptomatic, Assays of factor V protein indicate that most homozygotes and compound heterozygotes have a true deficiency rather than a dysfunctional protein. Above 80 total distinct mutations have been identified, of which one quarter are missense, Homozygous or compound heterozygous patients whose factor V level ranges from less than 1 to 10 percent of normal exhibit a lifelong bleeding tendency. Common manifestations include ecchymosis, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hemorrhage following minor lacerations, and menorrhagia. Postpartum hemorrhage occurs in more than 50 percent of pregnancies in patients with severe factor V deficiency. Bleeding from other sites is less common. Trauma, dental extractions, and surgery confer a high risk of excessive bleeding. In case a severe spontaneous bleeding occurs, or surgery is performed, fresh-frozen plasma replacement should be given. When planning plasma replacement therapy it is important to consider surgical procedures at sites having high local fibrinolytic activity such as the urogenital tract, oral cavity, and nose, since surgery at these sites will result in excessive bleeding and postpartum hemorrhage is common. Therefore, in some embodiments, the tPA and plasminogen-deficient products provided by the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with Factor V deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0188">In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention may be particularly applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating, inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary factor II deficiency, or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from factor II deficiency.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0189">Inherited factor II (prothrombin) deficiency is one of the rarest coagulation factor deficiencies. It presents in two forms: type I, true deficiency (hypoprothrombinemia), and type II, in which dysfunctional prothrombin is produced (dysprothrombinemia). These autosomal recessive disorders are genetically heterogeneous and characterized by a mild to moderate bleeding tendency.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0190">Abnormalities of prothrombin are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Among individuals with type I deficiency, heterozygotes exhibit prothrombin levels that are approximately 50 percent of normal, whereas homozygotes display levels that typically are less than 10 percent of normal. Above fifty mutations that cause prothrombin deficiency have been identified, most of which are missense mutations.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0191">Inherited types I and II deficiencies are characterized by mild to moderate mucocutaneous and soft-tissue bleeding that usually correlates with the degree of functional prothrombin deficiency. With prothrombin levels of approximately 1 percent of normal, bleeding may occur spontaneously or following trauma. Surgical bleeding may be significant. Menorrhagia, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, easy bruising, and subcutaneous hematomas may occur.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0192">Replacement therapy in patients with inherited prothrombin deficiency consists of administration of FFP. Therefore, in some embodiments, the tPA and plasminogen-deficient FFP provided by the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with Factor II deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0193">In yet another embodiment, the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing attenuating, inhibiting bleeding associated with hereditary fibrinogen deficiency or any acquired bleeding or hemostatic condition in patients suffering from hereditary fibrinogen deficiency.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0194">&#x201c;Fibrinogen (factor I) deficiency&#x201d; as used herein relates to hereditary fibrinogen abnormalities comprises the afibrinogenemia (complete absence of the fibrinogen), dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia Inherited disorders of fibrinogen are rare and can be subdivided into type I and type II disorders. Type I disorders (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia) affect the quantity of fibrinogen in circulation. Type II disorders (dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia) affect the quality of circulating fibrinogen. Afibrinogenemia, the most severe form of fibrinogen deficiency, is characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance and the complete absence of fibrinogen in plasma.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0195">Dysfibrinogenemia is defined by the presence of normal levels of functionally abnormal plasma fibrinogen. Hypodysfibrinogenemia is defined by low levels of a dysfunctional protein. These are heterogeneous disorders caused by many different mutations in the three fibrinogen coding genes. Dysfibrinogenemias and hypodysfibrinogenemias are autosomal dominant disorders. Most affected patients are heterozygous for missense mutations in the coding region of one of the three fibrinogen genes. Because the secreted fibrinogen hexamer contains two copies of each of the three fibrinogen chains, and the resulting fibrin network contains multiple copies of the molecule, heterozygosity for one mutant allele is sufficient to impair the structure and function of the fibrin clot.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0196">Bleeding because of afibrinogenemia usually manifests in the neonatal period, with 85 percent of cases presenting umbilical cord bleeding, but a later age of onset is not unusual. Bleeding may occur in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, or the central nervous system with intracranial hemorrhage being the major cause of death. There is an intriguing susceptibility of spontaneous rupture of the spleen in afibrinogenemic patients. Menstruating women may experience menometrorrhagia. In addition, first trimester abortion is usual in afibrinogenemic women. These patients may also have antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage. Hemoperitoneum after rupture of the corpus luteum has also been observed.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0197">Replacement therapy with fibrinogen containing commercial products is the only option for treatment of patients with inherited fibrinogen deficiency. Therefore, in some embodiments, the methods the invention may be particularly relevant for treating patients with fibrinogen deficiency, specifically, any of the conditions discussed above. Particularly, in some embodiments where the product used by the invention is supplemented with fibrinogen.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0198">In contrast to the commercial preparations of blood-derived products used for the treatment of hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies, t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-depleted plasma-derived products of the invention have a substantial advantage, because in addition to providing the missing factor (pro-coagulant quality) the removal of t-PA and plasminogen from the products renders them antifibrinolytic qualities that are essential for preventing further clot lysis in case of bleeding.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0199">In some embodiments, the methods of the invention may be applicable for treating acquired hemostatic disorders. The acquired hemostatic disorder may be at least one of surgery-induced bleeding, trauma-induced bleeding, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding associated with burns, hemorrhagic stroke, lung injury associated with emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bleeding associated with childbirth, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and bleeding resulting from fibrinolytic or thrombolytic therapy.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0200">In some specific embodiments, the method of the invention may be applicable for treating, preventing, reducing, attenuating, and inhibiting bleeding associated with surgical procedures, specifically, minor or major surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0201">Surgical procedures are a great challenge to the hemostatic system, especially when surgery is performed at places rich in fibrinolytic proteins. Even patients with no or mild to moderate bleeding disorders can bleed excessively following surgery. In addition to the extent of the surgical trauma, the magnitude of the fibrinolytic activity at the surgical site must be considered.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0202">It should be understood that in cases the surgical procedures are elective, expected or not urgent (e.g., cesarean surgery, or any other major surgery that allow sufficient time for pre-operative preparations), the products of the invention may be used for pre-operative treatment to facilitate prevention or reduction of excessive bleeding during the surgical intervention. Thus, in some embodiments, the invention may provide a preventive method particularly useful for patients having hereditary disorders, patients suffering from hyperfibrinolysis and/or patients that are expected to be operated.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0203">In a further specific embodiment the method of the invention is suitable for treating trauma-induced bleeding (traumatic bleeding).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0204">Traumatic bleeding can be caused by any type of injury, for example any injury caused by, work and car accidents, combats or falls. There are different types of traumatic wounds which may cause bleeding. In general, trauma causes damage to blood vessels that in turn causes blood to flow externally outside the body or internally into body organs such as brain, lung, liver, kidney, spleen or into body cavities, such as thorax and abdomen.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0205">Beside the physical measures to stop the bleeding, blood and blood-derived components are usually administered in order to initiate blood clotting, which will eventually result in a cessation of bleeding.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0206">The tPA and plasminogen deficient blood and blood-derived products of the invention display an advantage over the commercial blood-derived products, because they provide an additional antifibrinolytic quality, which will prevent dissolution of a formed clot that might be essential for rapid cessation of bleeding.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0207">In some specific embodiments the blood-derived products of the invention comprising t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient blood, t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient plasma, t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient FFP and t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient plasma derived glue/sealant supplemented or not with exogenous fibrinogen, as well as methods of using them, may be suitable for treatment of acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0208">&#x201c;Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding&#x201d;, also known as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, as used herein, relates to all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. &#x201c;Acute gastrointestinal bleeding&#x201d; means that there is a significant blood loss over a short time causing acute blood loss and hemorrhagic shock. Symptoms may include vomiting (hematemesis) either red blood or black blood (due to digested blood also called &#x201c;coffee ground&#x201d;), bloody stool, or black stool (digested blood called melena). In contrast, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding is bleeding of small amounts of blood over a long time. In this case the symptoms are of iron-deficiency anemia.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0209">GI bleeding is typically divided into two main types: upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Causes of upper GI bleeds include: peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices, that may occur in some embodiments, due to liver cirrhosis and cancer, among others. Causes of lower GI bleeds include: hemorrhoids, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. Endoscopy of the lower and upper gastrointestinal track may locate the area of bleeding. Medical imaging may be useful in cases that are not clear.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0210">Acute upper GI bleed is more common than lower GI bleed. An upper GI bleed occurs in 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year. A lower GI bleed is estimated to occur in 20 to 30 per 100,000 per year. It results in about 300,000 hospital admissions a year in the United States. Risk of death from a GI bleed is between 5% and 30%. Risk of bleeding is more common in males and increases with age.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0211">The most common source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is peptic ulcer. Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50-60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an <i>H. pylori </i>infection. Other causes include gastric or duodenal ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia. A number of medications are found to cause upper GI bleeds: NSAIDs. COX-2 inhibitors, SSRIs, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0212">Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is typically from the colon, rectum or anus. Common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding include hemorrhoids, cancer, angiodysplasia, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and aortoenteric fistula.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0213">The initial focus of the treatment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding is on resuscitation, beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using intravenous fluids and blood.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0214">Colonoscopy is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0215">The findings of the inventors that the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient products of the invention have a decreased fibrinolytic activity (Examples), are highly valuable, and may be utilized for treating acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Specifically, parenteral administration of t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient blood and t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP of the invention to a patient presented with acute gastrointestinal bleed may provide an additional benefit by more rapid cessation of bleeding due to the ability of these products to prevent dissolution of formed clots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-C</figref>). In addition, in case there is a clinical indication to use biological glue to stop local bleed in a patient with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the implementation of the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient blood or plasma derived glue/sealant of the invention may provide an additional hemostatic value in stopping rapidly the bleed, due to its antifibrinolytic quality.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0216">In other particular embodiments, the products and methods of the invention may be suitable for treatment of burns, and specifically, bleeding associated with burns.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0217">A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Among women in many areas of the world the risk is related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0218">Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0219">Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0220">Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal (heat-related), chemical, electrical, and radiation. In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%). Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%), and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1-2% resulting from a suicide attempt. These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%. At temperatures greater than 44&#xb0; C. (111&#xb0; F.), proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down. This results in cell and tissue damage. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0221">In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss, making the blood more concentrated. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in renal failure and stomach ulcers.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0222">Blood transfusions when required are recommended when the hemoglobin level falls below 6-8 g/dL. Plasma is administered as a colloid volume expander fluid.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0223">Thus, when there is an indication to use blood or plasma and related products for the treatment of burns in a subject in need thereof. Thus, the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient blood or t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient plasma products of the invention are a more appropriate alternative to the conventional blood products and therefore, in some embodiments may be used for treating subjects affected by any burn as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0224">In yet further embodiments the products of the invention and methods provided by the invention may be applicable for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke or any other brain injury or trauma.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0225">&#x201c;Hemorrhagic stroke&#x201d; as used herein, relates to bleeding occurring directly into the brain parenchyma. The usual mechanism is thought to be leakage from small intracerebral arteries damaged by chronic hypertension. Patients with intracerebral bleeds are more likely than those with ischemic stroke to have headache, altered mental status, seizures, nausea and vomiting, and/or marked hypertension. Even so, none of these findings reliably distinguishes between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Specific symptoms may stem from focal neurologic deficits. The type of deficit depends on the area of brain involved. If the dominant (usually the left) hemisphere is involved, a syndrome consisting of the following may result: right hemiparesis, right hemisensory loss, left gaze preference, right visual field cut and aphasia. If the nondominant (usually the right) hemisphere is involved, a syndrome consisting of the following may result: left hemiparesis, left hemisensory loss, right gaze preference and left visual field cut.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0226">Brain imaging is a crucial step in the evaluation of suspected hemorrhagic stroke and must be obtained on an emergent basis. Brain imaging aids diagnosing hemordiage, and it may identify complications such as intraventricular hemorrhage, brain edema, or hydrocephalus. Either noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0227">In case the treatment with blood products is indicated for hemorrhagic stroke, blood, FFP and platelets obtained from a blood bank are used. Taking into account the prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic quality of the t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient blood products of the invention (Examples), it seems that they are more appropriate cessation of bleeding in a patient suffering from hemorrhagic stroke than the conventional blood products.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0228">In some specific embodiments, the methods of the invention may be suitable for treating lung injury associated with emphysema and COPD. In more specific embodiments, the method of the invention may comprise the step of administering to the treated subject a therapeutically effective amount of t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP. In some specific embodiments, t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FP or t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP of the invention, due to its enrichment in alpha-1 antitrypsin, makes its use more appropriate for the treatment of a subject with emphysema and COPD. In these diseases leukocyte proteases break down the elasticity of the lungs resulting in lung fuller and consequent development of lung emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, alpha-1 antitrypsin within the t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP of the invention may inhibit the activity of leukocyte proteases and by this means restore the elasticity if the lung tissue.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0229">Emphysema is a form of chronic (long-term) lung disease. People with emphysema have difficulty breathing from a limitation in blowing air out. There are multiple causes of emphysema, but smoking is by far the most common.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0230">Emphysema is one of the main types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It's called &#x201c;obstructive&#x201d; because people with emphysema exhale as if something were obstructing the flow of air. The other form of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which can also be caused by smoking.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0231">Emphysema results when the delicate linings of the air sacs in the lungs become damaged beyond repair. Most commonly, the toxins in cigarette smoke create the damage. The lung changes of emphysema evolve slowly over years as the fragile tissues between air sacs are destroyed and air pockets in the lungs develop. Air becomes trapped in these spaces of damaged lung tissue. The lungs slowly enlarge and breathing requires more effort.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0232">This problem of emphysema is called airflow limitation. During lung function testing, it takes someone with emphysema far longer to empty their lungs than it does a person without emphysema.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0233">Besides smoking, the other major known cause of emphysema is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. However, this is a minor cause compared to smoking. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a natural protein circulating in human blood. Its main function is to keep white blood cells from damaging normal tissues. Thus, treatment of a subject with emphysema with t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FP or t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP enriched in alpha-1 antitrypsin may inhibit the activity of proteases and thereby restore the elasticity to the lung tissue.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0234">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long term poor airflow. The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD typically worsens over time. Eventually walking upstairs or carrying things will be difficult. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD. The term &#x201c;chronic bronchitis&#x201d; is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0235">COPD is a type of obstructive lung disease in which chronic incompletely reversible poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets known as bullae that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0236">Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0237">The most common symptoms of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for a prolonged period of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms that may or may not occur with COPD.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0238">Advanced COPD leads to high pressure on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart and right hear failure. This situation is referred to as cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0239">Consequently, the t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-deficient FP or t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-deficient FFP of the invention may be beneficial as a complementary treatment of COPD, since its enrichment in alpha-1 antiplasmin may inhibit leukocyte's proteases and thereby repair the elastic quality to the damaged lung tissue.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0240">In certain specific embodiments, the method of the invention may be suitable for treating, preventing, reducing, attenuating, and inhibiting bleeding associated with major surgery. Major surgery is defined as any surgical procedure that involves anesthesia or respiratory assistance. In case of bleeding during major surgery the treatment includes replacement of missing or non-functional coagulation factors by commercial FP, FFP or cryoprecipitate. However, this may not be sufficient since the presence of tPA and plasminogen within the above products can mediate the fibrinolytic activity at the site of injury of surgery and thereby promote the dissolution of clot formed to stop or prevent the bleeding. Therefore, administration of the t-PA and plasminogen-deficient products of the invention that display significantly reduced fibrinolytic activity, is a better and more efficient therapeutic option that the commercial products, since in addition to supplementation of coagulation factors by the products of the invention their antifibrinolytic activity (as demonstrated by the Examples), may decrease or prevent bleeding contributed by the clot lysis induced by fibrinolytic proteins that are present in commercial products.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0241">In particular embodiments the methods of the invention are applicable for open heart surgery. Some surgical procedures can be anticipated to cause severe bleeding, such as open heart surgery. In these operations extracorporeal circulation (cardiopulmonary bypass&#x2014;CPB) is used.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0242">Cardiovascular (open heart) surgery is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. Frequently, it is done to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, coronary artery bypass grafting), correct congenital heart disease, or treat valvular heart disease from various causes including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0243">During open-heart surgery, the heart is temporarily stopped. Patients undergoing an open-heart surgery are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, meaning a machine which pumps their blood and oxygen for them. A machine will never function the same as a normal heart and lungs, therefore, similar to many surgical procedures, the time on this machine is kept to a minimum. This artificial method provides a bypass, to overcome temporarily a patient's needs with regard to the function of the heart and lungs.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0244">The bleeding phenomena that occur in these operations are due to the anticoagulation used during the surgery, which, deliberately induces coagulation deficiency. In addition, platelet dysfunction that stems from the passing of the blood through an extracorporeal circulation contributes to the tendency to bleed.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0245">It should be realized that the methods of the invention may be particularly applicable for subjects undergoing open heart surgery by CPB. The products, compositions and methods of the invention may impart dual beneficial effect to these patients as follows:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0246">1. During the open-heart surgery, blood will flow through a tube added to the heart-lung machine (CPB machine), while the tube is coated with tranexamic acid to deplete t-PA and/or plasminogen from the blood (as detailed in Experimental Procedures). The pump will direct the blood flow from the CPB machine to the patient. While flowing through this tube, the blood depleted in t-PA and plasminogen is returned to patient's circulation. By this way the returned blood is poor in fibrinolytic activity and enriched in antifibrinolytic activity, thereby providing protection from bleeding tendency.</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0247">2. In case bleeding occurs due to the above-mentioned reasons, the patient may then be treated to stop bleeding with t-PA-deficient and plasminogen-depleted blood or blood-derived products of the invention, which are expected to be more potent in cessation of bleeding due to their antifibrinolytic qualities (as also demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0237" num="0248">In further embodiments the methods of the invention are suitable for implementation in treatment of bleeding associated with liver transplantation surgery.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0249">The liver plays a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Liver parenchymal cells are the site of synthesis of most coagulation factors, the physiologic inhibitors of coagulation, and essential components of the fibrinolytic system. The liver also regulates hemostasis and fibrinolysis by clearing activated coagulation factors and enzyme inhibitor complexes from the circulation. Therefore, when liver dysfunction occurs in patients with liver disease, a complicated hemostatic derangement ensues, which can lead to bleeding.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0250">During the first stage of liver transplantation, the removal of the diseased liver, (the anhepatic stage), significant hemostatic changes can occur. Because activated clotting factors are not removed from the circulation, their consumption can develop together with consumption of platelets and secondary hyperfibrinolysis. Moreover, primary hyperfibrinolysis also occurs as a result of defective clearance of tPA. The most severe hemostatic changes during liver transplantation occur after reperfusion of the donor liver. Platelets are trapped in the graft, giving rise to an aggravation of thrombocytopenia and causing damage to the graft by induction of endothelial cell apoptosis. Release of tissue factor and tPA from the reperfused graft further causes fibrinolysis. Thus, hyperfibrinolysis is thought to contribute significantly to impaired hemostasis during the anhepatic and reperfusion phases. Moreover, the graft releases heparin-like substances that can inhibit coagulation. In addition, other factors such as hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, and hemodilution adversely affect hemostasis during this phase. Liver transplantation is a lengthy procedure with extensive surgical wound surfaces including potential transaction of collateral veins. Improved surgical techniques and anesthesiologic care have led to a remarkable reduction of blood loss during liver transplantation. When uncontrolled bleeding occurs, packed red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma can be transfused. Use of synthetic antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid (a lysine analogue) and aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) is a common practice.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0251">Thus it should be appreciated that the products of the invention, compositions, and methods described by the invention, owing to their antifibrinolytic qualities may be particularly applicable for cessation of bleeding associated with hyperfibrinolytic state induced by liver transplantation surgery.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0252">It should be appreciated that the methods of the invention may be applicable for any surgery involving any organ or tissue transplantation, for example, liver, kidney, lung, heart, pancreas, skin, blood vessels and the like.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0253">In yet another embodiment, the products of the invention may be applicable for treating bleeding induced by fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0254">Fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy is mostly administered in patients with acute myocardial infarction (acute coronary artery thrombosis) or in patients with acute stroke (acute cerebral arterial thrombosis). The goal of fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy is rapid restoration of blood flow in an occluded vessel achieved by accelerating fibrinolytic proteolysis of the thrombus. Fibrinolytic therapy typically results in fibrinolytic state because plasminogen activation is not limited to the thrombus. These effects are complex and include a reduction in fibrinogen level, increase in fibrinogen degradation products, and decreases in coagulation factors. The complication of fibrinolytic therapy is bleeding. Bleeding complications are more frequent with fibrinolytic than with anticoagulant therapy and require rapid diagnosis and management. Two problems contribute to excess bleeding. First, the fibrinolytic effect is not limited to the site of thrombosis but is usually systemic. Therefore, any hemostatic plugs needed to prevent bleeding at sites of vascular injury caused either by catheters needed for treatment or within pathologic lesions in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, or elsewhere are also susceptible to dissolution. The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage which occurs in approximately 1% of patients and is associated with a high mortality and serious disability in survivors. The most common bleeding complications are related to invasive vascular procedures such as placement of arterial and venous catheters. Some bleeding at these sites is frequent and should not be a reason for interrupting therapy if it can be managed with local pressure or other simple measures. The problem can be minimized by limiting venous and arterial punctures and by early institution of local measures. Major bleeding may also result from preexisting lesions such as gastrointestinal ulcers or genitourinary lesions.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0255">Treatment of bleeding complications following fibrinolysis/thrombolysis involves measures directed to the local site as well as correction of the systemic hypocoagulable state includes replacement therapy to correct the hemostatic defect caused by systemic plasminemia. Fibrinogen replacement is often needed and can be accomplished by administration of cryoprecipitate, and fresh-frozen plasma can be used to replace other hemostatic proteins.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0256">It should be noted that fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy, involves the use of anti-coagulants or anti-coagulating agents. As used herein, the term &#x201c;anticoagulant agent&#x201d; is intended to mean any agent which interferes with the clotting of blood. Some anticoagulants, such as the coumarin derivatives bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) and warfarin (Coumadin) inhibit synthesis of prothrombin, a clot-forming substance, and other clotting factors. Anticoagulants can include but are not limited to compounds acting as beta2 Adrenoreceptor Antagonists, Neuropeptide V2 Antagonists, prostacyclin analogs, thromboxane synthase inhibitors, calcium agonists, coumarin derivatives, elastase inhibitors, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories thrombin inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors, Factor VIIa inhibitors, Factor Xa inhibitors, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, Heparins, and fibrinogen glucoprotein IIb/IIIa Antagonists.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0257">Coumarins are vitamin K antagonists. A prominent member of this class is warfarin (Coumadin). These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and to prevent emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Other examples are acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, atromentin, and phenindione.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0258">Heparin is a biological substance, usually made from pig intestines. It works by activating antithrombin III, which blocks thrombin from clotting blood. Low molecular weight heparin, a more highly processed product, is useful as it does not require monitoring of the APTT coagulation parameter and has fewer side effects as for example Enoxaparin (Clexane).</p><p id="p-0248" num="0259">Fondaparinux is a synthetic sugar composed of the five sugars (pentasaccharide) in heparin that bind to antithrombin and is an inhibitor of factor Xa. It is a smaller molecule than low molecular weight heparin. Another example is Idraparinux sodium which has a similar chemical structure and method of action as fondaparinux.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0260">Drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0261">Further examples include but are not limited to betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, and more recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and eribaxaban (PD0348292) from Pfizer.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0262">Another type of anticoagulant is the direct thrombin inhibitor. Current members of this class include but are not limited to the bivalent drugs hirudin, lepirudin, and bivalirudin; and the monovalent drugs argatroban and dabigatran.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0263">The antithrombin protein itself is used as a protein therapeutic anticoagulant agent that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly (for example, Atryn, which is produced in the milk of genetically modified goats).</p><p id="p-0253" num="0264">As indicated above, anti-coagulants administration for example, heparin, is the standard antithrombotic therapy indicated for acute venous thrombosis, for prophylaxis of thrombosis in the post-surgical (especially orthopedic) and immobile patient, and for flushing of intravenous lines to maintain patency. However, due to their potency, heparin and LMWH suffer drawbacks. Uncontrolled bleeding as a result of the simple stresses of motion and accompanying contacts with physical objects or at surgical sites is the major complication. In addition, approximately 5% (range up to 30%) of patients treated with heparin, and about 2% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH), develop immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (HIT) which may be complicated by either bleeding (as a consequence of decreased platelet count) or by arterial and venous thrombosis due to intravascular platelet clumping. The products and methods of the invention may prevent such undesired effects of these anti-coagulating agents.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0265">It should be further recognized that the method of treatment with the products and compositions of the invention, due to their antifibrinolytic effects (Examples 2 and 3), is particularly applicable for treating the bleeding manifestations induced by thrombolytic/fibrinolytic therapy. As have been already described herein, depletion of the fibrinolytic protein/s, tPA and plasminogen, from the products and compositions of the invention renders them an additional advantage over the commercial blood-derived products (FFP, cryoprecipitate) since they endow with additional antifibrinolytic qualities, and thereby provide further protection against dissolution of the clots.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0266">In yet some further specific embodiments, the invention provides methods applicable for treating, prevention, prophylaxis amelioration, inhibition of any bleeding associated with DIC. More specifically. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathological process characterized by the widespread activation of the clotting cascade that results in the formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. This leads to compromised tissue blood flow and can ultimately lead to multiple organ damage. In addition, as the coagulation process consumes clotting factors and platelets, normal clotting is disrupted and severe bleeding can occur from various sites.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0267">In yet some further embodiments, the invention provides methods applicable for treating, prevention, prophylaxis amelioration, inhibition of any bleeding associated with childbirth or pregnancies, for example, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Postpartum bleeding or postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is often defined as the loss of more than 500 ml or 1,000 ml of blood within the first 24 hours following childbirth. Signs and symptoms may initially include: an increased heart rate, feeling faint upon standing, and an increased breath rate. The condition can occur up to six weeks following delivery. The most common cause is poor contraction of the uterus following childbirth, the fact that not all of the placenta was delivered, a tear of the uterus, or poor blood clotting.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0268">Causes of postpartum hemorrhage are uterine atony, trauma, retained placenta, and coagulopathy, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;four Ts&#x201d;:</p><p id="p-0258" num="0269">Tone: uterine atony is the inability of the uterus to contract and may lead to continuous bleeding.

The method is used for therapeutic or donation purposes. More specifically, the method may be used to obtain autologous tPA and/or plasminogen free blood or blood product, or alternatively, tPA and/or plasminogen free blood or blood product for allogeneic use in a recipient. Anti-coagulated blood is shifted from the circulation passing through a shunt system outside the body while the shunt system is connected to a gradient separating container. Blood cells are separated from the plasma by centrifugation within the container, and the blood cells beside platelets are returned to the circulation, while the plasma and platelets are treated by flowing through a tube coated with tranexamic acid to deplete plasminogen or through container that contains magnetic beads coated with tranexamic acid. In case of container that contains magnetic beads coated with tranexamic acid, the beads are extracted by submitting the container to magnetic field or using a filter that prevents their incorporation to the circulating plasma. The plasma flow continues, where the beads are extracted. The t-PA-deficient and/or plasminogen-depleted plasma and platelets are then kept for autologous or allogeneic donation. In some embodiments, the whole blood is passing without separation through a tube coated with tranexamic acid or through container that contains magnetic beads or any other matrix coated with tranexamic acid to deplete the tPA and/or plasminogen and then the plasminogen depleted blood is returned to the circulation. To increase the efficacy of the depleting systems, in case of coated tubes or magnetic beads, the tPA and/or plasminogen can be removed periodically from the tranexamic acid-coated tube or magnetic beads by washing with saline containing soluble tranexamic acid. By that, the systems will be regenerated and will be able to deplete more plasminogen.

In brief, 2 mm of the tail tip of anesthetized mice was amputated. Before the amputation the tails were immersed in saline at 37&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. The amputated tails were immersed in Eppendorf tubes containing 500 &#x3bc;l of human FFP treated or untreated with magnetic beads coated with 1/10 volume/volume of 9 FFP and 1 coated bead of each one of the following amino acids: lysine, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6AHA), tranexamic acid or alanine. At the end of the 30 min, the Eppendorf tubes were collected. For dissolution of the blood clots formed in the FFP, tPA was added (100 nM) for 60 min at 37&#xb0; C.

Hence, the inventors employed an affinity-based approach for depletion of plasminogen and t-PA from plasma products (whole blood, FFP and cryoprecipitate) to produce blood products with an inhibited and markedly reduced fibrinolytic activity. TXA, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, is capable of binding plasminogen molecules with high affinity and prevent their activation. Using a cross-linking approach, the inventors have demonstrated the generation TXA-conjugated magnetic beads as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0459"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates that plasma treated with magnetic beads carrying lysine or its analogs 6AHA or TXA is resistant to fibrinolysis. The data also show that the obtained antifibrinolytic effect is specific to lysine-mediated depletion of plasminogen and t-PA, since alanine-treated plasma failed to exhibit an inhibition of fibrinolysis. Furthermore, the data also indicate that TXA is significantly more potent in depleting the plasminogen from the plasma than lysine or 6AHA.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0460">In line with these findings pretreating of another human blood product, cryoprecipitate, with magnetic beads coated with lysine analogs (TXA) resulted in inhibition of fibrinolysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0450" num="0461">The data presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also indicate that clots formed from untreated or alanine-treated cryoprecipitate can be easily dissolved by externally added tPA indicating that these clots are prone to fibrinolysis.

Thromboelastography is performed in whole blood and assesses the viscoelastic property of clot formation under low shear condition. Thromboelastography provides clot formation and clot lysis variables that are different in clinical situation, and therefore could be used for diagnosis and treatment of bleeding disorders. Thus, the inventors have used this method to unambiguously show that a depleting of plasminogen and t-PA from human blood by pretreating it with magnetic beads coated with lysine or tranexamic acid resulted in inhibition of clot lysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0454" num="0465">In contrast, lysis of clots prepared from untreated human blood is not inhibited.

However, replacing coagulation factors by FFP may not be sufficient to stop bleeding owing to the presence of fibrinolytic activity in FFP.

This finding excludes the possibility that dilution of coagulation factors is responsible for the excessive bleeding and suggests that FFP pro-coagulant effect is not sufficient to stop bleeding, probably due to its counteracting fibrinolytic activity. To prove the concept that a fibrinolytic activity present in FFP is responsible for the insufficient cessation of bleeding the amputated tails were immersed in FFP previously treated with magnetic beads coated with either lysine (Lys), 6-Aminohexanoic-Acid (6AHA), tranexamic acid (TXA) or alanine (Ala). The results as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, clearly indicate that only FFP depleted in plasminogen and t-PA by treatment with magnetic beads coated with lysine, 6AHA or TXA significantly reduced the amount of bleeding as compared to untreated or alanine-treated FFP.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 4</heading><p id="p-0461" num="0472">Transfusion of Mouse with t-PA and Plasminogen-Depleted Plasma Reduces Excessive Bleeding</p><p id="p-0462" num="0473">Plasma was collected form C57 black mice, following the plasma was transferred through TXA-coated magnetic beads.
