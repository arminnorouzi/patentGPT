Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mobile communication system is made up of the terminal and the base station. A position of a terminal is typically estimated based on a signal transmitted from the terminal. A typical method of estimating a position of a terminal is to use a delay value taken for a signal transmitted by the terminal to reach a base station. Further, a distance between a terminal and a base station may be estimated based on an amount of propagation attenuation occurring on a channel on which a signal transmitted by the terminal reaches the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other words, in the typical mobile communication system, a position of a terminal is estimated based on delay or propagation attenuation on a wireless channel of a signal that is transmitted by the terminal and then received by a base station, or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a drawback of such a method is that it is not easy to estimate a position of a terminal accurately due to a long distance between base stations. In mobile communication systems, a distance between base stations is usually around 1-3 km in urban and suburban areas, and around 10 km or more in rural or mountainous areas.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In most situations, a limitation of such a typical method of estimating a terminal position is that the number of base stations for detecting a signal transmitted by the terminal is not large. In a situation where a terminal is present in a handover-enabled area, a position of the terminal can be measured more accurately based on signals received by two or more base stations; however, this scenario is available to only some limited terminals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in a situation where an obstacle such as a building is present between a terminal and a base station, propagation delay and attenuation in such a situation may be much greater than those in a situation where such an obstacle is not present; thus, the accuracy of estimating a position of the terminal may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to these problems, in most cases, the accuracy of estimating a position of a terminal using such a typical method is around several hundred meters.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with

Herein, it should be noted that any ID temporarily assigned to a terminal in one base station or cell may be used for the same purpose or function as the RNTI.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, when a report on a missing person (or a person in distress) is received, the base station <b>120</b> of an associated mobile communication network assigns one RNTI to the missing person, and provides the RNTI information to at least one positioning device <b>130</b>. The positioning device <b>130</b> which received the RNTI information detects an uplink signal from a terminal <b>110</b> transmitting the uplink signal using the corresponding RNTI, and then estimates a position of the terminal <b>110</b> based on the detected signal. To do this, the base station may directly transmit the RNTI information to the positioning device, or in another embodiment, the base station may transmit the RNTI information to a communication server using a target terminal information server, and then the communication server may transmit the RNTI information to the positioning device. In another embodiment, an RNTI to be used for measurement may be defined in advance between a base station of a mobile communication network and a positioning device. In this embodiment, the base station may assign the predefined RNTI to a target terminal, and the positioning device may detect and measure a signal from the target terminal using the RNTI. Further, multiple RNTIs may be defined in advance between a mobile communication network and a positioning device. In this embodiment, information on which RNTI of the multiple RNTIs is assigned may be provided to a target terminal with bits less than the RNTI. For example, when the RNTI is configured with 16 bits, and 8 RNTIs can be assigned to a target terminal, information on which RNTI of these 8 RNTIs is used may be provided to the positioning device with information of 3 bits.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment, when the positioning device receives RNTI information of the target terminal <b>110</b> required to be located, or after the positioning device has received the RNTI information, the base station <b>120</b> may provide approximate position information on the target terminal <b>110</b>. An attempt to locate the target terminal may be performed in a situation where one or more positioning devices <b>130</b> are placed around the target terminal <b>110</b> based on such information. The positioning device <b>130</b> of the present disclosure may attempt to detect an uplink signal transmitted by the target terminal <b>110</b> required to be located based on an assigned RNTI. The positioning device <b>130</b> obtains resource assignment information of the target terminal by receiving resource assignment information of downlink based on the RNTI, and based on this, detects and measures an uplink signal of the target terminal.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The positioning device <b>130</b> of the present disclosure is required to acquire time synchronization in uplink in order to receive a signal of the target terminal <b>110</b> that is transmitted through uplink. To acquire time synchronization on an uplink transmission time, each positioning device <b>130</b> may include a downlink signal receiver. That is, based on time information of an associated system acquired by receiving a downlink signal, time synchronization can be obtained of allowing the target terminal <b>110</b> to transmit a signal through a reverse direction channel. When needed in this process, the downlink signal receiver included in the positioning device <b>130</b> may receive system information transmitted by the base station <b>120</b>, for example, information on a broadcasting control channel (BCH) or a dynamic BCH, or the like, and thereby obtain overall parameters, or the like for the system.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">At this time, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a method is provided of allowing the positioning device <b>130</b> to obtain information on when the target terminal <b>110</b> transmits a signal through uplink.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one embodiment, the positioning device <b>130</b> may receive a control signal via one or more downlink signal receivers, and based on the received control information and identification information of a target terminal, may obtain resource assignment information for an uplink signal of the target terminal. Specifically, the positioning device <b>130</b> may receive a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), which is a downlink control channel, using the downlink signal receiver, and obtain information on whether an uplink signal is transmitted and information on a transmitted resource. What is different from the operation of a typical LTE receiver is that the LTE downlink signal receiver according to embodiments of the present disclosure receives control information transmitted to one or more other user(s). That is, the LTE downlink signal receiver herein receives control information transmitted to another terminal (a target terminal) other than control information transmitted to the positioning device itself. The positioning device <b>130</b> can obtain information on an uplink resource assigned to the target terminal <b>110</b> based on the received target-user-related control information. Further, in this process, in order to obtain additionally information on resource assignment of uplink, the positioning device of the present disclosure may receive not only a control channel in the forward direction additionally transmitted to the target terminal <b>110</b>, but information on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmitted by being assigned to the control channel.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">when the base station <b>120</b> transmits such information on an uplink transmission resource to a target terminal, in order to reduce complexity of a terminal for receiving the PDCCH or PDSCH, any limitation may be put on a type in which the base station <b>120</b> transmits signal. In this case, the positioning device <b>130</b> may receive transmission type information on a downlink signal from the base station, receive a downlink signal through one or more downlink signal receivers using the transmission type information on the downlink signal, and obtain control information by processing the received downlink signal.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, in the case of the PDCCH, all control-channel element (CCE) aggregations of level 1, level 2, level 4, and level 8 are available. However, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to reduce the complexity of control in the positioning device <b>130</b>, a base station may transmit a PDCCH to a terminal through the CCE aggregation of only level 8. In another example, the base station may transmit a PDCCH to a terminal through the CCE aggregation of level 8 or level 4. By putting a limitation on a CCE aggregation level, when one positioning device measures positions of multiple target terminals, it is possible to reduce greatly the complexity for blind decoding of the PDCCH. Further, when a base station assigns an uplink resource of a target terminal, for allowing a positioning device to measure a position of the target terminal, through a PDSCH, it is possible to reduce complexity of a positioning device by putting a limitation on a transmission mode. For example, when a base station assigns an uplink resource to a target terminal through a PDSCH for allowing an associated positioning device to measure a position of the target terminal, a transmission mode may be limited to a diversity transmission mode. As a result, since the positioning device can use only a predefined transmission mode without implementing all possible transmission modes in downlink, the complexity of the positioning device may be greatly reduced.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Through the above process, the positioning device <b>130</b> may obtain information on a time point at which the target terminal <b>110</b> transmits a signal through uplink and an associated resource.

At this time, information on a signal of the target terminal provided from each positioning device <b>130</b> may include one or more of RNTI information of the target terminal (or ID information of the terminal), information on a reception time of an uplink signal, reception power information, and the like. Here, the information on the reception time of the uplink signal denotes information on a reception time relative to an absolute time determined based on GPS, or the like, and shared with all positioning devices <b>130</b>. That is, it denotes a relative reception time based on a time point according to information on one common time shared between all positioning devices. In addition to the measurement information, by allowing the positioning device <b>130</b> to transmit time information obtained by measuring a signal of the target terminal <b>110</b>, real-time position tracking may be enabled. A time in which an uplink signal is propagated from the target terminal to the positioning device may be calculated based on the information on the reception time. In particular, as multiple positioning devices each obtains information on a reception time or one positioning device obtains information on reception times at two or more positions, information on a propagation delay time can be obtained based on the obtained information, and a distance between the target terminal and the positioning device can be calculated based on this.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The position measurement system according to embodiments of the present disclosure may include the position measurement server <b>140</b>.

Further, by transmitting, to the position measurement server, information on a time at which a signal of the target terminal is received, the positioning device may provide information on when the measurement has been performed.

In another example, a number that is defined in advance between the position measurement server and the positioning device and that is assigned to one target terminal may be used as the ID of the target terminal. The position measurement server <b>140</b> can calculate a position of the target terminal based on information such as triangulation and propagation attenuation obtained based on measurement information transmitted by positioning devices, and transmit the resulted position information to the positioning devices. As a position measurement method used in these embodiments, various typical techniques that have been used in many studies may be applicable, and herein, a positioning device and an associated operating environment are provided for allowing such position measurement to be performed.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, a position measurement server <b>140</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure may further receive, from a base station <b>120</b>, information on a reception time and reception power of an uplink signal of a target terminal <b>110</b> which is received by the base station <b>120</b>, and calculate a position of the target terminal <b>110</b> by combining information on a reception time and reception power of the uplink signal of the target terminal <b>110</b> from a positioning device <b>130</b> and the information on the reception time and the reception power of the uplink signal of the target terminal <b>110</b> from the base station <b>120</b>.

When measuring a position of the target terminal using one positioning device, the positioning device may transmit information on the measurement results performed at multiple positions to a position measurement server, and the position measurement server may measure the position of the target terminal based on this. In another example, without transmitting information on the measurement results to the position measurement server, the one positioning device itself may measure a position of the target terminal based on the results from the measurement. However, in this embodiment, since it takes a long time to measure at multiple positions and the accuracy of the measurement is not high when the target terminal is moving, a position of the target terminal may be measured by using several positioning devices. When a position of the target terminal is measured using one positioning device, the position of the target terminal can be measured based on measurements for a recent Tm time.

Embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed based on the LTE system; however, may be easily applied to other wireless communication systems. That is, in a case where a communication system in which a call of a target terminal is established is a GSM or W-CDMA system, the downlink signal receiver <b>710</b> and the uplink signal receiver <b>720</b> are implemented as a downlink signal receiver and an uplink signal receiver of GSM or W-CDMA system, respectively.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The LTE downlink signal receiver captures an LTE downlink signal in an initialization stage and acquires time synchronization to the system, and obtains a base station ID, system information, and the like.

However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example, time synchronization may be established between other types of positioning devices, or any method capable of identifying a difference in arriving times may be used. In an example, time synchronization may be maintained using synchronization established in advance between positioning devices by using a high-precision clock, or in a case where time synchronization may be established such that a relative difference can be calculated, such synchronization can be applied. Further, a position measurement can be performed based on a time difference between a time at which the LTE downlink signal receiver receives a specific signal and a time at which another user, such as another LTE downlink signal receiver or another positioning device, receives an uplink signal.

The information on a position of the target terminal obtained by using such a typical position measurement system may be information on a cell in which a target terminal is placed in a mobile communication network. Further, the information on a position of a target terminal obtained by using a typical position measurement system may be information that the target terminal is placed within a certain radius from a specific position obtained by additionally using WiFi, or the like.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, after identifying an approximate position of a target terminal by using one of typical position measurement systems that can be used for measuring a position of a target terminal, it is possible to identify a precise position of the target terminal based on that information. For example, an approximate position of a target terminal may be identified by identifying a position of a terminal of a missing person or a person in distress by using a typical position measurement system. Based on this, one or more positioning devices of the present disclosure may be placed around the approximate position of the target terminal.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thereafter, in order to measure a position of the target terminal accurately, one of the positioning devices requests an associated mobile communication system to establish a link between the target terminal and an associated base station. In another embodiment, a person who wants to find the target terminal may directly request such a link establishment from a position measurement server. An associated mobile communication network establishes the link between the target terminal and the base station, and transmits associated configuration information to one or more positioning devices of the present disclosure. The configuration information may include information on a frequency used for the link established between the target terminal and the base station, a time used for multiple access or spreading code information, and a transmission format of a corresponding channel. Based on the information, one or more positioning devices of the present disclosure can detect and measure a signal transmitted by the target terminal. The information may be directly transmitted from the mobile communication network to the positioning device. In another example, the information may be transmitted to a communication server, and then the communication server may transfer it to the positioning device. In another embodiment, the position measurement server of the present disclosure may serve as the communication server.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">A request for a link establishment between the base station and the target terminal may be also performed by allowing a positioning device of the present disclosure to perform the request directly to the mobile communication system. In another embodiment, such a request may be transmitted to a position measurement server, and then the position measurement server may transfer the request to an associated mobile communication network. Thereafter, the position measurement server may provide information on a link received from the mobile communication network to one or more positioning devices.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In this process, one of the positioning devices adjacent to the target terminal may become a master, and a request for setting for establishing a link, termination of the link, or the like may be transmitted by the master positioning device. Further, in another embodiment, all of the positioning devices may be allowed to have an equal authority and perform a request for setting for establishing a link, termination of the link, or the like.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Operations according to such embodiments will be described based on LTE systems. A base station of the LTE system may establish various reverse direction channels for enabling a target terminal to transmit an uplink signal, and allow one or more positioning devices to detect and measure based on the signal. In this process, one of important considerations is to enable a target terminal to transmit a wideband signal. This is because the transmission of the wideband signal enables a time delay up to reaching one or more positioning devices to be calculated more accurately, and based on this, each positioning device to calculate a propagation delay of the signal accurately. Further, the wideband signal has an advantage of enabling a target terminal to transmit a signal with large transmission power, and enabling the signal to be detected from a long distance.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The target terminal may transmit a signal by configuring a sounding reference signal (SRS), a PUSCH, or the like of the LTE system with such a wideband signal.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The SRS is a signal transmitted by a terminal with a wideband without data as a usage of a channel measurement, or the like, and a base station may configure a target terminal to transmit the SRS periodically. Further, a base station of a mobile communication network provides information on a transmission parameter of the SRS, a transmission period, a time offset, and the like to one or more positioning devices. The positioning device obtaining the SRS transmission related information detects and measures a signal of the target terminal based on the obtained transmission information of the target terminal.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In another example, a PUSCH may be configured with a wideband to transmit a signal. That is, the PUSCH is configured with a wideband, and a signal may be transmitted through the PUSCH. The base station allows the target terminal to transmit a PUSCH with a wideband, and based on this, enables one or more positioning devices to measure a signal of the target terminal. A method of configuring this can be performed such that the base station configures the target terminal to transmit a PUSCH through a PDCCH in each time at which a transmission is needed. In another configuration method, the base station may configure the target terminal to transmit a PUSCH periodically through persistent scheduling. The configuration of transmitting a PUSCH through a PDCCH in each time at which a transmission is needed may be performed such that one or more positioning devices are allowed to obtain resource assignment information of the PUSCH through examples of operations of one or more positioning devices as described above. In one example, the base station of the mobile communication network may provide one or more positioning devices with information on transmission parameters, such as a bandwidth of a PUSCH, MCS, and the like, a transmission period, a transmission time offset, and the like, which are configured through the persistent scheduling. In this process, the base station may directly transmit the information to the positioning device. Alternatively, the base station may transmit the information to a communication server, and then the communication server transfers it to the positioning device.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In another channel configuration method, the target terminal may be configured to transmit a PUCCH. Since the PUCCH is a relative narrowband signal, therefore, it is possible to configure the PUCCH to be transmitted more frequently. The mobile communication network may configure the target terminal to transmit a PUCCH periodically, and configure the positioning device to measure a signal from the target terminal based on information related to the transmission of the PUCCH. In particular, due to a channel establishment through the PUCCH transmitted relatively more frequently, this method has an advantage that the positioning device can calculate an average of reception power more accurately. In the case of configuring the target terminal to transmit a PUCCH, the base station of the mobile communication network may transmit configuration information of the PUCCH to one or more positioning devices of the present disclosure. The configuration information may include information on a using band, a PUCCH transmission format, a using code, a transmission period, a transmission time offset, and the like.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In another channel configuration method, the target terminal may transmit a signal through a PRACH, which is a random access channel, and one or more positioning devices may measure the signal. In the case of a typical PRACH, since a terminal randomly selects and transmits a code of a preamble, it is difficult for a positioning device to detect it. Accordingly, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a base station of a mobile communication network may designate a code of a PRACH to be transmitted by a target terminal, and therefore enable the target terminal to transmit a PRACH using the designated code. The positioning device detects and measures the PRACH transmitted using the designated code. The base station of a mobile communication network may provide one or more positioning devices with information related to the transmission of the PRACH by the target terminal, such as a code of the PRACH, a transmission time, a transmission band, and the like.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the above embodiments based on the LTE, cases in which only one channel is established have been discussed. However, in order to detect and measure a position of a target terminal more accurately, it is possible to configure one or more positioning devices to detect a signal of a target terminal through an establishment of two or more different channels. For example, it is possible to configure an SRS and a PUSCH to be transmitted together or simultaneously. In another example, a PUCCH and a PUSCH may be configured to be transmitted together or simultaneously, or a PUCCH or an SRS may be configured to be transmitted together or simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">As such, when two or more channels are configured for signals transmitted by a target terminal, respective transmission periods or transmission frequencies of two or more channels are needed to be configured differently. Further, respective bandwidths of two or more channels are needed to be configured differently. For example, a channel transmitted by a target terminal relatively more frequently may be configured for a narrowband signal, and a channel transmitted by the target terminal relatively less frequently may be configured for a wideband signal. Information on these channel configurations may be provided from the base station of the mobile communication network to one or more positioning devices. Further, the positioning device can obtain the configuration information on the channels, and based on this, detect or/and measure an uplink signal from the target terminal.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an embodiment of such a transmission. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a target terminal is configured to transmit two different channels. That is, the target terminal can transmit a wideband signal relatively less frequently and a narrowband signal relatively more frequently. A PUCCH may be configured as the narrowband signal. Further, a PUSCH or an SRS may be used as the wideband signal. One or more positioning devices perform an operation of detecting signals from the target terminal using two different channels.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Operations of one or more positioning devices of the present disclosure based on the configuration of two different channels will be discussed for with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.

The positioning device detects and measures an uplink signal from the target terminal based on the information on the channel configuration. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, by detecting a narrowband signal first, the positioning device identifies that the target terminal is placed around the positioning device. In case the detection of the narrowband signal is successfully performed, thereafter, the positioning device more accurately measures a signal from the target terminal based on a wideband signal. In this process, when such measuring operation is performed based on both the narrowband signal and the wideband signal at the same time, the positioning device may obtain more accurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Operations of one or more positioning devices according to another embodiment of the present disclosure based on the configuration of two different channels will be discussed for with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

In case the detection of the wideband signal is successfully performed, thereafter, the positioning device more accurately measures a signal from the target terminal based on a narrowband signal. The narrowband signal that can be transmitted relatively more frequently may be used for measuring average power of signals received from the target terminal. In this process, when such measuring operation is performed based on both the narrowband signal and the wideband signal at the same time, the positioning device may obtain more accurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">If the target terminal transmits uplink signals continually, power consumption of the target terminal may be excessively increased. Further, uplink resources of an associated mobile communication system may be excessively used. To address these issues, a base station may configure the target terminal to transmit uplink signals intermittently. That is, it is possible to configure the target terminal to transmit specific uplink signals during a certain period, and configure the target terminal to stop transmitting the specific uplink signals during another period. Thereafter, it is possible to configure the target terminal to transmit the uplink signals again. By obtaining such intermittent channel configuration information, the positioning device performs operations of detecting and/or measuring uplink signals from the target terminal in a period in which the target terminal transmits signals. The intermittent channel configuration information may be received from a base station of an associated mobile communication network. In another example, the base station transmits the information to a communication server, and then the communication server may transmit it to the positioning device.

During a T<b>2</b> time subsequent to the T<b>1</b> time, the target terminal is configured to stop transmitting the uplink signals. Further, when the T<b>2</b> time elapses, the target terminal is configured to transmit one or more uplink signals again. The base station of an associated mobile communication network transmits such intermittent uplink transmission configuration information of the target terminal to one or more positioning devices. By receiving the intermittent channel configuration information, the positioning device performs operations of detecting and/or measuring one or more uplink signals from the target terminal in a time period in which the target terminal transmits one or more signals.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Methods of allowing the base station of the mobile communication network to transmit the information to the positioning device may be performed in various embodiments. In one embodiment, the base station may provide one or more positioning devices with information on a time offset at which the target terminal starts to transmit an uplink signal, information on a time period T<b>1</b> for transmitting uplink signals and a time period T<b>2</b> for stopping transmitting the uplink signals, and the like. In another embodiment, the base station may transmit a message at each time at which the target terminal starts or stops a transmission of an uplink signal to one or more positioning devices, in order to provide information on the start, stop and restart of the transmission of the uplink signal of the target terminal to one or more positioning devices. In this case, respective lengths of an uplink signal transmission time and an uplink signal stopping time of the target terminal may be adjusted. In another embodiment, once the target terminal starts to transmit an uplink signal, the base station may provide only information on the T<b>1</b> time in which signals are allowed to be transmitted and information on the fact that a signal transmission is started to one or more positioning devices. In this case, when the target terminal stops transmitting signals, since a separate message is not required to be transmitted, there is an advantage that a quantity of messages is reduced.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Operations according to such embodiments will be described based on a GSM or W-CDMA system. In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, methods and apparatuses are provided for allowing one or more positioning devices to obtain channel configuration information on a link between a target terminal and a base station, and based on this, detect and measure an uplink signal from the target terminal. This may be performed such that a base station of an associated mobile communication network directly transmits information to one or more positioning devices, or alternatively, the mobile communication network transmits the information to a communication server and then the communication server transmits it to one or more positioning devices.

In this case, the base station of the associated mobile communication network may provide information of the extent of when an associated channel is established and how long the channel is established to one or more positioning devices. Further, the base station of the associated mobile communication network may provide information on whether a signal of the predefined configuration is transmitted, or a transmission thereof is stopped, to one or more positioning devices. Further, in the case of measuring positions of multiple target terminals, multiple channel configuration parameters may be defined in advance, and ID information for identifying these parameters may be provided to one or more positioning devices. In this process, the base station of the mobile communication network may directly transmit the information to one or more positioning devices. Alternatively, the mobile communication network transmits the information to a communication server, and then the communication server transmits it to one or more positioning devices.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">One or more positioning devices of the present disclosure can measure a signal from the target terminal based on channel information of the target terminal transmitted by the mobile communication system. In this process, one or more positioning devices may attempt to receive a downlink channel transmitted to the target terminal. Based on this, it is possible to identify that a channel established between the target terminal and the base station is desirably formed. For example, it is possible to determine whether an uplink channel is transmitted based on the presence or absence of a channel transmitted to the target terminal in the downlink. Further, approximate uplink time synchronization information may be obtained based on a reception time of a downlink channel.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Operations according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described based on a GSM communication system. The GSM system uses time division multiple access technology in which a signal is transmitted based on resources divided in time.
