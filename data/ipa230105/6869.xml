It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that other examples may be employed apart from these specific details. In some instances, detailed descriptions of well-known methods, nodes, interfaces, circuits, and devices are omitted so as not obscure the description with unnecessary detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions described may be implemented in one or more nodes using hardware circuitry (e.g., analog and/or discrete logic gates interconnected to perform a specialized function, ASICs, PLAs, etc.) and/or using software programs and data in conjunction with one or more digital microprocessors or general purpose computers. Nodes that communicate using the air interface also have suitable radio communications circuitry. Moreover, where appropriate the technology can additionally be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer-readable memory, such as solid-state memory, magnetic disk, or optical disk containing an appropriate set of computer instructions that would cause a processor to carry out the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Manchester coding may be applied to data symbols of a Wake-Up Packet (WUP). That is, a data symbol comprising a logical &#x201c;0&#x201d; is encoded as &#x201c;10&#x201d; and a data symbol comprising a logical &#x201c;1&#x201d; as &#x201c;01&#x201d;. Therefore, for example, using On-Off Keying (OOK), every data symbol comprises an &#x201c;ON&#x201d; part (where there is energy transmitted) and an &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; part, where there is no energy transmitted. The order of the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; and &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; parts indicates whether the symbol is a logical &#x201c;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d;. In addition, in some examples, the signals during an &#x201c;ON&#x201d; period of the WUP may be generated by means of an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), as this functionality already be available in some transmitters, such as for example Wi-Fi transmitters supporting 802.11a, g, n and/or ac. An example IFFT has 64 points and operates at a sampling rate of 20 MHz, and just as for ordinary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), a cyclic prefix (CP) is added after the IFFT operation in order to keep the OFDM symbol duration used in 802.11a/g/n/ac. An example approach for generating the OOK signal is to use the 13 sub-carriers in the center, and then populating these with signals to represent ON periods and to not transmit anything at all during OFF periods. This may be referred to as multicarrier OOK (MC-OOK). The same OFDM symbol may be used to generate MC-OOK. In other words, the same frequency domain symbol is used to populate each of the non-zero subcarriers for all data symbols. Using the same OFDM symbol to generate the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; part of every Manchester coded data symbol may have some advantages. For example, it allows coherent reception of the MC-OOK.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Devices such as access points may possess several transmit antennas. Hence a transmit diversity scheme may be desirable to avoid unintentional destructive interference in any particular spatial direction. At least some embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods to generate signals such as multi-antenna MC-OOK signals, which may comprise wake-up packets (WUPs). In some examples, the OFDM symbol used to generate the ON part of each (e.g. Manchester coded) data symbol is antenna specific. That is, different OFDM symbols are transmitted through different antennas. In some examples, these antenna specific OFDM symbols may be generated by choosing the frequency domain symbols corresponding to any given subcarrier from different entries in a column (or row) of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix, or for example by rotating or phase shifting a frequency domain symbol by entries in a column (or row) of the DFT matrix for signals transmitted on a subcarrier from multiple antennas. In some examples, when the number of non-zero subcarriers exceeds the number of transmit antennas, a column (or row) of the DFT matrix can be used repeatedly. In some examples, columns (or rows) are used the same number of times. In some examples, therefore, where rows (or columns) of a DFT matrix are used, orthogonal beams may be generated, one beam per subcarrier, which in turn may result in an even spatial distribution of the transmitted energy of the signals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart of an example of a method <b>200</b> of transmitting signals. The method may in some examples be implemented, and hence the signals transmitted, by a device such as an access point (AP). The method <b>200</b> comprises, in step <b>202</b>, transmitting a first multi-carrier on-off keyed (MC-OOK) signal comprising a plurality of on periods and a plurality of off periods. Transmitting the first signal in each on period comprises, for each subcarrier of a plurality of subcarriers, in step <b>204</b>, transmitting, from each antenna of a plurality of antennas, a frequency domain symbol associated with that subcarrier phase shifted by a respective factor of a set of factors associated with that subcarrier, wherein the set of factors associated with that subcarrier is different from the set of factors associated with at least one other subcarrier of the plurality of subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other words, for example, the respective set of factors applied to at least two subcarriers is different. As a result, for example, the interference pattern produced by transmitting signals from the antennas is different for at least two of the subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of subcarriers that are transmitted from four antennas of an example device. Subcarriers <b>302</b> are transmitted from a first antenna, subcarriers <b>304</b> are transmitted from a second antenna, subcarriers <b>306</b> are transmitted from a third antenna and subcarriers <b>308</b> are transmitted from a fourth antenna. Each box represents one subcarrier. Where a box contains &#x2018;0&#x2019;, the subcarrier is unused (e.g. no signals are transmitted using that subcarrier from that antenna either in an &#x2018;ON&#x2019; or &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; period of a MC-OOK signal). Where a box is empty, the subcarrier is used (e.g. a signal is transmitted using that subcarrier from that antenna in an &#x2018;ON&#x2019; period of a MC-OOK signal). A vertical column of boxes represents one subcarrier. For example, boxes <b>310</b> represent one subcarrier transmitted from each of the four antennas. A signal transmitted from the four antennas using the subcarrier <b>310</b>, for example in an &#x2018;ON&#x2019; period, may comprise for example a frequency domain symbol shifted by a set of factors associated with that subcarrier. That is, a respective factor is applied to the frequency domain symbol transmitted from each antenna for the subcarrier <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the set of factors associated with each subcarrier corresponds to a row or column of a Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. In some examples, each row (or column) of the DFT matrix is used the minimum number of times. That is, for example, where the number of subcarriers is equal to the number of rows (or columns), each row (or column) is used once as a set of factors for a respective subcarrier. For example, the number of subcarriers is greater than a size of the DFT matrix, and the sets of factors associated with the subcarriers include sets corresponding to every row or column of the DFT matrix. If the number of subcarriers is double the number of rows (or columns), each row (or column) is used twice, and so on. In other examples, for example, the number of subcarriers may be less than or equal to a size of the DFT matrix, and the set of factors associated with each subcarrier comprises a different respective row or column of the DFT matrix.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, a matrix may be used that provides sets of factors, wherein the set of factors associated with one subcarrier is different from the set of factors associated with at least one other subcarrier. In some examples, the matrix generates orthogonal beams, the DFT matrix being an example.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of a 4&#xd7;4 DFT matrix <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of the factors <b>500</b> applied to the frequency domain symbol transmitted from each subcarrier and each antenna, in an example using the DFT matrix <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>, <b>12</b></figref> subcarriers numbered from &#x2212;6 to 6 (subcarrier 0 is unused), and four antennas. It can be seen that for each of subcarriers &#x2212;6 to &#x2212;3, the factors applied to the frequency domain symbol transmitted from each antenna correspond to a column (or row) of the DFT matrix <b>400</b>. Different columns of the DFT matrix are applied to the subcarriers &#x2212;6 to &#x2212;3. For subcarriers &#x2212;2 to 2 (not including subcarrier 0), the sequence repeats, and hence different columns (or rows) of the DFT matrix <b>400</b> are applied to each of these subcarriers. Similarly, the sequence repeats for subcarriers 3 to 6. It can be seen that each of the columns (or rows) of the DFT matrix is used three times. In some examples, the transmitter is used in an 802.11ba system (e.g. using a 64-point DFT), in which the subcarriers are labelled &#x2212;32, &#x2212;31, . . . , 30, 31.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To illustrate particular subcarriers, for example subcarriers &#x2212;6, &#x2212;2 and 3, the frequency domain symbol transmitted from each antenna is not shifted (the factor applied is 1) and the same symbol is transmitted on all of these antennas. On the other hand, for subcarriers &#x2212;5, &#x2212;1 and 4, the factors applied to the symbol transmitted from each antenna correspond to the second column (or row) of the DFT matrix <b>400</b>, and so a different symbol is transmitted from each antenna for each of the subcarriers &#x2212;5, &#x2212;1 and 4.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows another example of the factors <b>600</b> applied to the frequency domain symbol transmitted from each subcarrier and each antenna, in an example using the DFT matrix <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>, <b>12</b></figref> subcarriers numbered from &#x2212;6 to 6 (subcarrier 0 is unused), and four antennas. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, each column (or row) of the DFT matrix is used three times. However, in this case, the sets of factors (i.e. the columns or rows of the DFT matrix) are applied to the subcarriers in a different order.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of a 2&#xd7;2 Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix <b>700</b>. This matrix may be used in a two-antenna transmitter. In some examples, the size of the DFT matrix matches the number of transmit antennas, though in other examples the two values may be different. For example, one may be an integer multiple of the other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of factors <b>800</b> applied to a frequency domain symbol transmitted from each subcarrier and each antenna in the two-antenna system. Each column (or row) of the DFT matrix <b>700</b> is used six times.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the factors are all applied to the same frequency domain symbol. However, in other examples, the factors for different subcarriers may be applied to different frequency domain symbols. For example, for a first subcarrier, the factors for that subcarrier (to produce signals for each antenna) may be applied to a first frequency domain symbol. For a second subcarrier, the factors for that subcarrier may be applied to a second frequency domain symbol. The first and second frequency domain symbols may be the same in some examples, or may be different in some examples.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an example of general frequency domain symbols transmitted on each subcarrier and on each antenna in a two-antenna system. The complex phase for a frequency domain symbol associated with each subcarrier, on subcarriers &#x2212;6 to 6 (not including subcarrier 0), is represented by a complex phase value a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k and l respectively. Then, for each subcarrier, the associated frequency domain symbol is phase shifted by the set of factors associated with that subcarrier to produce the set of frequency domain symbols to transmit from both antennas using that subcarrier. For example, for subcarrier &#x2212;5, the complex phase b is shifted by the second column (or row) of the 2&#xd7;2 DFT matrix to produce frequency domain symbols of b and &#x2212;b. Each of these is then transmitted on subcarrier &#x2212;5 from respective antennas.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, each of the complex values a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k and l may represent a respective phase and amplitude value. In some examples, each value of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k and l may be different, or at least some of the values may be the same. In some examples, the same values for a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, k and l may be used for different &#x2018;ON&#x2019; periods for the MC-OOK signal, whereas in other embodiments one, more than one or all of these values may vary between &#x2018;ON&#x2019; periods. Thus, for example, the respective frequency domain symbol associated with one or more of the subcarriers may be the same or different in different on periods.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, the plurality of subcarriers comprise orthogonal subcarriers, e.g. the signals transmitted from one antenna on all used subcarriers (e.g. an OFDM symbol) are orthogonal signals.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the first signal comprises a plurality of data symbols, each data symbol corresponds to an on period and an off period in a respective symbol period, and the order of the on period and the off period in each symbol period is based on the data symbol corresponding to the symbol period. Thus, for example, the signal may comprise a Manchester-coded MC-OOK symbol where an OFDM symbol (e.g. a multi-carrier signal) is transmitted in each &#x2018;ON&#x2019; period. The data symbols in some examples may correspond to at least part of a wake up packet (WUP), such as for example at least part of an 802.11ba WUP. Upon receipt of the WUP, a Wake-Up Receiver (WUR) may wake up another device or component such as for example a Wi-Fi receiver or 802.11 PCR.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Repeated use of the same OFDM symbols to generate the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; part of a MC-OOK signal can lead to undesirable spectral lines, because repetition may create strong correlations in time. This problem can be addressed in some embodiments, where a set of matrices that generate orthogonal beams is chosen. The multi-antenna MC-OOK signal is generated as described by any of the embodiments above, but the matrix used to provide factors to be applied to the frequency domain symbols transmitted on each subcarrier from each antenna may be chosen in a ransom or pseudorandom fashion, and may therefore change from one &#x2018;ON&#x2019; period (e.g. OFDM symbol) to the next. An example of generating a set of matrices comprises applying circular shifts to a DFT matrix. That is, for example, all the columns of the DFT matrix are circularly shifted by the same number of steps. In some examples, the set of matrices may consist of only two matrices, for example the DFT matrix and a second matrix obtained by circularly shifting the DFT matrix by one step (or one or more steps for DFT matrices larger than 2&#xd7;2). This randomization of selected matrix may reduce or eliminate the above-mentioned spectral lines.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic of an example of apparatus <b>1000</b> for transmitting signals.
