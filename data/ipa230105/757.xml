Intrinsic aging occurs with the passage of time, whereas extrinsic aging occurs owing to exposure to external factors, such as harmful chemicals, air pollutants, and ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (<i>J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. </i>2011. 25:873-884). Extrinsic aging resulting from long-term exposure to UVB irradiation is called photoaging. During this process, UVB irradiation penetrates the dermis and induces breakdown of skin components; this is associated with skin inflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress (<i>Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. </i>2004. 195:298-308). In particular, excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major element involved in stimulating oxidative stress, damages skin cells, which degrades and disorganizes extracellular matrix (ECM) components (<i>J Agric Food Chem. </i>2015. 63:5428-5438).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">UVB irradiation-induced ROS production activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), subsequently stimulating to formation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) (J Am Acad Dermatol. 2006. 55:1-19<i>; Int J Dermatol. </i>2013. 52:531-543; and <i>PLoS One. </i>2016. 11: e0159998). AP-1 increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which stimulate breakdown of ECM components especially collagens (<i>Antioxid Redox Signal. </i>2014. 21:1063-1077). Degrading collagens, main components involved in supporting dermal layers, lead to the destruction and collapse of skin structure (<i>Am J Pathol. </i>2004. 165:741-751; and <i>Mol Med Rep. </i>2015. 11:3344-3348). Therefore, downregulating MMP expression is an effective strategy to prevent and delay the development of photoaging-related symptoms, such as wrinkle formation and thickening in UVB-exposed skin (<i>Exp Dermatol. </i>2010. 19:e182-e190). In terms of new collagen formation in the ECM, AP-1 complex blocks type-I procollagen production and downregulates collagen gene expression in UVB-exposed skin cells (<i>Ageing Res Rev. </i>2015. 21:16-29). Thus, photoaging is closely associated with both stimulating collagen breakdown and blocking collagen formation by suppressing type-I collagen synthesis and collagen gene expression (<i>Phytomedicine. </i>2016. 23:1273-1284). Additionally, exposure to UVB irradiation enhances translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#x3ba;B) to the nucleus where it is mainly involved transcription of inflammatory cytokines (<i>Int J Cosmet Sci. </i>2005. 27:17-34). The inflammatory responses induced by activation of NF-&#x3ba;B in UVB-exposed skin cells lead to MMP overexpression and collagen degradation (<i>J Photochem Photobiol B. </i>2015. 144:35-41).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze, also known as Korean mint, is mainly found in Korea, Japan, and China. <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze has been used as a food source and in traditional medicines to cure disease because it has varied bioactivities, which encompass anti-oxidant, anti-melanogenic, anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fungal properties (FEBS Lett. 2001. 495:142-147; and J Funct Foods. 2017. 30:30-38). Previously, <i>A. rugosa </i>leaf extract was shown to reduce photoaging by activating glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in human keratinocytes (HaCaT) (<i>J Photochem Photobiol B. </i>2016. 163:170-176). However, the antiphotoaging effect of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze extract (ARE) and the underlying mechanisms in human dermal fibroblasts (HS68) have not yet been proven. Here, we determined the attenuating effect of ARE on photoaging in UVB-treated human dermal fibroblasts by examining the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention provides a method for preventing or treating photoaging of skin, the method comprising: administering a composition comprising an effective amount of an extract of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an aspect, the extract of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze is obtained by using water or an organic solvent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an aspect, the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, acetone, ether, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, hexane, and cyclohexane.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect, the photoaging is due to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect, the composition decreases expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13, which is induced by UVB irradiation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect, the composition decreases expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling such as p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), ERK, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), JNK, p-p38, and p38.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect, the composition improves collagen synthesis and increase expression of collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), collagen type II alpha 1 (COL3A1), collagen type IV alpha 1 (COL4A1), and collagen type VII alpha 1 (COL7A1).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an aspect, the composition decreases skin inflammation induced by NF-&#x3ba;B.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an aspect, the composition decreases oxidative stress induced by UVB irradiation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an aspect, the composition is functional food composition.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an aspect, the composition ranges 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows effect of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze extract (ARE) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Ultraviolet B (UVB)-treated HS68 cells (##P&#x3c;0.01 compared with the control group; and **P&#x3c;0.01 compared with the UVB-treated cells).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) after ARE (10 and 20 &#x3bc;g/mL) treatment.

Preparation of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>Extract (ARE)</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The dried aerial parts of <i>Agastache rugosa </i>O Kuntze were extracted with water. ARE filtrates were evaporated. Cell culture and UVB irradiation HS68 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va., USA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, Utah, USA) containing 120 U/mL penicillin and 75 &#x3bc;g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, N.Y., USA), and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37&#xb0; C.

Equal amounts of proteins in each group were subjected to 8&#x2dc;-10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 90 min at 110 V. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose blotting membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J., USA) for 1 h at 110 V. After nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% skimmed milk (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, Mich., USA), membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies against NF-&#x3ba;B, phospho (p)-p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), p-c-Jun N terminal kinases (p-JNK), and c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif., USA); and p-c-Jun, c-Jun, ERK, JNK, p38, and &#x3b1;-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass., USA) at room temperature for 4 h. After washing three times in Tris-buffered saline (Dynebio, Gyeonggi, Korea) containing Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Tex., USA) at room temperature for 1 h.

Measurement of Type-I Procollagen Contents</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">After treatment with ARE and UVB exposure, the type-I procollagen content of the medium was evaluated using a human procollagen I alpha 1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass., USA), according to the company's protocol. Absorbance was recorded using a VERSAmax tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices Inc.) at 450 nm. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) was used for isolation of total RNA from cells. The quantity and quality of the isolated mRNA were spectrophotometrically determined using a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Mass., USA). The mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with RT PreMix (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon, Korea). Next, the cDNA of target genes was amplified using specific primers and HiPi PCR PreMix (Elpis Biotech). The list of primer sequences is shown in Table 1. Amplification was carried out over 25-30 cycles; denaturation for 30 s at 94&#xb0; C., annealing for 1 min at 56-60&#xb0; C., and extension for 1 min at 72&#xb0; C. PCR experiments were carried out using a SimpliAmp Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Hercules, Calif., USA). The amplified cDNA was stained with Loading star (Dynebio) and separated for 30 min in a Mupid electrophoresis chamber (Advance, Tokyo, Japan) on 1.5% agarose gel.

ARE Suppresses ROS Production and Increases Anti-Oxidant Enzyme Expression</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Excessive production of ROS is a major cause of photoaging in UVB-irradiated skin, and can further induce oxidative stress and MMP expression (Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed. 2014. 30:237-245). Thus, inhibition of UVB-induced ROS production could be an effective strategy to prevent photoaging. The ability of ARE to scavenge free radicals, and thereby exert anti-oxidant effects, was previously reported (Biomed Chromatogr. 2016. 30:225-231). Moreover, the phytochemicals, acacetin, and rosmarinic acid, which are present in ARE, have been reported to possess anti-oxidant activities (Free Radic Biol Med. 1990. 9:19-21; and J Korean Soc Agric Chem Biotechnol. 1999. 42:262-266).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Based on these studies, we evaluated the anti-oxidant properties of ARE in UVB-exposed human dermal fibroblasts by examining total levels of intracellular ROS. UVB irradiation markedly increased ROS generation; however, ARE treatment dose-dependently alleviated ROS production by 92% (10 &#x3bc;g/mL) and 142% (20 &#x3bc;g/mL), compared with UVB-treated HS68 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). These results indicate that ARE exhibits anti-oxidant activity by suppressing UVB-induced ROS production.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">We also examined mRNA expression of anti-oxidant enzymes in UVB-treated HS68 cells. It was reported that UVB-induced ROS led to cellular senescence in dermal fibroblasts (Yang and Li, 2015). As anti-oxidant enzymes protect skin from UVB-induced thickening and wrinkle formation, it may be necessary to enhance the activities of these enzymes to prevent photoaging (J Cosmet Dermatol. 2007. 6:2-6). According to a previous study, linarin, an active compound in ARE, markedly increased expression of the major anti-oxidant enzyme catalase in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse lung tissues (Int J Mol Med. 2018. 42:1460-1472). We evaluated mRNA expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes catalase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in cells treated with ARE. UVB irradiation reduced expression of all three transcripts; however, mRNA expression levels of these enzymes were markedly elevated after ARE treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Taken together, the reduction of UVB-stimulated ROS production and elevated expression of anti-oxidant enzymes suggest that ARE has potent anti-oxidant properties.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 3. ARE Suppresses UVB-Induced MMP Expression Through the Downregulation of the MAPK/AP-1 Pathway</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0065">UVB irradiation stimulates MAPKs, which promotes heterodimerization of proteins in the AP-1 complex. Enhancement of the MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway promotes upregulation of MMP expression, which subsequently results in breakdown of ECM components, such as elastic fibers, glycosaminoglycans, and collagens. Consequently, this signaling cascade results in photoaging related phenotypes, including wrinkle formation, epidermal thickening, and skin dryness (Food Chem Toxicol. 2012. 50:4260-4269). It was reported that UVB exposure upregulated the pro-MMP-2 and -9 expression; however, probiotic-fermented ARE decreased the MMP expression in UVB-induced HaCaT cells (BMC Complement Altern Med. 2018. 18:196).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Based on this effect of ARE, we evaluated the expression of MMPs, MAPK, and AP-1 in UVB-irradiated HS68 cells. UVB treatment markedly increased MMP mRNA expression; however, treatment with ARE significantly decreased their expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In this study, the MAPK signaling pathway was activated in the UVB-exposed cells. However, ARE significantly decreased MAPK expression, compared with UVB-irradiated HS68 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). In comparison with untreated cells, UVB irradiation significantly upregulated protein expression of the AP-1 components p-c-Jun and c-Fos, whereas ARE downregulated p-c-Jun and c-Fos (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Collectively, these data indicate that ARE decreases UVB-induced MMPs expression by inactivating the MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 4. ARE Increases Type-I Procollagen Production and Collagen Expression</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0068">UVB irradiation stimulates collagen breakdown by increasing the expression of MMPs and downregulates expression of collagen genes by activating the AP-1 complex (Mol Med Rep. 2015. 11:3344-3348). These responses alter the ECM architecture, resulting in wrinkle formation, elastosis, and skin dryness (Ageing Res Rev. 2015. 21:16-29).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Since ARE was revealed to reduce MMP expression by inhibiting MAPK/AP-1 cell signaling in UVB-treated HS68 cells, we evaluated the effect of ARE on regulation of genes related to collagen synthesis and production of type-I procollagen. The expression of the collagen genes [collagen type I al (COL1A1), collagen type III al (COL3A1), collagen type IV al (COL4A1), and collagen type VII al (COL7A1)] was significantly reduced in UVB-treated HS68 cells. However, ARE markedly upregulated mRNA expression of collagen genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). ARE treatment prevented UVB irradiation from reducing type-1 procollagen production in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, at a dose of 20 &#x3bc;g/mL, ARE increased type-I procollagen content by 27% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Consistent with these current results, <i>A. rugosa </i>recovered skin barrier function by increasing expression of collagens in atopic dermatitis induced mice (J East-West Nurs Res. 20:57-62).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">This study demonstrates that ARE attenuates skin photoaging by activating type-I procollagen production and improving collagen synthesis in UVB-irradiated HS68 cells.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 5. ARE Inhibits UVB-Induced Inflammation</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Previous study showed that UVB irradiation elevated inflammatory responses by activating NF-&#x3ba;B and stimulating expression of NF-&#x3ba;B-mediated inflammatory cytokines (J Pathol. 2008. 214:149-160). UVB-induced inflammatory responses upregulate MMP expression, resulting in skin dehydration, psoriasis, and erythema (Free Radic Biol Med. 2012. 52:1734-1743). Here, mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was examined in UVB-exposed HS68 cells. UVB irradiation elevated protein expression of NF-&#x3ba;B, which was inhibited by ARE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). In addition, mRNA expression of NF-&#x3ba;B-stimulated inflammatory cytokines was decreased in cells treated with ARE, compared with UVB-irradiated HS68 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The anti-inflammatory effect of ARE was reported in an osteosarcoma cell line, accompanied by downregulation of interleukin-1&#x3b2; and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (Arch Pharm Res. 2005. 28:305-310). Consistent with this report, our data showed that ARE exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects, thereby playing a critical role in anti-photoaging property by suppressing expression of NF-&#x3ba;B and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results suggest that ARE could be used as an anti-photoaging agent owing to its alleviation of UVB-induced skin inflammatory responses.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">In this study, the anti-photoaging effect of ARE was investigated in UVB-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts. ARE suppressed UVB-induced oxidative stress by reducing production of ROS and by increasing expression of anti-oxidant enzymes. In addition, ARE attenuated UVB-activated MAPK/AP-1 signaling, resulting in downregulation of MMP expression. Moreover, ARE both upregulated expression of collagen genes and increased production of procollagen. Further, ARE alleviated UVB-stimulated inflammatory responses by suppressing expression of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our findings suggest that ARE could be a potential candidate for skin anti-photoaging treatment. To develop ARE as a novel anti-photoaging agent, potentially as an ingredient in functional foods or nutraceuticals, the anti-photoaging effect of ARE should be verified in animal studies and clinical trials.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.
