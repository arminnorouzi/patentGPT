Mutations in the OTC gene can eliminate or reduce the ability of the OTC enzyme to catalyze the synthesis of citrulline (Cit) and phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) (in the liver and small intestine) from carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and ornithine (Orn). This dysfunction in the Urea Cycle can lead to excess ammonia, which can accumulate in the blood (hyperammonemia) and travel to the nervous system, resulting in symptoms associated with OTC deficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">OTC deficiency is the most common type of urea cycle disorder. Hundreds of mutations in human OTC have been reported. The severity and age of onset of OTC deficiency vary from person to person, even with in the same family and/or with the same causative mutation. A severe form of the disorder affects some infants, typically males, shortly after birth. A milder form of the disorder affects some children later in infancy. Both males and females can develop symptoms of OTC deficiency during childhood.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there is no cure other than liver transplant for people with OTC deficiency and long-term therapy involves life-long restriction of protein intake and nitrogen scavenger therapy (e.g., sodium phenyl acetate or sodium phenyl butyrate and/or sodium benzoate). Liver transplantation can also be considered in patients with severe, neonatal-onset OTC deficiency or those with frequent hyperammonemic episodes</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">RNA molecules have the capacity to act as potent modulators of gene expression in vitro and in vivo and therefore have potential as nucleic acid based drugs. These molecules can function through a number of mechanisms utilizing either specific interactions with cellular proteins or base pairing interactions with other RNA molecules. For disorders characterized by insufficient or faulty protein production, therapeutic mRNA has the potential to provide instructions for ribosomes to produce the missing or faulty protein. Efficient and effective intracellular delivery of RNA therapeutics is difficult because these therapeutics are prone to rapid degradation and excretion in the bloodstream and do not pass freely through cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The delivery of exogenous polynucleotides such as RNA molecules and other membrane impermeable compounds into living cells is highly restricted by the complex membrane systems of the cell. Typically, molecules used in antisense and gene therapies are large, negatively charged and hydrophilic molecules. These characteristics can preclude their direct diffusion across the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. Thus, a major barrier to the therapeutic use of polynucleotides for modulation of gene expression is the delivery of the polynucleotide to the cytoplasm. Transfection agents typically comprise peptides, polymers, and lipids of a cationic nature as well as nano- and microparticles. These transfection agents have been used successfully in in vitro reactions. However, there are challenges with efficacy and toxicity in vivo. Furthermore, the cationic charge of these systems can cause interaction with serum components, which causes destabilization of polynucleotide-transfection reagent interaction and poor bioavailability and targeting. When transfecting nucleic acids in vivo, the delivery agent should protect the nucleic acid payload from early extracellular degradation, e.g., from nucleases. Furthermore, the delivery agent should not be recognized by the adaptive immune system (immunogenicity) and should not stimulate an acute immune response.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides polynucleotide constructs comprising, from 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;: a 5&#x2032; UTR comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; an mRNA sequence comprising an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a functional human ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), wherein ORF comprises a codon optimized sequence at least about 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1; and a 3&#x2032; UTR comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain aspects the disclosure provides polynucleotide constructs comprising an mRNA sequence comprising an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a functional human ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), wherein the mRNA sequence comprises a sequence having no more than five nucleic acids different from SEQ ID NO: 4.

mRNA disclosed herein by a delivery agents can occur via delivery of the polynucleotide construct to the cytosol of a cell. As gene expression and mRNA translation occurs in the cytosol of a cell, the polynucleotides have to enter the cytosol for effective modulation of the target gene or effective translation of a transported mRNA.

In some aspects, by encapsulating the polynucleotide construct (e.g., comprising mRNA) within a delivery agent, such as a LNP, the nucleic acid (e.g., the polynucleotide construct of the disclosure) can be protected from an environment, which can contain enzymes or chemicals that degrade nucleic acids and/or systems or receptors that cause the rapid excretion of the nucleic acids. Lipid nanoparticles typically comprise an ionizable (e.g., cationic) lipid, a non-cationic lipid (e.g., cholesterol and a phospholipid), and a PEG lipid (e.g., a conjugated PEG lipid), which can be formulated with a payload of interest, e.g., a polynucleotide construct disclosed herein. The polynucleotide construct, e.g., mRNA, of the disclosure can be encapsulated in the lipid particle, thereby protecting it from enzymatic degradation.

The processes of the present disclosure are applicable to a wide range of lipid nanoparticle types and sizes. Further particles include, micelles, lipid-nucleic acid particles, virosomes, and the like. Those of skill in the art will know of other lipid LNPs for which the processes and apparatus of the present disclosure will be suitable.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111">In one aspect, the present method of encapsulating a polynucleic acid construct of the disclosure provides a lipid solution such as a clinical grade lipid synthesized under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), which is thereafter solubilized in an organic solution (e.g., ethanol). Similarly, a therapeutic product, e.g., a therapeutic active agent such as nucleic acid or other agent, is prepared under GMP. Thereafter, a therapeutic agent solution (e.g., mRNA) containing a buffer (e.g., citrate or ethanol) is mixed with a lipid solution solubilized in a lower alkanol to form a liposomal formulation. In preferred aspects of the disclosure, the therapeutic agent is &#x201c;passively entrapped&#x201d; in the liposome substantially coincident with formation of the liposome. However, those of skill in the art will realize that the processes and apparatus of the present disclosure are equally applicable to active entrapment or loading of the liposomes after formation of the LNP.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112">According to the processes and apparatus of the present disclosure, the action of continuously introducing lipid and buffer solutions into a mixing environment, such as in a mixing chamber, causes a continuous dilution of the lipid solution with the buffer solution, thereby producing a liposome substantially instantaneously upon mixing. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;continuously diluting a lipid solution with a buffer solution&#x201d; (and variations) generally means that the lipid solution is diluted sufficiently rapidly in a hydration process with sufficient force to effectuate LNP generation. By mixing the aqueous solution with the organic lipid solution, the organic lipid solution undergoes a continuous stepwise dilution in the presence of the buffer (aqueous) solution to produce a liposome.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113">After the solutions, e.g., lipid solution and aqueous therapeutic agent (e.g., polynucleotide construct) solution, have been prepared, they are mixed together using, for example, a peristaltic pump mixer. In one aspect, the solutions are pumped at substantially equal flow rates into a mixing environment. In certain aspects, the mixing environment includes a &#x201c;T&#x201d;-connector or mixing chamber. In this instance, it is preferred that the fluid lines, and hence fluid flows, meet in a narrow aperture within the &#x201c;T&#x201d;-connector as opposing flows at approximately 180&#xb0; relative to each other. Other relative introduction angles can be used, such as for example between 27&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; and between 90&#xb0; and 180&#xb0;. Upon meeting and mixing of the solution flows in the mixing environment, lipid LNPs are substantially instantaneously formed. Lipid LNPs are formed when an organic solution including dissolved lipid and an aqueous solution (e.g., buffer) are simultaneously and continuously mixed. Advantageously, and surprisingly, by mixing the aqueous solution with the organic lipid solution, the organic lipid solution undergoes a continuous stepwise dilution to substantially instantaneously produce a liposome. The pump mechanism can be configured to provide equivalent or different flow rates of the lipid and aqueous solutions into the mixing environment which creates lipid LNPs in a high alkanol environment.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0114">Advantageously, the processes and apparatus for mixing of the lipid solution and the aqueous solution as provided herein provides for encapsulation of therapeutic agent in the formed liposome substantially coincident with liposome formation with an encapsulation efficiency of at least 90-95%. Further processing steps as discussed herein can be used to target a specific mRNA concentration by concentrating or diluting the sample, if desired.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">In some aspects, the LNPs are formed having a mean diameter of less than about 150 nm (e.g., about 50-90 nm), which do not require further size reduction by high-energy processes such as membrane extrusion, sonication or microfluidization.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">In certain aspects, LNPs form when lipids dissolved in an organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) are diluted in a stepwise manner by mixing with an aqueous solution (e.g., buffer). This controlled stepwise dilution is achieved by mixing the aqueous and lipid streams together in an aperture, such as a T-connector. The resultant lipid, solvent and solute concentrations can be kept constant throughout the LNP formation process.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">In one aspect, using the processes of the present disclosure, a LNP is prepared by a two-stage step-wise dilution without gradients. For example, in the first stepwise dilution, LNPs are formed in a high alkanol (e.g., ethanol) environment (e.g., about 30% to about 50% v/v ethanol). These LNPs can then be stabilized by lowering the alkanol (e.g., ethanol) concentration to less than or equal to about 25% v/v, such as about 17% v/v to about 25% v/v, in a stepwise manner. In preferred aspects, with therapeutic agent present in the aqueous solution, or in the lipid solution, the therapeutic agent is encapsulated coincident with liposome formation.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">In certain aspects, lipid stocks can be prepared in 100% ethanol, and then mixed with mRNA LNP in acetate buffer via a T-connector. The lipid and mRNA stocks can be mixed at a flow rate of 400 mL/min at the T-connector into a collection vessel containing PBS. In some aspects, lipids are initially dissolved in an alkanol environment of about 40% v/v to about 90% v/v, more preferably about 65% v/v to about 90% v/v, and most preferably about 80% v/v to about 90% v/v (A). Next, the lipid solution is diluted stepwise by mixing with an aqueous solution resulting in the formation of LNPs at an alkanol (e.g., ethanol) concentration of between about 37.5-50% (B). By mixing the aqueous solution with the organic lipid solution, the organic lipid solution undergoes a continuous stepwise dilution to produce a liposome. Further, lipid LNPs can be further stabilized by an additional stepwise dilution of the LNPs to an alkanol concentration of less than or equal to about 25%, preferably between about 15-25% (C).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">In some aspects, for both stepwise dilutions (A&#x2192;B and B&#x2192;C), the resulting ethanol, lipid and solute concentrations are kept at constant levels in the receiving vessel. At these higher ethanol concentrations following the initial mixing step, the rearrangement of lipid monomers into bilayers proceeds in a more orderly fashion compared to LNPs that are formed by dilution at lower ethanol concentrations. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these higher ethanol concentrations promote the association of nucleic acid with cationic lipids in the bilayers. In certain aspects, the nucleic acid encapsulation occurs within a range of alkanol (e.g., ethanol) concentrations above 22%.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">In certain aspects, after the lipid LNPs are formed, they are collected in another vessel, for example, a stainless steel vessel. In one aspect, a second dilution can be performed, e.g., at a rate of about 100-200 mL/min.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">In one aspect, after the mixing step, the lipid concentration is about 1-10 mg/mL (e.g., about 7 mg/mL) and the therapeutic agent (e.g., mRNA) concentration is about 0.1-4 mg/mL.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">After the mixing step, the degree of therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) encapsulation can be enhanced if the lipid LNP suspension is optionally diluted. For example, prior to dilution step, if the therapeutic agent entrapment is at about 30-40%, it can be increased to about 70-80% following incubation after the dilution step. In step, the liposome formulation is diluted to about 10% to about 40%, preferably about 20% alkanol, by mixing with an aqueous solution such as a buffer (e.g., PBS). Such further dilution is preferably accomplished with a buffer. In certain aspects, such further diluting the liposome solution is a continuous stepwise dilution. The diluted sample is then optionally allowed to incubate at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">After the optional dilution step, about 70-80% or more of the therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) is entrapped within the lipid LNP. In certain aspects, anion exchange chromatography is used.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">In certain instances, the liposome solution is optionally concentrated about 2-6 fold, preferably about 4 fold, using for example, ultrafiltration (e.g., tangential flow dialysis). In one aspect, the sample is transferred to a feed reservoir of an ultrafiltration system and the buffer is removed. The buffer can be removed using various processes, such as by ultrafiltration.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">In some aspects, the concentrated formulation is then diafiltrated to remove the alkanol. The alkanol concentration at the completion of step is less than about 1%. Preferably, lipid and therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) concentrations remain unchanged and the level of therapeutic agent entrapment also remains constant.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">After the alkanol has been removed, the aqueous solution (e.g., buffer) is then replaced by dialfiltration against another buffer. Preferably, the ratio of concentrations of lipid to therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) remain unchanged and the level of nucleic acid entrapment is about constant. In certain instances, sample yield can be improved by rinsing the cartridge with buffer at about 10% volume of the concentrated sample. In certain aspects, this rinse is then added to the concentrated sample.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">In certain aspects, sterile filtration of the sample can optionally be performed. In certain aspects, filtration is conducted at pressures below about 40 psi, using a capsule filter and a pressurized dispensing vessel with a heating jacket. Heating the sample slightly can improve the ease of filtration.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">The sterile fill step can be performed using a processes for conventional liposomal formulations. In some aspects, the processes of the present disclosure results in about 50-60% of the input therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) in the final product. In certain preferred aspects, the therapeutic agent to lipid ratio of the final product is approximately 0.04 to 0.07.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">Preparation of encapsulated LNPs can then be filtered under sterile conditions, aliquoted, and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Copolymers</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0130">In some aspects, the composition of the disclosure further comprises a copolymer.

OTCD is a urea cycle disorder that can trigger hyperammonemia, a life-threatening illness that leads to brain damage, coma or even death. This is due to deficiency in the activity of OTC, a key enzyme in the urea cycle, which primarily takes place in the liver and is responsible for removal of ammonia from the body. Ammonia is produced from protein intake as well as protein breakdown in the body. In the liver, this ammonia is converted into urea by enzymes in the urea cycle. Urea is non-toxic and cleared easily through the kidneys in urine, normally. However, when the OTC enzyme is deficient, ammonia levels rise in blood and can cause severe brain damage. Patients with severe OTC deficiency are most often identified 2-3 days after birth where the patient has significantly elevated blood ammonia levels and ends up in a coma. Patients with milder OTC deficiency can have crises during times of stress resulting in elevated ammonia levels that can also lead to coma. Current therapies include ammonia scavenger drugs (Buphenyl, Ravicti) for use in patients with hyperammonemia.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">The OTC gene is X-linked. The disease is present in males with one mutant allele and in females either homozygous or heterozygous with mutant alleles. Male patients with the severest OTC deficiency are typically found right after birth. In addition to elevation in blood ammonia levels, urinary orotic acid levels are also elevated. In patients with severe OTC deficiency, OTC enzyme activity is &#x3c;2% of normal levels. In patients with milder OTC deficiency, OTC enzyme activity is up to 30% of normal levels.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0145">A method for treating OTCD with a polynucleotide construct of the disclosure or composition comprising an OTC-encoding mRNA of the present disclosure generally includes administering to a subject having OTCD a therapeutically effective amount of the composition, whereby the OTC-encoding mRNA is delivered to liver cells and translated during protein synthesis to produce the OTC protein. The OTC-encoding mRNA can be an mRNA as set forth above with respect to a composition or method for increasing OTC protein in a cell.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">The efficacy of an mRNA composition for treating a disease can be evaluated in vivo in animal models of disease. For example, suitable animal models for evaluating efficacy of an mRNA composition for treatment of OTCD includes known mouse models having deficiencies of the OTC enzyme in the liver. One such mouse model, Otc<sup>spf-ash </sup>(sparse fur and abnormal skin and hair) mice, contain an R129H mutation resulting in reduced levels of OTC protein and have only 5-10% of the normal level of enzyme activity in liver (see Hodges et al., PNAS 86:4142-4146, 1989). Another model, Otc<sup>spf </sup>mice, contain an H117N mutation which results in reduced levels of enzyme activity to 5-10% of normal levels (see Rosenberg et al., <i>Science </i>222:426-428, 1983). Both of these mouse models have elevated urine orotic acid levels compared to their wild-type littermate mice. A third model for OTC deficiency is inducing hyperammonemia in Otc<sup>spf </sup>or Otc<sup>spf-ash </sup>mice (Cunningham et al., <i>Mol Ther </i>19(5): 854-859, 2011). These mice are treated with OTC siRNA or AAV2/8 vector/OTC shRNA to knockdown residual endogenous OTC expression and activity. Plasma ammonia levels are elevated and mice die approximately 2-14 days.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0147">Once the detection of specific analytes narrows the diagnostic possibilities, the activity of the deficient enzyme is assayed in lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts as a confirmatory test. For many pathways, no single enzyme assay can establish the diagnosis. For others, tests such as complementation studies need to be done.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0148">In certain aspects, the goal of therapy is to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis. Neonates may require emergency diagnosis and treatment depending on the specific biochemical lesion, the position of the metabolic block, and the effects of the toxic compounds. Treatment strategies include: (1) dietary restriction of the precursor amino acids and (2) use of adjunctive compounds to (a) dispose of toxic metabolites or (b) increase activity of deficient enzymes. Liver transplantation has been successful in a small number of affected individuals. Even with current clinical management approaches, individuals with organic acidemias have a greater risk of infection and a higher incidence of pancreatitis, which can be fatal.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0149">In certain aspects, the polynucleotide constructs and compositions of the present disclosure is useful in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a disease or condition associated with defective gene expression and/or activity in a subject.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0150">The polynucleotide constructs and compositions of the present disclosure can be administered in a variety of routes of administration such as parenteral, oral, topical, rectal, inhalation and the like.

Preparation of OTC Polynucleotide Constructs</heading><p id="p-0156" num="0152">An OTC polynucleotide constructs comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 were prepared by In Vitro Transcription (IVT) using a plasmid DNA construct. The plasmid DNA construct contained the instructions for the 5&#x2032;UTR, ORF and 3&#x2032;UTR while the chemical modification (e.g. Pseudouridine) was determined by the addition of the desired nucleotide to the IVT reaction. To start, the plasmid DNA was linearized using 5 units of XbaI restriction enzyme per ug of plasmid DNA. After an overnight incubation at 37 degrees the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. An IVT reaction in addition to co-trascriptional capping (e.g., Cap1) was performed for 3 hours at 37 degrees using T7 Polymerase and CleanCap. After the IVT reaction, the resultant mRNA product was purified via DNase treatment followed by Diafiltration. The purified mRNA was then enzymatically Poly adenylated with 300 units of Poly A polymerase per mg RNA and incubated for between 15 and 60 minutes, depending on the desired Poly A tail length. The mRNA product was then purified by Diafiltration and HPLC before being adjusted to a desired concentration, sterile filtered and aliquoted.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 2.

Single Vs. Repeat-Dose Lipid Clearance in Rats</heading><p id="p-0181" num="0170">Lipid-clearance following single and repeated-dose administration of OTC mRNA construct-LNP was evaluated. OTC mRNA was formulated in LNP2 (PEG2000-S:13-B43:Cholesterol:DSPC) and administered to rats at 0.25 mg/kg per dose. For single dose, rats were administered the formulation at DO and terminal time points were at 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 24 h after administration (Table 5A). A high single dose (2 mg/kg) was administered at DO and the terminal time point was D1. For repeated dosing, rats were administered the formulation once every seven days for up to 49 days (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49). After the 8th treatment (Day 49) terminal time points were collected at 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 24 h (Day 50) after dosing. PBS was administered as a control (5 mL/kg) at DO, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49.
