The conductive portions and the insulating layer are pattern-formed by, for example, a photolithography method. Each step included in the production process of such a wiring circuit board may be carried out in a so-called roll-to-roll method in order to realize a high production efficiency. The technique relating to a method for producing a wiring circuit board in the roll-to-roll method is, for example, described in Patent Document 1 below.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-85944</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a substrate to be provided to a production line of a wiring circuit board in a roll-to-roll method is a sheet-shaped metal substrate, foreign matters may be attached to the surface of the substrate. Depending on the type of metal constituting the metal substrate, and a production process of the substrate, the foreign matters may be numerous. When the wiring circuit board is produced in the roll-to-roll method using such a metal substrate, in the metal substrate, the surface (processing surface) to which processing is subjected in a predetermined step (step P), and the rear surface accompanied with foreign matters due to the metal substrate surface being exposed on the opposite side to the processing surface are overlapped, in a state where the metal substrate is wound up and takes the form of a roll after the step P. Therefore, the foreign matters are easily transferred from the rear surface onto the processing surface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the step P is a step of forming an insulating film to be patterned by a photolithography method (i.e., an insulating film-forming step by application of a photosensitive resin-containing composition onto the metal substrate), in a subsequent exposure step, the insulating film is subjected to light exposure treatment in a state where foreign matters are attached to various portions on the surface of the insulating film on the processing surface-side, and the foreign matter attaching portions in the insulating film are not appropriately exposed to light. The insulating film having undergone such an exposure step may not be appropriately patterned in a subsequent development step. For example, the portion to which the foreign matter is attached in the insulating film during the exposure step is removed in the development step, and a pinhole to which the metal substrate directly below the insulating film faces is formed in the portion of the insulating film. When the wiring is pattern-formed in a region including such a pinhole on the insulating film, a short circuit occurs between the wiring and the metal substrate, and the reliability of the wiring is impaired.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a method for producing a wiring circuit board suitable for ensuring the reliability of a wiring to be formed.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention [1] includes a method for producing a wiring circuit board, the method including a first step of, while feeding and winding a work film which is a long metal substrate having a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface by a roll-to-roll method, applying a composition containing a photosensitive resin onto the first surface to form an insulating film, and interposing a protective film between the second surface and the insulating film of the work film in being wound; a second step of, while feeding and winding the work film having undergone the first step by the roll-to-roll method, peeling the protective film from the insulating film, and subjecting the insulating film to light exposure treatment to be formed with a latent image pattern; and a third step of subjecting the insulating film having undergone the second step to development treatment to be patterned.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the first step, in the roll-to-roll method, of the present method, as described above, the work film is wound while the protective film is interposed between the insulating film and the second surface of the metal substrate, after forming the insulating film on the first surface of the metal substrate as the work film. Therefore, even when the foreign matter is attached to the second surface of the metal substrate to be subjected to the first step, it is possible to suppress the transfer of the foreign matter from the second surface to the insulating film in the work film in a roll form after the first step. In the second step of the present method, in the roll-to-roll method, since the insulating film in which the transfer of the foreign matter from the second surface is suppressed is subjected to light exposure treatment after peeling the protective film from the insulating film, the insulating film can be appropriately subjected to light exposure treatment in a predetermined pattern to be formed with the latent image pattern, and in the subsequent third step, the insulating film can be appropriately patterned by the development treatment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present method, it is possible to pattern the insulating film while suppressing the formation of a pinhole caused by the attachment of the foreign matter in the insulating film.
