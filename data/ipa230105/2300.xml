For example, processes for preparing a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>aldaric acid and/or lactone(s) thereof by the catalytic oxidation of a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>aldonic acid and/or lactone(s) thereof and/or a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>aldose are described.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years, there has been an interest in using biorenewable materials as a feedstock to produce commercially useful chemicals. In particular, a significant body of work has focused on the oxidation of sugars obtained from these materials to aldaric acids, especially glucose to glucaric acid. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,669,397 and 8,785,683, which are incorporated herein by reference. Not only are these products useful as intermediates in the production of monomers such as adipic acid, but also in the production of compositions having commercial applications such as de-icing fluids, acidulants, detergent builders, pH regulators, chelants, de-scalers, corrosion inhibitors, metal cleaning and finishing agents, and components of cement formulations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous catalysts and reaction conditions have been attempted for these oxidation processes. However, sustained high yields of glucaric acid over prolonged operation or at high reactor throughputs have not been demonstrated. For example, in Lee et al., &#x201c;Pt catalysts for efficient aerobic oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid in water&#x201d; Green Chemistry 2016, 18 (13), 3815-3822 a glucaric acid yield of 74% is reported for the oxidation of a 5 wt. % glucose feed over a 5 wt. % Pt/C catalyst at 80&#xb0; C. and about 200 psi O<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure in a batch reactor after 10 h of reaction. In U.S. Pat. No. 9,770,705, a glucaric acid yield of 70% is reported for an experiment where 2.3 mL of 10 wt. % gluconic acid feed was contacted with 75 mg of catalyst at 112-126&#xb0; C. for 2-5 h. There remains a need for efficient and cost-effective processes for preparing aldaric acids, such as glucaric acid, and intermediates thereof from biorenewable materials that exhibit improved and stable yields, especially over prolonged operation and high reactor throughput.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various aspects of the present

Further, various processes described herein provide for stable product yields over extended operation and/or at high reactor throughputs. These processes can advantageously improve process economics by decreasing the amount of off-path products that may require separation from the product mixture and/or decreasing the amount of on-path products that require further processing.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0037">The preparation of an aldaric acid and/or lactone(s) from an aldonic acid and/or lactone(s) and/or corresponding aldoses is typically a multistep synthesis that proceeds through various intermediates. For example, as shown in the scheme below, the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid proceeds primarily through two intermediates: gluconic acid and guluronic acid.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="106.00mm" wi="75.78mm" file="US20230002301A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0076" num="0000">First, the carbonyl of glucose is oxidized to an acid, producing gluconic acid. Next, the terminal hydroxyl at the 6 position of gluconic acid is dehydrogenated to a carbonyl, resulting in guluronic acid. Finally, the carbonyl of guluronic acid is oxidized to an acid, forming glucaric acid.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0038">Previously reported glucaric acid yields (e.g., yields rarely exceeding 70%) may be limited due to a number of factors. Some potential limiting factors include the formation of on-path or off-path products which significantly reduce catalyst efficacy, over-conversion of glucaric acid, and leaching of catalytically active metals. Also, without pH mediation via the continuous introduction of base during the oxidation reaction, the rate of glucaric acid production decreases as the pH decreases. On the other hand, pH mediation results in many cases of lower glucaric acid yields due to the over conversion of glucaric acid to C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>sugar acid derivatives. Thus, several inhibiting factors may contribute individually or in combination to limit the total yield to glucaric acid.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0039">In processes for preparing an aldaric acid and/or lactone(s) thereof and/or intermediates thereof by the catalytic oxidation of an aldose, aldonic acid and/or lactone(s) thereof, and/or uronic acid and/or lactones thereof, it has been surprisingly discovered that employing at least two different catalysts provides for enhanced product yields (e.g., aldaric acid yields) even over prolonged operation. It is theorized that by employing at least two different catalysts that some of the inhibiting factors that are expected to limit total yield are reduced or avoided. In particular, it has been discovered that a first catalyst comprising platinum and a second catalyst comprising gold are especially effective for the catalytic oxidation of a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>aldose, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>uronic acid and/or lactone(s) thereof, and C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>aldonic acid and/or lactone(s) thereof to the corresponding aldaric acid and/or lactone(s) thereof or intermediate thereof.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0040">Processes for Producing Aldaric Acids and/or Lactone(s) Thereof</p><p id="p-0080" num="0041">As noted, embodiments of the present invention include oxidation processes for producing aldaric acids and/or lactone(s) thereof.
