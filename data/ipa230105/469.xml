In recent years, various methods different from the DAS method have been proposed. Examples of known methods include &#x201c;minimum variance beamforming&#x201d;, &#x201c;coherence factor imaging&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Delay Multiply and Sum Beamforming (DMAS)&#x201d;. Among these methods, according to a DMAS method, multiplication and addition are performed on signals output from mutually-different elements (piezoelectric transducer elements or piezoelectric elements).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As explained above, according to the DMAS method, the signals output from the mutually-different elements are multiplied by each other. Accordingly, in ultrasound image data obtained by implementing the DMAS method, output signals exhibit a more sensitive reaction to a time lag (a time difference or a phase difference) between signals than in ultrasound image data obtained by using the DAS method. The more sensitive reaction appears as a larger amplitude fluctuation of speckle patterns (speckle noise), for example. In other words, in the ultrasound image data obtained by implementing the DMAS method, the speckle patterns appear in a more emphasized manner than in the ultrasound image data obtained by implementing the DAS method. As explained herein, because the signals are multiplied by each other according to the DMAS method, contrast resolution is lowered due to a larger amplitude fluctuation of speckle echoes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of an ultrasound diagnosis apparatus according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a beam former included in a reception circuit according to the first embodiment and configured to implement beamforming using a DMAS method;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a flow in a process performed by the beam former implementing the DMAS method according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating an example of an ultrasound image based on ultrasound image data obtained by using a conventional DMAS method;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating an example of an ultrasound image based on ultrasound image data generated by the ultrasound diagnosis apparatus according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a beam former included in a reception circuit according to a modification example of the first embodiment and configured to implement beamforming using the DMAS method;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a partial configuration of a beam former according to a second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating an example of an ultrasound image based on ultrasound image data generated by an ultrasound diagnosis apparatus according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a partial configuration of a beam former according to a third embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a partial configuration of a beam former according to a fourth embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One of the problems to be solved by the embodiments disclosed in the present specification and drawings is to inhibit the occurrence of speckle patterns when a method involving multiplication and addition of signals is used as a beamforming method.

In the first embodiment, the ultrasound diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> is configured to implement a DMAS method, which is an ultrasound beamforming method by which, among a plurality of reception signals output from a plurality of elements in the ultrasound probe <b>101</b>, reception signals from mutually-different elements are multiplied by each other so that signals obtained as the results of the multiplications are added together.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> includes a plurality of elements (piezoelectric transducer elements or piezoelectric elements). The plurality of elements are configured to generate an ultrasound wave on the basis of a drive signal supplied from a transmission circuit <b>111</b> of a transmission and reception circuit <b>110</b> included in the apparatus main body <b>100</b>. More specifically, as a result of the transmission circuit <b>111</b> applying voltage (transmission drive voltage) thereto, the plurality of elements are configured to generate the ultrasound wave having a waveform corresponding to the transmission drive voltage. The waveform of the transmission drive voltage indicated by the drive signal is the waveform of the voltage applied to the plurality of elements. In other words, the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> is configured to transmit the ultrasound wave corresponding to the magnitude of the applied transmission drive voltage. Further, the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> is configured to receive a reflected wave arriving from an examined subject (hereinafter, &#x201c;patient&#x201d;) P, to convert the reflected wave into a reception signal (a reflected-wave signal) being an electrical signal, and to output the reception signal to the apparatus main body <b>100</b>.

In this situation, the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> is detachably connected to the apparatus main body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the ultrasound wave is transmitted from the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> to the patient P, the transmitted ultrasound wave is repeatedly reflected on a surface of discontinuity of acoustic impedances at a tissue in the body of the patient P, so as to be received as the reflected wave by the plurality of elements included in the ultrasound probe <b>101</b>. The amplitude of the received reflected wave is dependent on the difference between the acoustic impedances on the surface of discontinuity on which the ultrasound wave is reflected. Further, when a transmitted ultrasound pulse is reflected on the surface of a moving blood flow, a cardiac wall, or the like, the reflected wave is, due to the Doppler effect, subject to a frequency shift, depending on a velocity component of the moving members with respect to the ultrasound wave transmission direction. Further, the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> is configured to output the reception signal to a reception circuit <b>112</b> (explained later) of the transmission and reception circuit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ultrasound probe <b>101</b> is provided so as to be attachable to and detachable from the apparatus main body <b>100</b>.

Examples of different types of the 1D array probe include linear ultrasound probes, convex ultrasound probes, and sector ultrasound probes.

The scan may be referred to as scanning, ultrasound scanning, or an ultrasound scan. The transmission and reception circuit <b>110</b> is an example of a transmission and reception unit. The transmission and reception circuit <b>110</b> includes the transmission circuit <b>111</b> and the reception circuit <b>112</b>.

As a result of the rate pulse being routed through the transmission delay circuit, voltage is applied to the transmission pulser while having mutually-different transmission delay time periods. For example, the transmission delay circuit is configured to apply the transmission delay time period that corresponds to each of the elements and is required to converge the ultrasound wave generated from the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> into the form of a beam and to determine transmission directionality, to the rate pulses generated by the rate pulser generating circuit. The transmission pulser is configured to supply the drive signal (a drive pulse) to the ultrasound probe <b>101</b> with timing based on the rate pulses.
