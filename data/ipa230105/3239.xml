It comprises an annular base element having an assembly wall for abutting against a first component and a first fastening wall opposite the assembly wall for abutting against a second component, an assembly element having a bottom wall, wherein, in order to be passed through a second through-opening of a second component in an assembly direction, the assembly element has a smaller diameter than the base element, and two diametrically opposed, foldable retaining arms, which connect the assembly wall of the base element to the assembly element, wherein the retaining arms are each connected to the assembly element and the base element via a respective joint or hinge and form an articulated joint in the region between the joints, wherein a region of the retaining arms between the articulated joints and the assembly wall forms a fastening portion, and wherein at least one catching device is provided in order to connect the base element to the assembly element in an assembly position, such that a second component is retained between the fastening wall and the fastening portions, such that the fastening apparatus is connected to the second component, and an assembly body for connecting to a first component, which extends counter to an assembly direction, wherein means are provided on the assembly body for connecting to a correspondingly configured means of a first component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the fastening apparatus of the invention, a floor mat fastening that is fastenable to a vehicle floor, in particular a rug and or a corresponding carrier component of a motor vehicle, is provided in order to then connect a floor mat to the vehicle floor via the fastening apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fastening apparatus according to the invention is integrally configured and can be easily connected to a vehicle floor, as will be described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The fastening apparatus can also be made from a plastic, preferably by means of a single-component injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the context of the present invention, an assembly direction or axial direction is understood to mean a direction that extends in the direction of a second component and that is arranged substantially orthogonally to a component surface of the second component.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The assembly body can be arranged on the bottom wall of the assembly element and can extend towards the base element, wherein the base element comprises a through-opening for passage of the assembly body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, when transitioning from a home position into a final assembly position, the assembly body shifts in the axial direction in the direction of the base element or counter to the assembly direction such that, in the final assembly position, it extends from the assembly wall of the base element counter to the assembly direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an alternative design, the assembly body can be integrally formed on the assembly wall of the base element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the assembly body always extends, i.e., also in the final assembly position, from the assembly wall of the base element counter to the assembly direction.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Three or four or five or more foldable retaining arms can be provided, which are preferably arranged radially circumferentially and equally spaced apart from one another.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the region of the articulated joint, a region of the retaining arms between the articulated joint and the assembly element can be extended in the radial direction beyond the articulated joint, wherein said extension forms a securing portion, and wherein the securing portion forms a preferably approximately rectangular securing face, which is arranged in an assembly position approximately parallel to a surface of a second component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, an edge of the securing face facing in the direction of the articulated joint can form a securing edge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a final assembly position, it is provided that the securing portion abuts against an underside of a vehicle floor or a rug or a carrier component of a motor vehicle. In this way, the frictional forces between the fastening apparatus and the vehicle floor are increased so as to prevent the fastening apparatus from slipping in addition to the retaining forces of the retaining arms.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The securing edge reinforces this effect once more, as a sharp edge of the securing face slightly penetrates into a vehicle floor, which also prevents the fastening apparatus from slipping.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The assembly body can comprise means, in particular an edge or a catching edge, for connecting to a correspondingly configured means of a first component.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the assembly body can be approximately conical in shape, wherein the assembly body is configured to flare conically, in particular in an assembly direction. An edge of the assembly body that is radially circumferential in the assembly direction can form a catching edge, so that a first component with a corresponding fastening device can be connected to a vehicle floor via the fastening apparatus. The first component can be, for example, a floor mat or an interior rug of a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the fastening apparatus according to the invention, the components can be arranged in the assembly direction as follows: first the base element, then the retaining arms, and the assembly element in front in the assembly direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The catching device can have catching arms that extend approximately in the assembly direction and are integrally formed on the fastening wall of the base element, wherein correspondingly configured counter-catching means, in particular catching recesses, are arranged on the assembly element. The fastening apparatus can be safely and reliably fixed in a final assembly position via the catching arms.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The catching arms can be arranged in the region between the retaining arms and the through-opening. In this case, at least two diametrically-opposed catching arms or three or four or five catching arms, arranged radially circumferentially and equally spaced apart from one another, can be provided.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, only two retaining arms can be provided. Such a configuration is advantageous in that a deformation process is simplified in the manufacture of the fastening apparatus by means of an injection molding method and can thereby be carried out more cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In such a configuration of the fastening apparatus with two retaining arms, the catching arms can be arranged offset by 90&#xb0; from the retaining arms in a top and bottom plan view. Such an arrangement also simplifies the deformation process in the manufacture of the fastening apparatus by means of an injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, a stop edge or a stop face can be formed on the fastening element, against which the fastening wall can abut with a counter-stop edge or a counter-stop face in the final assembly position when the fastening apparatus is subjected to a force or a tensile force acting counter to the assembly direction or also a compressive force acting in the assembly direction or a tilting torque, in order to receive the forces in question.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By providing a corresponding stop edge, the retaining forces of the fastening apparatus according to the invention are significantly increased, because the assembly element then abuts against the base element in the case of a tensile force acting counter to the assembly direction and cannot be pulled through the corresponding through-opening, which would also lead to a slight deformation of the fastening apparatus. In addition, the retaining arms are protected against damage, as the forces occurring during loading can be dissipated via the retaining arms in the axial or assembly direction.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This means that when the base element abuts against the counter-stop edge or face of the assembly element with the stop edge or face of the fastening wall in the final assembly position and is loaded in tension, e.g., by unbuttoning a floor mat, so that a tensile load acts on the assembly body, the force is dissipated or transferred via the stop edge and the counter-stop edge and not directly to the joints, in particular the film hinges. In this way, multiple loads can be applied via the assembly body in the pulling direction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The assembly element can comprise a base body that is approximately rectangular. The retaining arms can be connected to the bottom wall of the base body as well as to the fastening wall in an articulated manner, preferably via hinges, in particular film hinges.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, the retaining arms can have approximately central articulated joints, which are preferably also configured as film hinges.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A region of the retaining arms between the articulated joints and the fastening wall can form a respective fastening portion for retaining a vehicle rug.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A region of the retaining arms between the articulated joints and the bottom wall can respectively form an arm portion.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the region of the retaining arms, abutting portions can be integrally formed on the base body or on the bottom wall of the base body. These can preferably extend in the horizontal direction or radially outward.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, abutting ribs can be integrally formed on the faces of the arm portions facing the direction of the fastening portions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The abutting portions and/or the abutting ribs are provided in order to abut the retaining arms in the final assembly position and to receive forces acting on the fastening apparatus (tensile and compressive forces and tilting torque acting on the fastening apparatus) and preferably to dissipate them in the axial direction via the retaining arms. In operation, such forces can be induced by a floor mat connected to a fastening apparatus according to the invention and coupled to the fastening apparatus.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Accordingly, the abutting portions and/or the abutting ribs act analogously to the stop edge and the counter-stop edge.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, according to the present invention, a method for connecting a fastening apparatus described above to a second component, in particular to a vehicle floor or a rug of a motor vehicle, is provided. This method comprises the following steps:inserting an assembly element into a through-opening of a second component in an assembly direction until a first fastening wall of the base element abuts against a surface of the component, wherein, upon insertion in the assembly direction, the second component is clamped by retaining arms in a region between the fastening wall and the fastening portions, and connecting the assembly element to the base element by means of a catching device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is thus provided that the fastening apparatus is inserted from above or in the assembly direction through an opening into a vehicle floor or a rug of a vehicle. By subjecting the fastening apparatus to a linear compressive force acting in the assembly direction, the assembly element opposite the base element is spread along a cover (carrier component) located behind the vehicle floor or rug. The flaring or folding of the retaining arms results in a lower or rear component abutment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Upon insertion into an opening of a vehicle floor or rug or a trim part located behind it, the foldable retaining arms move along the through-opening in a second component and follow the geometry of the corresponding through-opening. The base element and the assembly element are connected to one another via the catching means.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The number of retaining arms depends on the retaining forces required. As more retaining arms are provided, accordingly higher retaining forces can be achieved with the fastening apparatus according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a final assembly position in which the fastening apparatus is fixedly connected to a second component, the retaining arms lie with their fastening portions in the assembly direction behind the second component.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to a further aspect of the present invention, a fastening apparatus is provided for fastening a first component to a second component, in particular for fastening a floor mat to a vehicle floor. It comprises a fastening apparatus described above and a fastening device having a second component, comprising a circular disk-shaped cover wall with a visual side and an assembly side, wherein connecting means configured correspondingly to the assembly body of the fastening device are provided in the region of a through-opening.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this way, a simple fastening system is provided, which comprises only two components, namely the fastening apparatus and the fastening device, each formed from a single piece.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fastening device can comprise two diametrically-opposed, foldable second retaining arms, wherein second fastening portions of the second retaining arms extend radially outward and are connected to the assembly side via a respective joint, wherein the second fastening portions are connected to catching portions and second catching devices via an articulated joint in order to connect the retaining arms to the assembly side in an assembly position, such that a first component is retained between the fastening portions and the assembly side, such that the fastening device is connected to the first component.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The fastening apparatus can also comprise three or four or five or more foldable second retaining arms, which are arranged radially circumferentially and preferably equally spaced apart from one another.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, according to a further aspect of the present invention, a method for fastening a first component to a second component, in particular for fastening a floor mat to a vehicle floor having a protruding fastening system, is provided. It includes the following steps: A method discussed above for connecting the fastening apparatus to a second element, and inserting a fastening means into a second through-opening of a first component in an assembly direction until a first assembly side of a cover wall abuts against a surface of the first component, wherein, upon insertion in an assembly direction, the first component is clamped by retaining arms in a region between the assembly side and the second assembly portions, and connecting the fastening device to an assembly element of the fastening apparatus via connecting means.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With corresponding fastening apparatuses and fastening devices, as well as the method briefly summarized above for fastening a first component to a second component, floor mats can be easily, safely, and reliably connected to a vehicle floor, in particular a vehicle rug and/or a structure of a motor vehicle located behind it.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention will be described in further detail below on the basis of the exemplary embodiments shown in the figures.
