Distributed amplifiers are conventionally proposed since these amplifiers are technically feasible to widen the bandwidth thereof (see Non-Patent Literature 1). In the distributed amplifiers, the parasitic capacitances of transistors are incorporated into input/output transmission lines, to achieve impedance matching. Further, in the distributed amplifiers, matching phase velocities between the input transmission line and the output transmission line can realize broadband signal amplification.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The impedances of ordinary high-frequency radio frequency (RF) circuits or devices are often designed to be 50&#x3a9;. When the connection with these circuits or devices is taken into consideration, it is necessary to make input/output impedances of the amplifier match with 50&#x3a9;. Impedance Zo of a lossless transmission line can be represented by Zo=&#x3c;(L/C) in which L represents the inductance and C represents the capacitance component, per unit length of this transmission line. In the distributed amplifier, in a state where parasitic capacitance Cpara of the transistor is added to capacitance component C of the transmission line, the impedance (&#x221a;L/(C+Cpara)) is designed to be 50&#x3a9;. The transmission line including the parasitic capacitance of the transistor is hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;artificial transmission line&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, phase velocity v of the transmission line is represented by v=1/&#x221a;(LC). In the distributed amplifier, broadband amplification can be realized by designing the phase velocities of the input/output artificial transmission lines to be the same, in a state where the impedance of each of the input/output artificial transmission lines is matched with 50&#x3a9;.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, actually manufactured artificial transmission lines are affected by manufacturing errors and therefore the input/output impedances and the phase velocities often deviate from designed values. The deviations in impedance and phase velocity from the designed values lead to deterioration of the distributed amplifier in reflection characteristics or band deterioration. Therefore, a circuit that adjusts the impedance and the phase velocity after manufacturing is required.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, as a phase velocity adjusting circuit, a circuit in which variable capacitors are added to the transmission line so as to adjust the capacitance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, is proposed (see Non-Patent Literature 2).

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are inductors and C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are capacitors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the distributed amplifier illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, since only the capacitance is adjusted by the variable capacitors Ctune<b>1</b> and the variable capacitors Ctune<b>2</b>, there is a problem that the phase velocity and the impedance cannot be adjusted independently.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, if the capacitances of the variable capacitors Ctune<b>1</b> and Ctune<b>2</b> are increased to slow down the phase velocity, the impedances of the transmission lines CPW<b>10</b><i>a </i>and CPW<b>20</b><i>a </i>decrease and deviate from 50&#x3a9;. As a result, the reflection characteristics of the distributed amplifier will deteriorate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in the conventional technique, it was difficult to realize a distributed amplifier that can adjust the input/output impedances and the phase velocities, after manufacturing, without deteriorating both of the reflection characteristics and band characteristics.

As described in the first embodiment, the transmission line of the present invention is provided with an inductance adjustment function. Several circuits capable of changing the inductance have been proposed in the past (Literature &#x201c;Ehsan Adabi, and Ali M. Niknejad, &#x201c;Broadband variable passive delay elements based on an inductance multiplication technique&#x201d;, 2008 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium, IEEE, 2008&#x201d;). However, combining the proposed circuits with distributed amplifiers was difficult.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, as a variable inductor circuit, a configuration for switching a plurality of inductors has been proposed. However, this configuration requires insertion of switch in series with the signal. The switch is usually configured by a transistor, but a parasitic resistance and a parasitic capacitance of the transistor cause gain reduction and band deterioration. Therefore, the variable inductor circuit configured to switch a plurality of inductors by a switch cannot be used for broadband amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, as a variable inductor circuit, a configuration using mutual inductance has been proposed. However, in the above-described configuration, it is necessary to distribute input signal and generate mutual induction between two distributed signal lines. Therefore, the electric power to be input to the amplifier decreases due to power distribution and the gain decreases. In addition, a broadband matching circuit is required for a power distributor. Thus, the variable inductor circuit configured to use mutual inductance cannot be used for broadband amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, a configuration in which a variable resistor is inserted between a ground plate configuring the transmission line and the ground and the variable resistor value is adjusted to make the inductance of the transmission line variable.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective diagram illustrating a configuration of the transmission line CPW<b>1</b> of the present embodiment.
