Since the installation space in large-caliber weapon systems is limited, due to the lowest possible mass of the weapons, the penetrators extend ever farther into the elongated chamber of the weapons. One approach to resolving this situation is the use of shorter propellant igniters, which, however, lead to the increased formation of gas pressure waves, due to the strongly ground-burdening ignition of the propellant charge. The greater the expansion of the propellant charge in the longitudinal direction, the greater are the problems relating to the gas pressure waves. These gas pressure waves may result in leaks between the weapon and the cartridge casing base during firing&#x2014;i.e., to the escape of hot combustion gases into the combat compartment of the tank&#x2014;even leading to the destruction of the weapon system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To counteract these gas pressure waves, an ignition tube running in the middle of the propellant charge was provided in the past, which is connected directly to the propellant igniter and is formed as a structural unit therewith. Ignition tubes of this type extend, for example up to one third of the total length of the propellant charge, and are known, for example, from DE 199 44 377 B4 or from EP 0 822 385 A1, which corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,881, and which are all herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the provision of an ignition tube in the conventional art, which is arranged centrally with respect to the center line of the propellant charge and is connected to the propellant igniter, the installation space for longer penetrators has, however, also been limited, so that the latter could not be further elongated. Although the aforementioned approaches have proven to be successful in practice, improvements are nevertheless desirable with respect to the ability to provide longer penetrators.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Dispensing with ignition tubes of this type has, however, not produced the desired result, since the problem with gas pressure waves still remains.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an igniter system for a large-caliber piece of ammunition, which makes it possible to enlarge the installation space for a penetrator with reduced gas pressure waves.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the invention, an igniter system for a piece of ammunition, is provided, which comprises at least one propellant igniter and at least one igniter element designed to transmit ignition power and extending away from the propellant igniter. The igniter element is arranged at a distance from the propellant igniter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention, an igniter system for a piece of ammunition is provided. The igniter system comprises at least one propellant igniter, at least one propellant charge and at least one igniter element designed to transmit ignition power to the propellant charge and extending away from the propellant igniter in the propellant charge. The at least one igniter element is arranged at a distance from the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A piece of ammunition can furthermore be provided, which comprises a projectile and an igniter system of this type or refined as described below.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The igniter system may comprise at least one propellant charge, and the igniter element may be designed to transmit ignition power to the propellant charge. The igniter element preferably extends away from the propellant igniter in the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The principle of the invention is based on a short propellant igniter, which takes on the primary ignition or initiation of the propellant charge. In addition to the propellant igniter, at least one igniter element is provided according to the invention, which, due to its structural design (geometric built-in components) and/or due to its constitution (pyrotechnical measures), ignites the propellant charge as uniformly as possible over the entire length of the propellant charge in order to avoid the formation of a gas pressure wave.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By designing the at least one igniter element as a geometric built-in component, the goal is primarily to provide clearances and channels, which make it possible for the flame and the particles of the propellant igniter to reach the front part of the propellant charge from the propellant igniter (at the rear), in order to also ignite the propellant powder in this location. For this purpose, round, oval and/or rectangular channels (tubes), for example, are introduced into the propellant charge for the purpose of ensuring a flame, particle and/or gas transport, with as little turbulence as possible. In the case of fine-grained propellant powders (pourable powders), a through-flow of the propellant powder without pressure waves would not be possible within the necessary firing times, since the propellant powder grains would cause a highly turbulent flow and thereby interfere with the timely ignition in the front part of the propellant charge. These disadvantages are overcome by the igniter system according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The at least one igniter element is preferably formed from combustible materials, such as cardboard or cardboard including nitrocellulose and binder. The at least one igniter element may contain pyrotechnic compositions in bound form (e.g., varnish or adhesive), pressed into molded bodies, pyrotechnic compositions in loose bulk form or textile form (pouches), prefabricated pyrotechnic mixtures or propellant powder.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">If the flame, hot particles and/or gases generated by the propellant igniter or possibly additionally by the ignition boost charge are merely transmitted, the at least one igniter element may be formed without ignition-boosting substances. In this case, transporting the flame, the at least partially burning particles and/or the hot gases by the at least one igniter element into the regions of the propellant charge at a distance from the propellant igniter is sufficient to ignite the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one igniter element may be arranged at a radial distance with respect to the center line of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The center line is a shared center line of the propellant charge, the propellant igniter, the rotationally symmetrical cartridge casing or cartridge rim, the rotationally symmetrical cartridge casing or cartridge rim and the projectile, as well as the penetrator of the projectile.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The at least one igniter element may be placed at an axially distance from the propellant igniter with respect to a center line of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The at least one igniter element may be designed as a channel, tube and/or as a cylindrical element.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By transferring the flame, gas and/or particles via the at least one igniter element, the ignition of the propellant charge may be sufficient to safely ignite the cartridge within the required time period with few pressure waves.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It may furthermore be provided that the at least one igniter element extends in the direction of a propellant charge front, preferably at least up to the longitudinal direction center of the propellant charge, in particular up to the front of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The front of the propellant charge within the meaning of the invention is a region of the frontmost 10% of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one ignition boost charge may be formed separately from the propellant igniter and the at least one igniter element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the propellant igniter has too little igniter mass, the ignition boost charge ensures that the ignition power reaches the at least one igniter element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">One or multiple additional ignition boost charges may be used or combined.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The position of the ignition boost charge (igniter or propellant powder in each case) may be situated in the region of the propellant igniter, in ignition transmission channels and/or in the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the purpose of ignition transmission, rapidly initiatable ignition compositions may be also introduced onto or into the ignition boost charges.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It may also be provided that the igniter element is arranged at a radial distance from the propellant igniter.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It may furthermore be provided that the at least one igniter element is designed to transfer the flame, hot gases and/or particles generated by the propellant igniter and/or by the at least one ignition boost charge. This is done without the formation of an undesirable gas pressure wave.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It may furthermore be provided that the at least one igniter element is designed to generate a flame, hot gases and/or particles.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A better ignition may be achieved if a pyrotechnical flame transfer or transmission takes place in the chamber in addition to the geometric flame transfer by igniter elements, for example in the form of tubes and/or channels, whereby burning particle and/or gases are additionally generated, which may contribute to the transmission of the ignition power&#x2014;in the front regions as well as the rear regions of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The at least one igniter element can have a flashover speed or burn-through speed which is higher compared to the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This achieves the fact that the propellant charge is ignited more uniformly.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The igniter elements with active transmission of the ignition power due to pyrotechnic measures should have a higher or at least the same burn-through/flashover speed, compared to the flashover of the propellant powder bed without assistance (geometric built-in components). Ignition mixtures should preferably be used, which react while forming hot particles.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The igniter element can be designed in such a way that the propellant charge is uniformly ignitable over the length of the propellant charge, preferably the entire length of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This achieves the fact that the propellant charge is ignited as simultaneously and completely as possible. This also prevents a gas pressure wave from forming during the ignition of the propellant charge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It may furthermore be provided that the at least one ignition boost charge and/or the at least one igniter element is/are designed in the form of an additional black powder, boron-potassium charge and/or igniter charge, in particular in pouch form or encapsulated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">These substances have proven to be particularly resistant to heat and mechanical stress when implementing a particularly fast ignition/flashover. In addition, these substances may form desired sparks with our without metallic additives.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, the igniter element may have an elongated hollow space. This is one possible embodiment of the igniter element, by means of which it is achieved that the generated flame, the hot gases and/or the particles are transferred.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The piece of ammunition can be a large-caliber piece of ammunition, in particular in a large caliber such as 105 mm, 120 mm, 130 mm, 140 mm or 150 mm. It may also be a piece of ammunition of a different caliber.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The piece of ammunition may preferably be a cartridged piece of ammunition.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The projectile can include a penetrator having a tail unit, the at least one igniter element being arranged in the propellant charge such that it runs through a region between the two adjacent tail unit wings of the tail unit.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each igniter element can run through a separate region between each of two adjacent tail unit wings.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This achieves the fact that the particular igniter element is arranged in an installation space between two tail unit wings, the igniter element being fastened to the tail unit for mounting the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.
