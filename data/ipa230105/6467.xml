Batteries are frequently used as power sources but they always bring along the need of recharging or replacement. In more and more applications recharging or replacement of batteries is economically and logistically impractical, laborious, or potentially dangerous.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, batteries are used as power supply in pacemakers. If the life time of the battery is over, it must either be recharged or even be replaced by a new one. Conventional recharging systems use for example magnetic induction (U.S. Pat. No. 3,867,950 A1) or solar cells (US 2009326597 AA). These systems suffer from the fact that additional technical devices outside the patient's body must be used to charge the pacemaker, which still makes it necessary to check the pacemaker's performance status and perform a battery charging procedure either by a technician or by the patient if necessary. A procedure which is usually unfavorable for the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another aspect is the so called Internet of Things (IoT) which is of growing interest. IoT describes a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers enabling the transfer of data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Naturally those unique identifiers need wireless power supply and it is highly desirable if no recharging by an external power source (e.g. power outlet) or even replacement of the power supply is necessary.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would be of high economic interest to provide a power supply for such applications which need not to be recharged by an external power source like a power outlet or be replaced. This would make such applications independent of external power sources. Furthermore, in cases where battery recharging or replacement is inconvenient or even potentially dangerous for a user, as in the case of pacemakers, a major step towards greater security could be taken.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is the purpose of the invention to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages of the state of the art and to provide a device which can be used as a power source and which must not be recharged by an external power source or be replaced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the invention provides a device and a method to collect small charges from electrical energy sources e.g. from the surrounding environment in the amount that a power supply can be provided for portable electronics, wherein the small voltage levels of the source themselves are too low to be used as power supply for any kind of portable electronics. The invention targets electrical energy sources like bioelectric signals, radio signals, thermal sources or vibrations, which means the electrical energy voltage levels are in the range of a few millivolt.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a device for charge collection comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">at least one capacitor stack built by n capacitors and 2n switches;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">at least one further capacitor outside the at least one capacitor stack as buffer capacitor;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">at least two additional switches outside the at least one capacitor stack;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">a DC input source;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">a CMOS-Logic;<br/>wherein the 2n switches of the at least one capacitor stack couple the n capacitors selectively to the DC input source;<br/>wherein the n capacitors of the at least one capacitor stack are dedicated to be sequentially charged by the DC input source one after the other;<br/>wherein the at least one further capacitor outside the at least one capacitor stack is dedicated to be charged from the n capacitors of the capacitor stack at once; and<br/>wherein n&#x2208;N.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for charge collection, comprising at least one capacitor stack build by n capacitors and 2n switches, at least one further capacitor outside the capacitor stack as buffer capacitor, at least two additional switches and a DC input source, comprising the steps<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0015">the n capacitors of the capacitor stack are sequentially charged by coupling one capacitor after the other to the DC input source by selectively closing the switches;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0016">discharging the n capacitors of the capacitor stack into the at least one further capacitor outside the capacitor stack;<br/>wherein n&#x2208;N.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">Additionally, the usage of the device according the invention or the method according to the invention to collect charges from sources with electrical potentials of a few millivolts is disclosed.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0018">The device according to the invention comprises at least one DC input source.

The regularity is visible and also the capability to extend the capacitor stack to n capacitors. The capacitor stack generates positive as well as negative voltage, depending whether the top plate or the bottom plate is grounded.

Also, when using bulk-technology, all p-substrates (of the NMOS-transistors) have to be tied to the most negative voltage in the circuits as otherwise Source/Bulk or Drain/Bulk diode action may disturb the functionality. For SOI- and FDSOI-Technologies this constraints does not exist due to the absence of the bulk-diode.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0098">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (B) both positive and negative voltages are being used. Here the gates of the NMOS-transistors are switched with voltages between 0 and positive supply and the PMOS-transistors are switched between 0 and the negative supply. With this, the non-selected path to the capacitor stack is always open in the sense of not connected. The selected path puts positive supply to NLn and NMn, while PLn and PMn receive the negative supply voltage.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0099">Discharge occurs from the top- and bottom-plates of the capacitor stack where the sum of the individual capacitor-voltages can be found.

The inner resistance of the voltage source is 100 kOhm. Every capacitor of the capacitor stack has a capacitance of 100 pF and is charged to 90%. The cycle time for charging one capacitor is 25 &#x3bc;s. The stack of 9 capacitors requires in general a cycle time of 250 &#x3bc;s (9 charging cycles+1 discharge cycle of 25 &#x3bc;s). The input of 10 mV generates an output of 81 mV. This is one setting applied for harvesting of bioelectric energy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0103">A device according to the invention comprising two capacitor stacks is connected to an input voltage source of 10 mV. Each capacitor stack comprises 10 capacitors with a capacitance of 100 pF. According to the invention the capacitors of the capacitor stacks are charged one after the other to 100%, which is maximum efficiency. Therefore every capacitor of the first stack is charged to 10 mV. After all capacitors of the first capacitor stack are charged, all capacitors of the first capacitor stack are discharged into the top capacitor of the second capacitor stack. Accordingly, the top capacitor of the second capacitor stack is charged to 100 mV. Next, the capacitors of the first capacitor stack are charged again one after the other each to 10 mV. Subsequently, all capacitors of the first capacitor stack are discharged into a further capacitor of the second capacitor stack, whereby the further capacitor of the second capacitor stack is a neighboring capacitor of the capacitor of the second capacitor stack which was charged before. This scheme is repeated until all capacitors of the second capacitor stack are charged. Afterwards, all capacitors of the second capacitor stack are discharged into a buffer capacitor outside the capacitor stack. By this method a maximum output of 1V is realized. This example shows an embodiment, where cascading of the charge collection generates significant higher voltages than the initial input source provides as voltage.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0104">The same device as described in example 2 is used with a charging efficiency of 50% of each capacitor in the first and second capacitor stack.
