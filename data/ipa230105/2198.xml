The pallet <b>16</b> of material might be concrete masonry blocks, bags of concrete mix or any type of material that would commonly be found on an industrial construction site. Additionally, the cage <b>12</b> has a plurality of bar openings <b>18</b> each extending through the cage <b>12</b>. The cage <b>12</b> has a plurality of outer walls <b>20</b> that each extends between the bottom end <b>14</b> and a top end <b>22</b> of the cage <b>12</b>, and the outer walls <b>20</b> intersect each other such that the cage <b>12</b> has a rectangular shape. The top end <b>22</b> is open to accommodate the height of the pallet <b>16</b> of material.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cage <b>12</b> has a plurality of lift points <b>24</b> and each of the lift points <b>24</b> extends upwardly from the top end <b>22</b> of the cage <b>12</b>. Each of the lift points <b>24</b> is positioned at an intersection between a respective pair of the outer walls <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b>. Additionally, each of the lift points <b>24</b> has a hole <b>26</b> extending through the lift point <b>24</b> to have a lifting line <b>28</b> extended through each hole <b>26</b> for lifting the cage <b>12</b>. The lifting line <b>28</b> may be a four point sling that is attached to a crane line, a hoist line or other type of lifting machinery.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the bar openings <b>18</b> extends through a respective one of the outer walls <b>20</b>. Additionally, each of the bar openings <b>18</b> is bounded by a bottom threshold <b>30</b> of the respective outer wall. A plurality of bars <b>32</b> is provided and each of the bars <b>32</b> is slidable through a respective pair of the bar openings <b>18</b>. In this way each of the bars <b>32</b> can be extended through the pallet <b>16</b> when the cage <b>12</b> is lowered over the pallet <b>16</b>. Moreover, each of the bars <b>32</b> rests on the bottom threshold <b>30</b> of respective outer walls <b>20</b> when the cage <b>12</b> is lifted. In this way each of the bars <b>32</b> transfers the weight of the pallet <b>16</b> onto the cage <b>12</b> thereby facilitating the cage <b>12</b> to lift the pallet <b>16</b> when the cage <b>12</b> is lifted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cage <b>12</b> might include a plurality of intersecting members <b>34</b> that form a frame of the cage <b>12</b>. The plurality of intersecting members <b>34</b> might include a series of members <b>36</b> that are horizontally oriented and vertically spaced apart from each other to define the bar openings <b>18</b>. Thus, each of the bars <b>32</b> might rest on a lowermost one 38 of the series of members <b>36</b> that are spaced apart from each other. Additionally, each of the outer walls <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b> might comprise a steel mesh or other similar type of rigid, resilient material. The intersecting members <b>34</b> might be comprised of steel such that the cage <b>12</b> has a weight capacity of several thousand pounds.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A plurality of sleeves <b>40</b> is provided and each of the sleeves <b>40</b> is coupled to the cage <b>12</b>. The sleeves <b>40</b> are strategically arranged on the cage <b>12</b> thereby facilitating each of the bars <b>32</b> to be slidably stored in the plurality of sleeves <b>40</b>. Each of the sleeves <b>40</b> has an outside wall <b>42</b> and the outside wall <b>42</b> of each of the sleeves <b>40</b> is coupled to a respective outer wall <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b>. The plurality of sleeves <b>40</b> includes a plurality of pairs of the sleeves <b>44</b>, and each of the pairs of sleeves <b>44</b> is aligned with each other on the outer wall <b>20</b> such that each of the pairs of sleeves <b>44</b> is facilitated to slidably receive a respective one of the bars <b>32</b> for storage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the pairs of sleeves <b>44</b> includes a closed sleeve <b>46</b>, and the closed sleeve <b>46</b> has a lower end <b>48</b> which is closed. In this way the lower end <b>48</b> of the closed sleeve <b>46</b> inhibits the bar <b>32</b> from falling through the closed sleeve <b>46</b>. The closed sleeve <b>46</b> of each of the pairs of sleeves <b>44</b> is positioned adjacent to the bar opening <b>18</b> in the respective outer wall <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b>. Each of the pairs of sleeves <b>44</b> is arranged such that the bars <b>32</b> are oriented at a diagonal line on the respective outer wall <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b> when the bars <b>32</b> are stored in the sleeves <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A plurality of handles <b>50</b> is each coupled to a respective outer wall <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b> such that each of the handles <b>50</b> can be gripped. Each of the handles <b>50</b> is positioned on opposite sides of the cage <b>12</b> with respect to each other. In this way the plurality of handles <b>50</b> facilitate a worker to guide the cage <b>12</b> around the pallet <b>16</b> when the cage <b>12</b> is being lowered around the pallet <b>16</b>. A box <b>52</b> is coupled to a respective outer wall <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b> to store objects and the box <b>52</b> has a top side <b>54</b> that is open. As is most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the box <b>52</b> may have a plurality of compartments <b>56</b> integrated into the box <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, each of the lifting lines <b>28</b> is coupled to the respective lift point <b>24</b> and the cage <b>12</b> is lowered around the pallet <b>16</b> of material. As is most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a spacing pallet <b>58</b> is positioned beneath the pallet <b>16</b> of material. In this way the pallet <b>16</b> of material is aligned with the bar openings <b>18</b>. Each of the bars <b>32</b> is slid through the bar openings <b>18</b> in opposing outer walls <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b>. In this way the bars <b>32</b> pass through the pallet <b>16</b> and rest against the bottom threshold <b>30</b> of the opposing outer walls <b>20</b>. Thus, the bars <b>32</b> transfer the weight of the pallet <b>16</b> into the bottom threshold <b>30</b> of the opposing outer walls <b>20</b> when the cage <b>12</b> is lifted. In this way a single pallet, or a stack of pallets, can be safely lifted with a crane or hoist. Additionally, the outer walls <b>20</b> of the cage <b>12</b> ensure that no material can fall out of the pallet(s) <b>16</b> while the pallet(s) <b>16</b> is/are being lifted. The bars <b>32</b> are removed from the bar opening <b>18</b> in the opposing outer walls <b>20</b> when the pallet <b>16</b>(<i>s</i>) is lowered to its drop off point, the bars <b>32</b> are stored in the sleeves <b>40</b> and the cage <b>12</b> is lifted away from the pallet(s) <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
